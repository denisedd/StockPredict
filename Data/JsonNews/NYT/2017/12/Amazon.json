{"Headline": "Shirley Childress Mastered How to Convey Music Without Sound", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.In the late 1970s, Sweet Honey\u2019s tours were booked by a politically minded coalition of women called Roadwork, who offered wheelchair accessibility, child care and sign-language interpreters at their concerts. But the network\u2019s interpreters, all of whom were white, were a bad fit for Sweet Honey. The Sweet Honey singer Ysaye Barnwell recalls that one interpreter at sound check signed \u201cAfrica\u201d by rotating her finger around her nose to indicate a nose ring. The group decided to look for its own interpreter; when they found Johnson, the chemistry was immediately apparent. Johnson grew up attending the silent ministry at Shiloh Baptist Church, singing spirituals in a flowing sign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a record player at home, so singing in sign at church was probably our first exposure to song,\u201d Khaula Murtadha, Johnson\u2019s sister, says.She intuitively understood how to translate Sweet Honey\u2019s music. \u201cShe had an amazing way of using her body and her hands to help people understand the rhythm of the music that we were doing,\u201d Barnwell says.Interpreters usually stand off to the side of the stage in a separate area. Johnson sat in a semicircle with the ensemble, moving in time with them. In concert footage that appeared in the 1983 documentary \u201cGotta Make This Journey: Sweet Honey in the Rock,\u201d Reagon strolls across the stage ebulliently bellowing \u201cDown by the Riverside\u201d and casually goes into a riff with Johnson, as Bruce Springsteen might have with Clarence Clemons. As Reagon approaches, Johnson turns partly away from the audience to face her; Reagon lunges down, and Johnson lowers herself to match.Johnson\u2019s role as a full member of Sweet Honey is still unmatched. As Barnwell would lay down a bass line that seemed to be drawn from the deepest well and Reagon\u2019s voice would go incandescent with praise, Johnson would remove the sound from the song, conveying its words and its feeling as it ran through her.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Anita Hill Fix Hollywood\u2019s Harassment Problem?", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerAs a powerhouse producer for Steven Spielberg and now president of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy has for decades tackled some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous monsters: gremlins, poltergeists, T. rexes and the dark side of the Force.Now Ms. Kennedy has set her sights on perhaps the most pernicious industry villain of all: sexual misconduct and abuse. She is spearheading the creation of an anti-harassment commission, backed by more than two dozen of the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest bigwigs, that, in a stroke of marquee casting, will be led by Anita Hill.The hard part will be figuring out what comes next. As Ms. Hill concedes herself, there\u2019s no blueprint for ridding an industry of sexual harassment. At least not yet.\u201cIf there was a template out there, at this point I think it would\u2018ve already been discovered,\u201d Ms. Hill said in a phone chat Monday with the Bagger and Ms. Kennedy.\u201cThere\u2019s something out there, pieces out there that need to come together,\u201d Ms. Hill continued. \u201cBut I think if a model was out there, we\u2019d know, because there\u2019s so much will and desire to end this problem.\u201dIt\u2019s too early to guess if the commission will work, but it already has a few Hollywood must-haves on its side. Backing it is a good look, and it has money.Speaking by phone on Monday, Ms. Kennedy said that despite her initial prescriptive suggestions, she didn\u2019t at the time have a clear idea of what the commission might look like or how it might come about.They were casting about for someone to head the commission when Ms. Kapor suggested Ms. Hill, \u201cand, thank goodness, Anita said yes,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.And indeed in many ways, given the left-leaning world of show business, Ms. Hill was an obvious choice. She is a lawyer and an academic, as well as a household name, which is important in Tinseltown, and has been a figurehead in the fight against sexual harassment since 1991, when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Despite Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony that he had assailed her with inappropriate sexual suggestions when they worked together years before, Justice Thomas was confirmed.Yet the sight of Ms. Hill sitting by herself as a bank of white men peppered her with condescending and withering questions became a flash point for many women, both a symbol of what they were up against and an inspiration to push back.\u201cThis has been a 26-year fight,\u201d said Ms. Hill, now a professor of social policy, law and women\u2019s studies at Brandeis University.Ms. Hill said both Washington and Hollywood were plagued by an imbalance and misuse of power. But where she saw a difference, she said, was in Hollywood\u2019s desire \u2014 at least as evidenced by the overt support for the new commission \u2014 to stamp out sexual harassment.\u201cWe have to celebrate that we are coming together for a purpose and that people are saying at this point, \u2018We cannot tolerate this behavior,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point from here. There will be lots of work to do.\u201dThe structure of the initiative \u2014 high-profile women backed by the industry\u2019s top brass, most of whom happened to be men \u2014 was deliberate, and borne out of earlier conversations Ms. Kennedy had with men in the business. They were eager for change, she found, but reluctant to lead the charge because they didn\u2019t feel like it was their place to. (Imagine!)\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one of them that didn\u2019t respond very proactively, but I think there\u2019s a hesitancy on the part of some men, and a thinking that this is something women need to step out in front of,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.Ms. Hill said this dovetailed with what she had been hearing as sexual harassment accusations unfolded.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of men who say, \u2018I\u2019m so embarrassed to be a man,\u2019 and, \u2018What do I tell my daughters?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey want to address this problem. But they\u2019re not sure they are credible to address it on their own. And I would say we now have women who are in leadership positions that can do it. I think that men wouldn\u2019t step out on their own, but will step out in partnership with women.\u201d\u201cWe are going to do this as quickly and effectively as possible,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure out what are the best practices and best policies, and how we think about implementation. All of those things are yet to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But hold up, Santa.Of course, we\u2019ve been trading off privacy for the wonder and convenience of technology for years. How comfortable we are with gradually ceding more data to the machines is probably inversely correlated with how many times we\u2019ve watched \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d And I\u2019ve watched it. A lot.Still, the kid wants it, and I\u2019ll probably fold, eventually. But I\u2019d like to know what I\u2019d be getting into. So let\u2019s start with the fine print.In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe\u2019ve built multiple layers of privacy protections into Echo including a mute button that electronically disconnects the microphones, clear visual indicators when voice recordings are being captured and streamed, as well as the ability for customers to see and delete voice recording history for their devices.\u201dIn its own statement, Google said that \u201call the devices that come with the Google Assistant built in are designed with privacy in mind.\u201d It added that \u201cGoogle only stores voice-based queries\u201dafter it is manually activated or recognizes \u201cthe hotwords \u2018O.K. Google\u2019 or \u2018Hey Google.\u2019\u201dI asked Joel Wallenstrom, the chief executive of Wickr, a messaging company focused on security, what he thought of the rise of digital assistants. He doesn\u2019t have one, though he pointed out that we already have this kind of technology \u201cby virtue of Siri.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of ways to have privacy and security, it just requires an awful lot of human oversight and management, and that typically doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. With a digital assistant, he added, \u201cyou\u2019d have to constantly be on your toes about updates and changes to their privacy policy.\u201dI already spend a lot of time interacting with talking computers. When I recently moved from London to New Jersey, my new American phone synced with my old British one, including Google Maps. I now spend weekends being bossed around by the voice of an unyielding British woman who seems incredibly confident about the back roads of suburban New Jersey. We get along great. But she\u2019s not recording my rants about traffic and sending them to the cloud.At least I can take comfort that I\u2019m not the only one who wonders about these things. In the past three years, the Better Business Bureau told me it had received 9,876 complaints about Amazon.com. Seventy-nine were related to the Echo speaker, which features Alexa, and just a single one of those complaints mentioned privacy concerns.The lone dissenter was identified by the bureau as \u201cDennis W\u201d in Massachusetts, who told them he bought an Echo because he thought it \u201cwould be good for an information source (news, weather, sports)\u201d but \u201cupon further research I found that this device is an unwanted privacy concern where Amazon collects and sells info.\u201dWhen he tried to return his Echo, Amazon tried to allay his fears. \u201cI do not believe them,\u201d he said.So there you go, I\u2019m not the only one worried.

{"Headline": "Google Thinks I\u2019m Dead", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by(I know otherwise.)I\u2019m not dead yet.But try telling that to Google.For much of the last week, I have been trying to persuade the world\u2019s most powerful search engine to remove my photo from biographical details that belong to someone else. A search for \u201cRachel Abrams\u201d revealed that Google had mashed my picture from The New York Times\u2019s website with the Wikipedia entry for a better-known writer with the same name, who died in 2013. My father pointed this out in a quizzical text message, but the error seemed like an inconsequential annoyance best ignored indefinitely. To anyone who knows me, it is clearly not me \u2014 I am not married, my mother\u2019s name is not Midge, and I was not born in 1951. But when an acquaintance said she was alarmed to read that I had passed away, it seemed like an error worth correcting. And so began the quest to convince someone at Google that I am alive. My picture, however, appeared inaccurately only in Google search results, so it seems reasonable to assume that a company with thousands of employees, whose parent company, Alphabet, has a market capitalization of about $740 billion, would be able to help. But like many technology companies, Google doesn\u2019t really put a lot of emphasis on human technical support, something anyone who has had a problem with Gmail already knows. There\u2019s no customer service hotline, and it\u2019s unclear which of the various \u201cfeedback\u201d options is appropriate. But even against that backdrop, correcting the impression about something as simple as whether a person is alive should be eminently fixable. Right?\u201cIn my experience, it is very difficult to submit correction requests to Google for situations that aren\u2019t clear violations of policies or laws,\u201d Mr. Matta said. \u201cMost individuals are overwhelmed with the difficulty of the problem, and don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201dSince the Google entry was using my official Times photo, I first contacted someone on Google\u2019s corporate communications team, identifying myself as a member of the media.Here\u2019s how that goes:This allows Googlers to get basic information, like a phone number or address, without visiting another website. The cards also feed answers to smart speakers like Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Google Home. If these speakers rely on the cards, it\u2019s conceivable that they would repeat their errors, so my cousin and I decide to ask his Alexa some questions. That biographical information belongs to the writer Rachel Abrams, the late wife of Elliott Abrams, who held prominent positions during the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Ms. Abrams, who came from a family of well-known conservative thinkers, published online on her blog, Bad Rachel, and her writing appeared in national publications.My cousin presses Alexa more specifically. \u201cWho is Rachel Abrams at The New York Times?\u201dAlexa makes a noise that sounds like a sigh, and powers off. A friend tries Google Home next. It does not bring up the Northern Mariana Islands. It also does not seem to know about any Rachel Abrams at The New York Times. But none of the four options feels applicable:\u201cYou own the topic\u2019s official website, YouTube channel, or Google+ page.\u201d (Doesn\u2019t seem right.)\u201cYou\u2019ve added the official website to Search Console.\u201d (???)I try to make one of the options work anyway, without any luck. At the bottom, the author of this help page, a cartoon doodle of a \u201csearch expert\u201d named Katie, asks whether her advice was helpful. \u201cNo,\u201d I click, prompting me to fill out another feedback box. Katie thanks me for my submission, although she doesn\u2019t pledge to do anything. I am moving closer to actual death by the minute, and running out of ideas. I decide to call the number listed for the Googleplex, the company\u2019s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The automated greeting informs me that the Googleplex does not provide support, but that there is plenty of help online. \u201cWe\u2019re busier than usual today,\u201d the recording insists when I stay on the phone, in what feels by now like a deliberate attempt to discourage me. \u201cIt could be at least a half-hour until one of our agents is freed up.\u201dOn the bright side, the recording says that if I don\u2019t enjoy the music, I can hit any key to browse Google\u2019s selection. The website says I should keep submitting feedback, over and over again from different IP addresses. If possible, I should also enlist the help of other people. I surmise that this will help push my query to the top of Google\u2019s to-do pile. Or it won\u2019t do anything. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 there\u2019s no way to know!Complaints about what appears in Google\u2019s search results aren\u2019t new. But as the company has grown into one of the largest technology forces on the planet, the strategy for fixing the inevitable misfires can\u2019t keep up with the thousands of complaints it receives every day. \u201cSome of those requests, we have to assume, are frivolous or invalid or misleading,\u201d according to Mr. Matta from ReputationDefender. \u201cGenerally, all you can do is write more content that is more accurate and have that content rise to the top of Google\u2019s search rankings.\u201dOne option, Mr. Matta explained, is to create an entirely new webpage about myself and hope that I eventually become more famous than the other Rachel Abrams, so that my Knowledge Graph card may one day shove hers out of the way. This strategy seems unfair to both of us. On Thursday afternoon, I decide to email the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai. What would Mr. Pichai tell people facing a similar problem? I also alert the Google spokeswoman that I am writing an article about this nearly weeklong effort and ask for comment \u2014 a requirement of journalistic fairness, but a step that may also push Google to fix the problem more quickly, an advantage that most users won\u2019t have. It\u2019s \u201cimportant to balance the need to make changes quickly with wanting to ensure the change is accurate,\u201d she writes.Mr. Pichai doesn\u2019t respond. But hours later, my photo has been removed. I am alive again. Advertisement"}

The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse.

Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

In an emailed statement Saturday night, Milstein Properties said it built 30 Lincoln Plaza in 1978.\u201cWe are long-term members of this community and have played a central role in nurturing this special theater,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cvital structural work\u201d was needed to repair and waterproof the plaza around the building.\u201cAt the completion of this work, we expect to reopen the space as a cinema that will maintain its cultural legacy far into the future,\u201d the statement said.A Milstein spokesman said in an email that it was yet to be determined if the cinema would reopen with the Talbots in charge.Stepping off the escalator into the theater, which is below an apartment building, feels like entering a bygone era. A statue of Humphrey Bogart stands in a corner. French movie posters adorn the lavender walls. The concessions stand sells muffins and carrot cake.As moviegoers filed into the theater on Saturday morning, they mourned a New York institution.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat brokenhearted,\u201d Paul Johnson, 68, said.Allan Sigall, 68, of Brooklyn said he often checks the newspaper to see what is playing at Lincoln Plaza. He pulled out a copy of the Saturday New York Times and pointed to the theater\u2019s advertisement.\u201cI have eclectic taste,\u201d Mr. Sigall said. \u201cMost movies aren\u2019t made for people my age.\u201d\u201cYou work here long enough and you see how things are going,\u201d said Mr. Tabarez, 28, who started at the theater 10 years ago. \u201cYounger folks are not really into it.

{"Headline": "Fox-Disney Deal Gives Rupert Murdoch His King Lear Moment", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible.But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley.Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief.The $52.4 billion deal \u2014 which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company \u2014 has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy.After all, Mr. Murdoch didn\u2019t grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. \u201cRupert has always been a collector, a builder,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.In 2012, under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch split his entertainment assets into a separate publicly traded company, 21st Century Fox, from News Corporation, the company that includes The Journal, the New York Post and other newspapers. For a time Mr. Murdoch\u2019s enterprise looked like an entertainment company with a newspaper problem, with glitzy Hollywood assets and lucrative Fox News keeping Mr. Murdoch\u2019s true love, printed papers, afloat.But 21st Century Fox soon faced the same economic headwinds affecting other traditional media companies that have been disrupted by the rise of digital: customers cut the cable cord and streamed TV shows and movies on multiple devices. At the same time, Fox News, the highly rated basic cable channel and a big moneymaker, has suffered setbacks after a series of sexual harassment allegations at the network led to high-level departures and costly legal settlements.Mr. Murdoch must have known he needed to get even bigger to survive. But lately his buying prowess has taken a hit. In 2014, investors rebuffed him when he tried to gain scale with an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc., the company that owns HBO and CNN \u2014 and which may end up the property of AT&T, if a deal long in the making survives the scrutiny of a skeptical Justice Department. Regulatory hassles have also thwarted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s efforts to pay $15 billion for the 61 percent stake in Sky not already owned by 21st Century Fox.\u201cHe tried to buy, and when that didn\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t sulk \u2014 he sells,\u201d Ms. Martin said.Disney\u2019s planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox \u2014 Mr. Murdoch\u2019s confidants call it a merger \u2014 makes economic sense, analysts say, and may be the best way for Mr. Murdoch\u2019s broader empire to thrive. But it also makes the identity of his heir less apparent.Lachlan Murdoch, the elder brother at 46, has been caricatured as the prodigal son. He left the family business in 2005 and was happily living out of the fray in Australia, with a supermodel wife and a trust fund. But as part of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s succession plan, Lachlan returned to the United States in 2015 to serve with his younger brother \u2014 and alongside his father, as co-executive chairman \u2014 at 21st Century Fox. Seen by some insiders as a daddy\u2019s boy, he moved into his father\u2019s former office on the company\u2019s palm-tree-lined lot in Beverly Hills.Questions abound about which son would carry on the family legacy, should the Disney deal go through. (Mr. Murdoch\u2019s older daughters, Prudence and Elisabeth, have stayed mostly out of the business, and his younger daughters, Grace and Chloe, are teenagers.)\u201cYou have this issue with two sons who are seemingly capable of commercial success and, if you\u2019re Rupert, you want to leave them both in a good spot, for lack of a better spot,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.In one possible outcome, James Murdoch would take on an executive position at Disney, and Lachlan Murdoch, who shares his father\u2019s passion for news, would move to News Corporation or oversee the company that absorbs Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.\u201cThe Disney deal gives Lachlan a clear run to manage the remnants,\u201d said Neil Chenoweth, an Australian financial journalist and author of \u201cRupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World\u2019s Greatest Media Wizard.\u201dA company insider who could only discuss ongoing deal negotiations anonymously said it was too early to know what roles the Murdoch sons would take on, and added that James Murdoch could decide to strike out on his own.The Disney deal would leave him without a seat at the Dolby Theater for the Academy Awards \u2014 a string of Fox Searchlight Pictures films including \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cBirdman\u201d have won best picture Oscars \u2014 but Mr. Murdoch would maintain his seat at the White House. In August, the family patriarch had a private dinner with President Trump; Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser; and the White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.Mr. Murdoch talks regularly with Mr. Kushner, who knows a thing or two about tiptoeing around powerful family business dynamics. People close to Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Kushner described them as friends, but others saw a transactional relationship.\u201cRupert is a guy who doesn\u2019t have friends,\u201d said Mr. Chenoweth, the Murdoch biographer.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s news properties will allow him to maintain the political influence that he has cultivated.\u201cI think he\u2019s keeping his passion projects,\u201d said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.As for his sons, people close to Mr. Murdoch do not envision a scenario in which either James or Lachlan thrives long-term at the top of a company that doesn\u2019t have their father\u2019s stamp on the door.In a joint memo to employees sent last week, James and Lachlan tried to quell concerns about the sale. \u201cUncertainty,\u201d they wrote, \u201calways breeds unease.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prescription Drugs May Cost More With Insurance Than Without It", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was written through collaboration between The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.Having health insurance is supposed to save you money on your prescriptions. But increasingly, consumers are finding that isn\u2019t the case.Patrik Swanljung found this out when he went to fill a prescription for a generic cholesterol drug. In May, Mr. Swanljung handed his Medicare prescription card to the pharmacist at his local Walgreens and was told that he owed $83.94 for a three-month supply.Alarmed at that price, Mr. Swanljung went online and found Blink Health, a start-up, offering the same drug \u2014 generic Crestor \u2014 for $45.89.It had struck a better deal than did his insurer, UnitedHealthcare. \u201cIt\u2019s completely ridiculous,\u201d said Mr. Swanljung, 72, who lives in Anacortes, Wash.In an era when drug prices have ignited public outrage and insurers are requiring consumers to shoulder more of the costs, people are shocked to discover they can sometimes get better deals than their own insurers. Behind the seemingly simple act of buying a bottle of pills, a host of players \u2014 drug companies, pharmacies, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers \u2014 are taking a cut of the profits, even as consumers are left to fend for themselves, critics say.Pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that deal with drug benefits on behalf of insurers, often do negotiate better prices for consumers, particularly for brand-name medications, Mr. Rea said, but that\u2019s not necessarily true for some generic drugs. Insurers\u2019 clients are frequently employers overseeing large numbers of workers, and the companies are focused on overall costs. So when insurers seek deals for generic drugs, they do so in batches, reaching agreements for groups of different drugs rather than getting the lowest price on every drug.As a result of these complicated layers of negotiation \u2014 which are not made public \u2014 different insurers end up paying different prices for individual drugs. Further compounding confusion for consumers, some insurers require a set co-payment for each prescription \u2014 say, $15 or $20 \u2014 even when the insurer reimburses the pharmacy at a much cheaper rate.A spokesman for UnitedHealthcare, Mr. Swanljung\u2019s insurer, noted that while Mr. Swanljung got a lower price for generic Crestor through Blink Health, he also takes four other prescriptions, for which he got a better deal by using his insurance. (Mr. Swanljung gave UnitedHealthcare permission to discuss his situation.) Having insurance is clearly valuable, said the spokesman, Matt Burns. In addition, the co-payment for generic Crestor, also called rosuvastatin, in Mr. Swanljung\u2019s plan is set to decrease significantly in January, in large part because the price of the drug has dropped this year.Consumers also may face penalties if they don\u2019t use their insurance and pay cash to save money. In many cases, insurers won\u2019t let them apply those purchases to a deductible or out-of-pocket spending maximum.Still, many find that leaving their prescription card at home is worth it. Some have found a better deal even at pharmacies that are owned by their drug plan, like CVS.Susan Thomson, 55, a university lecturer who lives in Summit, N.J., is covered by a high-deductible plan through her former employer. Her drug benefits are managed by CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. For at least a decade, she\u2019s been using a prescription lotion called sulfacetamide sodium to treat rosacea, a skin condition.Last year, each time she filled her prescription at a CVS, she paid $75.07. Checking the CVS Caremark website this year, she learned that the cost had gone up to $99.03 (or $81.51 if she used CVS\u2019s mail order service).Investigating further, she found that GoodRx offered the same prescription at the same drugstore for $75.57, without her insurance. The prices were even lower at other pharmacies.\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel that the pharmaceutical industry and health care industry are pulling these numbers out of thin air.\u201dMichael DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, did not dispute the details of Ms. Thomson\u2019s experience, but said it was rare and attributed the price disparity to her high-deductible plan. Because consumers are responsible for their costs in those plans until they hit their deductible, Mr. DeAngelis said it would take them longer to reach it and they might end up spending more in the long run.Prices can also vary widely from month to month when consumers pay cash, he said.Drug-discount cards have been around for decades, and retailers like Walmart have also offered cheap generic drug programs, but both were mainly used by people without insurance.Reporters at ProPublica and The New York Times examined whether they could get better prices on 100 of the most prescribed drugs, identified by GoodRx, without using their insurance. ProPublica\u2019s prescription claims are managed by OptumRx, a large pharmacy benefit manager owned by UnitedHealth Group; The Times\u2019s medication coverage for reporters is managed by Express Scripts.Both reporters found lower prices on GoodRx for at least 40 drugs on the list (many were drugs that can be purchased for $4 at Walmart, without any coupon).Blink Health also sometimes beat the insurance out-of-pocket costs, but less often than GoodRx. Blink Health recently suffered a series of setbacks when two of the largest drugstore chains, CVS and Walgreens, stopped accepting its discounts, along with a grocery chain, Publix. In November, Blink Health sued its pharmacy benefit manager, which negotiates its prices, claiming that the company, MedImpact, had violated their agreement. MedImpact has not yet formally responded to the allegations in federal court in New York.\u201cWe said, let\u2019s see if we can gather all these prices and see if we can exploit the variation in these contracts,\u201d said Doug Hirsch, GoodRx\u2019s co-founder and co-chief executive, \u201cto see if we can provide better value.\u201dThe New York Times would like to hear from people about their experiences paying for prescription drugs.Dr. Brad Wainer, a family-practice doctor in Berwyn, Ill., said that he frequently shows patients their options on GoodRx to see if they can get a better price. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t believe me until they go and they find it out for themselves,\u201d he said.Consumers may also pay more if they are covered by plans that require them to pay a set co-payment, no matter the cash price. In some of those cases, the insurers require the pharmacies to send them the difference between what they collect from the consumer and what the insurers have agreed to reimburse the pharmacies.Several independent pharmacists said there might be safety issues if consumers buy drugs at different pharmacies. If those prescriptions are filled without an insurance card, pharmacy systems may not catch dangerous drug interactions. \u201cThat, to me, is a recipe for disaster,\u201d said Craig Seither, who owns Fort Thomas Drug Center in Fort Thomas, Ky.Mary Furman, a retired medical social worker in Charlotte, N.C., takes the drug celecoxib, the generic version of Celebrex, to treat her rheumatoid arthritis. When she went to fill a 90-day prescription in April, her pharmacy told her that her share would be $96.89 if she used her Medicare drug plan, offered by SilverScript, run by CVS Health.Then the pharmacy offered her a deal \u2014 only $72.25 if she paid cash, a price the worker said was the same the pharmacy would offer to any customer. \u201cI was flabbergasted,\u201d said Mrs. Furman, who is 72.Mrs. Furman took the deal, and afterward, her husband, Nelson, called SilverScript to report what happened. The representative told Mr. Furman he was \u201cnot surprised.\u201dThe couple then reported the experience to a company hired by Medicare to investigate fraud, but a representative encouraged her to contact the health plan again.After reporters sent details of Mrs. Furman\u2019s case CVS, Mr. Furman said they received a call from the SilverScript president. Mr. DeAngelis, the CVS spokesman, blamed the pharmacy for charging the couple more than what their share should have been using their insurance. (Medicare rules require that consumers always get the lower price of their set co-payment and a pharmacy\u2019s cash price.)Now the Furmans are looking at drug coverage for next year, and once again, they see huge variation in prices for that drug and others.\u201cThe prices are all over the map,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Charles Ornstein is a reporter at ProPublica.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thousands Once Spoke His Language in the Amazon. Now, He\u2019s the Only One.", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINTUTO, Peru \u2014 Amadeo Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda rushed upriver in his canoe, slipping into the hidden, booby-trapped camp where his brother Juan lay dying.Juan writhed in pain and shook uncontrollably as his fever rose, battling malaria. As Amadeo consoled him, the sick man muttered back in words that no one else on Earth still understood.The words were Taushiro. A mystery to linguists and anthropologists alike, the language was spoken by a tribe that vanished into the jungles of the Amazon basin in Peru generations ago, hoping to save itself from the invaders whose weapons and diseases had brought it to the brink of extinction.A bend on the \u201cwild river,\u201d as they called it, sheltered the two brothers and the other 15 remaining members of their tribe. The clan protected its tiny settlement with a ring of deep pits, expertly hidden by a thin cover of leaves and sticks. They kept packs of attack dogs to stop outsiders from coming near. Even by the end of the 20th century, few outsiders had ever seen the Taushiro or heard their language beyond the occasional hunter, a few Christian missionaries and the armed rubber tappers who came at least twice to enslave the small tribe.But in the end it was no use. Without rifles or medicine, they were dying off.A jaguar killed one of the children as he slept. Two more siblings, bitten by snakes, perished without antivenom. One child drowned in a stream. A young man bled to death while hunting in the forest.Then came the diseases. First measles, which took Juan and Amadeo\u2019s mother. Finally, a fatal form of malaria killed their father, the patriarch of the tribe. His body was buried in the floor of his home before the structure was torched to the ground, following Taushiro tradition.So by the time Amadeo wrestled his dying brother into the canoe that day, they were the only ones who remained, the last of a culture that once numbered in the thousands. Amadeo sped to a distant town, Intuto, that was home to a clinic. A crowd gathered on the small river dock to see who the dying stranger was, dressed only in a loincloth made of palm leaves.Juan\u2019s shaking soon gave way to stiffness. He drifted in and out of consciousness, finally looking up at Amadeo.The church bell rang that afternoon, letting villagers know that the unusual visitor had died.Amadeo said it haltingly, in broken Spanish, the only way he would be able to communicate with the world from that moment on. No one else spoke his language anymore. The survival of his culture had suddenly come down to a sole, complicated man.Human history can be traced through the spread of languages. The Phoenicians spanned the ancient Mediterranean trade routes, bringing the alphabet to the Greeks and literacy to Europeans. English, once a small language spoken in southern Britain, is now the mother tongue of hundreds of millions across the world. The Chinese dialects are more than a billion strong.But the entire fate of the Taushiro people now lies with its last speaker, a person who never expected such a burden and has spent much of his life overwhelmed by it.\u201cThat\u2019s Amadeo there: Almost no one understands him when he\u2019s speaking his language,\u201d said William Manihuari, watching Amadeo fish alone from a canoe on a recent day.\u201cAnd when he dies, no one is left,\u201d added Jos\u00e9 Sandi, a 12-year-old boy who watched as well.The waters of the Peruvian Amazon were once a vast linguistic repository, a place where every turn of the river could yield another dialect, often completely unintelligible to people living just a few miles away. But in the last century, at least 37 languages have disappeared in Peru alone, lost in the steady clash and churn of national expansion, migration, urbanization and the pursuit of natural resources. Forty-seven languages remain here in Peru, scholars estimate, and nearly half are at risk of disappearing.I came to the river outpost of Intuto, 10 hours by speedboat from the nearest city, to figure out how the Taushiro, like so many other cultures, had been brought to this kind of end. The journey began in forgotten linguistic papers and historical sketches. It even led me to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico, where a retired Christian missionary rummaged through the last existing pictures of the Taushiro, nearly coming to tears as she looked through them for the first time in years.And it brought me here, to the banks of a silty brown river, where the cumulative experience of the Taushiro people swung alone in a hammock: A man around 70 whose memory was fading and whose grasp of the language was slipping away because he had no one to speak it with.\u201cAt any moment I might disappear, my life will end, we don\u2019t know how soon,\u201d Amadeo said stoically. \u201cThe Taushiro don\u2019t think about death. We just move on.\u201dHe knows that\u2019s not true, that there is no moving on for the Taushiro anymore. It leaves him exasperated, at times wondering how much of the blame is his, or whether the extinction of his people really matters at all.\u201cSometimes I don\u2019t care anymore,\u201d he said.Languages are typically passed down through families, but Amadeo broke his apart decades before he realized what the consequences would be for his culture and its place in history. He still has five children, dotted across the Americas. But after his wife left him in the 1980s, he put them into an orphanage when they were still young, thinking it was safer than a life in which children were abducted by traffickers or lost to war. None of them lived with him after that. They never learned his language.\u201cFor those languages that are in this critical situation, many times it seems their fate is already sealed \u2014 that\u2019s to say, it\u2019s hard to ever recover a language at this stage,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Panizo, a government linguist trying to document Taushiro. \u201cAmadeo Garc\u00eda, he wants Taushiro to come back. He wants it, he dreams of it, he longs for it, and he suffers to know that he\u2019s the last speaker.\u201dNow Amadeo lives alone in a clapboard house behind the town\u2019s water tower, spending many of his final days drinking. Desperate to speak and hear whatever Taushiro he can, he sits alone on his porch in the morning, reciting the only literature ever written in the language \u2014 verses of the Bible translated into Taushiro by missionaries who sought to convert the tribe years ago.Amadeo lives alongside the people of Intuto, but not with them, often passing them in a quiet stupor. Mario Tapuy, 74, who met Amadeo as a child when he lived in the forest, said he had tried many times to draw Amadeo out of the bar to teach others the language.Mr. Tapuy, who speaks his own indigenous language, Kichwa, said he had realized years ago that the future of Taushiro would come to down to Amadeo, regardless of whether he wanted the responsibility.\u201cI told him many times,\u201d Mr. Tapuy said. \u201cHe listens, but it doesn\u2019t record in his brain.\u201dI had arrived in Intuto with a linguist named Juanita P\u00e9rez R\u00edos, who had known Amadeo for years and introduced me to him that day. In the evening, Amadeo wanted to speak to his son Daniel, who lives in Lima, the capital, and Ms. P\u00e9rez lent him her phone. It had been many months since the father and son had spoken.\u201cI fell on my knees in the jungle,\u201d said Amadeo. \u201cI\u2019m limping a little.\u201d\u201cYou need to be careful,\u201d said Daniel.The two spoke in Spanish, which was sometimes difficult for Amadeo.\u201cMy brothers told me you\u2019ve been getting a little drunk,\u201d Daniel chided him. \u201cYou need to stop that now.\u201dThen a pause.\u201cI love you a lot, understand?\u201d said Daniel. The phone clicked.Amadeo sat in his home for a few minutes, looking into the night as the sounds of the forest grew louder. Families could be heard in the distance, cooking dinner.\u201cThey say they love me, but they never come,\u201d he said.The problems began with rubber.The Taushiro and other indigenous groups had long harvested a sticky white substance that leaked from certain trees and coated their clothes, making them waterproof. But by the 19th century, Europeans had discovered the utility of rubber as well, setting off a boom.European and American companies descended into the jungles, forcing indigenous populations into slavery to tap the rubber while building huge palaces on the lands left behind. The deadly Age of Rubber had begun in the Amazon.In many areas, as much as 90 percent of the indigenous population died from disease and forced labor, researchers say. Thousands moved into newly settled cities. But the Taushiro, along with many other tribes, took another route: They decided to disappear.Amadeo\u2019s early memories from the hidden Taushiro settlement of Aucayacu remain in the haze of a place where writing was unknown and no records were kept, not even of his birth, which he thinks was sometime in the 1940s. His first memory was walking naked through the forest in a storm, the rain trickling down his body.Contact with the outside world was rare, and often violent.First came a rubber tapper in search of slaves. Wielding machetes and rifles, he found Aucayacu with four of his men and ordered the tribe to work. Amadeo and his family spent grueling days draining rubber from tree trunks and sculpting it into blocks to be sold by the trader downriver.The tapper forced Amadeo\u2019s married sister into a sexual relationship, then nearly beat her to death with a piece of wood. Her husband threw a spear through the tapper, who was never seen there again.Before long, another rubber tapper came in his place. Perhaps learning from the fate of his predecessor, the new tapper decided to give his rifle in exchange for work, rather than turn it against the Taushiro.He also gave them something else. Unable to distinguish among his workers, he lined them up and gave them Spanish names: Margarita, Andr\u00e9s, Magdalena, C\u00e9sar, Antonio. The youngest boy was called Amadeo. With no surnames, the Taushiro were each given two: Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda.One day the ground began to tremble and the world took another step toward Amadeo.It wasn\u2019t an earthquake, but the seismic testing equipment of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, an American company that had come to Peru. Rubber had long declined in the Amazon. Now the foreigners were after oil.Word spread among the drillers that an indigenous group was hiding on one of the tributaries of the Tigre River. Occidental soon sent a plane and a lookout with binoculars to locate the tribe.It was the first time Amadeo had seen anyone fly. It was 1971.\u201cThey were so close to the ground you could see their faces looking at us,\u201d Amadeo said.With the coordinates of the Taushiro in hand, contact was inevitable. But rather than sending one of its own, the oil company turned to a group of Christian evangelists with an unusual mission.Contact \u2014 followed by conversion \u2014 was the ultimate goal of the Christian linguists. The mission sometimes proved deadly.In 1956, after dropping gifts to the uncontacted Waorani people, five missionaries were speared to death by the tribe on a riverbank in Ecuador. Undeterred, the institute sent a sister of one of the dead missionaries to try once more with the Waorani, who let the outsider and her family live among them. The tribe converted.In 1971, Daniel Velie approached the edges of the Taushiro settlement, making his way past the booby traps and barking dogs. From the back of a canoe, he hauled out a heavy device to make the first recordings of their language.But the Taushiro were in no state to speak.An illness had swept through the village. When Mr. Velie arrived, seven Taushiro were near death. He pulled out a first-aid kit and gave them penicillin, the first antibiotics the Taushiro had taken. When they recovered, he took down the first 200 words of a Taushiro glossary.Using hand gestures, the group conveyed their appreciation to the missionary. But Mr. Velie wanted something in return. He eventually asked for Amadeo, who was thought to be in his 20s at the time, to return with him and start teaching the language to others.\u201cThey said yes, Amadeo could go; they were so thankful to have been saved,\u201d said Nectali Alicea, the linguist soon put in charge of the Taushiro project by the language institute. \u201cIt was medicine that was the key.\u201dMs. Alicea was a young Puerto Rican social sciences graduate. She had already embarked on missions to Mexico as part of her training with the institute, which taught her the structures of languages at its annual summer boot camp in Oklahoma.For Ms. Alicea, as with many of the missionaries, the languages were a bridge to Christianity.\u201cYou cannot evangelize in Spanish,\u201d she said.One of her pictures from 1972 shows Amadeo stepping aboard a plane for the first time, en route to the institute\u2019s compound outside the Peruvian city of Pucallpa. A new world of firsts was opening up: of roads and sidewalks, of chicken, which he had never eaten before. He slept on the floor, unaccustomed to a bed. For days on end, Ms. Alicea took dictations of his language to prepare to meet the Taushiro in the forest.She arrived at their secret camp that June with a missionary doctor from Georgia, his wife and their son for a two-week visit. The Taushiro clan welcomed the strangers and the recording technology they brought, along with medicine, machetes and food.\u201cThe father would embrace me and not let me go,\u201d Ms. Alicea wrote in her diary of one of the Taushiro men. \u201cI would forget my land and stay here, he said.\u201dShe began to follow some of their conversations, learning enough Taushiro to ask one man in the clan why he never swam. Despite living off the river, the Taushiro avoided even wading in it, washing themselves from the safety of a canoe. The man explained that under the water lurked a horde of boa constrictors, waiting to strike.Ms. Alicea and the missionaries with her stripped down to their underwear and jumped into the river, laughing and splashing.\u201cWhen they saw us in the water, something changed,\u201d Ms. Alicea said, adding that the event had caused the Taushiro to question their long-held beliefs. \u201cThey asked us how we did it. And we said: \u2018Because we have a Spirit that is stronger than the boa.\u2019\u201dMs. Alicea produced a Bible.Years before, the Taushiro had taken Christian names. Now they were taking on Christianity itself.When Amadeo, the youngest of the Taushiro, arrived with a girl named Margarita Machoa, declaring that she would be his wife, there was a sigh of relief in Aucayacu. The Taushiro line was continuing.\u201cShe fell in love with me,\u201d said Amadeo, recalling how he and Margarita had played with her toy dolls after meeting.Amadeo was a grown man. Margarita was 12 years old.Amadeo soon wound up in jail, arrested at the request of the girl\u2019s father. He said Margarita was too young to give Amadeo her consent.In the end, it was Ms. Alicea, the linguist, who brokered Amadeo\u2019s release, arguing that Peruvian law allowed indigenous men to marry according to their customs. Converting the clan to Christianity was possible, Ms. Alicea felt, but the changes could go only so far.\u201cIt was typical among natives; I had seen this with Candoshi, with the Sharpras people,\u201d Ms. Alicea said. \u201cThey had such small girls with the oldest men. At least this was better.\u201dWithin months, Margarita was pregnant with Amadeo\u2019s first child, a girl they named Margarita. The baby was the first of five.During the birth of his last son, also named Amadeo, Ms. Alicea cut the umbilical cord by the side of the river. The two were becoming inseparable, working long hours to document Taushiro words.\u201cShe would ask, \u2018What is this called?\u2019\u201d Amadeo recalled. \u201c\u2018How do you say nail? How do you say toe?\u2019\u201dAmadeo taught his children the ways of the clan, particularly David, Daniel and Jonathan, who were becoming quick with blow guns and spears. On early mornings, he took them to gather the palm leaves they had left near termites\u2019 nests the day before. The leaves were covered in insects \u2014 bait for fishing, a technique the Taushiro had used for generations.Yet the dangers of the forest were always present.\u201cMy father would say before we went to sleep, \u2018Remember, a tiger can come for you,\u2019\u201d Jonathan said, using a common word for jaguars.Taushiro culture, especially its language, proved isolating for Amadeo\u2019s wife, Margarita, who came from a different tribe and was unable to communicate with anyone in Taushiro. She couldn\u2019t even speak with her own husband, except in broken Spanish. She spent long days alone with her children, sometimes screaming at them or giving them beatings in frustration.\u201cSince she was married young, she wasn\u2019t grown up,\u201d said her daughter, also named Margarita, who remembers being thrown out of a canoe by her mother when the girl could barely swim. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same to play with a doll as it was to play with flesh and bones.\u201dIn 1984, after their fifth child was born, Amadeo took the family to a village where he worked construction for several months. Neighbors said the couple argued frequently. They could hear Margarita\u2019s screams when Amadeo beat her.Margarita, her daughter said, had gotten into a relationship with a man her own age. When Amadeo learned of it, he attacked her again.It was the last beating she took from him.\u201cShe left that night and said nothing,\u201d the daughter said.Their mother\u2019s sudden departure devastated the family. Without her, Amadeo became the sole caretaker of five children. The division of labor between the genders had been strict among the Taushiro, with men spending the day hunting for food and women raising the children.\u201cI knew nothing about how to care for them,\u201d Amadeo said.With his relatives in Aucayacu dwindling from old age and disease, Amadeo decided to leave the camp for the missionary compound near Pucallpa, several hundred miles away. His children, he didn\u2019t realize at the time, were leaving the forest for good.In the city, Amadeo sank into despair \u2014 and into alcoholism. In town, liquor was suddenly available.\u201cHe got drunk, he insulted people,\u201d said Mario Tapuy Paredes, a friend at the time.Still, Amadeo held onto the project that had anchored most of his adult life, documenting Taushiro with the missionaries. He and Ms. Alicea had moved beyond a basic dictionary and grammar books into the first translations of the Bible, including parts of Genesis and sections of New Testament books like the Gospels.But for the language to survive beyond books, it needed to be taken on by Amadeo\u2019s children. And it was becoming unclear whether he could keep them safe, let alone teach them Taushiro.One day when Amadeo was out of the house, Margarita, then 9, was approached by a woman offering her food. She followed the woman to a taxi, which sped away with her. Ms. Alicea called the police, who rescued the girl from a boat launch where her abductor had planned to put her into a child trafficking ring.The abduction shook Amadeo. Feeling overwhelmed, he eventually decided to put the children into an orphanage.Could Ms. Alicea, the orphanage asked, adopt the Taushiro children herself? Ms. Alicea, then in her 50s, would now become the mother of the world\u2019s last five Taushiro children.There was an obstacle, however. Her own mother, in her 70s, was growing ill in Puerto Rico. Ms. Alicea wanted to return to care for her.This confronted the linguist with the most difficult choice of her career: to save the Taushiro language and culture, or to save the children she had known since their birth and grown to love.The contradictions were lost on no one.First Amadeo, one of the last of his people, who had spent his adult life trying to ensure that his language endured, had given up his own children, virtually guaranteeing that they would never pass it along.Then Ms. Alicea, who had devoted herself for nearly two decades to documenting and preserving the Taushiro way of life, was taking its few remaining descendants to a distant country, to be raised in an entirely different culture that would effectively erase their own.\u201cI was Christian first,\u201d she said, explaining that her principal duty was to the welfare of the children.Ms. Alicea\u2019s decision to move the children to Puerto Rico remains a shock to linguists who know of Taushiro, arguing that her choice all but guaranteed its extinction.\u201cI have never heard of an equivalent story elsewhere; in any academic circle, that would have been considered an unethical event,\u201d said Zachary O\u2019Hagan, a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley who has done research with Amadeo in Peru.\u201cWhen a language like this disappears, you have lost a key data point in studying what universal properties exist in all languages,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hagan said.But Ms. Alicea said it was unlikely that Amadeo would have ever taught his children Taushiro under the circumstances. And she said that, at the time, she did not envision a future in which Amadeo would become the last of his tribe.In 1990, she adopted the children and changed their last names to her own. The family moved across the hemisphere.\u201cI love the language,\u201d Ms. Alicea said. \u201cBut I love the people more than the language. With the blessing of God, those children had a future.\u201dThe change was staggering for the children.They had been born in an isolated tribe in the Amazon and abandoned in an orphanage. Suddenly, they were transported to a commonwealth of the United States, with busy streets that came to a halt at rush hour and high rises in San Juan.The thump of nightclub music stretched into the night. They saw the Caribbean for the first time. Ms. Alicea became their guide to the new world, taking them on vacations to New York. Her photos from the early 1990s show the Taushiro children playing in the snow.The adjustment differed for each of the children as they settled into San Lorenzo, Ms. Alicea\u2019s home in the center of the island. Margarita, the most extroverted of the children, made new friends quickly. Amadeo Jr., the youngest at 6, picked up a Puerto Rican accent. But his indigenous features were a curiosity to his classmates. Rather than say he was Taushiro, he told his friends his father was Japanese.David was the first one to run into trouble.As the years passed, he became angry. By seventh grade, his teachers feared his outbursts. Ms. Alicea began to notice money missing from her wallet.One night, Ms. Alicea confronted him in the living room. It led to an altercation that ended with her calling the police.\u201cI want you to decide if you want to stay here, if you want to be American or Peruvian,\u201d she recalled telling him. \u201cI love him and still do.\u201dTwo of the brothers, Jonathan and Daniel, decided to return to their father.The years alone had been difficult for Amadeo. Increasingly drawn to alcohol, which was available only in towns, Amadeo settled in Intuto and lived as a recluse, still sleeping on the ground as he had in Aucayacu. He now hunted with a rifle instead of a blowgun, heading into the forest most days in search of game to sell.\u201cWhen we were out, he camped alone,\u201d recalled Jorge Chocl\u00f3n, who sometimes hunted with Amadeo. \u201cThat was his way. And he didn\u2019t like society.\u201dBut waiting on the dock in 1994 for the arrival of Jonathan and Daniel, Amadeo was filled with hope again. The father and sons, reunited, embraced.While they could not speak the language, Amadeo was eager to bring his sons back into the traditions of their people. He and Jonathan woke at 5 a.m. for the hunt, returning after sundown. He took the boys to what remained of the Taushiro settlement in Aucayacu, where only his father and a few relatives still survived.Jonathan felt apart from it, unable to communicate with anyone there.\u201cMy grandfather could only say my name,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had gotten used to Puerto Rico. Now I felt more from there. I cried all night.\u201dThe opportunity to learn Taushiro seemed lost. The boys were teenagers, past the age when children usually pick up language quickly from their parents. Spanish was still the language they heard at school most of the day, and a stigma lingered in Intuto when it came to indigenous languages.\u201cI could barely say a few words \u2014 mother, father, that was it,\u201d Jonathan said.The arrival of David, the oldest brother, in 1996 brought new challenges. Mr. Villalobos, the Christian missionary who directed the school in Intuto, said David\u2019s anger had followed him to Peru. The boy rarely did his schoolwork and was known for carrying a knife around town, once threatening to stab one of his classmates, Mr. Villalobos said.And Amadeo\u2019s drinking continued.One day, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez, a missionary, went to visit Amadeo at his home on the edge of town. In Spanish, Amadeo told him he was sick, but after a moment Mr. \u00c1lvarez said he realized Amadeo was trying to say he was depressed, unable to find the correct word. Amadeo began to cry, the first time Mr. \u00c1lvarez had ever seen him express emotion.\u201cHe spoke in tears of his children, that they didn\u2019t want to come see him, that they didn\u2019t want to know hardly anything of him, or their Taushiro origins, not the language, not the culture,\u201d Mr. \u00c1lvarez wrote in a letter from that time.Mr. \u00c1lvarez added: \u201cI felt in these moments the deep pain that probably that man felt, the last Taushiro, that the saga of his people would definitively end with him.\u201dThe Taushiro language had been reduced to its last five speakers: Amadeo, and four family members who desperately held onto life in their encampment in Aucayacu. And even that meager number was about to collapse.The first to die was a brother of Amadeo\u2019s who had long been unable to walk, paralyzed years ago after a snake bite. Then Amadeo\u2019s aunt woke up one day with a sore throat, a fever and blotchy rashes across her body, the first signs of measles. The missionaries had left the encampment years ago, and she died without treatment.Then came malaria. In the late 1990s, a deadly strain began to work its way up the rivers of northern Peru. Amadeo\u2019s father fell ill and died. Now only Juan, Amadeo\u2019s last brother, remained, living alone in the ruins of the settlement where he had grown up, with only dogs for company.In 1999, Amadeo hauled his dying brother from the canoe, and the two spoke in Taushiro for the last time.\u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t cry, your brother is with the Lord,\u2019\u201d recalled Amadeo.Nearly 20 years later, Amadeo walked through an overgrown cemetery, the place he had buried his brother. The wooden cross had fallen over. Juan Garc\u00eda\u2019s name was barely visible where it had been etched onto one of the beams.\u201cWhen I\u2019m gone, I\u2019ll be here as well,\u201d Amadeo said later that day. \u201cI am old and will disappear at any time.\u201dYet even in the twilight of Amadeo\u2019s life, a few hold out hope that some part of the Taushiro language will persist after him.This year, Peru\u2019s Ministry of Culture decided to take up the work that Ms. Alicea began. Working with Amadeo, government linguists have created a database of 1,500 Taushiro words, 27 stories and three songs, with plans to make recordings of Amadeo available to academics and others interested in the language.It is a race against time \u2014 and against Amadeo\u2019s own memory, which sometimes fails him after so many years of having no one to speak with in Taushiro.But linguists involved in the work say that even if Taushiro dies with Amadeo, a record of it will be kept, at least.\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that Peru has made this kind of gesture,\u201d said Mr. Panizo, the linguist leading the project.Last February, the government flew Amadeo to Lima to give him a medal for his contribution to Peruvian culture. The sudden attention was a shock to Amadeo, along with the packed streets of Lima and the interviews with the local news media.Still, he beamed as a crowd gathered for a ceremony that honored several other indigenous activists who spoke their languages. Government officials gave impassioned speeches on the importance of preserving the 47 indigenous languages that remain in the country. Amadeo spoke words in Taushiro.While Amadeo knew that he had not passed his language to his five children, he took comfort in the fact that they were safe. They had not suffered the fate of their relatives, who had all perished in the forest. One of them, Daniel, was even in the audience that day to see him.After the ceremony, the two men embraced. Daniel introduced Amadeo to his 6-year-old daughter, the first time Amadeo had met his grandchild.\u201cI just want to be proud of my father, of the tribe that we were, that I was born into, that we lived,\u201d said Daniel, who works as a construction worker in Lima.One evening this summer, Amadeo sat alone and began to speak his language, saying one sentence in Taushiro, then translating it into Spanish, before repeating the process. It was growing late, the crickets and frogs were getting louder, and Amadeo raised his voice above them.\u201cI am Taushiro,\u201d he said. \u201cI have something that no one else in the world has. One day when I am gone from the world, I hope the world remembers.\u201dJuanita P\u00e9rez R\u00edos and Andrea Zarate contributed reporting from Intuto, and Waldemar Serrano Burgos from San Lorenzo, P.R.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ren Hang\u2019s Photographs Scandalized \u2014 and Inspired \u2014 His Countrymen", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.In Ren\u2019s photographs, the body never seems ordinary; it\u2019s humorous, bizarre, sublime \u2014 even unnerving. There are people piled on top of one another, penises placed delicately on cheeks, pelvises thrusting skyward. Sexuality and gender become fluid, destabilized. The images should be shocking or titillating, but somehow they\u2019re not. Spread orifices seem as pretty and delicate as a palm frond or a lily.Ren picked up a point-and-shoot camera out of boredom at 17, while he was a student at the Communication University of China. His photographs were first shown a few years later in Beijing, and he was almost immediately anointed a rising star in the art world. He had shows in Paris, in Vienna, in New York, but at home, Ren ran afoul of local authorities and was arrested frequently. One exhibition in China was shut down by censors on \u201csuspicion of sex\u201d; at others, people spat on his work.Ren\u2019s images tell a story about Chinese youth, a generation pushing back against censorship and societal restrictions. The American understanding of China is filtered through years of politics; we rarely see the culture on its own terms. Ren\u2019s work challenges our stereotypes. He once said he didn\u2019t want others to have \u201cthe impression that Chinese people are robots.\u201d Life is present in all his images, but so is death. One image features a fully nude woman hanging by her feet from a rope in a barren tree. Others show heads submerged in bags of water, bodies consumed by smoke. There\u2019s an entire series of bodies half-buried in fields. His work seemed to acknowledge that the price of living is dying.\u201cHe repeated over and over that nothing was ever planned for photographs,\u201d said Dian Hanson, an editor at Taschen who worked with Ren on a monograph of his photographs that was published earlier this year. \u201cNothing was planned in his life. He was determined to live in the moment always. There was no thought for the future. In retrospect, one sees that as a plan not to be around for very long.\u201dThough he rarely discussed it, Ren suffered from depression. In China, mental health is almost as taboo as nudity, and Ren projected happiness to make people comfortable, but he frequently posted desperate journal entries on his website. On July 19, 2016, he wrote, \u201cEvery person is suddenly like an enormous wound.\u201d Several months later, in February, at age 29, he jumped to his death from the 28th floor of a building.Hanson told me she doesn\u2019t know what will happen to Ren\u2019s legacy. Like many people in China, his family, who now control his estate, did not approve of his work. A journalist once asked Ren how he coped with the refusal of acceptance in China. \u201cTrue, I\u2019m restricted here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more I\u2019m limited by my country, the more I want my country to take me in and accept me for who I am and what I do.\u201dB. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: \u201cI ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R.

Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Cooking, and Reporting, in the Thrall of the Instant Pot", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the perks of being a technology columnist is getting to test lots of gadgets before they\u2019re available to the general public. As a result, my apartment has at times resembled a Best Buy showroom. I have installed Bluetooth door locks; Wi-Fi-connected lights that can be turned on and off by talking to my Amazon Echo; and a remote-controlled bidet on my toilet. (Don\u2019t ask about that last one.)But of all the hardware products I\u2019ve used this year, my favorite wasn\u2019t the iPhone X or some newfangled VR headset. It was a $99 electric multicooker called the Instant Pot, made by a tiny Canadian company called Double Insight.Mr. Wang seemed surprised. (Ottawa in December is not exactly a dream destination for journalists.) But he agreed to host me, and give me a peek at the company\u2019s inner sanctum. I arrived on a warmer-than-expected Wednesday, and we spent nearly four hours talking about Mr. Wang\u2019s upbringing in China, his Ph.D. in computer science, and how he spent $350,000 of his own savings developing the Instant Pot after being laid off from his technology job in 2008. He also told me about some unorthodox ways people are using their Instant Pots, like the arts-and-crafts buff who creates sculptures out of popsicle sticks, and uses her Instant Pot to steam the sticks to make them bendable.The Instant Pot\u2019s main draw is its pressure-cooking function, which can cook unsoaked beans or soften tough cuts of meat in a half-hour or less. But it can also saut\u00e9, steam, and slow-cook, and its idiot-proof interface is perfect for \u2026 well, me. It\u2019s now my go-to device for weeknight dinners \u2014 in the past few weeks, I\u2019ve used my Instant Pot to make green Thai curry, butternut squash risotto, and a reasonable facsimile of a beef bourguignon.By the way: The best use I\u2019ve found for the Instant Pot is cooking raw beets. Beets are the greatest vegetable on God\u2019s green earth, but roasting them the conventional way takes hours and gets red stuff all over your hands. Now, I just put a few beets in the Instant Pot with a steamer rack and an inch of water, turn on the high-pressure mode, and wait 20 minutes. They come out warm and soft, with skins that slip right off. No more red hands!Normally, I\u2019m skeptical of new product hype. The tech industry has an ignoble record of overselling its innovations and making even the smallest incremental advances seem like huge leaps forward. (How many times have I been pitched a \u201cworld-changing\u201d start-up that turns out to be \u201cTinder for insurance agents\u201d or whatever?) But in the Instant Pot\u2019s case, I had already spent several months experiencing the product\u2019s benefits, and talking to Mr. Wang convinced me that this device might represent an actual, lasting shift in the way people cook and eat.I\u2019m still not a good cook. But I\u2019m a lot better than I was. And for that, I have Mr. Wang\u2019s invention to thank.Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a beef stew to make.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Love Affair With Bookstores", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.After surviving a civil war, a devastating fire and a property dispute, the 89-year-old Catal\u00f2nia bookstore in Barcelona closed in 2013 and was reborn as a McDonald\u2019s. Witnessing this sacrilege was Jorge Carri\u00f3n, a Barcelona-based novelist and essayist who at the time was preparing a cultural history of bookstores. \u201cOf course, it is an obvious metaphor,\u201d he recalls glumly, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t make it any less shocking.\u201dFortunately he holds off his pessimism until the end of \u201cBookshops\u201d (so named because its seasoned translator, Peter Bush, is British) since his real purpose is to celebrate bookstores. And he does so by wandering the globe in search of those that play \u2014 or have played \u2014 a special role in the intellectual and social lives of their communities. They become Carri\u00f3n\u2019s personal mappa mundi.It is the bookseller, then, who must stay in touch with the world to survive. And by tracking down what claims to be the oldest functioning bookstore in the world, the Livraria Bertrand in Lisbon, with its logo displaying 1732, Carri\u00f3n demonstrates that survival is possible. But what a struggle! While writing, he discovers that some bookstores he has admired have since closed.Still, beyond a nod to ancient Greece\u2019s book trade and the Library of Alexandria, he finds recent history worth revisiting, not least Sylvia Beach\u2019s Shakespeare and Company on the Rue de l\u2019Od\u00e9on in Paris, which served as a second home to the Lost Generation and first published James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d in 1922, before closing in late 1941 during the German occupation of France.Its namesake, though, lives on. Founded by George Whitman as Le Mistral in 1951, it became the new Shakespeare & Company in 1964 and, to this day, it draws crowds of writers and tourists to its labyrinthine quarters near Notre Dame. In his early years, Whitman befriended expat American writers, among them Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who on his return to San Francisco founded City Lights, which naturally Carri\u00f3n also visited.At times, \u201cBookshops\u201d reads like a collection of notes, leaping between topics, comparing discoveries in different countries within a single paragraph, stopping to discuss writers like Julio Cort\u00e1zar and Roberto Bola\u00f1o, recounting the history of publishing from China to Gutenberg, digressing to recall those authors, like Jean Genet, who began their careers by stealing books. All this, while profiling scores of bookstores.Repression is a reality because regimes can know their enemies by what they read and write. Book burning was routine for Spain\u2019s Inquisition and Franco\u2019s dictatorship as well as for Stalin, Hitler, Mao Zedong and a good many other dictators. Myriad authors have also seen their books banned, from Charles Baudelaire, Joyce, D.H. Lawrence and Henry Miller to Salman Rushdie. The United States is no innocent, Carri\u00f3n notes, \u201cwith the present proscription of books enforced by thousands of bookshops, educational institutions and libraries for political or religious reasons.\u201dOur peripatetic author\u2019s explorations are most enjoyable when he goes beyond such landmarks as Foyle\u2019s in London, the Strand Book Store in New York and L\u2019Ecume des Pages in Paris to less obvious corners, for instance, Antigua in Guatemala. There, La Librer\u00eda del Pensativo opened in 1987 in the midst of a civil war when \u201cdistant shots fired by the guerrillas, army or paramilitary echoed around the volcanoes surrounding the city.\u201d Under its tenacious owner, Ana Mar\u00eda Cofi\u00f1o, Carri\u00f3n writes, it became a \u201ccenter of resistance.\u201dIn the postwar years of Paul Bowles\u2019s Tangiers, it was La Librairie des Colonnes, with its shelves full of English, Spanish and Arab titles, that served as a meeting place for fugitive or visiting writers, among them the Beats William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg as well as Gore Vidal, Marguerite Yourcenar and Juan Goytisolo. Yet even with the support of leading Arab writers like Amin Maalouf and Tahar Ben Jelloun, the bookstore had to be rescued from closure in 2010 by Pierre Berg\u00e9, the late French fashion industrialist and philanthropist.In Cape Town, Carri\u00f3n was charmed by the warmth of the Book Lounge, but he noticed that each of the shelves marked Paulo Coelho, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and J.M. Coetzee had a card reading, \u201cAsk for his books at the counter.\u201d Puzzled, he inquired. \u201cThey are the three most stolen writers. The only ones people steal. So we keep their books here,\u201d the bookseller explained, pointing to a pile behind her.For all Carri\u00f3n\u2019s love of independent bookstores, another reality is the mass marketing of books, which began with stands in 19th-century railroad stations and later airports, spread to chains like Barnes & Noble and Waterstones in Britain and eventually spawned Amazon. But even as he admits to occasionally buying online, he considers his mission incomplete. \u201cI devote many of my Sunday afternoons to surfing the web in search of bookshops that still do not exist for me,\u201d he writes, \u201cthough they are out there, waiting for me.\u201dAlan Riding is a former European cultural correspondent for The Times.

{"Headline": "Royal Robbins and the Fight for the Soul of Rock Climbing", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Harding found all this pompous and ridiculous. A California road surveyor who loved fast cars, he saw climbing as an enjoyable but silly vice and felt no responsibility to anybody. To establish Wall of the Early Morning Light, a 3,000-foot sweep of golden granite, Harding and his partner lived out of hammocks for 27 days and drank cheap wine while pandering to the TV news crews filming them. Worst of all, in Robbins\u2019s view, Harding ascended huge blank sections of rock by drilling more than 300 bolts and then clipping on stirrups to eliminate difficulty and risk.Robbins craved order, greatness and the confidence that he was doing the right thing. Born in West Virginia in 1935, he suffered early abandonment by his father, also named Royal (\u201cAh, Dad, why did you leave me?\u201d he wrote in an autobiography titled \u201cTo Be Brave\u201d). Then came years of abuse by an alcoholic stepfather named James Chandler, who moved the family to California and changed Robbins\u2019s name to his own. Robbins was 10 when he heard his mother beg his stepfather to put down a knife. Robbins ran for help, Chandler disappeared and Robbins soon reclaimed his birth name and resolved to become a better man than either of his fathers.He found schoolwork difficult but climbing easy. He first climbed in Yosemite in 1952 at the dawn of the sport\u2019s true golden age, when equipment and techniques were finally mature enough for the biggest walls, but Yosemite\u2019s marquee cliffs remained unclimbed. The obvious first plum was the 2,500-foot northwest face of Half Dome, and when Robbins heard that Harding was planning an attempt, Robbins scrambled a team and, in 1957, got to the top first. Harding retaliated by claiming the first ascent of El Capitan. In 45 days\u2019 work spread over 18 months, Harding created the so-called Nose Route by keeping ropes always fixed from his high point to the ground, commuting up and down with food and wine, drilling countless bolts and basking in national publicity.Robbins was so disturbed that in 1960 he made the second ascent of the Nose Route in just seven days. A year later, Robbins demonstrated just how retrograde Harding\u2019s methods were by doing his own first ascent of a different route on El Capitan in just 12 days and with very few bolts. The resulting route, called the Salath\u00e9 Wall, is still perhaps the greatest long rock climb on Earth.Robbins and Harding kept up their amiable competition \u2014 for prestigious first ascents and the soul of the sport \u2014 throughout the 1960s. Each time Harding or anyone else established a big new route, Robbins repeated it in better style: faster, sometimes alone, occasionally chopping bolts he deemed unnecessary. When not climbing, Robbins played tennis, read Ralph Waldo Emerson and wrote essays calling at least one of his own climbs \u201cbetter even than Mozart.\u201d Harding wasn\u2019t the only one who thought Robbins ought to lighten up, but many leading climbers shared Robbins\u2019s belief that first ascents should be done in the most adventurous way possible, with minimal damage to the wall.So when Harding spent nearly a month drilling his way up Wall of the Early Morning Light in 1970, with constant network-news coverage, Robbins was on firm social footing in declaring the route \u201ccontrived and artificial.\u201d A year later, with a partner named Don Lauria, Robbins started up Harding\u2019s opus with hammer and chisel, beginning an operation without precedent in the history of the sport \u2014 the deliberate, violent erasure of a major new climb created by an internationally famous climber.Early on the first day, however, Robbins encountered an unbolted section of surprising technical delicacy. More bolts followed, and Robbins chopped them, but then he found still more dangerous and challenging stretches, until it became apparent that Harding had taken greater risks and done the route in a more adventurous style than Robbins had imagined. That night, Robbins hung in a bivouac hammock convulsed with self-doubt. He had convinced himself he had the moral authority to obliterate Wall of the Early Morning Light, but a voice inside told Robbins that envy was blinding his better judgment. The next morning, Robbins put away hammer and chisel and, without doing further harm, followed Harding\u2019s route to the summit.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good.

Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.Read more \u25beB. 1974John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Toys That Teach Kids How to Code", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCoding is a fundamental skill for children to learn in school, but it is more than just feeding programming into a computer. Learning to code teaches valuable cognitive skills like critical thinking and problem solving. As coding moves from school to home, many toy manufacturers are responding with gadgets that turn homework into a game.Most coding toys work by using a companion app to teach children how to combine commands to make the toys generate sounds, lights and movement. If you\u2019re looking for the perfect gift for children eager to learn the basics of coding, or want to give a little one a heads up when they get to logic and problem solving in school, here are 10 of the best coding toys on the market today.The simplest toys teach coding with physical building blocks. Some require companion smartphone apps to work, but the best (and the ones friendliest to young children) do not, and let kids play with them freely, without needing pricier screens or devices.For older children, or kids with mobile devices, app-enabled coding toys allow children to drag and drop block-based commands to chain together a sequence of actions. New, more advanced challenges are typically unlocked in each toy as a child progresses.Construction-based coding toys require a lot of time, patience and room, but the payoff is that children can show off their own creations.I had the opportunity to test out several of these coding toys with my brother\u2019s three children: Ava, 8; Will, 6; and Henry, 2. We skipped the construction toys, primarily because they had too many parts and took too long to build. They wanted something that worked right out of the box.Less familiar with coding than his sister, Will was drawn to the Osmo Coding Jam, which eased him into creating his own music with simple picture instructions. He shouted with glee as he passed each lesson in the tutorial. I had hoped to entice him with the playful antics of Cozmo, but the setup, which required connecting to its own Wi-Fi network with a password, took too long.Henry loved the bright lights and loud music emitting from the Code-a-Pillar. The durable construction meant he could bang on it without breaking it. Even though we could not get the Code-a-Pillar to respond to more than five segments at a time, he still liked pushing it around the floor by hand.After all, it\u2019s better to ease children into coding and get them hooked on something right for them that they can then step up from, than to start with something that is too advanced that will collect dust in a corner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Wavers on Environment, and Earth\u2019s Largest Wetland Starts to Wither", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIRANDA, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s booming soy industry and cattle ranches are threatening one of the richest wildlife havens on the planet, where packs of jaguars, caimans, marsh deer and macaws have roamed freely for eons.The Pantanal region, the world\u2019s largest tropical wetlands, is starting to wither. Over the last 15 years, about 8,700 square miles of the area, which straddles Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, have been altered, with fast-growing patches of yellow, arid land introduced into the lush biome, which covers roughly 70,000 square miles, or about the size of Syria.This degradation of the Pantanal is seen by critics as one sign of Brazil\u2019s weakening resolve to protect its environment.While the Brazilian government earlier this year hailed a modest achievement in its signature environmental fight \u2014 containing the deforestation of the Amazon \u2014 it has been embarrassed by other trend lines. The country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions increased by 9 percent last year, compared with 2015, marking the highest output since 2008.Fueled in large part by the conversion of forested land for farming and other commercial purposes, last year\u2019s emissions increase has called into question Brazil\u2019s ability to honor its international commitments to combat climate change, including those under the Paris agreement.The expansion of agriculture into areas with few environmental regulations, or lax enforcement, has coincided with a politically turbulent period in Brazil during which a powerful coalition of federal lawmakers, representing farming interests, has had its way on a number of controversial land-use policies.\u201cIn practice, Temer has removed Brazil from the Paris agreement, just like President Trump did, with the difference that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to assume that position publicly,\u201d said Marina Silva, who was Brazil\u2019s environment minister from 2003 to 2008. During that period, the country was celebrated abroad for its aggressive efforts to curb rampant Amazon deforestation.\u201cThere\u2019s a firm effort to dismantle the government apparatus created over the past decades to support policies that were consistent with the reduction of greenhouse gases,\u201d Ms. Silva said.Mr. Temer is unabashed about his support for the agriculture and cattle industries, calling them essential engines of economic growth.\u201cIt is often said that I, or my government, protects farmers or cattle ranchers,\u201d he said during a recent speech at an industry event. \u201cIt\u2019s the contrary. It\u2019s farmers and cattle ranchers who protect the national economy and that is the clear reality. We can\u2019t be afraid to say that.\u201dA law regulating the sustainable use of land in those areas, however, was passed for only one of the biomes, the Atlantic Forest. That meant that landowners in places like the Pantanal had few constraints when Brazil\u2019s commodities boom at the turn of the century suddenly made their parcels highly profitable.The Temer government has characterized the surge in agricultural exports, mainly to China, as an important ingredient of the country\u2019s slow recovery from a yearslong recession.This export-led growth has generated tempting opportunities for landowners in Pantanal, a region whose swampy terrain and sweltering temperatures had previously made it unattractive for farming. That changed as new technology made it possible to turn wetlands into soybean fields.Last year, there were 4.8 million acres of soy fields in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, the two states that include the Pantanal \u2014 a 77 percent increase from a decade ago.\u201cThank God we have China buying our products,\u201d said Roberto Folley Coelho, a farm owner who makes a living raising cattle, planting rice and soy, and hosting tourists.Mr. Coelho scoffed at the notion that his soy crops could be causing environmental damage, arguing that imposing environmental regulations in the region would do more harm than good.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that curtailing private initiative could lead to more poverty here,\u201d he said.The threat of rigid environmental regulations remains remote in Pantanal. In 2011, a law was introduced in Congress seeking to create a framework for sustainable development in the region, but the legislation has stalled.\u201cWhat we need is to strike a balance,\u201d said Felipe Dias, the executive director of the SOS Pantanal Institute, which advocates wetlands conservation.But farmers, he said, often don\u2019t focus on the long-term damage caused by their crops, which erode the soil, polluting and diverting rivers. This alters the rhythms of the wet and dry seasons in the Pantanal, permanently flooding large areas. \u201cThey don\u2019t think about tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re fine now, they don\u2019t care about what happens next.\u201dAt the national level, a similar focus on short-term economic gains has made sustainable development an afterthought, environmentalists argue.Those initiatives came as Mr. Temer, a deeply unpopular leader, spent enormous political capital fending off the threat of trial on corruption and obstruction of justice charges by persuading lawmakers to block them.\u201cLacking popular support, the Temer government sought the backing of groups with clout in Congress, among them the agricultural bloc,\u201d said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of Climate Observatory, an environmental group. \u201cTemer leaned on that support to shield himself from investigations and sold out the environmental agenda.\u201dTemer administration officials defended their record on the environment, arguing that criticism was overblown. Their main achievement this year was a 16 percent reduction in Amazon deforestation, following several years of steady rise.\u201cDeforestation was out of control,\u201d Environment Minister Sarney Filho told reporters recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve addressed the situation.\u201dAnother initiative the Temer government cited as part of its commitment to the environment has been met with criticism.In October, officials announced they would offer companies that have been fined for violating environmental regulations steep discounts to settle their debts. Proceeds, the government said, would go toward conservation projects. The ministry noted that only about 5 percent of environmental fines had been collected in recent years.Mr. Sarney defended the measure as pragmatic in light of the fact that big companies can refuse to pay fines by fighting them in court for years on end. The long-term solution, he said, is to find a way to compensate owners who preserve their lands.\u201cForest protection services need to be paid for,\u201d he said.Adauto Rodrigues Oliveira, a soy farmer in Miranda, agrees. Environmentalists, he said, show little regard for the livelihood of farmers.\u201cThey don\u2019t care, they just say you can\u2019t plant here,\u201d he said. \u201cEnvironmentalists want to protect the land but they don\u2019t want to pay indemnity.\u201dAsked about the long-term impact of his soy fields on the surrounding wildlife, he shrugged. People in the region are less poor than they were before agriculture in the area took off.\u201cSoy is a good business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very good for Pantanal.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fingerling Caught On (Robot Grip and All) as 2017\u2019s Hot Toy", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout two years ago, Sydney Wiseman had a challenging assignment for an engineer at her family toy company.Sure, the engineer told her. What do you want the little monkey to do?Thus was born the Fingerling, a five-inch monkey that grips your finger with its legs and arms, as it babbles, blows kisses and blinks its eyes. Cradle a Fingerling in your hand and it drifts off to sleep. Press the Fingerling\u2019s head and it passes gas.Created by the Canadian company WowWee, the Fingerling has been anointed one of this year\u2019s hot toys for the holidays, a designation that most toymakers only dream of achieving.For decades, there has always been a must-have holiday toy \u2014 Cabbage Patch Kids, Beanie Babies, a Tickle Me Elmo doll. Parents drive long distances to scour stores for the one item in short supply at exactly the moment when everyone wants it. Scalpers sell the toys at ridiculous markups, while counterfeiters dupe desperate families into buying knockoffs.At stake are the tears \u2014 of joy or misery \u2014 of the children whose dearest wishes are fulfilled, or dashed.How the Fingerling reached this tipping point \u2014 when suddenly millions of children cannot do without a $15 farting monkey \u2014 is the story of a promising idea\u2019s going viral on social media, a large retailer\u2019s savvy pricing strategy and the science of managing scarcity.The monkey\u2019s journey from Ms. Wiseman\u2019s imagination to holiday sensation also shows how the making of a hot toy has evolved through the generations.The $84 billion global toy industry is struggling for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing each year, but at a slower pace than video games.The average life span of a toy fad is about eight months from its launch until it\u2019s marked down, said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and publisher of Global Toy News.\u201cThe life of an item is a little rockier\u201d than it used to be, said Anne Marie Kehoe, the Walmart vice president who runs the retailer\u2019s toy division in the United States. \u201cWe move as a country faster from one thing to the next.\u201dWowWee says it did not intentionally create the shortage. But whether by design or happenstance, there is no question that scarcity fuels a toy\u2019s mystique.\u201cThe reality is that you are better off having some disappointed children this year in order to excite them next year,\u201d said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, a supply-chain analytics firm.But extended shortages can be perilous. Empty shelves can tantalize for only so long before would-be buyers might give up.This fall, WowWee increased the number of Chinese factories producing Fingerlings to three, from two. Fingerlings started arriving by plane because it was taking too long for the toys to reach the United States from Asia on container ships.\u201cIt\u2019s like coming up with a hit movie or a hit song,\u201d Richard Yanofsky, one of WowWee\u2019s founders, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf you see signs of success, you pour gas on it.\u201dOne bitter cold morning last month, Ms. Wiseman scrolled through her phone in the WowWee offices in a former industrial building on Rue Saint-Patrick in Montreal.She pulled up the picture of a wild pygmy marmoset that launched the idea for the Fingerlings.\u201cBringing animals to life is something that is in our DNA,\u201d said Ms. Wiseman, who, ebullient and energetic, sounds as if she is about to burst into joyous laughter at any moment.WowWee is owned by Ms. Wiseman\u2019s uncles, Richard and Peter Yanofsky, with Richard living and working in Montreal and Peter in California. Her mother, a former veterinarian, also works at the company, as do two cousins. Ms. Wiseman is a brand manager at WowWee.But pricey robots are more difficult to sell these days. The challenge for WowWee\u2019s designers was developing a monkey with just enough sounds and movements to entertain children, but not so many sensors and circuitry that it would be prohibitively expensive to make.Ms. Wiseman worked with Davin Sufer, the company\u2019s 38-year-old chief technology officer, on the design.The first prototype looked like a primordial creature that had crawled out of the jungle. \u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d recalled Mr. Sufer, who has three daughters, an 8-year-old, a 6-year-old and a 4-month-old.Over time, the monkey\u2019s face softened into something cuter. It developed a curly tail and plump arms and legs. Ms. Wiseman reviewed dozens of monkey sounds until she settled on the right voice.A Fingerling can snore, say hello and babble in monkey gibberish. If one Fingerling starts singing, it triggers sensors in nearby Fingerling monkeys \u2014 the company hopes you\u2019ll buy several \u2014 that get them to join in.Ms. Wiseman and her team came up with the name Fingerling \u2014 not Finger monkey \u2014 so the brand could produce other miniature animals. (One of them, a sloth, moves, sings and, yes, farts about 10 percent slower than the monkeys.)\u201cYou know you can trust a toy company if its toys fart,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cIt knows what kids want.\u201dWowWee\u2019s offices look like a hip playroom for grown-up kids. Techno music is piped into the design lab, while Japanese anime plays on a screen mounted on the wall above a row of 3-D printers.Every shelf in the conference room was filled with robots that WowWee has produced over the decades: Robosapien, a guard dog, a panda, a Minion on wheels.The company, with about 100 employees, also has the intensity of a Wall Street trading floor, where everyone is in constant motion and new ideas are flying. Its executives travel to Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Bentonville, Ark., site of Walmart\u2019s headquarters.Whenever possible, staff engineers, designers and executives sit down and have lunch together, often at an old-style deli known for its smoked meat sandwiches and matzo ball soup.\u201cWhen the toy business is good, it is really fun,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky, 59, after parking his Tesla outside the deli one afternoon. \u201cWhen it is bad, it is really bad.\u201dMr. Yanofsky got his start as a trader. He used to buy items from wholesalers in the old part of Montreal and resell them out of the trunk of his car to retailers at a markup.\u201cIf I thought I could sell it, I would buy it,\u201d he said.The Yanofsky brothers started developing toys in the 1980s. After some early success, Hasbro bought their business in 1999, and the brothers were incorporated into Hasbro. The marriage was short lived. Mr. Yanofsky said that the toy giant hadn\u2019t been willing to take the risks he wanted, but that they had parted amicably.The brothers eventually bought back their business, then sold it to another public company and then took it private again.Over the decades, Mr. Yanofsky has watched as the industry consolidated and retailers struggled. (Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy in September.) The rise of social media \u2014 where toys can be instantly validated or just as quickly panned \u2014 has raised the stakes for companies like WowWee.\u201cThere are less shades of gray,\u201d Mr. Yanofsky said. \u201cYou either fail or you succeed.\u201dAnne Marie Kehoe, the high-ranking toy executive, is Walmart\u2019s real-life Santa Claus. She plays a big role in determining what millions of children will get for Christmas.Ms. Kehoe knew right away that the Fingerling would be a hit.\u201cThis monkey creates an emotional connection right in front of your face,\u201d Ms. Kehoe said in an interview this month. But it is sales potential, not emotion, that drives her decisions. Ms. Kehoe views even a wacky toy like the Fingerling through the lens of a retailer with troves of data on what customers are willing to buy, and at what price.\u201cIt\u2019s such an art and a science,\u2019\u2019 she said.WowWee\u2019s wooing of Walmart began in June 2016 when Ms. Wiseman flew to Bentonville to pitch the Fingerlings.Walmart was sold almost instantly on the toy\u2019s appeal, but the price was a problem. WowWee had originally planned on selling the Fingerling for $20, but the giant retailer was insistent: About $15 was the magic number. Drop $5 from the price and Walmart would buy as many as 10 times more Fingerlings.Walmart had been doing this for decades \u2014 pushing down the price of paper towels, toothbrushes, avocados and now robotic monkeys in order to sell as many as possible.Back in Montreal, the WowWee executives debated the price cut; it would mean sacrificing significant profit on each monkey.\u201cIt was pure margin,\u201d Mr. Sufer recalled.Ms. Wiseman pleaded with the team. In the past, WowWee had stood firm on keeping a higher price, only to mark down the toys later when they didn\u2019t sell.\u201cI said, \u2018I am telling you, I don\u2019t want to fight this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman recalled. \u201cThey are saying it for a reason. They know.\u201dThe price was set at roughly $15.In July, Walmart invited hundreds of children to a convention center to play with a range of new toys, including the Fingerling.Based on the children\u2019s feedback, the retailer named the Fingerling one of its 25 top-rated toys for the holidays and purchased more monkeys.When Fingerlings hit stores across the United States in August, Maya Vallee-Wagner, 7, was overcome with emotion.\u201cFingerlings,\u201d Maya said, through sobs. \u201cThey\u2019re in stores. I am so happy.\u201d\u201cThis made my life,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said of the video.The video was a marketing coup, just as WowWee was launching its social media push \u2014 an effort that in many ways resembled the rollout of a Hollywood movie.Gone are the days when a toy company could simply blitz Saturday morning cartoons with ads.WowWee focused much of its effort on YouTube, where children go to watch other children play with toys in a phenomenon called \u201cunboxing\u201dThe toy company sent Fingerlings to key \u201cinfluencers\u201d on YouTube \u2014 two preschool \u201cbesties\u201d who make videos about their trips to a playground and a skinny girl with faded fingernail polish who publishes daily posts about toys. Some influencers were paid to promote the monkeys; others did it for fun.Mackenzie Ziegler, a dancer with more 1.7 million YouTube subscribers, and her friend Lauren wrapped multiple monkeys around their fingers and mugged for the camera.Not long after the social media push in August, the monkeys were basically sold out everywhere, and WowWee was able to pull back on its marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful problem when your demand outstrips supply,\u201d said Mr. Gottlieb, the toy analyst.But managing supply can be a delicate balancing act. If WowWee fails to deliver enough Fingerlings by Christmas, it could miss the moment when the fad reaches its peak, or alienate desperate parents who feel manipulated by the hype.\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair,\u201d one woman posted on Facebook. \u201cPeople work and no one has time to stalk\u201d toy stores.Last year, there was a run on Hatchimals, furry birds that hatch from an egg, causing shortages. Parents complained that when they did manage to get their hands on the birds, some failed to hatch on Christmas morning. \u201cMy four-year-old is gutted,\u201d a father wrote on Twitter.WowWee ramped up shipments of Fingerlings in October and November \u2014 way ahead of the number of Hatchimals that were shipped to the United States at this time last year, according to data supplied by Panjiva. Retailers say Fingerlings are being bought up as quickly as they can be stocked.WowWee executives are confident the Fingerling\u2019s popularity will live on past Christmas, but the company\u2019s designers are already pitching their next big toy for 2018.\u201cOur lives are at the whim of 5- to 9-year olds,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky\u2019s son Michael, vice president of sales at WowWee. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives.

Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won\u2019t have any board seats there.What Robert Iger of Disney has to say We\u2019re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we\u2019re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\u2022 The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\u2022 The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\u2022 A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\u2022 A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\u2022 The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\u2022 A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\u2022 A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill\u2019s treatmentThe tax flyaroundWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here\u2019s what Ms. Yellen said:\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out.

Congress suspended the limit through Dec.8, 2017. However, the debt limit will be reset on Dec. 9, and the Treasury Department will then have to begin taking its usual \u201cextraordinary measures.\u201d Unless the debt ceiling is raised, the government will run out of money next spring, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

{"Headline": "Tesla the Car Is a Household Name. Long Ago, So Was Nikola Tesla.", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Tesla is an electric car. Just about everybody knows that.But it is less widely known that the car was named for Nikola Tesla, an electrical engineer who was once renowned as the prototype of a genius inventor.While Tesla\u2019s star began to fade long ago, Elon Musk has contributed to something of a Nikola Tesla revival.In the age of Edison, Westinghouse, Marconi and J. P. Morgan, Tesla was a giant of innovation because of his contributions in the fields of electricity, radio and robotics.\u201cIt\u2019s a sociological fact that Elon Musk took the Tesla name and launched Nikola Tesla into the stratosphere,\u201d says Marc Seifer, the author of \u201cWizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla.\u201d \u201cTesla\u2019s risen to the surface again, and now he\u2019s getting his due.\u201dIn 1884, Tesla came to New York to work for Thomas Edison with the hope that Edison would help finance and develop a Tesla invention, an alternating-current motor and electrical system.But Edison was instead investing in highly inefficient direct-current (D.C.) systems, and he had Tesla re-engineer a D.C. power plant on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan. The men soon parted company over a financial dispute.But George Westinghouse provided funding for Tesla\u2019s A.C. induction motors and devices, which soon came to dominate manufacturing and urban life. Unlike the D.C. motors of the time, Tesla\u2019s motors didn\u2019t create sparks or require expensive permanent magnets to operate. Instead, they used a rotating magnetic field that used power more efficiently in a basic design that is still the core of most electric motors.Tesla developed radio technology and tested it from 1892 through 1894. He called radio an \u201coscillator\u201d through which electricity is converted into high-frequency radio waves, enabling energy, sound and other transmissions over great distances.He envisioned a system that could transmit not only radio but also electricity across the globe. After successful experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899, Tesla began building what he called a global \u201cWorld System\u201d near Shoreham on Long Island, hoping to power vehicles, boats and aircraft wirelessly. Ultimately, he expected that anything that needed electricity would get it from the air much as we receive transmitted data, sound and images on smartphones. But he ran out of money, and J. P. Morgan Jr., who had provided financing, turned off the spigot.Tesla\u2019s ambitions outstripped his financing. He didn\u2019t focus on radio as a stand-alone technology. Instead, he conceived of entire systems, even if they were decades ahead of the time and not financially feasible.\u201cHe proved that you could send power a short distance,\u201d said Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Center. \u201cBut sending power a long distance is still proving to be a hurdle. It would be monumental if it could be done.\u201dAnother Tesla invention combined radio with a remote-control device. We\u2019d now call it a robotic drone.An innovation in the boat\u2019s circuitry \u2014 his \u201clogic gate\u201d \u2014 became an essential steppingstone to semiconductors.Tesla\u2019s tub-shaped, radio-controlled craft heralded the birth of what he called a \u201cteleautomaton\u201d; later, the world would settle on the word robot. We can see his influence in devices ranging from \u201csmart\u201d speakers like Amazon\u2019s Echo to missile-firing drone aircraft.Tesla proposed the development of torpedoes well before World War I. These weapons eventually emerged in another form \u2014 launched from submarines.Tesla failed to fully collaborate with well-capitalized industrial entities after World War I. His supreme abilities to conceptualize and create entire systems weren\u2019t enough for business success. He didn\u2019t manage to build successful alliances with those who could finance, build and scale up his creations.Tesla\u2019s achievements were awesome but incomplete. He created the A.C. energy system and the basics of radio communication and robotics but wasn\u2019t able to bring them all to fruition. His life shows that even for a brilliant inventor, innovation doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. It requires a broad spectrum of talents and skills. And lots of capital.An earlier version of this article misstated who named the carmaker Tesla after the inventor Nikola Tesla. It was Martin Eberhard, one of the company\u2019s founders, not Elon Musk, another founder and the current chief executive.Advertisement"}

As of midday, it was up about 19 percent.Remember that the VIX tracks investor expectations of how volatile stock markets will be in the month ahead. The possibility that Mr. Flynn could implicate senior White House officials in Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation would certainly throw the markets into high uncertainty.Major stock indexes have pulled back today as well, despite the tax news. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index was down nearly 1 percent at 2,622.12, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down a more modest 0.6 percent, at 24,120.72.Two Republican senators who had previously opposed the bill for its treatment of so-called pass-through businesses, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, now say they will vote for the legislation.The Senate tax bill allows pass-through owners to deduct 17.4 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes. Republicans were planning to increase the deduction to 20 percent to address the concerns over how pass-through owners were being treated by the bill.Now, the deduction is to be raised to 23 percent, an aide to Mr. Daines said.The remaining holdouts include Susan Collins of Maine and several senators concerned about the bill\u2019s effect on the deficit.How Republican leaders are proposing to find at least $400 billion in new revenue\u2022 Slowly raising corporate rates above 20 percentThe big problemAides say they still hope to bring all 52 Republicans to yes. But it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to find ways to raise as much as $500 billion in revenue overnight, and raising taxes could lose other members.Worth notingThe tax flyaroundProsecutors have listed \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d as a potential asset that could be seized from the convicted hedge fund manager.A recap of the history of the controversial album:\u2022 Only one copy of it reportedly exists.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedShares of Blue Apron have stumbled since its initial public offering in June.

{"Headline": "Dick Gregory, Legendary Comic, Put Civil Rights Above All Else", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: \u201cI ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE. LET NOT ANYONE STOP YOU.\u201dWiretaps, beatings, jail and a gunshot didn\u2019t stop Gregory \u2014 nor did fame and money. He claimed he briefly earned more than Frank Sinatra, entertaining on his terms \u2014 \u201cflatfoot,\u201d as he liked to say, not dancing and singing but speaking directly about racism. He was the first African-American stand-up to gain crossover fame, and it didn\u2019t soften his act. (On his first album, in 1961, responding to a heckler, he says, \u201cTrying to get you to shut up is like trying to explain integration to a lynch mob.\u201d) Hugh Hefner booked him at the Playboy Club. An appearance on \u201cThe Jack Paar Show\u201d in 1961 was followed by top billing at the best clubs, and then big money poured in. Gregory commented on his new role: \u201cYou been reading these local papers, calling me the Negro Mort Sahl. You have to read the Congo papers and see where they\u2019re calling Mort Sahl the white Dick Gregory.\u201d The stand-up W. Kamau Bell says: \u201cThat line about Ginger Rogers did everything Astaire did, but backwards? Dick Gregory did everything that Lenny Bruce did, but black.\u201d In fact, he did more than Bruce.In 1962, Medgar Evers asked Gregory to speak at voter-registration rallies in Mississippi, and he gave himself to the movement from then on. He used his celebrity to draw the press, whose attention helped protect the crowds. (One F.B.I. report on a rally at the United Packinghouse Workers hall in Chicago noted \u201ca combo and a girl singer\u201d \u2014 which Gregory said was \u201cthe trick we used to get you all here.\u201d Then he added, referring to campaign work, \u201cNow we\u2019re going to ask you to work hard through the summer.\u201d) Steve Jaffe, his publicist for over 50 years, says he can\u2019t count the times he watched Gregory cancel gigs and head off to a march over the desperate begging of his agent. \u201cHe lived his life not trying to sustain a career,\u201d says Edward Schmitt, his biographer. \u201cDistilling the news and making connections. That was not just his method. It was his mind.\u201d Gregory used humor to communicate the risks that he and others were taking with their bodies. \u201cJust got back from Mississippi,\u201d he says on his 1964 album, \u201cRunning for President\u201d (something he did, along with running for mayor of Chicago). \u201cI realized Mississippi is probably the only state in the whole wide world where a fair trial is considered something primitive. I mean, in all honesty, you\u2019ve got a lot of Northern cops that will shoot first and ask questions later. But in Mississippi, they shoot first, second, third, fourth. ... \u201dGregory, who was a competitive runner in high school and college, pushed his body onto other front lines: He stopped drinking and smoking. He became a vegetarian, then a vegan, and he fasted against the Vietnam War. He ran marathons and extreme distances \u2014 one from New York to Los Angeles, 50 miles a day \u2014 to highlight world hunger. He offered himself as the subject for a study of a 70-day fast to understand the process of malnutrition. Concerned with high rates of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure among African-Americans, he created and marketed a plant-based diet. Muhammad Ali, training for his third heavyweight title, brought him on as his nutritionist. Gregory was a conspiracy theorist of singular commitment, as he was singular in most everything else he did; he obsessively studied the Kennedy and King assassinations.Even after Gregory stopped performing in comedy clubs in the mid-70s, he often worked 300 dates a year at colleges. He wanted young people to recognize their unstoppable power. The talks \u201cwere billed like lectures, but were entertainment,\u201d Jaffe says. On airplanes he took to those engagements, the flight attendants knew to take him a garbage bag for his newspaper clippings. \u201cHe would grab and read anything he could get his hands on,\u201d says Christian Gregory, one of Gregory\u2019s 11 children. \u201cThat was his research for the show.\u201d Information was slippery, and it needed moral framing, but you could get ideas to people through comedy. To Christian, it was \u201clike watching a surgeon with a scalpel to watch my father with the newspaper with a highlighter, to gut them and get the funny out.\u201d His son explained that his father\u2019s large, serious eyes would scan the text for signs of racism, \u201clooking for the code words.\u201d When he found a turn of phrase or a fact that could help him make his case, he would say, \u201cThere\u2019s the trick, right there.\u201dIn a documentary in production by Andre Gaines, Gregory explains in a radio interview \u2014 once again \u2014 why fighting for justice trumped show business. \u201cIt\u2019s just \u2014 I liked what I felt,\u201d he says. You can hear the good feeling in his voice \u2014 one still alive on 16 albums and as undaunted on the page. As he wrote in one of his many books: \u201cThe freedom of black folks has always outweighed my life as a comic.\u201dAdrian Nicole LeBlanc, an independent journalist and a MacArthur fellow, is completing a book on standup comedy.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of Chicago\u2019s Playboy Club in the 1960s. It is not the case that the club was racially segregated at that time.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1933None of it compensates for the lack of a man\u2019s touch. The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

Instagram and Facebook monitor our activity and send us targeted, shoppable ads that allow us to buy items with a click. Influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers are paid by brands to wear and write about clothing and accessories in ways that encourage viewers to make purchases. Amazon now sells nearly everything: wedding gowns, car tires, diapers.Many designers are forgoing traditional seasonality and taking a \u201csee now, buy now\u201d approach to sales, allowing customers to buy items as soon as they appear on the runway. All these changes can feel unsettling.What do you feel is the most important first connection to make with a potential customer?The first thing someone who comes to buy something asks is \u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d because fashion is all about newness. It\u2019s about having something very special that is very specific for you \u2014 to make your own. I design for the woman who desires something feminine, luxurious and special, but that also fits her modern lifestyle.What are some of the biggest evolutions happening in fashion right now?The digital world has changed the way people view fashion. Social media, Instagram, Facebook have never been more relevant in telling the brand story. Years ago, fashion was something very few people were involved in; now it\u2019s everywhere. With the internet, anyone can see the shows while they\u2019re happening. For example, I have an Instagram for the Carolina Herrera house that gives people exclusive access into the atelier and design process. It allows people to be more informed about the clothes.Fashion is a dream that suddenly has to become reality. You have to wear it, which is why I always say that fashion is art in movement. It changes all the time and it changes very quickly now with each collection, but that doesn\u2019t change its allure and mystery.What remains consistent?I\u2019ve always made clothes that make women look beautiful and feel feminine. Elegance never goes out of style. I always say that I\u2019m not working in the fashion business; I\u2019m working in the beauty business. I want women who wear Herrera to really feel confident in what they are wearing. Style isn\u2019t just what you wear, but how you wear it. It\u2019s a personal thing that is reflected in the way you live and arrange your house, your taste in books and art, and the personal stamp you give to everything you touch.Why is New York so important to you?New York is a very important place for fashion. I am Venezuelan, but I am an American designer because I started designing in New York over 35 years ago. It\u2019s always been important for me to have an in-house atelier and to support the city and the garment district that has supported the brand.New York is a constant source of inspiration. There is always something happening \u2014 its energy is contagious. There is inspiration everywhere if you are open to it.You\u2019ve spoken about the importance of design integrity and style. Are you concerned about maintaining pace with current trends?I don\u2019t believe in trends. If everyone follows trends, then we will all look the same, and what fun is that? Fashion should be an expression of yourself. I\u2019ve always stayed true to the style codes of the house and have kept my eyes open \u2014 beauty has a way of finding you that way.And yet you\u2019ve managed to stay so current. How?This is a 36-year-old house. A designer has to stay true to who they are and what their house is while creating clothes for today. We are in another era. I cannot sit still and do the same things that I did in the \u201980s or in the \u201990s.The landscape has totally changed. The world is completely different because of technology and global access to information. Fashion is everywhere now \u2014 it\u2019s on the phone or computer, it\u2019s in television, it\u2019s in films. What is produced has to be something new in the consumer\u2019s eyes.It\u2019s a huge challenge, but it\u2019s also very exciting because nobody knows whether it\u2019s magical, it\u2019s madness or it\u2019s beautiful.

{"Headline": "UnitedHealth Buys Large Doctors Group as Lines Blur in Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn another example of the blurring boundaries in the health care industry, UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, said on Wednesday that it is buying a large physician group to add to its existing roster of 30,000 doctors.UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum unit will acquire the physician group from DaVita, a large for-profit chain of dialysis centers, for about $4.9 billion in cash, subject to regulatory approval. DaVita operates nearly 300 clinics across a half-dozen states, including California and Florida.With the purchase, UnitedHealth is increasingly moving into the direct delivery of medical care.\u201cCombining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways,\u201d Larry C. Renfro, Optum\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.Analysts praised the move as keeping with UnitedHealth\u2019s broader goal of building a large ambulatory care business.\u201cThe asset is strongly synergistic\u201d with the company\u2019s overall \u201cmission and strategy,\u201d Ana Gupte, an analyst for Leerink, told investors after the deal was announced.To change how people receive medical care, particularly when managing chronic, and costly, diseases like diabetes and asthma, the parties \u201care going to have to reorganize,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\u201cThere\u2019s no chance that the existing companies, be they hospital or insurers, have the right configuration of assets to be successful\u201d at turning health care into a business where the parties are able to produce better outcomes at a lower cost, he said.What is striking about the recent combinations, Professor Garthwaite said, is that insurers are the ones seeking to integrate the delivery of care into their operations, as opposed to a large health system like Kaiser Permanente, the health maintenance organization based in California, directing members to its hospitals and doctors. \u201cFor a long time, we thought there was a world in which Kaiser was the future,\u201d he said.But Kaiser Permanente has proved to be mostly an exception to the rule. Several large systems began offering health plans under the Affordable Care Act, only to end up losing money and getting out of the business.Aetna and UnitedHealth appear to be trying to develop their own in-house network of doctors to try to change how care is delivered. UnitedHealth, which already operates a large pharmacy-benefit manager and a variety of health care services through its Optum unit, is among the most diversified and most successful insurers.The acquisition of DaVita Medical Group, which includes such high profile organizations as HealthCare Partners and the Everett Clinic, is the latest move by UnitedHealth to expand into the realm of delivering medical care as a way of reducing costs. The company already operates medical practices in Southern California and elsewhere, and it owns nearly 250 MedExpress urgent-care clinics. The company says the clinics offer much of the same care available at a hospital emergency room but at a significantly lower cost.Insurers are also increasingly experimenting with different methods of paying for care and attempting to provide better oversight of potentially expensive chronic conditions like diabetes or heart failure. To date, Aetna and Cigna have favored joint ventures with large health groups.Consumers could also see their choice of doctor or pharmacy sharply limited under these arrangements as insurers attempt to steer patients into the groups over which they have the most control. Both Aetna and UnitedHealth insist their goal is to develop a new model of care that will be available to people outside their respective health plans, and Optum says it now works with more than 80 health plans.Even if insurers succeed in lowering medical costs as a result of the new ventures, economists and other experts warn that shareholders, not consumers, could benefit unless the lower costs yield lower prices for coverage. There must be sufficient competition among insurers for consumers to benefit, Professor Garthwaite said.\u201cYou need three, four or five insurance companies trying to pull that strategy off,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really hard to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He then sexually assaulted me. I told the truth to the authorities then, and I have been telling it, unaltered, for more than 20 years.Why is it that Harvey Weinstein and other accused celebrities have been cast out by Hollywood, while Allen recently secured a multimillion-dollar distribution deal with Amazon, greenlit by former Amazon Studios executive Roy Price before he was suspended over sexual misconduct allegations?

At 87, Mr. Aldrin, who made history in 1969 when he set foot on the moon, has hung on to his plain-as-folk charm and easy, infectious enthusiasm.Those attractions may well factor into pop culture\u2019s resurrected romance with the pioneering astronaut, who raised his profile in recent years with guest spots on shows including \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d and an appearance at the Summer Olympics in Rio last year.

Wilson, a robotics engineer and the author of science fiction novels including \u201cA Clockwork Dynasty\u201d and \u201cRobogenesis.\u201d In the world of sci-fi publishing, he said, there has been tendency to forsake gloom-and-doom scenarios in favor of more exhilaratingly upbeat fare. The objective, it seems, is to revive the optimism of the late 1960s, when the promise of adventure and discovery \u2014 and the reality of a lunar landing \u2014 spawned a generalized blue-sky optimism.That mood contrasts mightily with the one of the moment. In a currently divisive, often chaotic sociopolitical climate, \u201cspace exploration offers a vision of escape that\u2019s really appealing,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cIf reality is dystopia, why shouldn\u2019t our dreams turn utopic?\u201dIt\u2019s a concept that seems to have wings. And it goes some way toward explaining why a novel like \u201cArtemis,\u201d an account of life on a lunar colony by Andy Weir (the author of \u201cThe Martian\u201d), quickly entered the New York Times best seller list. Or how \u201cStar Wars: the Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in movie theaters next week, came to be one of this year\u2019s most anticipated releases.Interstellar travel has proved at least as intoxicating in the rarefied realms of art and style. Late last year, the sculptor Tom Sachs installed a interplanetary launch station at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, complete with space-suited astronauts and a plywood mock spaceship destined for a simulated mission to the moon. Elements of Mr. Sachs\u2019s D.I.Y. project were highlighted in an auction of space artifacts last summer at Sotheby\u2019s.Fashion is celebrating its own return to the galaxies. Past expeditions included those of Karl Lagerfeld, Rick Owens and Christophe Decarnin of Balmain, who nearly a decade ago cast a wistful backward glance at the swashbuckling universe of space-traveling superheroes, a universe earlier explored by Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges, Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin.Somehow their vision persists. This year Alessandro Michele of Gucci introduced fall 2017 advertising images of U.F.O.s, and beam-me-up-Scottie teleportation platforms. Mr. Lagerfeld, in his fall show, offered the spectacle of a simulated rocket launch to highlight a collection of sparkle tights, dresses and cap-toe boots, and a silver Mylar space blanket.Last spring, Stuart Vevers of Coach, no laggard in this latest fashion space race, unveiled a retro-futuristic capsule collection of NASA-themed handbags, light jackets and sweatshirts. \u201cThe collection is very nostalgic,\u201d Mr. Vevers said at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the time of the space program that just gives this feeling of possibility.\u201d His cosmic references, he said, \u201care symbolic of a moment of ultimate American optimism and togetherness.\u201dMr. Aldrin, who predicts settlements on Mars by 2040, has loftier aims, some founded on his indelible recollections. \u201cYou\u2019ll always remember the times when you launch and when you\u2019re in a coasting condition \u2014 zero gravity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is the view of other spacecraft that you\u2019re close to, and, of course, the landing, touching down on soil that in hundreds of thousands of years has been ground to a little fine dust.\u201cYou can\u2019t find anything like that here on Earth. It is exciting to see something that is so absolutely unreproducible.\u201dHe hopes to inspire a youthful generation, \u201cobsessed,\u201d in his phrase, with \u201cthe short-term payoff,\u201d to participate in a larger, more ennobling scheme. While not technically suited for space exploration, his backpacks and solar-panel flight jackets serve metaphorical function, he said, to remind wearers that they are but fragments in a whole, \u201cmembers of a team, part of something bigger than themselves.\u201dMr. Ben-David of Sprayground wants to share in that dream. But for now, he said: \u201cMy goal is to make the ultimate backpack. And the ultimate backpack is a jet pack.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Will the G.O.P.\u2019s tax plan pay off?\u2022 A top European court dealt Uber a stinging blow.\u2022 How will FedEx use the cash it gets from the Republican tax overhaul?\u2022 With the tax bill close to becoming law, what Republicans will do next. \u2022 And Bitcoin falls as quickly as it rises.\u201cCongress, working closely with the President, took a monumental step to bring taxes paid by U.S. businesses in line with the rest of the industrialized world,\u201d said Randall Stephenson, AT&T chairman and CEO. \u201cThis tax reform will drive economic growth and create good-paying jobs. In fact, we will increase our U.S. investment and pay a special bonus to our U.S. employees.\u201dAt a news conference Wednesday, President Trump cited AT&T\u2019s move.Liz Moyer at CNBC reports:\u201cFifth Third Bancorp will pay more than 13,500 employees a bonus and raise the minimum wage of its workforce to $15 an hour after the passage of the Republican tax plan that will cut the bank\u2019s corporate tax rate...Nearly 3,000 workers will see hourly wages rise to $15. The $1,000 one-time bonus is expected to be paid by the end of this year.\u201cWells Fargo, meanwhile, also said it would be boosting its minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour, which was prompted by the tax plan. The San Francisco-based bank also said it would target $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year.\u201dRepublicans are betting it will.\u2022 In being classified as a transport service instead of an online platform, Uber must comply with local rules that govern taxis.\u2022 It doesn\u2019t block Uber from operating in any countries where the company currently operates.\u2022 But it doesn\u2019t let Uber move forward with any so-called peer-to-peer services in which anyone with a driver\u2019s license and a car can use its app to pick up customers.The ruling is expected to set a precedent for how Uber will be allowed to operate across the E.U., including in a separate pending case at Europe\u2019s highest court involving a complaint by a French taxi association against Uber. A decision in that case is expected sometime next year, and it will likely cement demands that the ride-booking company comply with Europe\u2019s transport standards.A service that connects, by means of mobile telephone software, potential passengers with drivers offering individual urban transport on demand, where the provider of the service exerts control over the key conditions governing the supply of transport made within that context, in particular the price, does not constitute an information society service within the meaning of those provisions.Can Uber appeal?No. But here\u2019s what a representative for the company said:This ruling will not change things in most E.U. countries where we already operate under transportation law. However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new C.E.O. has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across EuropeWhere in Europe Uber doesn\u2019t operate at all right now\u2022 Denmark\u2022 Latvia\u2022 Hungary\u2022 Slovenia\u2022 BulgariaThe big questions\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedKhosrowshahi\u2019s first few months on the job convinced him that he had to take a different role than the one he played at Expedia. Uber required a CEO who was more a public face of the company. Khosrowshahi was meeting with regulators in London who had revoked Uber\u2019s license when he had to work with the board of directors over a deal for SoftBank Group Corp. to invest in the company. Later, he visited Brazil to win over lawmakers there.Mr. Harford is the second big hire of Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is putting his stamp on the company. In October, he appointed Tony West as chief legal officer. Mr. West had been general counsel at PepsiCo. Uber still needs to name a chief financial officer.Mr. Harford is someone that Mr. Khosrowshahi is familiar with, having worked and competed with him over the past decade-plus.\u2022 Mr. Harford was an executive at Expedia when Mr. Khosrowshahi became C.E.O. of the company in 2005.\u2022 The pair then competed when Mr. Harford was named C.E.O. at Orbitz, one of Expedia\u2019s main rivals, in 2009.\u2022 In 2015, Mr. Harford sold Orbitz to Expedia for $1.6 billion.\u2022 Mr. Harford has been an adviser at Uber since October.\u201cIf tax reform is enacted, we expect our uses of cash from tax savings would include, optimizing CapEx to capture the benefits of 100% expensing to further grow the business and create even more upward mobility for our team members.\u201cFunding our pension plans beyond our current forecast. Increasing the dividend as our board may approve. Continuing our stock repurchase program at our current modest levels, and investing in M&A where it makes sense.\u201cU.S. GDP could increase materially next year as a result of U.S. tax reform. If this occurs, we would likely increase capital expenditures and hiring to accommodate the additional volumes triggered from this incremental GDP growth.\u201dHis comments break somewhat from the narrative that has developed around the Republican tax overhaul. Proponents of the bill argue that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent will lead corporate America to invest more in their businesses and hire more workers. Critics counter that companies will spend their cash windfall on share buybacks and dividends, not on growing their businesses.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201d Mr. Cohn asked.Shares of the online retailer are down 12 percent premarket after the company\u2019s first earnings as a public company fell short of Wall Street\u2019s hopes.While earnings and sales just slightly surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations, gross margins were hampered by investments into new categories, falling nearly 3 percentage points. In the near term, Stitch Fix said it continues to expect profit margins to decline as those investments ramp up and it invests in new categories.Stitch Fix\u2019s stock had gained 65 percent since its initial public offering last month. Stitch Fix priced its initial public offering at $15 a share, valuing the company at about $1.5 billion.\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere\u2019s what Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, emailed us about the bill\u2019s passing:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be a major breakthrough for America\u2019s long-term competitiveness and prosperity. For decades, American workers have been paying the price for our archaic corporate tax system. The reforms in this bill will enable America\u2019s companies, which are our job creators, to be better engines of growth and prosperity, and it will attract job-creating investment in the U.S. by foreign companies.The tax flyaroundWithin the past day alone, the digital currency has plummeted from $18,385 to $16,626. It\u2019s a timely reminder that when one chooses to jump in on an investing trend/fad, nerves of steel are required.\u201cA short-term correction was definitely on the cards,\u201d said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see some recovery by the end of the week. To be honest, I only see this as the short-term volatility we were all expecting to see anyway.\u201dThey have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum. The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which most likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make each of them a billionaire.HNA\u2019s efforts to cut its enormous debt load has led to some unintended \u2014 and probably unwelcome \u2014 consequences. Namely, that one of its portfolio companies now counts a major activist investor among its shareholders.Elliott was able to get hold of the stock because HNA recently took out a so-called \u201cequity collar\u201d facility, under which it lent a stake in the Swiss company to a bank in exchange for funding. This collar facility allows the Chinese company to remain a shareholder on paper even though it no longer directly holds the shares. But the bank that provided the collar sold the underlying Dufry stake to funds, including Elliott, to hedge its position, according to the people familiar with the matter.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like this sick perversion I have, catching thieves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His response:What would happen to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sonsThis is where it gets interesting. If there\u2019s a deal, James Murdoch, who\u2019s currently Fox\u2019s C.E.O., could become a senior executive at Disney, with a portfolio that would likely include oversight of Sky and Star. Several news reports have said that James Murdoch could eventually succeed Bob Iger as Disney\u2019s C.E.O., though they cautioned that there\u2019s no formal agreement.His brother, Lachlan, would stay to oversee what remains of Fox, which would include Fox News Channel, the FS1 sports channel and the company\u2019s broadcast network.At times, James has felt like a C.E.O. in title only, according to some people who know him. These people say James was never keen about the setup, is ready for a new chapter in his career and has sometimes been on a different page from his father and brother.Critics\u2019 corner____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Shanghai, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________Among those discussed in the articleMaking cameo appearancesThe latest in other misconduct newsDoug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post on the company\u2019s website said:\u201cWhy the change? Because of our growing presence as a retailer who serves customers no matter how they choose to shop.\u201cChanging our corporate name from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to Walmart Inc. is just a symbol of how customers are shopping us today and how they\u2019ll increasingly shop us in the future.

It also offered a glimpse of how new advances in artificial intelligence and facial recognition can be used to track citizens, and how they have become widely accepted.Investors and analysts say China\u2019s unabashed fervor for collecting such data, combined with its huge population, could eventually give its artificial intelligence companies an edge over American ones. If Silicon Valley is marked by a libertarian streak, China\u2019s vision offers something of an antithesis, one where tech is meant to reinforce and be guided by the steady hand of the state.More in Chinese techSome employees, including a few of the bureau\u2019s top officials, have welcomed their new leader.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it.

Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass.

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor.

Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California.

{"Headline": "Beware, Italy. Santa the Invader Is Coming.", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 Don Emilio is the parish priest at the cathedral of my hometown, Crema, 30 miles from Milan. He just hates Father Christmas (Babbo Natale if you\u2019re Italian). The priest doesn\u2019t simply ignore Father Christmas or disapprove of him: He hates him with a vengeance. A while ago he came over and rang my doorbell, and he was not a happy trouper: He\u2019d noticed a brightly lit Santa Claus clinging to my balcony, clambering toward the window of the floor above.My family thought it was cute, but Don Emilio didn\u2019t. He thinks Babbo Natale is an interloper and says as much in church, thundering from the pulpit now that Christmas is nigh, accusing him of elbowing out the infant Jesus \u2014 not from a manger in a Nativity scene, but from the minds of Italian children. Who brings gifts? Good old Santa, not a newborn, no matter how sweet he is. And we know how pragmatic children are.Let me say that Don Emilio has a point. We Italians tend to be xenophiles all year round, not just at Christmas. But during the festive season, our fascination with other cultures \u2014 above all with American culture \u2014 just rockets sky high.You may well say, \u201cBut Santa Claus isn\u2019t American!\u201d Indeed. He\u2019s inspired by St. Nicholas of Myra, in Anatolia, a fourth-century Christian bishop. The character then got a Dutch name, entered Germanic folklore, helped the cause of the Reformation in England (the infant Jesus was considered papist), became patron saint of Russia.Later on, as we all know, he moved to Lapland, hired Scandinavian reindeers and bought a flying sledge. Not even Elon Musk owns such a cool vehicle. And Jeff Bezos, who\u2019s testing drones to deliver packages right to his customers\u2019 doorsteps, ought to pay royalties to Santa Claus. True, with Amazon, it\u2019s one click; with Santa, you need snail mail (no credit card, though, since most 5-year-olds don\u2019t carry one).Santa is an international character, you may conclude. His big white beard and big red suit, however, were products of 20th-century American advertising, given a global lift by Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But there\u2019s no doubt that this elderly foreign gentleman, who stubbornly refuses to retire and seems immune to arthritis or rheumatism, has ousted the baby Jesus. In Italy, at least.Let\u2019s face it. Santa Claus is a quaint but powerful invader. You may think he has an exhausting seasonal job \u2014 Italians love an open-ended contract, which has no set date of expiration \u2014 but the man in red moves a lot of money. Italy is the third-largest Christmas spender in the European Union, after Spain and Britain. Italians are expected to spend 528 euros ($628) on average for Christmas, according to the farmers association Coldiretti. About a quarter of that sum will go for food (capitone in Rome, panettone in Milan, spumante wine everywhere). As much will be spent on travel and a tenth on movies and concerts.But the largest slice \u2014 about 40 percent \u2014 will go for presents. And most of those will end up in Santa\u2019s spacious sack. That makes Babbo Natale a sort of tycoon, and you never know with those people. They may decide to run for office. Come to think of it, if we shaved off Santa\u2019s beard, dyed his hair and opened a Twitter account for him, we might pop him into the White House and no one would notice the difference. Well, maybe not: Santa is a smart businessman, a communications pro, and he knows his job.He\u2019s also a social and cultural climber. Not only did he get as far as my balcony, but he also scaled the heights of Italian preferences and changed our Christmas customs. Every year, more and more children write letters to Babbo Natale/Santa Claus. When I was a child, in the 1960s, I remember we wrote to Ges\u00f9 Bambino/Infant Jesus, and we ignored those who pointed out that he was too young to read.Almost all advertising and many shop windows today feature bright, red, bold Santas; Nativity scenes, with their soft pastel colors, have all but disappeared from the shopping streets. Where do the ox and the donkey hang out? In more traditional parts of Italy, like the Alps and the Apennines. And in Naples, where the Nativity scenes we call presepi have been a form of art since the 18th century and artisans every year come up with new figurines, taking inspiration from current affairs. (This year\u2019s debutantes are Donald Trump and Obi-Wan Kenobi from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d)Italians don\u2019t have a board game to decide who rules Christmas. But the British do: \u201cPlayers get into two teams \u2014 Team Santa and Team Jesus \u2014 and fight it out through a variety of festively themed puzzles, riddles, jigsaws, building challenges (not easy after a few Christmas sherries) and brain games to win believers,\u201d proclaims the website for a game called Santa vs. Jesus. The Italian Catholic media, including the newspaper Avvenire, owned by the congregation of bishops, have made it clear that such a game is not a good idea.Italy, as usual, is subtler, but no less ferocious. Santa is feared because he is an American icon and has powerful friends. Halloween witches and monsters have obliterated the traditional Giorno dei Defunti (All Souls, Nov. 2) and are bothering St. Lucia, a third-century martyr from Sicily who travels with her little donkey on Dec. 13 to take presents to children who, in northeastern Italy, leave a hay bouquet outside their windows. Santa is also undermining Italy\u2019s Epiphany (Jan. 6) broomstick lady, the Befana, who is about his age, but not as charming.But none of those other peaceful American invaders \u2014 who also benefit from powerful allies like Facebook (narrative), Instagram (images) and Amazon (delivery) \u2014 is as loved and feared as Santa Claus. True, his immense power over media and sales has put the infant Jesus back into his role as the ultimate spiritual model. But the risk of being conquered by the big man in red, for Italy, is still great.There is only one defense left: words. The most famous festive proverb is \u201cNatale con i tuoi, Pasqua con chi vuoi\u201d \u2014 \u201cChristmas with your own; Easter with whom you please.\u201d And the infant Jesus is definitely one of us. Nativity images have been found in fourth-century catacombs in Rome. So, let\u2019s stick to him this Christmas. If Santa wants to come back next spring, he\u2019s welcome. He ought to wear a lighter coat, though. April in Italy is balmy.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

As topics like sexual harassment dominate the national conversation and chief executives weigh in on the ethical and social issues of the day, business schools around the country are hastily reshaping their curriculums with case studies ripped straight from the headlines.At Vanderbilt, there are classes on Uber and \u201cbro\u201d culture. At Stanford, students are studying sexual harassment in the workplace. And at Harvard, the debate encompasses sexism and free speech.\u201cSomething has changed,\u201d said Ed Soule, a professor at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business. \u201cI would be kidding you if I told you there wasn\u2019t a different vibe in the classroom.\u201dThis fall, Professor Soule assigned coursework covering sexual harassment at Uber, how companies like Amazon respond when attacked by Mr. Trump and the social justice protests by N.F.L. players.During one class, students debated whether players should have been more deferential to the wishes of team owners and the league, or whether the league should have supported players more vocally. The conversation grew tense when the topic turned to respect for the national anthem, and Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful response to players who continued to kneel as it was played.\u201cEthics and values have taken on more significance,\u201d Professor Soule said. \u201cIt has to do with all of the things going on in this administration, often things that challenge our understanding of ethics and leadership.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of M.B.A.s who are really passionate about this,\u201d said LaToya Marc, who graduated from Harvard Business School last spring and now works in sales and operations at Comcast. \u201cIt may not affect your bottom line directly, but it needs to be affecting how you make decisions.\u201dStudents also realize that as leaders of increasingly diverse work forces, they will need to understand their employees\u2019 perspectives on national debates, and how corporate decisions affect them.\u201cIt is a shift, absolutely, mostly because all of our companies are just starting to look a lot different,\u201d Ms. Marc said.One way that some business schools are responding is by drawing on the social sciences, like behavioral economics and psychology. The Stanford Graduate School of Business\u2019s ethics class \u2014 taught by two political scientists, one an expert in behavior and the other in game theory \u2014 sounds more like a course in human nature than in finance.A new topic this year is sexual harassment, and how to create a workplace culture in which people feel comfortable reporting it. The Stanford students studied psychological research showing that people are more willing to challenge authority if at least one other person joins them, and discussed ways to encourage such reporting.\u201cIt\u2019s not just how the C.E.O. of Uber was treating women,\u201d Ms. Mandelbaum said. \u201cThe bias is throughout the system.\u201d\u201cWe said, \u2018This is not just a gender issue. It\u2019s a business issue,\u2019\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cIt has marketing implications, legal implications, H.R. implications.\u201dTwo dozen schools have started groups based on the program, including groups called the Manbassadors, for men committed to gender equity in business, at the business schools at Columbia, Dartmouth and Harvard.The goal is \u201cmaking sure that as men we\u2019re very aware of some of the privileges we\u2019re afforded simply because of gender,\u201d said Alen Amini, a third-year student at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a founder of its Manbassadors group.As previously taboo subjects enter the classroom debate, students and professors are still adjusting.At Vanderbilt, Professor Vogus solicited ideas from the class about how Uber might change its ways. One student suggested hiring fewer star engineers and more team players. Another proposed hiring a woman to lead human resources.\u201cWe have a \u2018C.E.-bro\u2019 culture in the technology sector today, but we\u2019ve had \u2018C.E.-bros\u2019 throughout time,\u201d said a student, April Hughes. \u201cEnron was an example of this. All the guys there thought they were smarter than everyone else.\u201dThe class turned testy, however, as students debated whether Uber\u2019s hard-charging culture might have been an asset.\u201cSome of that brashness was actually critical to the company being successful,\u201d said one student, Andrew Bininger.When the Uber conversation turned to gender and power dynamics, a female student suggested that women in the Vanderbilt M.B.A. program had to work harder than their male counterparts.\u201cThe women who do make it to business school are all super strong personalities, whereas the men here can float through without being the cream of the crop,\u201d Natalie Copley said, adding of the women in the class, \u201cThey\u2019re not meek little timid things.\u201dThat drew jeers from the men in the group, and Professor Vogus changed the subject.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Many Unhappy Returns? Online Holiday Shopping\u2019s Big Hangover", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKristina Nicolas will proudly tell you that she\u2019s been doing practically all her shopping online for years now. She will also tell you, in a more exasperated voice, that this has not remotely abbreviated the amount of time she spends going to stores.\u201cIt has become a huge errand and a huge part of my life having to get all this stuff back to where it came from,\u201d said Ms. Nicolas, a stay-at-home mother and former fashion buyer. She receives about 10 to 15 boxes per week of merchandise at her home in Chicago, and returns (or tries to return) about 30 percent.The ease of the task varies.\u201cSometimes it can be returned to the store, but sometimes it cannot,\u201d said Ms. Nicolas, growing louder. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s UPS, or DHL, or FedEx, or however they shipped it, then you have to print up a label, and I never seem to have the right tape.\u201dAnd who has a working printer at home anyway? \u201cI don\u2019t really need one except for this,\u201d said Beth Paholak, a TV producer who has sacrificed a corner of her small apartment in Manhattan to boxes awaiting return. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not buying a printer just for returns.\u201dThe paradox of e-commerce now is that while acquiring items has gotten easier than ever before, exchanging or returning the unwanted ones remains an epic, tyrannical time suck.\u201cI\u2019ve ended up keeping stuff because the return process was such a pain,\u201d said Rob Cromer, an entrepreneur in New York City, using profanity.Likewise, Ms. Nicolas is currently making peace with the fact that the three wooden cutting boards she bought for Thanksgiving, total cost $100, are hers to keep at this point.But while a handful of retailers receive nearly unanimous praise from shoppers for open-ended, friction-free returns of purchases made online (Amazon, Nordstrom, L.L. Bean, Madewell, among others), and many offer more generous policies during the holiday season, plenty still impose tight limitations and draconian requirements that seem designed to either discourage returns or drive traffic into their physical locations.Forever 21 and Shopbop require customers to return items bought online within 30 days, and like Victoria\u2019s Secret, Kohl\u2019s and Rue La La, don\u2019t always pay for shipping (Shopbop offers refunds for items returned within 15 days). Returns to Net-a-Porter must be made within 28 days, and within 14 days for Apple and Barnes & Noble \u2014 a narrow window if you factor in packing and shipping. Many retailers will send multiple items from a single order in separate boxes, each of which could require its own label (and box) in case of return.And while Amazon refunds your money the moment UPS scans your box for return, others make customers wait weeks to see the refund on their credit card \u2014 a period of uncertainty too agonizing for some.\u201cIf I can\u2019t go the store to return something, I won\u2019t make the purchase,\u201d said Lauren Nolte, a marketing executive in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have to make up your mind the second you get the item, then run to the post office or you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d And good luck finding a post office open before or after work.One can also feel sorry for the stores. Returns cost retailers $260 billion in 2015, according to the National Retail Federation. And about 30 percent of items bought online end up being returned, versus 9 percent of items bought in stores.Whether its attempts to discourage online returns will save money or simply drive away customers remains to be seen. \u201cThis is principally a reason why many retailers aren\u2019t making any money,\u201d said Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School and a former chief executive of Sears Canada. E-commerce start-ups have the extra challenge of needing to build loyalty. \u201cThese are new businesses that are just learning what they\u2019re in for,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.The unavoidable shortcomings of online shopping may make a high return rate a necessary part of the process. Trying on clothes isn\u2019t an option, and colors often appear different in person, leading many shoppers to buy an item in multiple sizes or colors with the intention of sending back the misfits.But there is also the growing problem of so-called wardrobing: buying an item to use once knowing it can be returned afterward. The classic example is a prom dress, but generous return policies are luring more people to try bringing back, say, the camcorder they bought to record the prom, too.Some third-party vendors are eager to cash in on the inconvenience of returns. In 2015, two former Nordstrom employees started Happy Returns, a company that operates physical \u201creturn bars\u201d in malls where customers can give back items brought from e-commerce retailers including Everlane, Chubbies and Tradesy for immediate refunds. Happy Returns has 50 locations and expects to open 150 more by the end of 2018.While you wait for a better system to come along, there are steps you can take to cut down on online returns, said Eric Himel, a stylist whose clients include Giuliana Rancic and Kristin Cavallari. \u201cShopping is something you have to be in the right frame of mind for, and you have to dig in and do a little work,\u201d he said. That means no more clicking and buying at midnight, or after a second cocktail, and always taking the time to read reviews, check the fabrication and make yourself aware of return policies.Most important, Mr. Himel advised, remember that clothes modeled by professionals online may not look the same in your mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s like I tell women, \u2018Don\u2019t go shopping with your girlfriend, because they\u2019re always going to say something looks cute on you.\u2019\u201dIf you miss the cut-off dates, you can sell mistakes through secondhand marketplaces like Letgo, Vestiaire Collective or the TheRealReal. You\u2019re not likely to get full price, but getting anything can feel like a triumph (though of course, you still have to pack it up and ship it).\u201cI\u2019ll say to my husband, \u2018See I made money!\u2019\u201d Ms. Nicolas said. \u201cHe says, \u2018No you did not. You lost money today.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Goes Deep With Mobile and Verizon", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith television audiences for the N.F.L. getting smaller, the league\u2019s new digital rights deal with Verizon Communications represents the latest challenge to the traditional media partnerships that for decades have served as the lifeblood for North America\u2019s richest sports league.The deal, which will cost Verizon more than $2 billion during the next five years, gives the telecommunications giant the rights to stream games across its variety of digital media brands, including Yahoo Sports, Complex and go90. In addition, fans no longer have to be Verizon customers to gain access to the games, which they can watch regardless of which company is their mobile provider.CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox currently pay the NFL some $5 billion a year for the rights to televise those games. Those rights help those networks garner top fees from pay television distributors and help those distributors convince subscribers not to cut off their cable subscriptions.Rick Cordella, executive vice president and general manager for digital media at NBC Sports, a unit of the pay television distributor Comcast, said the Verizon deal could help expand the reach for NBC\u2019s advertisers, since fans watching the Verizon stream will see NBC\u2019s inventory of ads.\u201cWe are selling one audience, no matter where they watch our content,\u201d Cordella said.Like previous agreements with Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo, the new Verizon agreement illustrates the N.F.L.\u2019s proclivity to push the envelope to broaden its reach, especially among younger viewers, who may not have a pay television subscription, even if it means potentially angering its television partners as they approach the start of negotiations for new deals.In a statement announcing the deal, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was thrilled to get more deeply involved with digital distribution.\u201cLive N.F.L. action directly on your mobile device \u2014 regardless of carrier \u2014 will give millions of fans additional ways to follow their favorite sport,\u201d Goodell said.Hans Schroeder, an N.F.L. executive in charge of media, believes fans won\u2019t choose to watch on their phones instead of their televisions, but instead will add to the television audience. \u201cWe think this is a very complementary way of growing, engaging and reaching younger fans that will ultimately become longer term viewers,\u201d he said.Since 2010, Verizon mobile customers have been able to stream N.F.L. games for free through the N.F.L. Mobile app.The deal potentially allows Verizon, and the N.F.L., to reach more people, but also does away with what made the previous agreements so lucrative for Verizon: Exclusivity. When signing an extension of the mobile agreement in 2013, Verizon executives said that the number of subscribers the N.F.L. Mobile app helped retain, or add, contributed to the company\u2019s decision to re-sign.Now Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile customers will also be allowed to stream N.F.L. games, as long as they go to Verizon-owned apps or websites with their mobile phones.Over the past few years, Verizon has acquired a spate of digital media companies, including paying more than $9 billion combined to buy AOL and Yahoo, a sign of the company\u2019s growing ambitions at becoming a digital media powerhouse able to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook for advertising dollars.There are some protections for traditional broadcast partners built into the agreement, which does not extend to streaming on tablets or through smart televisions.For the N.F.L., the deal is surely a short-term win. Verizon is paying nearly double the amount of money each year and doesn\u2019t retain exclusivity over the games, though they are adding a number of sponsorship benefits. But long term it seems certain to allow for further erosion of pay television subscriptions, and it will challenge the N.F.L.\u2019s partners in legacy media, who are already facing two straight years of declining ratings.The N.F.L.\u2019s broadcast agreements all expire after the 2022 season. With ratings trending downward and digital rights giants, such as Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, so far balking at paying hundreds of millions, or billions, for sports rights, the N.F.L. could soon be in for a round of tense negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Joseph Nicolosi\u2019s Life Traced the Rise and Fall of the Ex-Gay Movement", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.After each public denunciation of the industry they helped build, Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist who believed that male same-sex attraction was a developmental disorder caused by childhood trauma and gender confusion, called Chambers on the phone. \u201cIf you\u2019ll just come into therapy with me, I will fix this,\u201d Nicolosi insisted. \u201cI will cure this.\u201d But Chambers was happy as he was. \u201cI\u2019d say: \u2018Joe, you can\u2019t promise to cure people. That\u2019s not going to happen, nor do I even want it to happen.\u2019\u201dAs tense as those conversations were, Chambers could never manage to dislike his old friend, a gruff, offbeat New Yorker who could \u201ccuss the wallpaper off the wall\u201d and whose brashness rubbed many people the wrong way. \u201cHe was a prima donna, for sure, but he was also a breath of fresh air\u201d in the conservative Christian world they inhabited, Chambers told me. Nicolosi stood out in many ways, including being Catholic and having no personal connection to L.G.B.T. issues. While many in the ex-gay movement were either struggling with same-sex attractions or had a family member who seemingly was, Nicolosi was ostensibly heterosexual and professed to come at reparative therapy from an intellectual and scientific perspective.He counseled adults and teenagers from his office in Encino, Calif., where the mahogany shelves featured several of his books, including \u201cA Parent\u2019s Guide to Preventing Homosexuality\u201d and \u201cHealing Homosexuality.\u201d (They are jam-packed with falsehoods and absurdities, including passages like \u201cTwo men can never take in each other in a full and open manner\u201d and \u201cGrowing up straight is not something that just happens. It requires good parenting.\u201d)One of Nicolosi\u2019s teenage patients in the late 1990s was Gabriel Arana, who at 14 agreed to his parents\u2019 request that he try reparative therapy. \u201cNicolosi had a very clear narrative coming in about what my life was about,\u201d Arana recalls. \u201cMy mom was controlling, and my dad was underinvolved. And I overidentified with my mom because I didn\u2019t feel masculine, and that was the source of my attractions.\u201d Arana didn\u2019t mind his weekly sessions with Nicolosi, who he remembers as warm and nonshaming, even when Arana confessed that the therapy didn\u2019t appear to be working. \u201cWhen I told him I was still meeting gay boys from the internet, he said not to feel guilty about it. He tried to position himself as the supportive father that he thought his clients didn\u2019t have.\u201dSome 15 years later, Arana \u2014 by then a journalist who had long accepted his sexuality \u2014 called his former therapist for an article he was working on about the ex-gay movement. Nicolosi expressed surprise that Arana \u201cwent in the gay direction\u201d and then shocked Arana by asking if he wanted to try therapy again. \u201cThat just shows you how deluded he was,\u201d Arana told me.That delusion caused Nicolosi to see transformation where there was none. Ryan Kendall, another former teenage client of Nicolosi, who blames the therapy for years of depression and suicidal feelings, remembers the day Nicolosi introduced him to one of his supposed success stories. \u201cHe trots out this 25-year-old named Kelly, who I remember finding very attractive,\u201d Kendall recalls. \u201cWhen Nicolosi\u2019s out of the room, the guy says, \u2018I\u2019m here because my parents want me to be here, and I\u2019m going to a gay bar later.\u2019\u201dWhen Nicolosi died in March at the age of 70, few tears were shed in the L.G.B.T. community. (\u201cHas he tried *not* being dead?\u201d was a typical reaction on Twitter.) But some, like Arana, were surprised by the feelings his former therapist\u2019s death evoked. \u201cI felt this strange need to defend him,\u201d Arana told me. \u201cPart of me wonders if it\u2019s Stockholm syndrome even all these years later. But while there were evil people in the ex-gay movement, I don\u2019t see him as one of them. However terrible or harmful his ideas were, he believed them sincerely and ignored \u2014 whether consciously or not \u2014 all evidence to the contrary. I think it\u2019s counterproductive to portray him as a total villain.\u201dSo how should Nicolosi be understood? According to his son, Joseph Nicolosi Jr., Nicolosi believed that sexuality \u201cwasn\u2019t something set in stone for all people\u201d and was merely \u201cdescribing sexual fluidity 40 years before it became accepted.\u201d But to Wayne Besen, a gay activist and longtime foe of Nicolosi and the ex-gay industry, Nicolosi was an enigma. \u201cWhat motivated him?\u201d Besen wonders. \u201cWas it opportunism? Catholicism? A personal issue? Nobody could really figure him out.\u201dWhatever Nicolosi\u2019s motivations, Besen calls him the most \u201cimportant and destructive\u201d figure in the reparative-therapy community, because Nicolosi \u2014 who had a Ph.D. in psychology and was a founder of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality \u2014 bolstered the movement with the veneer of scientific respectability. \u201cHe was essentially there to say, \u2018You may not believe that Jesus will cure you, so here\u2019s some science for you,\u2019\u201d Besen says. \u201cIt was fake science, but he used misinformation well.\u201dNicolosi\u2019s death comes at a precarious time for the ex-gay movement. Most of its once-formidable organizations (including Exodus International, Love Won Out and Jonah) have closed, and several former ex-gay leaders have apologized and accepted a gay identity. Still, gay men desperate to change \u2014 and parents desperate to change their children \u2014 aren\u2019t without options. Only nine states and the District of Columbia ban conversion therapy for minors, and most people who practice it these days operate below the radar of state regulators. Charles Francis, the president of the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., an L.G.B.T. history society, warns that the ex-gay movement is quietly rebranding itself. \u201cNicolosi is horse and buggy compared to what\u2019s coming our way with conversion therapy under cover of the First Amendment and religious liberty,\u201d Francis predicts.But Besen isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cThe industry is a corpse, a shell of its former self,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve laid down such a robust record that proves beyond any doubt that reparative therapy doesn\u2019t work, and is in fact damaging. It\u2019s a joke and a fraud, and just about everybody realizes that. It\u2019s too bad Nicolosi never did.\u201dB. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus. Another wrote, \u201cConsider taking his courses during 2nd semester because he hates winter, so he\u2019s more sympathetic when grades close in the spring!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1954At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1934John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Read more \u25beB. 1927John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.People often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dennis Banks Led a Native-American Revolution", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Having renounced alcohol, Banks made his way to the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. He asked a medicine man there to indoctrinate him in Lakota rituals. Banks was desperate to connect to a tribal past; he wasn\u2019t about to quibble over which tribe\u2019s. He began regularly practicing rituals of smudging, singing at the drum, pipe carrying and religious use of tobacco. He insisted on a spiritual component to AIM as well. He promoted sweat lodges and sun dances, in which flesh was pierced and suffering endured, as a means of transforming alienated youth into warrior priests.The rituals inspired community, and so did Banks. He was a charismatic leader, adept at building social networks. Later in life, he coached runners and organized spiritual marathon runs around the world. He also produced a community of his own, marrying four times and fathering 20 children.AIM\u2019s spiritual communion with the past only underscored the conundrums of its present \u2014 how to be fully Indian and fully modern, and how to be American when your Americanness was the very thing, along with the land beneath your feet, that had been stolen from you.Amid the revolutionary fashion of the early 1970s, AIM\u2019s look was cool \u2014 buckskin, braids, feathers, rifles. But while the Black Panthers preached revolution, AIM called for restoration. Its demands were rock-ribbed Republican. It wanted property rights safeguarded, borders enforced, laws respected, debts paid, treaties upheld.Banks was instrumental in attracting recruits for AIM and connecting them to myth, history and one another. But a realistic vision for the future never jelled. And in a political system that honored wealth and valued votes, Indians, who had been reduced to less than 1 percent of the population, largely impoverished, possessed neither.In lieu of power, Banks opted for attention, operating a guerrilla theater that used live ammunition. \u201cI think he helped Native Americans realize that they still count and need to step forward and let U.S. society know we are still here,\u201d says John Echohawk, a founder of the Native American Rights Fund.Banks and his photogenic colleague Russell Means became what The Los Angeles Times called the \u201cmost famous Indians since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.\u201d There was collective pride in that, along with jealousies, rivalries and subterfuge. When a trusted aid to Banks announced that he was an F.B.I. informant, the government\u2019s counterintelligence work was done: Fear of infiltrators led to suspicion and vengeance.In a historical inversion, AIM would go on to occupy white property, recouping a symbolic fraction of a bill that was cosmically in arrears. But the endgame, given the lopsided power of AIM\u2019s federal adversaries, was always distant, the staging improvisational. When Banks led a caravan of AIM members to Washington in 1972, the group sat in at the Bureau of Indian Affairs headquarters (and its cafeteria) and refused to leave, in no small part because night was coming and they had failed to secure accommodations.AIM\u2019s last stand at Wounded Knee, S.D., was similarly ad hoc, a strategic fiasco slathered in media. Hundreds of Lakota were massacred at the site by the United States Army in 1890. Seeking to dramatize local corruption and pervasive injustice and also to honor the dead, AIM moved into the tiny hamlet on the Pine Ridge reservation after minimal planning. Provisions and ammunition soon ran short.Hundreds of government agents laid siege; AIM held out for 71 days. Two AIM supporters were killed; another\u2019s body was never found. (A suspected F.B.I. mole, he may have been murdered.) A federal marshal was paralyzed.AIM surrendered, then unraveled. Banks took to life on the run, making an underground tour of 1970s bizarro, with star turns by William Randolph Hearst (who sought Banks\u2019s help finding his kidnapped daughter), Marlon Brando (who supplied Banks with a mobile home and $10,000 for a getaway) and the cult leader Jim Jones (who raised bail for Banks\u2019s wife before leading his followers to mass suicide in Guyana in 1978).Banks eventually served a short stint in prison on charges unrelated to Wounded Knee. He kept faith with his spiritual renewal and encouraged his own children to draw spiritual strength from rituals and running. But his paradoxes persisted. His preferred nomenclature was \u201chuman rights activist,\u201d but his 2004 autobiography was titled \u201cOjibwa Warrior.\u201d He lavishly extolled the healing powers of native medicine, but he died at the Mayo Clinic.As AIM prepared to surrender at Wounded Knee and Banks readied an escape through the federal cordon, a Lakota medicine man said a prayer to make Banks invisible. That a 20th century Indian, a defiant survivor, should require such a ministration was achievement in itself.Francis Wilkinson is on the editorial board of Bloomberg View, where he writes about politics.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: \u201cI ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE. LET NOT ANYONE STOP YOU.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1933None of it compensates for the lack of a man\u2019s touch. The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1946Read more \u25beB. 1928This was the dilemma facing Adam West, the former William West Anderson, as he contemplated becoming TV\u2019s Batman in the fall of 1965. He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.Read more \u25beB. 1974John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus. Another wrote, \u201cConsider taking his courses during 2nd semester because he hates winter, so he\u2019s more sympathetic when grades close in the spring!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1954At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1934John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mary Tyler Moore Defined the Idea of the Working Woman", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Redford knew the role was a change from Moore\u2019s sunny appearances as Mary Richards on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and Laura Petrie on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d so much so that he was initially worried to even approach her. But when he did, he told her that when he read the Judith Guest novel that he was adapting, he couldn\u2019t stop picturing Moore as Beth. Redford had a home in Malibu, and sometimes he\u2019d look out on the beach and see her taking walks. She seemed like a sad figure on those walks, so different from the spunky and triumphant walks she took in the opening credits of \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d He told her that it was the most important role in the film. He wanted someone to play her sympathetically. Moore agreed emphatically. Beth reminded Moore of her father. She also had a little of Beth in her herself \u2014 she would realize that eventually. She told Redford that she didn\u2019t think of Beth as a villain but as just another victim in the story.Moore called \u201cOrdinary People\u201d the \u201choly grail\u201d of her career, not just because it had a remarkable script and production, or because of the Oscar nomination that she earned from it, but because it saved her from eternal typecasting just when she needed it. She had been so good in sitcoms. But what now? She was only in her early 40s, and it seemed as if she was sentenced to a life of short-lived series and celebrity guest appearances on sitcoms and game shows. Depth and mood and range weren\u2019t things people associated with her.When \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d debuted in 1970, no one could have predicted how iconic it would become for the way it portrayed women\u2019s experiences in the workplace, and for the way its heroine, Mary Richards, remained plucky in the face of discrimination, both passive and aggressive. That was back when plucky seemed like a good solution to the constant insults of merely trying to function while female, when smiling with moxie at all the crap thrown in your direction seemed like the best way to survive and advance.Mary Richards struck an exact balance of wit and intelligence with a kind of wise understanding of people\u2019s natures. She was a perfect guide for navigating the a-wokening of the corporate American man (a project that is still ongoing, to say the least). The show\u2019s cultural impact over its seven years was monumental. Mary Richards allowed women to ask themselves questions out loud about what exactly they were hoping for in life, why it was so important for them to marry and how the families we build for ourselves can be as important and sustaining as the families we\u2019re born into.Mary Richards was a hero for all she represented. But Moore wasn\u2019t Mary Richards. She didn\u2019t have her ease or confidence. She grew up in a house with distant parents; her mother was an alcoholic. Moore lived between her parents\u2019 house and her grandmother and aunt\u2019s house. When she was at her parents\u2019 house, she slept on the couch, because there were only two bedrooms and she felt uncomfortable sleeping in the same room with her brother. She grew up to struggle with diabetes, with rejection, with alcoholism, with divorce, with another divorce, with the death of a grown, only child, with forgiveness. She left her second husband, Grant Tinker, with whom she had so little intimacy that they never undressed in front of each other except during actual sex. She moved to New York, away from him. At night, in her apartment, she made margaritas in her blender that were one-quarter drink mix, one-quarter ice and one-half tequila, so that they had the consistency of a milkshake. She got into her bed at night, next to the air-conditioner, and built a kind of fort around herself with pillows and drank until those margaritas began their work. (She would eventually marry a third time.)People still mistook Moore for Richards, though. In 1980, Gloria Steinem asked Moore to speak at an Equal Rights Amendment rally in Washington. Moore said yes, but when the time came, she lied and said she had an ear infection and couldn\u2019t fly. Steinem suggested she take a train instead. She told Moore that Tip O\u2019Neill, the speaker of the House, had agreed to meet with Steinem\u2019s group \u2014 Bella Abzug, Gloria Allred, etc. \u2014 only if Moore was in attendance. So Moore took the train, begrudgingly, now roped into a four-hour trip instead of an hourlong flight. She showed up to the meeting and submitted to the \u201cbig hug\u201d that O\u2019Neill demanded of her. (\u201cWhere\u2019s that little cutie?\u201d she remembered him saying.) But it was a waste of time. The amendment stalled, and she found the women rallying for equal rights well intentioned and intelligent but off-putting, with their shouting, like \u201cangry children.\u201d This, she believed, was one reason the amendment ultimately failed to become law. Yes, she saw the paradox in all this. Yes, she loved Mary Richards, too. But didn\u2019t all the women in America know by now how exhausting it was to aspire to be Mary Richards?So there she was, a few years after her show went off the air. She told people she ended it so that they could go out on top, but the real reason was that the producers, the writers and Tinker, who co-founded their production company, MTM Enterprises, saw so much potential in spinoffs \u2014 \u201cRhoda,\u201d \u201cLou Grant\u201d and others \u2014 that it seemed like the smart move. Great for the bottom line, yes, but what about Moore? She had these Maryisms, she called them \u2014 referring to the movements and speech patterns that she had absorbed into her own manner after so many years of playing Mary Richards.She did some theater, including playing a quadriplegic who wants to end her own life, in \u201cWhose Life Is It, Anyway?\u201d for which she won raves and a special Tony. Then came Redford\u2019s offer. But it wasn\u2019t really an offer, in the end. After they spoke that first time, he took three months to consider if she was right for the role, auditioning just about every actress in town, from what Moore heard.When he finally returned to her, saying, Yes, please, come be my Beth Jarrett, she nearly fell over with relief. Now she could show something of herself to as big an audience as she\u2019d always had. She had been so afraid that people would find out that she wasn\u2019t Mary Richards. But in the time she waited for Redford\u2019s offer, she realized she was more afraid that they wouldn\u2019t; she was more afraid that she\u2019d never be seen or known or loved for who she was.Redford continued to try to get the shot of Beth and the cake, but it was never to be. It appears nowhere in the movie. Moore said later that she believed that Redford had been looking for Beth\u2019s soul. But Beth wasn\u2019t the kind of person to reveal her soul. Beth was the kind of person who would rather give you a cake and a smile. She could mourn by overcoming sadness in a lifelong pursuit for perfectionism. Beth\u2019s soul was the act of not showing her soul. How did Redford not see that? How did Redford not see that Beth\u2019s soul was right in front of him the entire time?B. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Dr. Sarno, at War With The Medical Establishment and His Own Body", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Around this time, he started seeing a therapist, \u201cto learn about my own psyche.\u201d He devoured psychology books and began to see his own physical ailments \u2014 an irritable stomach, itchy skin, shrieking headaches \u2014 as manifestations of his emotional well-being. He wondered if his understanding of his own pain might offer insight into his patients\u2019 problems.As he squeezed and pressed his patients\u2019 sore backs, he asked them about their medical history; migraines and irritable stomachs were common. There were more searching questions too: Are you sensitive to criticism? Why do you put so much pressure on yourself? Do you think you\u2019re a good mother? From their answers, a theory took shape: His patients\u2019 pain was real, but it wasn\u2019t really caused by slipped disks, pinched nerves or old football injuries. Instead, the body was using physical pain to defend itself from mental anguish over the disappointing career, the combative marriage. Your back doesn\u2019t hurt because you lifted that heavy suitcase; your back hurts because you\u2019re smoldering with unacknowledged rage that your sister, who always got away with everything, still hasn\u2019t repaid that loan you couldn\u2019t afford to give her in the first place.\u201cDon\u2019t be misled by the excruciating spasm your brain has engineered,\u201d he told an interviewer in 1994. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you have a disease. ... Know about the anger, and know why it\u2019s there. And if you do those two things, your pain will go away.\u201d He warned that the medical community was part of the problem. Other doctors saw nontraumatic chronic back pain and diagnosed serious physical maladies, which made the patients all the more anxious, which made the pain even worse.Among his peers, he felt he became a medical laughingstock. \u201cI\u2019m a heretic,\u201d he would say. Nearly every day, he ate lunch alone in the N.Y.U. cafeteria while the other doctors huddled together at their own tables. He wasn\u2019t invited to their cocktail parties. He was not asked to teach his work and was never invited to present at the monthly department meetings.He had always been a nervous man who, at 5-foot-3, had, as he described it, \u201csubstantial problems with self-esteem.\u201d It was worse now. His colleagues\u2019 slights ate at him. His suppressed rage at the constant disrespect made him physically sick, an itchy, agitated exhibition of the very mind-body connection he championed. \u201cI can\u2019t stand not being recognized!\u201d he said in that 1994 interview. \u201cI hate it!\u201dBecause his colleagues wouldn\u2019t listen, he bypassed the journals and instead wrote best-selling books, conversational in tone, that detailed the link he saw between emotional distress and physical pain; he sold more than a million copies. Those who believed Sarno had an almost religious devotion. Howard Stern dedicated his autobiography to him.Testimonials have poured onto the site thankyoudrsarno.com. One expresses gratitude for \u201cgiving me a new life to go on with.\u201d Another says: \u201cWhenever I feel a slight twinge, I remind myself that nothing is really wrong with my neck. Thank you, Dr. Sarno, for changing my life.\u201dMost doctors still dismiss Sarno\u2019s views, and his understanding of pain remains on medicine\u2019s fringe. I, however, count myself among the believers. Some 15 years ago, when I was in my 20s, I had terrible back pain, and an eminent doctor recommended that I have spinal surgery. On a relative\u2019s recommendation, I went to see Sarno for a second opinion. Limping into his office, I found a tiny, owlish man sitting behind a giant wooden desk. It looked as if his lab coat might swallow him, leaving behind just a pair of heavy, dark-rimmed glasses. He asked why I had come to see him, and I described my problems with my back and then with my life.He was kind and inquisitive but firm. He had seen people like me before. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, he said. Don\u2019t have surgery. Stop acting sick. Your back is fine, and so are you.He gave me his book, and I watched his videos (they have the distinct feel of public-access TV), but mostly I tried to stop treating myself like an invalid. I threw away the back braces, started playing basketball again and watched, amazed, as the pain gradually went away.I can\u2019t say that I quite understand what happened with my back, but Sarno believed that I was suppressing a white-hot anger I could not articulate. Anger was always the most powerful emotion in Sarno\u2019s cosmology, the root cause of the physical pain.And Sarno, with his irritated skin and his solitary lunches, would be the first to acknowledge that he never conquered his own.\u201cI am furious!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s there all the time! I\u2019m in a rage!\u201dB. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites.

In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weinstein\u2019s Complicity Machine", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "\u2018One phone call and you\u2019re done.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m Harvey Weinstein \u2014 you know what I can do.\u2019\u2018I am a man who has great resources.\u2019\u2018I have ears and eyes everywhere!\u2019The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades.He gathered ammunition, sometimes helped by the editor of The National Enquirer, who had dispatched reporters to find information that could undermine accusers. He turned to old allies, asking a partner in Creative Artists Agency, one of Hollywood\u2019s premier talent shops, to broker a meeting with a C.A.A. client, Ronan Farrow, who was reporting on Mr. Weinstein. He tried to dispense favors: While seeking to stop the actress Rose McGowan from writing in a memoir that he had sexually assaulted her, he tried to arrange a $50,000 payment to her former manager and throw new business to a literary agent advising Ms. McGowan. The agent, Lacy Lynch, replied to him in an email: \u201cNo one understands smart, intellectual and commercial like HW.\u201dMr. Weinstein\u2019s final, failed round of manipulations shows how he operated for more than three decades: by trying to turn others into instruments or shields for his behavior, according to nearly 200 interviews, internal company records and previously undisclosed emails. Some aided his actions without realizing what he was doing. Many knew something or detected hints, though few understood the scale of his sexual misconduct. Almost everyone had incentives to look the other way or reasons to stay silent. Now, even as the tally of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misdeeds is still emerging, so is a debate about collective failure and the apportioning of blame.Executives at Mr. Weinstein\u2019s film companies who learned of allegations rarely took a stand, cowed by their volatile boss or worried about their careers. His brother and partner, Bob, participated in payoffs to women as far back as 1990. Some low-level assistants were pulled in: They compiled \u201cbibles\u201d that included hints on facilitating encounters with women, and were required to procure his penile injections for erectile dysfunction. His lawyers crafted settlements that kept the truth from being explored, much less exposed. \u201cWhen you quickly settle, there is no need to get into all the facts,\u201d said Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer who handled two agreements with accusers.Agents and managers across Hollywood, who wanted in on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s star-making films, sent actresses to meet him alone at hotels and advised them to stay quiet when things went wrong. \u201cThat\u2019s just Harvey being Harvey,\u201d more than one agent told a client. At C.A.A., for example, at least eight talent agents were told that Mr. Weinstein had harassed or menaced female clients, but agents there continued to arrange private meetings. Even Nick Wechsler, a talent manager at another firm who confronted Mr. Weinstein about Ms. McGowan, felt he had to maintain business ties with him: \u201cSometimes he was the only game in town.\u201dMr. Weinstein held off press scrutiny with a mix of threats and enticements, drawing reporters close with the lure of access to stars, directors and celebrity-packed parties. Some journalists negotiated book and movie deals with him even as they were assigned to cover him. The studio chief once paid a gossip writer to collect juicy celebrity tidbits that Mr. Weinstein could use to barter if other reporters stumbled onto an affair he was trying to keep quiet. He was so close to David J. Pecker, the chief executive of American Media Inc., which owns The Enquirer, that he was known in the tabloid industry as an untouchable \u201cF.O.P.,\u201d or \u201cfriend of Pecker.\u201d That status was shared by a chosen few, including President Trump.Mr. Weinstein, 65, is under investigation by law enforcement authorities in three cities. Though he has acknowledged that his behavior \u201chas caused a lot of pain,\u201d his lawyers denied that he committed sexual assault. His spokeswoman disputed claims of inappropriate advances in this article, saying Mr. Weinstein\u2019s recollections differed from those of his accusers.A master of leverage, Mr. Weinstein parlayed his films into relationships across the worlds of entertainment, politics, publishing and beyond, achieving a stature that at times proved useful in intimidating others and protecting himself. \u201cI know the president of the United States. Who do you know?\u201d Mr. Weinstein, a Democratic fund-raiser, would say during the years Barack Obama was in the White House, adding expletives. \u201cI\u2019m Harvey Weinstein,\u201d he used to say. \u201cYou know what I can do.\u201dIn late September, emails show, he was discussing a documentary television show he was working on with Hillary Clinton. He had long raised campaign cash for her, and her feminist credentials helped burnish his image \u2014 even though Tina Brown, the magazine editor, and Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, each say they had cautioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides about his treatment of women. Now, Mr. Weinstein exchanged questions about distribution rights for the show. \u201cI am hopeful we can get a good price for this,\u201d Robert Barnett, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer, replied.Two days later, Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, interrupted a vacation in Hawaii to field advice from Mr. Weinstein, according to the emails. The Wall Street Journal was reporting on turmoil at Amazon Studios, one of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s business partners. He recommended an aggressive response that involved hiring some of his own team, including a libel lawyer who \u201cmakes sure everyone sticks to the right narrative,\u201d Mr. Weinstein wrote. He added, \u201cI\u2019m happy to coordinate with whoever you\u2019d like, as a friend of the court.\u201d Mr. Bezos declined to comment.Even as Mr. Weinstein was aware that reporters were examining his behavior, he attended the Toronto International Film Festival in September and invited two women to his hotel room. He alternated between making massage requests, other unwelcome advances and offers of career help, said the women, who asked to remain unidentified, but whose account was backed up in part through text messages and a friend who was told at the time of the encounter. Then, the women said, he issued pleas and warnings not to tell anyone. Mr. Weinstein called the account \u201cnonsense.\u201dHe pressured his business associates, telling Lance Maerov, an outspoken member of the Weinstein Company board, that he would find embarrassing details from his past and use them against him. He pushed Irwin Reiter, an executive who had worked with him for three decades, to speak favorably of him to reporters. When Mr. Reiter refused, he said, Mr. Weinstein responded that he had damning information about him too.About the same time, he tried to facilitate a business deal with Ms. Lynch, the literary agent consulting with Ms. McGowan, and others. \u201cGetting together with three intelligent women would help my image immensely,\u201d he wrote in an email, proposing a meeting. That never happened, according to Ms. Lynch. She said that she felt Mr. Weinstein was trying to ingratiate himself with her because of her relationship to Ms. McGowan, and that she was simply playing along. Jill Messick, Ms. McGowan\u2019s former manager, never received or accepted money from the producer, her lawyer said.Minutes before The New York Times published the first allegations about Mr. Weinstein this fall, he called the reporters who wrote it. Swinging between flattery and threats, he said that he had ways of knowing who had cooperated with the investigation and the means to undermine it.\u201cI am a man who has great resources,\u201d he warned.Mia Kirshner, a Canadian actress who was 19 when she starred in the film \u201cExotica,\u201d traveled to New York not long after its 1994 release. Miramax distributed the movie, and her agents at C.A.A. had set up a meeting with Mr. Weinstein at her hotel. \u201cWe thought it was a coup,\u201d she recalled. The producer had already told Ms. Kirshner, whose grandparents had survived the Lodz ghetto in Poland, that he wanted to discuss a film about the Warsaw ghetto uprising. But when he came to her room, his agenda was to exchange sex for career opportunity, the actress said. While she rejected him, the experience left her feeling \u201cextremely upset and alarmed and scared,\u201d and somehow, like so many other women who say he targeted them, at fault.She told her primary agent, Lisa Grode, who sounded shocked. In a subsequent conversation, her talent manager, John Carrabino, and his boss, Sandy Gallin, joined the call. Mr. Gallin was outraged and urged Ms. Kirshner to meet with the producer again, while wearing a wire. \u201cI remember John and Lisa were both like, \u2018Sandy, no!\u2019\u201d Ms. Kirshner said. From the general tone of the conversation, she concluded she should drop the matter. \u201cI was told to forget about it; it was pointless to do anything about this,\u201d Ms. Kirshner said.She was grateful to Ms. Grode for signing her and for encouraging her to get a college degree, she said. But in that moment, she recalled, \u201cI was very disappointed by them.\u201d\u201cIt all came down to money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt speaks to why he was protected as opposed to the actors.\u201c Ms. Grode and Mr. Carrabino declined to comment; Mr. Gallin is deceased.It is impossible to say how many women might have been spared Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged sexual aggression had more agents responded with the impulse to act. At C.A.A., at least eight agents had heard about Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, largely from actresses they represented, but several former senior C.A.A. agents said they were unaware of it or any formal agency response.In a statement, C.A.A. said it apologized \u201cto any person the agency let down for not meeting the high expectations we place on ourselves.\u201d Like other agencies, it said it had begun revising its management structure to include more women and improve its sexual harassment policies.When asked if he had known of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged harassment of clients, Bryan Lourd, a partner at C.A.A., declined to comment, citing client confidentiality. In mid-September, Mr. Weinstein stormed into Mr. Lourd\u2019s office to complain about an article that Ronan Farrow, a C.A.A. client, was writing on Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct for The New Yorker, according to someone familiar with C.A.A.\u2019s dealings with Mr. Weinstein. Later that month, Mr. Lourd tried to set up a meeting at the producer\u2019s request. \u201cThis guy won\u2019t meet right now,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Weinstein on Sept. 26. \u201cHe did say he will call you soon. I think he is absolutely pursuing the story.\u201dThe top agencies are among Hollywood\u2019s most male institutions; none has ever been led by a woman. \u201cGiven everything that has happened, agencies are suddenly on a very steep learning curve, but I think they are doing the work to create a better environment,\u201d said Marti Noxon, a television producer. She had been disappointed in the past by an agent\u2019s response when she reported that she had been sexually harassed.Two decades ago, Ashley Judd, who met Mr. Weinstein in his hotel room for what she thought was a business meeting, said she turned down the producer\u2019s repeated offers of a massage, as well his efforts to steer her toward the bathroom so she could watch him shower. After the encounter, the actress made no secret of what had transpired, and told her agent, Michelle Bohan, who was then at the William Morris Agency. \u201cI know my agent would have done whatever I asked her to do,\u201d Ms. Judd said. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know what to ask anyone to do.\u201d Ms. Bohan, who remains Ms. Judd\u2019s agent, declined to comment.Failure to take action in the face of misconduct accusations was hardly limited to cases involving Mr. Weinstein. After complaints about his treatment of women became public, Reese Witherspoon said in a recent speech that a director had sexually assaulted her when she was 16, and she expressed anger toward \u201cthe agents and the producers who made me feel that silence was a condition of my employment.\u201dAgents often sign actresses when they are at peak value to the industry \u2014 just out of their teens, if not still in them \u2014 and also at peak vulnerability, given their youth. Although agents are charged with protecting their clients\u2019 interests, they earn their living, indirectly, from the executives who write their clients\u2019 paychecks. For agents, actors and actresses might come and go, but Mr. Weinstein was one of Hollywood\u2019s seemingly permanent fixtures, distributing as many as 30 films a year.In the absence of any collective discussion of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior, stories circulated in the industry, tainting many of those associated with him. More than two decades ago, Gwyneth Paltrow reported advances he made in a hotel room to her agent, Rick Kurtzman of C.A.A. Mr. Kurtzman \u201clooked incredulous\u201d and expressed revulsion, Ms. Paltrow said, but he did not suggest discussing the episode with the agency\u2019s leaders. Mr. Kurtzman declined to comment.Ms. Paltrow went on to become known as the first lady of Miramax, winning an Oscar in 1999 for her performance in \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d But without her knowledge, Mr. Weinstein was tarnishing and trading on her golden-girl image. Ms. Paltrow said she rebuffed Mr. Weinstein. But now, she is hearing that as he tried to coerce other women, he repeatedly boasted that he had sex with her. Complying with him was \u201cthe best thing you can do for your career now,\u201d Mr. Weinstein told one young actress in 2000, mentioning Ms. Paltrow and others. Another woman, who alleged that Mr. Weinstein assaulted her in 2004, recalled a photo of Ms. Paltrow prominently displayed in the room.In recent weeks, Ms. Paltrow has started to connect with some of those who said Mr. Weinstein cited her name in disturbing encounters. She said the phone calls with the other women have been devastating. \u201cHe\u2019s not the first person to lie about sleeping with someone,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cbut he used the lie as an assault weapon.\u201dWhen Disney bought Miramax in 1993, it acquired an un-Disney-like duo from New York, brothers who already had reputations as ruthless businessmen and fearsome bosses.But the Weinsteins had an eye for talent and success in critically acclaimed art house films. They were given wide latitude \u2014 \u201cvirtual autonomy,\u201d as Disney put it in a statement \u2014 a move meant to preserve Miramax\u2019s creative culture. That hands-off supervision, several former executives now suggest, could have inadvertently created opportunities for misconduct that Mr. Weinstein exploited.But Disney continued to bankroll the Weinsteins with hundreds of millions of dollars a year \u2014 more money than they had ever handled before \u2014 and Mr. Eisner tolerated them as they were churning out hits. When Chris McGurk, then a Disney executive, broached the idea of selling Miramax in the mid-90s, he recalled Mr. Eisner saying, \u201cI\u2019m not selling as long I\u2019m chairman.\u201dDisney said that it did not know of any complaints, lawsuits or the settlements dealing with sexual misconduct involving Mr. Weinstein, and no clear evidence to the contrary has emerged. But there were hints of other troubling behavior.One involved a physical altercation with a male employee at a film conference in the mid-90s that resulted in a financial settlement. About that time, the producer Sybil Robson Orr said that when she complained to Mr. Weinstein about falling short on a distribution deal, he berated her with vulgarities, pounding his desk and vowing to destroy her career, according to a 1996 lawsuit. Two Disney executives joined in the threats, she claimed.She prevailed, receiving a \u201csizable award,\u201d said Bertram Fields, the lawyer who represented her. \u201cNo one is going to do that again,\u201d Mr. Weinstein vowed, according to a former Miramax official. The producer and his company later hired Mr. Fields and another star litigator, David Boies.By that time, dozens of women had become victims of Mr. Weinstein, they now say. One of them, a Canadian who anonymously filed a lawsuit accusing him of assaulting her in 2000, said in an interview: \u201cYou do not get to trade on my physical safety for your accolades and your Oscars.\u201dShortly after the news investigations of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged abuse were published, A. J. Benza, a former New York Daily News gossip columnist, received a two-word text from the producer: \u201cHelp me.\u201dMr. Benza had been integral to the network of friendly journalists \u2014 gossip columnists, magazine writers, editors and authors \u2014 whom the producer relied on to promote his entertainment empire and sometimes punish rivals or deflect threats.Over dinner in West Hollywood in late 2003 or early the next year, the men had discussed a plan to help Mr. Weinstein avoid embarrassment. While married to his first wife, he had become involved with someone else, Mr. Benza discovered. A clerk at a Los Angeles art studio where he commissioned a gift for Mr. Weinstein \u2014 a painting of a reimagined \u201cHollywood\u201d sign reading \u201cHarveywood\u201d \u2014 volunteered to Mr. Benza that a friend, Georgina Chapman, was seeing the producer. Mr. Weinstein, who would later marry Ms. Chapman, was separated and wanted to keep the relationship confidential until he was divorced, according to his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister.Mr. Benza, then between jobs, had a suggestion. \u201cI could supply your P.R. girls with a lot of gossip \u2014 a lot of stories \u2014 and if people come at them with the \u2018Harvey\u2019s having an affair story,\u2019 they can barter,\u201d Mr. Benza recalled telling Mr. Weinstein. \u201cHe said, \u2018A. J., it\u2019s got to be good stories,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about it.\u2019\u201dCollecting a monthly retainer, Mr. Benza said, he reported items on Roger Clemens, Michael Jackson and others and sent them to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s communications team, though he didn\u2019t know whether they were used to trade away stories about the producer. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s spokeswoman said the payments to Mr. Benza were for public relations work during Miramax\u2019s dispute with Disney.Mr. Benza and Mr. Weinstein were exploiting a longstanding system of favor-trading between the press and the movie business. Gossip writers need a stream of insider scoops, industry beat reporters need exclusives on the next big deal and glossy magazines need celebrities who can drive newsstand sales. Mr. Weinstein, who wanted glowing coverage, could provide that and more.Mr. Auletta, of The New Yorker, said he learned about a sexual assault allegation that a former assistant had made against the producer, and a related settlement that required confidentiality. Mr. Auletta said that he and his editors concluded just before publishing that they could not include the allegation because the woman would not agree to cooperate.Mr. Carr, a New York Times columnist who died in 2015, heard about Ms. McGowan\u2019s assault allegation and other accusations while reporting a profile for New York magazine in 2001, his editors said.Several weeks before the article was published, Kroll, a private investigative agency that did work for Mr. Weinstein, provided him with some details of Mr. Carr\u2019s reporting, according to a former Miramax executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Carr wrote in the profile that Mr. Weinstein seemed to have \u201cnear-perfect visibility into my notebook,\u201d and told friends that Mr. Weinstein called him before publication to read a line he had written.His spokeswoman dismissed the account as \u201curban legend,\u201d and a top Kroll executive, Daniel E. Karson, did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Carr\u2019s article also did not include any sexual misconduct allegations; Caroline Miller, then New York\u2019s editor, said that none of the women would speak on the record. That same wall of silence would stymie other journalists in the years that followed.As he and his legal team worked to undermine Ms. Battilana\u2019s credibility, American Media entered the picture.In November last year, Lauren O\u2019Connor, a former Weinstein Company employee who had written a blistering memo asserting sexual harassment and other misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, received calls from a Coleman-Rayner reporter. He said he was working on a story about \u201cmajor studio heads\u201d and kept pressing her to speak even when she declined. She said it made her so uncomfortable she reported the phone call to her lawyer.By fall last year, Mr. Weinstein was trying to stop what he feared would be a story about the allegations against him by New York magazine. Once again, he called on Mr. Benza, meeting him at the Peninsula Beverly Hills that October.Saying the magazine was \u201cdoing a Bill Cosby on me,\u201d Mr. Weinstein asked for help, Mr. Benza recalled. He said he did not believe at the time that the studio chief had abused women, and despite feeling a debt of loyalty, would not have knowingly participated in a scheme to silence victims.He said Mr. Weinstein suggested that Mr. Benza pose as an author \u201cwriting a hit job,\u2019\u2019 so he could call potential sources to learn what they were saying about the producer. Mr. Weinstein discussed paying Mr. Benza up to $20,000 a month and providing a list of contacts, Mr. Benza said, though the producer never followed through. Mr. Weinstein\u2019s spokeswoman denied that he had proposed the scheme.But a list was shared with Mr. Howard, who sent Mr. Weinstein an email last December with an attachment called \u201cContacts\u201d and a note reading, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss next steps on each.\u201dThe New York magazine piece never materialized; the accusers would not speak on the record. But The Times, NBC and then The New Yorker began pursuing their own stories.The day before The Times published its article this fall, Mr. Weinstein was planning to make his last defense. He wrote an urgent email to Mr. Howard, instructing him to meet outside the newspaper\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. American Media said that Mr. Howard did not show.If Mr. Weinstein built his wall of invulnerability from many varied bricks, it was covered with a sheen of celebrity. He created stars through his movies, but he also acquired famous friends through his other activities, including in the Democratic politics that dominate Hollywood.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s political activity \u2014 he provided consistent support for Mr. Obama as well \u2014 boosted his image as a man with friends in high places and close ties to the country\u2019s leading female politician. It is not clear if rumors of his record of sexual misconduct had ever reached them.But two prominent women said they warned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team. In 2016, Lena Dunham, the writer and actress, said she was troubled by the producer\u2019s visible presence during Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential run, hosting fund-raisers and appearing at campaign events. She had heard stories, both directly and secondhand from other actresses, about disturbing encounters with him, she said. So in March last year, Ms. Dunham, a vocal Clinton supporter, said she warned the campaign.\u201cI just want you to let you know that Harvey\u2019s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,\u201d Ms. Dunham said she told Kristina Schake, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. She recalled adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it\u2019s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault.\u201dEarlier, during the 2008 presidential race, Tina Brown, the magazine editor, said she cautioned a member of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inner circle about him. \u201cI was hearing that Harvey\u2019s sleaziness with women had escalated since I left Talk in 2002 and she was unwise to be so closely associated with him,\u201d Ms. Brown said in an email.Ms. Dunham said that Ms. Schake seemed surprised at her warning, and that Ms. Schake said she would tell Robby Mook, the campaign manager, Ms. Dunham recalled in an interview.The latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.Ms. Elrod and Ms. Schake, through Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, denied that Ms. Dunham mentioned rape, while Mr. Mook said that no one had ever alerted him about the producer.Nick Merrill, the communications director, said in a statement: \u201cWe were shocked when we learned what he\u2019d done. It\u2019s despicable behavior, and the women that have come forward have shown enormous courage. As to claims about a warning, that\u2019s something staff wouldn\u2019t forget.\u201d Referring to Ms. Dunham, the statement continued, \u201cOnly she can answer why she would tell them instead of those who could stop him.\u201d Mr. Merrill added that no one could find people from the 2008 campaign who could recall a warning from Ms. Brown.Mrs. Clinton herself said in a statement in October that she was \u201cshocked and appalled by the revelations,\u201d adding that the alleged behavior \u201ccannot be tolerated.\u201dWhile Ms. Dunham says she has \u201can incredible allegiance to Hillary,\u201d and does not believe the reports ever traveled to Mrs. Clinton, she remains troubled by what had happened. \u201cA year and a half ago, on one of the most progressive campaigns in history, this wasn\u2019t a problem,\u201d she said, referring to the allegations about Mr. Weinstein.(Ms. Dunham herself stirred controversy recently for defending a former colleague accused of sexual assault, though she later apologized.)Days after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s election loss, the Clintons had dinner with Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Boies, the lawyer, and their wives at Rao\u2019s restaurant in Harlem, Manhattan.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weinstein began planning a documentary TV show about her campaign. Discussions about the project stretched out for months with her lawyer, Robert Barnett, who emailed with Mr. Weinstein on Sept. 28 about potential European buyers.In a statement, Mr. Barnett said that \u201ctalks were ongoing until the allegations surfaced, at which point all discussions ceased \u2014 completely and permanently.\u201dBeginning in 2014, one of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s longest-serving employees had an overdue realization that he needed to do something about his boss\u2019s treatment of women.Irwin Reiter had done finance and accounting work for Mr. Weinstein for three decades. He knew the outlines of a few alarming episodes with female employees over the years, but he had never intervened. Like many others, he had brushed aside Mr. Weinstein\u2019s private relations with actresses, figuring it was an embarrassing but consensual extramarital habit.Now Mr. Reiter watched the public accusations mount against Bill Cosby. He learned that Mr. Weinstein allegedly harassed a new employee named Emily Nestor, offering her career help in return for sex. Sandeep Rehal, then a 28-year-old assistant, began confiding in him about some of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s demands. She had to rent him a furnished apartment, using his corporate credit card to stock it with women\u2019s lingerie, flowers, two bathrobes and extra clothes for Mr. Weinstein.Mr. Weinstein had long used his company credit card with abandon, relying on assistants to classify what was business or personal, sometimes writing checks to reimburse the company, according to several current and former employees. Now, on top of his salary \u2014 $2 million before bonuses in 2015, according to his contract \u2014 he wanted the business to pay expenses including a $27,000 tip for yacht staff and a private jet stop in Europe to pick up a model. Mr. Reiter and other executives also began to question why he was putting women on movie production payrolls without clear assignments.\u201cHow many????????????? How many are enough???? How many are too much???\u201d Mr. Reiter wrote in a February 2015 email to Tom Prince, the head of physical production.\u201cWe fly \u2018actresses\u2019 in from all over the world for 1-2 lines of dialogue,\u201d Mr. Prince wrote back.In a statement, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers, Blair Berk and Ben Brafman, said that he never used \u201ccompany resources for personal expenditures,\u201d and that he reimbursed the company \u201cwhere there was any confusion.\u201dConcerned that his boss\u2019s activities were \u201cgoing to take the company down,\u201d Mr. Reiter and other executives decided they should act. But Mr. Weinstein was the dominant figure in the company. He and his brother owned nearly half the business and served as co-chairmen, and he packed the board with allies.Fellow executives helped mask Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior going back to 1990. That year, a 23-year-old assistant said he sexually assaulted her when she ran an errand at his home. Bob Weinstein worked on the confidential settlement, according to two people familiar with the agreement \u2014 the first of at least three he would be involved in over the years. In a statement, Bob Weinstein said he did not recall being informed of the initial settlement, and denied being aware that his money was used to pay off two other accusers.After the episode with the young assistant, Harvey Weinstein confessed that he had done \u201csomething terrible,\u201d according to John Schmidt, then Miramax\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what got into me. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Mr. Schmidt, in an interview, recalled Mr. Weinstein telling him. Mr. Weinstein denied having this conversation.But the allegations kept coming. Even as other women at the company complained of abuse, Mr. Weinstein was never fully held to account. In 1998, Zelda Perkins, an assistant in London, confronted him about harassing her and allegedly assaulting a colleague. Donna Gigliotti, a senior executive who had left Miramax a few years earlier, recommended a lawyer and encouraged Ms. Perkins to demand more settlement money. But \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d which Ms. Gigliotti had produced with Mr. Weinstein, was about to be released. \u201cShe clearly felt that it was perfectly fine to get me to down Harvey,\u201d Ms. Perkins said. But \u201cshe wasn\u2019t going to stick her neck out.\u201d\u201cWhen Zelda told me what happened to her colleague, I was horrified,\u201d Ms. Gigliotti said in a recent email. \u201cOnce I was sure she had good independent counsel, I thought it best to let her lawyer determine how to approach and deal with Harvey. I did what I thought was best for Zelda,\u201d she said, adding that she did not speak to Mr. Weinstein for years afterward.In 2010, Ms. Gigliotti resumed working with Mr. Weinstein, becoming the president of production at his company. She left a year later.The Weinstein brothers used \u201cfear, intimidation, psychological and emotional abuse\u201d on their executives, male and female, said Amy Israel, Miramax\u2019s former co-head of acquisitions. \u201cAs a spectator to the abuse you were silenced by the fear that you would become the next target,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only alternative seemingly was to quit \u2014 to throw away everything you had worked so hard for and walk out the door.\u201dEven as someone with stature, Ms. Israel was not immune: Mr. Weinstein promoted her, praised her work, then harassed her, she said. When she stopped by his hotel room to pick him up for a film festival screening in 1994, she said, he was nearly naked and asked her for a massage.\u201cI reported the incident to someone more senior,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was told that another one of my other colleagues had also been harassed. But no one had ever bothered to warn me. Even after reporting it, nothing was done.\u201d She started warning female colleagues never to be alone with Mr. Weinstein, she said.The human resources department was seen by many as protecting Mr. Weinstein more than his employees. When Ms. O\u2019Connor complained that she was frightened to travel with Mr. Weinstein, \u201cthe response was basically, \u2018let us know if he hits you or crosses a line physically,\u2019\u201d she wrote in a 2015 memo. After she submitted a document detailing allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct by Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Boies and another lawyer helped reach a settlement with her.Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\u201cThe first time I spoke out, the message from H.R. was, \u2018This is not our problem,\u2019\u201d Ms. O\u2019Connor said in an interview. \u201cThe second time I spoke up the response was, \u2018How can we quickly make this go away?\u2019\u201dMr. Weinstein shielded himself with legal measures that silenced alleged victims and muffled employees. Mr. Weinstein has said he struck at least eight to 12 settlements with women claiming mistreatment, according to two associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Steve Hutensky, a Miramax lawyer nicknamed the Cleaner-Upper by some colleagues, helped write an agreement with Ms. Perkins in 1998 that barred her from disclosing Mr. Weinstein\u2019s name, even to a therapist, and required her to provide \u201creasonable assistance\u201d to Miramax if the company chose to contest any criminal investigation that might arise.Mr. Hutensky also helped implement an unusually restrictive nondisclosure agreement, obtained by The Times, that prohibited Miramax employees from disclosing any information about \u201cHarvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein and their family members, friends and/or business associates,\u201d without the written consent of the brothers. Mr. Hutensky declined to comment.Mr. Boies, a trusted adviser to Mr. Weinstein, signed a contract this summer with Black Cube, a private investigative firm founded by former intelligence analysts from the Israel Defense Forces. The firm was hired to block The Times\u2019s reporting about Mr. Weinstein, and an operative posed as a women\u2019s rights advocate to get information from an accuser, The New Yorker reported. Black Cube declined to discuss its operations, and Mr. Boies said he did not select the firm or direct its work.Mr. Weinstein cast some of his youngest and least powerful employees in the most uncomfortable roles. In recent weeks, their actions have become a matter of painful debate: Were they careerists doing whatever it took to advance, or victims themselves?Some women whom the producer allegedly targeted describe assistants manipulating them with chilling detachment. In 2004, when Ashley Matthau was a dancer in a Weinstein film, she said his assistant ushered her into a car, told her that the meeting with the producer was for business purposes and then waited outside a hotel room. There, she said, Mr. Weinstein pushed her on a bed and masturbated on her. When she walked out, the assistant was waiting. Ms. Matthau began to cry, but the woman \u201cwouldn\u2019t even acknowledge me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just seemed like a well-oiled machine.\u201d She later reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein.Protesting could get an assistant fired: Michelle Franklin, who worked in London in 2012, said her initial alarm about arranging encounters only escalated as she saw women who appeared emotionally bruised by them. One day, as she guided a woman to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s hotel room, she confronted him. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job, and I don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d she remembers saying. \u201cYour opinion doesn\u2019t count,\u201d she said he responded. She was fired soon after.Others stayed quiet because they felt like they shared a shameful secret. \u201cYou become more and more aware of everything going on, then you realize what it is you\u2019re cleaning up, and you don\u2019t ever want to tell anyone that \u2014 friends, family, my parents \u2014 what kind of job this is,\u201d Ms. Rehal said. She and Ms. Franklin said they were tasked with procuring injectable erectile dysfunction drugs, Caverject and alprostadil. Mr. Weinstein paid with his company card and gave Ms. Rehal a $500 bonus for supplying the medication, she said. Ms. Rehal said she had to keep a supply of the shots at her desk, dispense them to him in brown paper bags and sometimes deliver the medication to hotels and elsewhere before his meetings with women. She and Ms. O\u2019Connor said they had to escort Mr. Weinstein to sex-addiction therapy in 2015.Mr. Weinstein somehow knew personal information about Ms. Rehal, mentioning her student loans and where her younger sister attended school and saying he could have her kicked out. Rewards awaited those who went along, he said. \u201cThis is Harvey Weinstein University, and I decide if you graduate,\u201d he told Ms. Rehal and other assistants. Other former employees recall him saying, \u201cOne phone call and you\u2019re done.\u201d Mr. Weinstein denied threatening Ms. Rehal about her sister.Even as Mr. Reiter learned more, he said his efforts to stop Mr. Weinstein went nowhere: The man and the business were too intertwined. Mr. Reiter several times confronted Mr. Weinstein, who brushed him off. Along with David Glasser, the president, and Andy Kim, the chief financial officer, Mr. Reiter voiced concerns with a board member in summer 2015 about whether Mr. Weinstein\u2019s employment contract should be renewed. The executives put together a plan with Bob Weinstein to eject his brother from the company \u2014 they called it \u201cPlan B\u201d or the \u201cnon-Harvey option,\u201d according to Mr. Reiter. In the end, the board renewed his contract.Soon Mr. Reiter found himself under scrutiny. Mr. Boies acknowledged to Mr. Reiter that a security firm was scanning his computer, Mr. Reiter said. It was not the first time Harvey Weinstein had surveilled his associates: Years before, a former Miramax executive who was in a legal dispute with the producer and his company said operatives from Beau Dietl & Associates tailed him, even while he and his wife drove their children to school in Westchester County, N.Y. Richard A. Dietl, head of the private investigative firm, said he could not recall working for Mr. Weinstein.A decade ago, Kroll investigators spent weeks sifting through employee emails looking for derogatory comments about Mr. Weinstein, searching for phrases like \u201chate Harvey\u201d and another that used the word \u201cfat\u201d followed by an expletive, according to a person familiar with the undertaking. More recently, when Mr. Weinstein heard that Jessica Lewis, a casting director on the television show \u201cMarco Polo,\u201d was discussing his behavior toward women, he told her, \u201cI have ears and eyes everywhere!\u201dJust before the Times investigation was published, Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Reiter to speak favorably about him to reporters: \u201cIf you don\u2019t help me, 180 people will lose their jobs,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said, according to the finance official.When he refused, Mr. Weinstein threatened: \u201cYou\u2019re not so clean either \u2014 I have stuff on you,\u201d he said, referring to a decades-old anecdote about Mr. Reiter repeatedly calling a female co-worker. Mr. Reiter said that he saw her being grabbed at a bar, tried to intervene and called her multiple times the next day to discuss what had happened.\u201cHis modus operandi was always to try to find something on someone else,\u201d Mr. Reiter said. Through his spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein denied threatening Mr. Reiter.After years of support for Mr. Weinstein, most of the board members have now quit, while publicly staying silent. Privately, at least one expressed loyalty. On Oct. 7, the day before he was ousted from his own company, Mr. Weinstein received an email from the investor Paul Tudor Jones.\u201cI love you,\u201d he wrote, while detailing the steps Mr. Weinstein should take to rehabilitate his image. Mr. Jones told The Times that he condemned Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct and wanted to encourage him to get help.\u201cFocus on the future as America loves a great comeback story,\u201d he wrote to the movie producer.He finished: \u201cThe good news is, this will go away sooner than you think and it will be forgotten!\u201dBrooks Barnes, Barry Meier and William K.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

A former Vogue editor and glossy blond socialite, she is married to the heir of a Colombian beer fortune and has a slew of \u201cIt girl\u201d friends. She could appear easy to dismiss.\u201cWe feel on top of the world right now, and it is a fantastic place to be,\u201d Ms. Nicodemus said.It\u2019s a world dominated by two behemoth competitors who have spent the last year aggressively expanding their territories and strategically carving up the landscape between them. Napoleons of the virtual boulevards, they are locked in an escalating battle for power \u2014 and your wallet. You may not know their names, but they are shaping how you shop.Yoox Net-a-Porter, the largest luxury e-tailer by sales, is one of them. It owns the e-tailers Net-a-Porter, the Outnet, Mr Porter and Yoox; it also operates the e-commerce sites for over 30 luxury brands including Stella McCartney, Dolce & Gabbana and Chlo\u00e9.Farfetch, the other big name, is an online marketplace for 500 independent luxury boutiques and 200 brands as well as the owner of the bricks-and-mortar store Browns in London.Yoox Net-a-Porter promptly responded with \u201cNext Era\u201d: a partnership with brands that debuted with Valentino giving customers access to Valentino products wherever they are, and however they want them.\u201cWe are the leaders in the luxury fashion online space, no question about it,\u201d said Federico Marchetti, the C.E.O. of Yoox Net-a-Porter, from a giant television screen streaming into the glossy \u201cTechnology Hub\u201d in West London that he opened earlier this year. On message in every way, he was doing a virtual interview from Milan. \u201cIf you want me to describe my territory, then that is how I would describe it,\u201d he said.An intense and bespectacled self-made multimillionaire, Mr. Marchetti, 48, was a pioneer in Italian luxury fashion, starting Yoox in 2000 as a platform where end-of-season stock could be sold online, before branching out into full-price designer wares.\u201cIn any industry there are always copycats, but what we do here is come up with ideas first and lead from the front,\u201d Mr. Marchetti said, pointing to the group\u2019s early foray into mobile-commerce (two thirds of sales are on mobile), sales of high-end jewelry online and fresh focus on E.I.P.s: the \u201cextremely important persons\u201d who make up 2 percent of the company\u2019s clientele but contribute 40 percent of revenue. While he seemed relaxed about the group\u2019s plans for growth, Mr. Marchetti scoffed at the notion that anyone may be snapping at his heels.While there was a braggadocio to his words, any first mover inevitably looks behind at the next generation of names adapting their approach to suit ever-evolving contemporary needs. Enter Jos\u00e9 Neves, 43, who founded Farfetch in 2007. Then a shoe-brand owner from Portugal, Mr. Neves chose to create an online marketplace platform helping smaller bricks-and-mortar stores enter the digital world and taking a commission on each purchase, freeing himself from the need to take on the significant inventory risk and working capital requirements of a traditional store (and Yoox Net-a-Porter).\u201cWhat makes us different is that everyone else is operating on a retail model, but we are a platform, not a shop, an enabler not a competitor, and are reaping all the advantages that such a position entails,\u201d the suave Mr. Neves said in London this week. (Although the company is based in Britain, he continues to live in Portugal.)\u201cWe have a completely full plate right now with all our current plans, from consolidating our position locally in key growth markets like China and Korea, and exploration of how to leverage augmented retail and ideas around the store of the future, particularly in relation to Browns,\u201d Mr. Neves said. \u201cWe believe we are the only global luxury platform at scale. Maintaining and building on that is keeping us more than busy.\u201dEspecially as new players start their own incursions into the market and brands ramp up their independent e-commerce operations. High-profile flops like that of Style.com, the Cond\u00e9 Nast-backed venture that shuttered earlier this year, serve as stark reminders that things can easily go wrong.It isn\u2019t surprising, then, that as the big two (and the one that would be three) fight to expand their reach, their focus is on new territories, particularly Asia and the Middle East.\u201cClients from these regions want to make their own decision on purchases, and love the experience of a trunk show and high sense of luxury,\u201d said Ms. Nicodemus of Moda Operandi, noting (or gloating) that the average basket value for its shoppers was $1,300, and \u201cour nearest rival brings in around $650.\u201d\u201cThere is definitely a heightened sense of rivalry across a narrow band of luxury e-commerce players, but there\u2019s also a great deal to play for as it is a growing sector,\u201d she said. \u201cStill, there is no question that everyone is sizing up where to go next.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Dotrice\u2019s command of character voices grows especially virtuosic when unlike types converse: Tyrion and the regular-guy sellsword Bronn, the castrato spymaster Varys and the doddering savant Grand Maester Pycelle.But it\u2019s Dotrice\u2019s narration, even more than his facility with characters, that puts his mark on \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire.\u201d There\u2019s a creaking note in his voice redolent not only of long-ago-and-far-away but also of dinge and rot, the thick sense of lived-in everydayness that most distinguishes Martin\u2019s grubby fantasy world from J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s idealized Middle-earth. And Dotrice\u2019s own aging became part of the developing richness of the series. He was 80 when he recorded the first three audiobooks and pushing 90 when he finished the fourth and the fifth, and he had an old man\u2019s voice \u2014 still robust, but imbued with experience and the long view. His character voices lose suppleness and range in the last two books, but his elders sound more fantastically wizened than ever, and the extra quaver and rasp in his narration only heighten its gravitas.Carlo Rotella is the director of American studies at Boston College and the author, most recently, of \u201cPlaying in Time: Essays, Profiles and Other True Stories.\u201dB. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

I can\u2019t say much about the trip, because I felt somewhat concussed after a spin on the roller coaster that simulates Quidditch. I spent the ride with my eyes closed and hunched over. It was not a good look.A wand was purchased that day, and not long afterward an overenthusiastic young wizard cast a spell with a little too much elbow rotation. The wand snapped in half. Until then, I didn\u2019t believe much in magic, but examining the wand closely for the first time, I marveled that a such a thin reed of resin could require the heft of a credit card to own.So what are the highest profit margins in the toy business? Brand Finance, a brand consulting company based in London, pointed to Lego, putting its operating margins at 34 percent over the last half-decade, compared with 14 percent for Hasbro and 13 percent for Mattel.Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst at BMO Capital Markets, named both Lego and Thomas & Friends, the maker of toy trains for little kids, which he said also had an operating profit margin in excess of 30 percent.\u201cReally, it\u2019s the brand and the brand quality,\u201d he said, adding that high sales volumes eased overhead costs.\u201cParents feel good about letting their kids play with LEGO.

{"Headline": "In Spending Spree, European Mall Operator Bets on Westfield", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent years, the news has been nothing but bad for malls.With the rise of Amazon and other online shopping options, consumers have skipped treks to the sprawling malls that dot the American landscape, preferring to click-and-shop from the comfort of home. Struggling to adapt, the stores that once lined the interiors of malls, from RadioShack to The Limited, filed for bankruptcy. Then, department store giants like Sears, J. C. Penney and others \u2014 long the reliable anchors of malls everywhere \u2014 began shuttering properties at a fast and furious pace.But now, a megadeal is signaling that there may still be life after all in the American mall \u2014 especially the luxury version. On Tuesday, the European property company Unibail-Rodamco said it had agreed to acquire the Westfield Corporation for $15.7 billion.For Westfield, which was built by Frank Lowy, the Australian billionaire tycoon who started with one shopping center outside of Sydney in 1959, the deal allows the family to exit at a hefty premium. Unibail-Rodamco\u2019s cash-and-shares offer was 18 percent above Westfield\u2019s closing price on Monday. The Lowy family said it intended to retain a stake in the company.The acquisition came amid growing expectations that mall operators, many which have seen their real-estate investments battered badly, are ripe for alliances. Just this week, GGP, the rebranded General Growth Properties, turned down a $14.8 billion bid from Brookfield Property Partners for the shares of GGP it didn\u2019t already own. Activist hedge fund investors have taken stakes in Macerich and Taubman Centers.European shopping center owners have fared relatively well this year, with many of the biggest owners reporting gains in rental income. Unibail-Rodamco, whose real estate portfolio also includes office and convention space, said that rental income from its shopping center arm was up 4.1 percent to 781 million euros, or about $920 million, in the first half of the year.But their counterparts in the United States have struggled. That\u2019s due, in part, to the fact that retail real estate expanded at a much more rapid clip in the United States than it did in Europe, so the pullback has been much sharper.In the United States, there appears to be two bets emerging on the future of malls, analysts said.Higher-end malls \u2014 those that are in wealthier suburbs and have attracted a blend of luxury retailers with gyms, organic grocery stores, and even urgent-care centers \u2014 will survive or even thrive. Lower-end malls located in less-prosperous locations will continue to see stores shutter and will most likely be snapped up by bargain-hunting investors, who may seek new tenants for the properties \u2014 or just raze them.This summer, a group of Wall Street analysts predicted that nearly a quarter of the roughly 1,100 malls in America would close in the next five years.\u201cThere are a fair amount of distressed malls out there where an experienced owner is going to get a distressed buy and figure out what type of tenants can support a particular area,\u201d said David Kessler, a managing partner in the real-estate practice of CohnReznick.There, shoppers who sign up online for a reserved parking place have their license plates scanned before the gate is lifted and are directed to a space under a monitor. While the mall has its share of typical fashion retailers, it also has an Equinox gym, a medical clinic and, next year, a cryotherapy clinic.Westfield also owns a number of premier shopping centers in Britain and is developing a new shopping center adjacent to Linate Airport in Milan that is expected to be completed in 2020.Still, no matter how trophy the mall, they still face the same pressures.The Westfield World Trade Center has been open for more than a year and in that short time it has dealt with delays, lawsuits and staunch competition from its next door neighbor, Brookfield Place, which is offering more luxe shopping options like Burberry, Gucci and Herm\u00e8s.Located near a PATH train hub and within the soaring Oculus structure designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the Westfield World Trade Center mall was largely bereft of shoppers on Tuesday afternoon.While the two-floor Apple store buzzed with shoppers, the same could not be said of Dior, Hugo Boss and Breitling, where employees stood around looking at their phones or chatting with one another.In the middle, near a set of pop-up stores, a woman read traditional holiday stories to children seated around her. One of her titles: \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas.\u201dZach Wichter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.\u201dWithin weeks, the letters begin to arrive from the Review of Books to your Berkeley, Calif., cottage. In total, you will receive 63, in seven manila envelopes. One man sends a picture of himself naked, except for sunglasses balanced on his nose. He includes a poem detailing his disgust with older women. Another confesses he\u2019s married. A 72-year-old man with a Gramercy Park address tells you that he\u2019s very horny. The address is encouraging. The inelegance of \u201chorny\u201d is not. It lands him in the \u201cno\u201d pile, along with the married man and the naked man. The \u201cyes\u201d suitors come in a variety of ages, occupations and locations, but they have one thing in common: They can write a good sentence. For you \u2014 a lover of Trollope, Dickinson, Chekhov \u2014 fine writing arouses like the male body.Among the yeses is a man you agree to meet in a Manhattan cafe. You\u2019ll refer to him as Sidney in your 2003 memoir, \u201cRound-Heeled Woman: My Late-Life Adventures in Sex and Romance.\u201d (All your men have pseudonyms.) You will eventually have sex with Sidney in a conference room at his office. Before him, there\u2019s Jonah, who flies out to California for three nights in a hotel, during which you learn he\u2019s 82 (he said he was somewhat older than you in an email). He steals your Champagne flutes and your pajama bottoms. Next comes Robert from Manhattan. He is 72, tall, slim, a martini drinker. He takes you to the opera, wants to know your fantasies, traces your body from head to toe with his finger and is one of the most skilled lovers you will ever know. You fall in love. But Robert, who struggles with impotence and has another girlfriend, is fickle in his passions.So you keep moving forward. John, a New England recluse, has graceful legs and charm. He sucks on candy \u2014 he\u2019s beating a smoking habit \u2014 when he performs oral sex on you. And your phone-sex partner, Matt, speaks of sex positions and Roethke poems in a voice practiced in seduction.What do you want from all this? Not marriage. You aren\u2019t eager to pick up dirty clothes or stop your sexual adventures. Also, your lovers tend to live in New York City, and you won\u2019t move away from your son, Andy, his wife and their new baby in California. (Andy, incidentally, will never read your book. Who wants to know such things about his mother?) What you do want is connection, which both good sex and good conversation create. You are also on a mission to shed the inhibitions of your youth, when your mother shunned all hints of your sexuality and warned of the dangers of men, and you favored XL sweatshirts to hide your breasts. Now a feminist who reads Shere Hite\u2019s writing on female sexuality, you reclaim the desires pushed down for too long. You lust for men\u2019s asses, their long, muscled legs, that flat space between their buckle and their hipbone, their penises. Menopause has not dampened desire but only made you bolder. When you wonder aloud to your therapist why Manhattanites seem to stare at you, he notes, \u201cPeople recognize the libido when they see it.\u201dWhich is not to say that it is easy to take your clothes off in front of new men or to make love with the lights on. But you do it, again and again, including with Graham, who arrives in the final packet of letters and, at 32, is more than three decades your junior. He has never dated someone older, never answered a personal ad. But he is coming off a bad breakup and is intrigued by your words. The conversations start by email, then phone, then in person, during which you share passions and opinions about John Singer Sargent, \u00c9mile Zola, Herman Melville, W.H. Auden, Jane Austen. Graham is not only one of the most intellectual men you have ever met, but he is also six feet tall, with green eyes and an unabashed eroticism. In his first letter, he proclaims that \u201csex is extremely important to me, and my proficiency is quite good.\u201d Later, at a picnic lunch in Battery Park, after pouring you wine, he explains that he doesn\u2019t drink because he has \u201cno inhibitions, so nothing to release.\u201d That night, he lays you down on your hotel bed, kneels naked and tells you how sexy you are.But age and the width of a country stand between you. Less than two years after you first meet, Graham will marry someone his own age, in his own city. Your heart will fracture. Still, the men keep arriving. After your book is published, they call you and come to your book readings. Some think you will be an easy lay, not understanding that intellect is part of your criteria. Others are just lonely. At the end of one reading, a man who looks like Clark Gable in his older years, with the cleanest fingernails you\u2019ve ever seen, asks you for a drink. He tells you he is married but promises to give you as much of himself as you can handle. If you were 50, you would run the other way. But now, in your mid-70s, the sex, the travel and the companionship are welcome, even if your heart pays a price. He will not leave his wife.In your final days, it is Graham who returns. In fact, he never really left. He is still married, but on his frequent business trips to California, you take long walks and talk about relationships, writing, books, love. He is your muse. You are his best friend. He reads all your work and gives you the idea for your novel, \u201cMrs. Bennet Has Her Say.\u201d Now, before he leaves, you have a request: Kiss me, you say, as we used to. He leans over your bedside and places his mouth fully on yours, one last time.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "The Bitcoin Boom: In Code We Trust", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet as Bitcoin continues to grow, there\u2019s reason to think something deeper and more important is going on. Bitcoin\u2019s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code. It is a trend that transcends finance: In our fear of human error, we are putting an increasingly deep faith in technology.What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like \u201990s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: Where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over.Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other people\u2019s money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change.We might add that major governments \u2014 the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks and enforcers of contracts \u2014 do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens \u2014 Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the world\u2019s citizens might be looking for alternatives.This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a \u201cblockchain,\u201d a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested.This isn\u2019t to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the N.F.L., Stability Comes With a $200 Million Price Tag", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballIn a word, continuity, numerous owners said, and the start of a smooth transition to new leadership, as Goodell begins the process of finding a suitable successor to take over when his deal expires in 2024, if he does not decide to leave sooner.Goodell, the owners acknowledge, is hardly the perfect leader for North America\u2019s most successful sports league. His tenure, they know, has been filled with missteps and controversies, unforced errors and self-inflicted wounds.But he has worked for the league for 35 years, and he knows, better than anyone, the owners, their ancestors and their progeny. That is no small thing. He knows which ones he must listen to, and which ones he can pretend to listen to, and how to finesse them. The same goes for the media titans who have helped turn the N.F.L. into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. During his tenure as commissioner, which began in 2006, Goodell has helped team values skyrocket, and the owners are betting that will continue under his leadership.\u201cYou can\u2019t be cutting off your nose to spite your face,\u201d one owner said of his colleagues who want to replace Goodell for his missteps, most notably in his handling of player discipline and off-field controversies. \u201cPeople tend to focus on the things he did wrong. But who\u2019s going to replace him? That\u2019s when things bog down.\u201dThe owners did not want to speak publicly about league business before Wednesday\u2019s owners\u2019 meetings.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones tried for months to undermine the new deal, arguing that Goodell should not be rewarded with a new contract while the league was facing big challenges, like the decline in television ratings and player protests during the national anthem. Jones hired the star lawyer David Boies and threatened to sue his fellow owners if they did not halt the contract talks, a move that led to his ouster last month from the compensation committee.At the one-day owners\u2019 meetings here on Wednesday, Jones and several of his allies continued to quietly complain about the deal, Goodell\u2019s leadership and a league office they believe is filled with too many meddlesome executives.Speaking after the meeting, Goodell tried to downplay the friction created by his contract extension. He said that the league was stronger because owners were able to disagree, both among themselves and with the commissioner. He added that his relationship with Jones has not been damaged.\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, I\u2019m not paid to agree and he\u2019s not paid to agree with me,\u201d Goodell said.Goodell then gave Jones an awkward hug and left the room.Jones took the podium and said the owners will consider changing the N.F.L.\u2019s constitution to give them more sway over league executives, including the commissioner. He added that the owners would look at trimming the power of the department that investigates off-field behavior by players.Jones tried to downplay the tension he created when he threatened to sue the owners on the compensation committee, saying that he was only trying to improve the league. But he also took a dig at the size of the commissioner\u2019s new contract.\u201cI know how much Roger Goodell loves the National Football League, and he should love it even more right now,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Jones failed to derail Goodell\u2019s new contract because of a basic truth: Whatever their differences, most owners believe Goodell is still the best man to lead the league, and they know there is no credible replacement they could agree on. That\u2019s why, in May, the owners voted unanimously to extend his contract through 2024, and they raised little fuss when the compensation committee offered him a deal worth up to $40 million a year.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the compensation committee, said on Wednesday that most of the other owners were glad the fight with Jones was over.\u201cThe owners were bothered by anything that was a distraction from the league, the league\u2019s business,\u201d Blank said. \u201cThere was a strong feeling in the room that we need to bond together, be together.\u201dMany owners say it would be risky to replace Goodell at a critical juncture for the N.F.L. Roughly half of the league\u2019s revenue comes from broadcast and media deals, yet television ratings are down for the second straight year. In the coming years, networks could balk at paying even more for the rights to show games as the league continues to chip away at the legacy media companies\u2019 traditional lock on N.F.L. content. Digital media companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, have shown little appetite for competing for rights that now cost more than $1 billion a year.Some of the world\u2019s most prosperous companies clamor to become league sponsors, but that enthusiasm has been eroded by a series of public relations disasters, including, most recently, the protests during the national anthem.\u201cWe take that very seriously,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThose are issues that are important to us. We want to make sure all of our employees, whether at the NFL Network or league office, or at clubs, are working in a safe and comfortable environment.\u201dAlso, with the league\u2019s labor agreement set to expire in 2020, and its television contracts expiring in 2021 and 2022, Goodell\u2019s institutional knowledge could be difficult to replace. He has been willing to cede much of the power during labor and media negotiations to a handful of key owners, something a hypothetical replacement might not be willing to do.\u201cIn an industry as complicated as ours, with fans, media, owners and players, you have to have someone who understands the league\u2019s business,\u201d another owner said. \u201cYou need to understand each owner\u2019s personality, understand the process and understand how to get votes.\u201dStill, several owners said that they have protected themselves in case Goodell falters. They structured his contract so that 90 percent of his compensation is based on financial and nonfinancial goals, and the members of three influential committees made up of about 20 owners will decide whether he meets the targets.According to several owners, Goodell has already said that he will not seek another contract beyond 2024, when he will be 65. Grooming a successor, or searching for one outside the league\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters, will be one of his chief responsibilities. One owner added that Goodell may leave after a new labor deal is struck or the league\u2019s broadcast contracts are renewed, and not finish his contract.\u201cI think there is a limit to how many years you should serve in this,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared and ready to go.\u201dAt the very least, the fight over Goodell\u2019s contract and his leadership skills has forced the owners to openly discuss the league\u2019s future, another owner said. With the contract dispute seemingly resolved, the owners are confronting the far more complex and daunting tasks ahead.Advertisement"}

That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content.

{"Headline": "Irina Ratushinskaya and How to Be Free in the Gulags", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1954At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dThe daughter of an engineer and schoolteacher, she started writing poems as a child. At her university, a boyfriend was surprised to learn that she had never read the great poets of Russia\u2019s Silver Age. He brought her illegal volumes of Marina Tsvetayeva, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam. Reading them, Ratushinskaya made two galling discoveries: one, that the Soviets had denied students of her generation knowledge of this great work; the other, that in her own poems, she had unconsciously echoed Russian modernist gestures without understanding them. The poets may have been banned, but fragments of their work drifted through the culture. Ratushinskaya vowed to scrap \u201call my unknowingly stolen black horses, weeping accordions, white swans and gypsies\u201d and start over again.In \u201cGulag,\u201d a history of the Soviet labor-camp system, Anne Applebaum describes the development, over decades, of prisoners\u2019 political consciousness: a growing organization, solidarity and rebelliousness among camp inmates that led them to stage work strikes, protests and hunger strikes. Whereas in the 1930s prisoners were ordinary Soviet citizens who were bewildered and ashamed to find themselves arrested, the prisoners of the postwar and post-Stalin eras were more likely to be former soldiers or partisans from the Western republics, experienced in organized resistance. The early 1960s saw the publication of Solzhenitsyn\u2019s novel about camp life, \u201cOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,\u201d as well as memoirs of former prisoners, which were widely read in Soviet society and did much to chip away at the perceived legitimacy of the regime. In the 1960s many of the prisoners were active dissidents, and by the 1970s, they also had contacts with sympathizers in the West. In 1983, when Ratushinskaya was sentenced, she was joining a network of political prisoners that had well-developed methods for smuggling information out to free society. When she met four of the women whose prison barracks she would be sharing, Ratushinskaya recognized all their names from Western radio broadcasts. They were well-known dissidents whom she admired. \u201cGray Is the Color of Hope\u201d (1988), her memoir about her more than three years in the gulag, describes not only hunger strikes, force-feedings and punitive stays in solitary confinement but also the intense camaraderie of the political prisoners, who made a point of treating each other humanely in inhumane conditions.Ratushinskaya\u2019s two memoirs are, in effect, books about how to be free even when no authority will recognize your rights. When you are free, you write poems without permission. You risk comfort and safety to attend demonstrations. You memorize the Soviet penal code so that you can trip up your interrogators. You and your fellow inmates plant vegetable gardens on scraps of land outside your barracks, and when the weather is good you carry your dining table outdoors to have your camp gruel and strictly rationed cup of tea in the fresh evening air. \u201cThe day died like a dog and won\u2019t come back,/So let\u2019s arrange a splendid funeral feast,\u201d begins one of her poems from the camp. \u201cWe take another lovely draught, and let/The dusk carry us back to some lost place.\u201dShe was released in 1986, after Gorbachev came to power. She lived in Britain and the United States until 1998, when she and her husband decided to return to Russia so that they could raise their young sons among Russian speakers. She continued to write poetry as well as fiction. The Soviet and Western publics lost interest in the dissidents after the fall of the Soviet Union. Their skills didn\u2019t seem to translate to the post-Soviet political landscape, and what was the point of their tactical knowledge and experience once the empire fell? Seen as a struggle against totalitarianism, their efforts seemed to belong to history. But seen more broadly as a struggle against corruption and abuse of power, their example may be of some use after all.Elaine Blair is a writer whose work has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper\u2019s and The New York Review of Books.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him.

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island.

Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Even a President\u2019s Clemency Couldn\u2019t Save DeMarlon Thomas", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.After graduating from Saginaw High, Thomas headed to a Division III community college in Minnesota to play football. He lasted there only a year, then asked his mom to come get him, saying school just wasn\u2019t his thing. By then, Saginaw\u2019s violent-crime rate was among the highest in the nation. His mother, a substitute teacher, begged her only child to stay in college \u2014 for the degree, the opportunities, the chance to move beyond Saginaw \u2014 but he told her he missed his grandma too much. \u201cI cried all the way on the ride to get him, and all the way home,\u201d his mother remembers.Thomas moved back in with Willie Jane. He fell in with the crew from his south-side neighborhood, a gang called Sunny Side. Its members were kids Thomas grew up with \u2014 kids who had long looked out for one another in a city land-mined with violence and overwhelmed by despair. The police, though, blamed Sunny Side for escalating the drug dealing, shootouts and drive-by killings, impelled by gang rivalries. Without football to keep him occupied, Thomas joined the one industry that was thriving: drugs. A year later, he was convicted of selling 0.008 ounce of crack cocaine and put on probation. The court extended his probation when, a few months later, he negotiated a $20 sale of crack.By then, the F.B.I., the A.T.F., state troopers and the local police were in the midst of a three-year investigation of the Sunny Side gang. In 2007, they indicted 17 of its members, including Thomas, on federal charges. Thomas pleaded guilty to distributing a quarter-ounce of crack. At the time, the mandatory minimums of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d were leading courts to impose long sentences on \u201ccareer offenders,\u201d the biggest felons, to keep them off the streets as long as possible. The judge concluded that Thomas, with two state convictions for dealing drugs, was a \u201ccareer offender.\u201dHis defense attorney, Amy Grace Gierhart, argued that he shouldn\u2019t be treated like one, telling the judge, \u201cThere is nothing to indicate that Mr. Thomas is anything more than a small-time, street-level seller.\u201d She noted that the federal Sentencing Commission had concluded that applying \u201ccareer offender\u201d to low-level dealers has a disproportionate impact on black defendants, the ones most visible because they more often sell out in the open in poor, minority neighborhoods. The judge was not persuaded.When Gierhart told Thomas he was potentially looking at 22 years in prison, he was dumbfounded. \u201cBut Miss Gierhart,\u201d she remembers him saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never even done any jail time.\u201d She told him she did her best. \u201cAnd he just said, \u2018Well, O.K.,\u2019 and then he thanked me. He was a really extraordinary client \u2014 always very kind, very courteous, more so than regular courtesy, and very gentle.\u201d She credits his connection with his grandmother.In prison, Thomas called Willie Jane every Sunday morning \u2014 and if anyone else phoned her while she waited for that call, she scolded whoever was occupying her line: \u201cYou know that boy\u2019s calling me today!\u201dIn other ways, though, prison changed Thomas. \u201cHe went in there blaming his problems on the world,\u201d says his father, Ricardo Foster. \u201cBut he came to realize he was the one hurting himself. He really grew up.\u201d Thomas befriended older inmates, who mentored him. He took responsibility for his son, born shortly before Thomas was indicted. He worked out, dropping from a size 52 waist to a size 36. He talked about how much he wished the boys and young men in Saginaw would quit killing one another. Twice a year, Thomas\u2019s father drove from his Detroit home, picked up Willie Jane and Thomas\u2019s son and made the six-hour trip to prison so they all could visit.Thomas\u2019s mentors told him that President Obama was soliciting clemency applications from nonviolent offenders, to help reverse decades of harsh sentencing. Clemency, Obama wrote, was one step \u201cto restore a degree of justice, fairness and proportionality to the system.\u201dJust before Thanksgiving in 2016 \u2014 with eight years in prison behind him and 11 more to go \u2014 Thomas learned that the president had commuted his sentence and those of 78 other inmates, having noted that they probably would have received much shorter terms if convicted under his administration. In his letter to Thomas, Obama wrote: \u201cYou have demonstrated the potential to turn your life around. Now it is up to you to make the most of this opportunity.\u201d Gierhart, who had been haunted by Thomas\u2019s long sentence, sobbed when she heard he would soon be free.A year before Thomas\u2019s sentence was commuted, his grandmother learned she had cancer that had spread to her lungs. \u201cMy mom was really, really sick,\u201d Thomas\u2019s mother says. \u201cI had to feed her, take her to the bathroom, put her in a wheelchair. But when she heard DeMarlon was coming home, she was up and doing things. She could stand up, she could walk, and a few times she even cooked for him.\u201dOn Dec. 13, 2016, at age 31, Thomas was moved to a Saginaw halfway house, where he was allowed out for several hours a day as part of his reintegration. Thomas was uneasy that the facility was on the north side, home to Sunny Side\u2019s fiercest rivals, but aside from that, he was elated to be back home. Early each morning, he texted his friends and family. \u201cLove you,\u201d he would write. \u201cEnjoy life.\u201d \u201cHave a great day.\u201d And of course, he visited his grandmother.On Jan. 23, less than six weeks after Thomas left prison, two masked men carrying semiautomatic assault rifles burst into the halfway house through an unsecured door. One held the other inmates and employees at gunpoint; the other shot Thomas multiple times at close range. The police called it an execution. When Willie Jane found out he had been shot, his mother says, she stopped talking, stopped eating and refused her medicine. She died on March 19 \u2014 three days before Thomas was scheduled for release from the halfway house to become a truly free man.The police have yet to make an arrest.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California.

{"Headline": "Should Buyers Be Told About the Killer Next Door?", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI live in a one-family house adjacent to the house of a family whose son was a serial killer 25 years ago. He was 20 at the time and killed two people. He was recently released and now lives there. My son will inherit our house after us and plans to live elsewhere closer to work. A house is for living in, and you might conclude that things that don\u2019t affect its use for that purpose are up to you to divulge or not. Yet a house is also an investment, and buyers reasonably want to know about circumstances that could affect its resale value. The simple fact that a buyer would want to know something, though, doesn\u2019t require you to tell them.Some buyers might be deterred by the fact that a previous occupant had AIDS, that the house is believed to be haunted, that there\u2019s a senior-living facility in the neighborhood, that there\u2019s a mosque at the corner or that a mentally disabled person lives across the street. Depending on your pool of prospective buyers, these things could affect the home\u2019s resale value. So you might think that these facts should be disclosed as latent defects, akin to poorly insulated pipes that freeze in the winter. Yet by doing so, you\u2019d be acquiescing to prejudice and superstition.I\u2019m not talking about the law here, but it\u2019s notable that a number of states don\u2019t require you to disclose the presence of sex offenders in your neighborhood or the fact that your home was once a murder site. Owing to fair-housing laws, there\u2019s a general prohibition on discussing the ethnic or religious composition of a neighborhood. (The disclosure of some of the other circumstances I listed earlier could be prohibited, too.) Legislators, guided by moral concerns, have decided that transparency isn\u2019t the only value to be considered.In this welter of things that you must disclose, may disclose and must not disclose, where should we situate your neighbor\u2019s troubled past? Obviously, most buyers would want to know about it. But there are reasons for doubting that they have a right to be told. One is that the legal system has judged the murderer next door to have paid his debt. We need to rehabilitate offenders, even murderers. That is one aim of a decent system of criminal justice.Calling him a serial killer suggests that you think he\u2019s mentally ill in a way that poses a continuing threat to others. But if that were so, the courts should have committed him until psychiatrists were convinced he posed no danger. Putting aside the movie stereotype of the serial killer, what you really know is that this is someone who killed two people. A sane person who has just spent a quarter of a century in a prison cell for murder would know that he\u2019d be the first suspect if anything happened near his home. Reoffense rates for people like your neighbor are hard to come by, but in her 2012 book \u201cLife After Murder,\u201d the journalist Nancy Mullane identified a thousand convicted murderers who were paroled in California over the previous two decades; not one was rearrested for murder.The likelihood is that buyers would react irrationally to the information about your neighbor. That is emphatically true if you were to call him a serial killer, which evokes an image of someone meticulously planning the murders of innocent strangers. If a buyer asks a question, you ought not to lie. But you can certainly say, for example, that you don\u2019t want to spread gossip about the neighbors. Only if you have reason to think that the fellow next door poses a significant threat do you need to talk about his history.I am Facebook friends with a well-known practitioner in my field. I\u2019ve never met him, but he posts interesting things and blogs about various developments in our field. I sometimes comment on his blog.One morning I saw a bunch of posts in my Facebook feed featuring pictures and such from a somewhat flamboyant blond woman with the same last name as this fellow. Having never seen her before, I assumed she was his spouse, and I\u2019d somehow accepted her friend request. There were a lot of posts that I was not interested in (fashion, glamour), so I quickly unfriended her. I continued to scroll down and saw her first post \u2014 she had just come out as trans. She was formerly he, the practitioner I knew and followed. My husband and I have our medical insurance through a Medicare Advantage insurance plan. In addition to paying monthly premiums and having Medicare payments deducted from our monthly Social Security benefits, we paid, in 2016, more than $6,000 for prescriptions, doctors\u2019 visits and other medical expenses that were not covered by our insurance.As a perk, our plan offers gift cards when a member participates in certain \u201cbest practices\u201d such as having an annual flu shot, an annual physical or a mammogram. When I recently called to request a $50 gift card (you can select gift cards to several restaurants or shopping sites such as Amazon or Target) after having my annual physical, my husband became extremely angry and told me to cancel my request. He insisted that by requesting these gift cards I was participating in the high cost of medical insurance. I told him he was being ridiculous and refused to do so. (The gift card for a flu shot is $10.)Of course, if you wanted to avoid the complexities, you could adopt a policy of not accepting any gifts at all. That way you could truthfully say, \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but I have a policy of not accepting gifts from patients.\u201d A response like that might still be regarded as disrespectful by people in some communities, with contrary customs, but that\u2019s much less likely if you report your refusal as one of your own customs.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Facebook Job Ads Raise Concerns About Age Discrimination", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was written through collaboration between The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.A few weeks ago, Verizon placed an ad on Facebook to recruit applicants for a unit focused on financial planning and analysis. The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be \u201cmore than just a number.\u201dSome relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation\u2019s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.Verizon is among dozens of the nation\u2019s leading employers \u2014 including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Target and Facebook itself \u2014 that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook\u2019s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it unlawful to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unlawful,\u201d said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.The precision of Facebook\u2019s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 \u2014 and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user\u2019s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for \u201cpart-time package handlers,\u201d United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. State Farm pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. \u201cWe completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Facebook.After being contacted by ProPublica and The Times, other employers, including Amazon, Northwestern Mutual and the New York City Department of Education, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.\u201cWe recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,\u201d said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. \u201cWe have corrected those ads.\u201dVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.\u201cWhat happens with Facebook is you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten & Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn\u2019t pretend to know what he doesn\u2019t know, but he has his suspicions.Mr. Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. \u201cOnce you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cHypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,\u201d Mr. Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.She added that \u201cthe use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn\u2019t want to target ads at him: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who\u2019s disabled?\u201dOne reason is that Facebook\u2019s sheer size \u2014 two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn\u2019s 530 million total members \u2014 gives recruiters access to types of workers they can\u2019t find elsewhere.Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to use LinkedIn,\u201d said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. \u201cNurses are predominantly female, there\u2019s a larger volume of Facebook users. That\u2019s what they use.\u201dThere are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but who check Facebook obsessively.Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed \u201cto start bringing younger blood\u201d into their organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that we wouldn\u2019t take someone older,\u201d these clients say, according to Ms. Andrychuk, \u201cbut if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.\u201dMs. Andrychuk said that \u201cwe coach clients to be open and not discriminate\u201d and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn\u2019t exclude any age groups.But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm\u2019s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.\u201cWe welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cFor some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.\u201dPauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account \u201creasonable factors\u201d that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don\u2019t rely on the characteristic explicitly.In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to \u201cself-certify\u201d that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.Still, Facebook didn\u2019t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges when placing an employment ad, unless they affirm that the ad is not discriminatory.With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency \u2014 collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to \u201caid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing\u201d of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.\u201cThey may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook\u2019s age-targeting of employment ads.Mr. Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, \u201cno one over 55 need apply.\u201d But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook\u2019s offering of age-targeted customization.\u201cDepending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development\u201d of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.Julia Angwin and Ariana Tobin are reporters at ProPublica.

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly.

They were an exotic and beautiful new species.The rise of the cardinal tetra \u2014 Paracheirodon axelrodi, now one of the world\u2019s most popular aquarium fish \u2014 helped make Axelrod, in the words of the trade publication Practical Fishkeeping, perhaps \u201cthe single most influential fishkeeper the hobby and industry has seen.\u201d But Axelrod\u2019s tale of discovery is a myth: As he himself admitted early on, he had actually acquired the tetras not in the Amazon but from a dealer in Irvington, N.J. (The dealer got them from the discus monopolist. Nonetheless, after a technical yet dramatic dispute, an international commission named the fish for Axelrod.) Inventing a new origin story, Axelrod didn\u2019t just change the facts; he spun a personal legend, which he clung to as he self-promoted his way to pet-industry fortune. After all, it not only legitimized his \u201cdiscovery\u201d but also, accompanied by digressions about befriending Indians and swimming with piranhas, presented him as \u201cthe Indiana Jones of ichthyology,\u201d as one hobbyist put it, which he must have preferred to the P.T. Barnum of pet fish.Raised in North Jersey during the Depression, Axelrod supposedly spoke five languages by age 5 and swam across Lake Ontario at 10. He was also crazy about pet pigeons (which he collected, alongside fossils and rare violins, in adulthood too). The pivot to fish came in his 20s, when he studied at New York University, served in the Army and found time to publish tropical-fish handbooks and start Tropical Fish Hobbyist. In 1965, Sports Illustrated called him \u201can intrepid ichthyologist and explorer,\u201d trumpeting dozens of claims: He could recognize more than 7,000 kinds of fish by sight. He once landed at the Trinidad airport, approached a pool near the runway and, as onlookers gasped, netted a new species. \u201cHe was once censured by a professor,\u201d the magazine reported, \u201cfor performing a Caesarean on a guppy.\u201dGuppy surgeon or not, his importance was undeniable. In an era before web forums and Google, collectors turned to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Axelrod\u2019s dozens of books: \u201cKoi of the World,\u201d \u201cThe Allure of Discus,\u201d \u201cTropical Fish for Those Who Care.\u201d His company, TFH Publications, became a dominant pet-book publishing conglomerate, which catered to gecko and gerbil fanciers alike and invested in tetra farms and chew toys. He smoked Cuban cigars and boasted of collecting sea slugs with Emperor Hirohito, spearfishing with King Leopold III and corresponding with Winston Churchill about goldfish. He also, reportedly, became pen pals with prisoners in Indiana, who, he claimed, had for decades hidden pet fish in vials strapped to their bodies.In his later years, Axelrod restyled himself as a philanthropist: After he sold TFH Publications in 1997 for $70 million and a $10 million loan, he became best known for collecting Stradivarius violins and other prestigious stringed instruments, many of which he gave to the Smithsonian or sold to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. (A 2003 Times Magazine profile of Axelrod was headlined \u201cMedici of the Meadowlands.\u201d) But this narrative didn\u2019t last. In 2004, he was indicted on federal tax-fraud charges and accused of hiding money in Switzerland; separately, in one of many lawsuits he attracted, TFH\u2019s new owners sued him for misrepresenting its finances, and a Senate committee investigated whether he inflated the value of some of his instruments. He fled to Cuba \u2014 \u201cHerbert Axelrod sits in an oceanfront bungalow at the Hemingway Marina, a fugitive from justice, poring over photographs of hamsters,\u201d The Star-Ledger reported from Havana \u2014 and was later extradited from Germany. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Paradoxically, as a hobbyist observed on MonsterFishKeepers.com, Axelrod, confined like a tetra in a tank, ended up \u201cliving the life of a fish.\u201d\u201cI will be remembered as someone who disrespected the law,\u201d Axelrod lamented in 2005. But after his death in May in Switzerland, tributes rang out from admirers as disparate as the violinist Joshua Bell and the Australian Society for Fish Biology. And his name still adheres to more than a dozen species, including, of course, Paracheirodon axelrodi. For Axelrod, the tetra wasn\u2019t just a discovery or a pet. It wasn\u2019t just the profound beginning of fortune and notoriety. It was a symbol of our all-too-human foibles and obsessions, real and imagined, the stuff of emperors and prisoners and priests.Daniel Fromson is a copy editor for the magazine.

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures.

Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island.

Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Australian Debut Brings Excitement, Dread and Defiance", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut people who posted on social media about Amazon\u2019s debut were generally underwhelmed, with prospective Australian customers playfully pointing out lackluster product offerings and uncompetitive pricing.One New York Times reporter spotted a pair of shoes listed in the website\u2019s cookware section, a sign of the site\u2019s growing pains.Some compared Amazon\u2019s unremarkable Australian debut with that of another digital giant: Netflix. When that service arrived in Australia in 2015, it offered a notably leaner offering of its streaming-on-demand product, especially in comparison with its American lineup.However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s early days \u2014 it\u2019s Day 1,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. \u201cAs you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you\u2019ll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there.\u201dMr. O\u2019Leary pointed out that at Amazon\u2019s debut, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers \u2014 or third-party vendors \u2014 who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon\u2019s formula of providing large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices.As the number of sellers increases \u2014 and the company\u2019s pricing algorithm takes hold \u2014 its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said.Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon\u2019s entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions.\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to adjust to anything,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in business now for 56 years. I\u2019ve always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I\u2019ll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don\u2019t follow them.\u201dAustralians spend less on the internet than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market.Mr. O\u2019Leary, who has studied Amazon\u2019s impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company\u2019s product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to out-Amazon Amazon \u2014 well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering. Additionally, store-based retailers can take advantage of their retail presence.\u201dBut for some small business owners, the disruption has created opportunity.\u201cWe\u2019ve been following it very closely,\u201d Tristan Swanwick, the co-founder of Swanwick Sleep, an Australian company that sells sleep-aiding glasses, said of Amazon\u2019s debut in Australia.\u201cAs soon as Amazon officially announced they were coming to Australia, we started sending emails and making phone calls\u201d to ensure they would be among the first to team up with Amazon in Australia, he added.Mr. Swanwick said his company initially started its business in the United States through Fulfilled by Amazon, a program that allows small businesses to have Amazon handle things like warehousing, delivery and customer service.\u201cIt really lowers the barrier for entry for small businesses getting started in e-commerce,\u201d he said.Swanwick Sleep was among the first batch of merchants included in Amazon\u2019s Australian offering, easing its efforts to penetrate the Australian market.\u201cOur mother used her spare bedroom to store inventory for us,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would go down to the post office, maybe two or three times a day, depending on demand, to send off orders to Australian customers.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s one of the happiest people in Australia that Amazon is here \u2014 she gets her spare bedroom back,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Return of the Techno-Moral Panic", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe story was a sensation, inspiring a \u201cNightline\u201d feature and drawing the attention of politicians. The full text of the Time article was entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Chuck Grassley, who urged his colleagues to act \u201cto help parents who are under assault in this day and age.\u201d With strong bipartisan support, Congress soon passed the Communications Decency Act, as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which broadly criminalized the transmission of \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d materials to underage internet users. (A Supreme Court ruling in 1997 essentially defanged it.)As moral panics about danger and depravity lost traction, popular tech criticism became nebulous and fretful, concerned with vague themes and forecasts. (\u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d \u201cTinder and the Dawn of the \u2018Dating Apocalypse.\u2019\u2009\u201d) In the absence of coherent critiques, and in the context of a stunningly rapid adoption of smartphones, a righteously defensive posturing about the social consequences of tech went mainstream. Critics were easily dismissed as Luddites, unable to see the future through a misplaced nostalgia for the past. This assumption was frequently vindicated and started to feel a lot like wisdom. As the world truly moved online, abstract fears were repeatedly met with, and answered by, specific, irresistible and unthreatening products and experiences. We had learned our lesson.Our present panics tend to arrive just as new parts of our economy, culture and politics are reconstituted within platform marketplaces \u2014 shifts that have turned out to be bigger than anyone anticipated. Aggravation about \u201cfake news\u201d followed the realization that the business and consumption of online news had been substantially captured by Facebook, which had strenuously resisted categorization as a media company. Children\u2019s entertainment has migrated to new and unexpected venues faster and more completely than either parents or YouTube expected or accounted for. Twitter is now the most effective way to keep up with breaking news, a singular direct line to the president, and a conspicuously mismanaged experiment in centralized public discourse.In this way, these new moral panics do have something in common with Luddism, though not as it is now popularly and mistakenly understood. The original Luddites\u2019 complaint was with the way industrialists were using new textile manufacturing technologies to circumvent labor conventions and to thin their ranks as quickly as possible, not with the technologies themselves. They didn\u2019t so much propose solutions as much as they registered a loud and visceral complaint, smashing machines until they were put down by gunfire. Luddites have been reduced in the popular imagination to misguided fools obstructing the arrival of technologies that we now understand as both primitive and vital to the advance of civilization. Their message was inchoate but fueled by firsthand experience of material change rather than speculative, moralistic doomsaying or elite hand-wringing about what we might have lost.As the internet of 2017 has changed, so has the internet user. We are now in the majority, and our experience is defined by plenitude and freedom, still, but also by a growing sense of exploitation. We find ourselves aware of the power and unaccountability of the new marketplaces in which we socialize, communicate and do business. To cast our recurring panics as technophobic reruns is to misidentify what animates them most: Not fear, but helplessness.It would be a mistake to give credence to every noisy critique of a platform, and some of the inevitable panics about Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 not to mention Amazon \u2014 will be bolstered by sheer reactionary traditionalism. But in more cases, these panics will reveal themselves as concrete complaints, addressed to people and companies whose responsibility for the networks that connect us \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 will finally start to catch up with their power.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "San Francisco\u2019s Skyline, Now Inescapably Transformed by Tech", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi, will be inhabited in January, signaling tech\u2019s triumph in the city.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The skyscraper came late to this city, a shipping and manufacturing hub for much of its existence. The wealthy roosted on the hills and the masses toiled on the flats and the docks. Everyone lived close to the ground in a setting renowned for its natural beauty.Now the things being shipped are virtual, and vast amounts of office space are needed to design, build and market them. Salesforce, a company that did not exist 20 years ago, will take up residence on Jan. 8 in the new Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi.Skyscrapers tell a different story. They are the pyramids of our civilization, permanent monuments of our existence. They show who is in charge and what they think about themselves. Salesforce Tower is breaking a San Francisco height record that stood for nearly half a century.\u201cA ceiling has been breached,\u201d said Alison Isenberg, a professor of urban history at Princeton University. \u201cNow the discussion becomes is this just a building that is taller than the ones we already had, or does it raise new questions about the nature of the city?\u201dSalesforce Tower is visible from just about everywhere. Go to the farthest edges of the city and its 61 stories of tapered steel and glass stick up like a forceful thumb. On the drive north from the airport, the tower is the one building discernible over Potrero Hill. From the distant North Bay, it is the first thing you notice as San Francisco sheds its customary morning fog. The building catches the morning sun, dazzling the way none of its lesser neighbors do.The tower is not beautiful but is impossible to ignore. The top floors are set off from the rest, and the crown is flat rather than a spire. It looks as if a rocket were stowed up there, an escape vehicle for the tech overlords when the city is consumed by disaster.\u201cSan Francisco has gone from being driven by multitudes of industries in 2007 to being now focused largely on tech,\u201d said Colin Yasukochi, a CBRE analyst. \u201cThe growth feeds on itself. Tech workers are attracted to the great opportunities in the city, and the supply of workers means more tech companies come here.\u201dSan Francisco has always been like this. There were so few skyscrapers in the city\u2019s first century that the ones that were built tell a tale of rampant egos and unrestrained power. At the end of the 19th century, the city\u2019s newspapers had hubris and wealth to rival today\u2019s internet companies. In 1890, the owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, M. H. de Young, erected a 10-story building worthy of his publication. It was the tallest building on the West Coast.That irked the new owners of the Call newspaper, the Spreckels family, who in 1895 commissioned a tower of their own mere feet from the Chronicle building. It would be more than half again as tall \u2014 18 stories \u2014 and would be, they promised, \u201cthe finest building ever erected for a newspaper office.\u201d It had a 60-foot terra cotta Baroque dome, four corner cupolas and spectacular flourishes.That was just the beginning. Today\u2019s inhabitants of Silicon Valley are no slouches at self-promotion, but even they could learn something from The Call, which published a report calling its new headquarters \u201cthe crowning achievement of mankind in the Western world.\u201dSalesforce, co-founded and run by Marc Benioff, is wisely saying no such thing. It makes software that lets companies handle their relationships with customers better, and so passes unnoticed by the general public. Next year, it will most likely surpass Wells Fargo as the largest private employer in the city.San Francisco has always had conflicting feelings about growth and wealth. It was a gold rush boomtown but in the 1960s was home to the Diggers, a hippie offshoot that dreamed of a society without money. That notion lingered in a thousand communes.\u201cThe mid-1960s and early 1970s in San Francisco simultaneously saw a downtown building boom and by far the nation\u2019s strongest anti-skyscraper movement,\u201d said Ms. Isenberg, author of \u201cDesigning San Francisco: Art, Land and Urban Renewal in the City by the Bay.\u201d \u201cThey went hand in hand.\u201dThe leader of the opposition was Alvin Duskin, a dress manufacturer \u2014 he is said to be the first to use the peace sign in fashion \u2014 and local agitator. \u201cStop them from burying our city under a skyline of tombstones,\u201d one ad urged, while another proclaimed: \u201cNew studies have shown that the more we build high-rise, the more expensive it becomes to live here.\u201dThe protests had an effect. The Transamerica Pyramid was shaved down from 1,040 feet to 853 feet. A proposition in 1971 to limit buildings to six stories did not pass, but it was one of those defeats that is also a bit of a victory. The Transamerica Pyramid remained the tallest in the city until this year.\u201cA set of compromises was struck over heights and growth and redevelopment that held,\u201d Ms. Isenberg said. \u201cNow they will need to be renegotiated.\u201dThe Transamerica Pyramid became a beloved local landmark and universally recognized symbol of the city. Salesforce, if it is smart and lucky, might see its headquarters become the same. The company\u2019s offices are concentrated on the lower floors, but it is also leasing the 60th and 61st, the latter of which is a 17,000-square-foot event space that nonprofits can use for free. That\u2019s one way to build good will. Already 55 groups have inquired.If Salesforce executives ever get too full of themselves, and become convinced they are the crowning achievement of the Western world, they can seek out the Call building.In 1938, the dome was removed, and the remains were stripped of all architectural splendor. The building \u2014 whose high-tech tenants include a venture capitalist and a DNA sequencing start-up \u2014 is currently getting a face-lift, but its past glory is gone for good.As for The Call itself, the paper disappeared many decades ago, leaving no trace.Advertisement"}

She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus. Another wrote, \u201cConsider taking his courses during 2nd semester because he hates winter, so he\u2019s more sympathetic when grades close in the spring!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1954At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California.

{"Headline": "When Derek Walcott Staked His Claim on English Poetry, He Brought a Tiny Island With Him", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.But poetry was his true calling. To pursue it, he left his native St. Lucia in 1950. His first sojourns were to Jamaica, where he studied, and Trinidad, where he worked as a journalist and founded a theater workshop. As his reputation grew, he would move to the mainland to teach at Boston University and Harvard; he would publish dozens of poetry collections and plays; he would win a MacArthur fellowship and be named an officer of the Order of the British Empire.It was the year he turned 60, though, that Walcott\u2019s masterwork appeared like a revelation, numinous and perfectly formed. \u201cOmeros,\u201d published in 1990, was a book-length poem in which figures on St. Lucia echoed Homeric legend. The form it used, terza rima, is difficult to pull off in English; to try it is to announce your ambition. But even without that, you could appreciate that something audacious was afoot. Like H\u00f6lderlin in German, Shakespeare in English or Walt Whitman in the American we speak, Walcott seemed to be inside the language itself, at one with it. If you were like me \u2014 alive in the falling days of apartheid and the Berlin Wall, entertaining the notion of being a writer \u2014 you might have seen in Walcott\u2019s incandescent marriage of form and worldview something so new as to suggest another way of seeing. You\u2019d have to reach back to T.S. Eliot to find an English-language poet as original and transformational. Eliot remade himself from American arriviste to the central figure in English letters. Walcott, too, wrote his way from the margins to primacy, pulling an entire region with him onto center stage.Writing was, for him, not a career decision but a near-monastic dedication. As he told The Paris Review in 1986, \u201cI have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer.\u201d His days began before sunrise, in a studio within earshot of the sea. \u201cHe was giving his life to it,\u201d says Glyn Maxwell, who studied with Walcott at Boston University during the \u201980s, remained an enduring friend and was entrusted to edit Walcott\u2019s collected work. \u201cHe felt the weight of the great dead poets standing over him. He wanted to be equal to it. I remember running into him one morning before class, and him saying he\u2019d just read some lines of Ovid, then questioning what his work was worth.\u201dIt was in Boston that Walcott forged his truest companionships with other writers, as part of an improbable triumvirate with the Irish writer Seamus Heaney and the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Joseph Brodsky. All three would eventually win the Nobel Prize for literature. They had, as a former student, Sven Birkerts, recalled in the journal AGNI, a friendship of \u201cRabelaisian gusto rarely \u2014 maybe never \u2014 seen in academe.\u201d I remember meeting Walcott when I was a college freshman: After a campus reading, there was a very serious English-department dinner at a mediocre Italian restaurant where, in a bid to one-up each other, Walcott and Brodsky ordered enough bottles of the most expensive wines on the menu for a wedding. They were already old men, and Walcott no longer drank, but they were playing, winking, puncturing the self-importance of what must have been one in a rote series of Very Serious English-Department Dinners. \u201cHe was the sort of poet,\u201d Maxwell says, \u201cfor whom a new day was your first day on the planet.\u201d\u201cHe was generous in the way he invited you into his life,\u201d recalls Caryl Phillips, who met Walcott as a young writer in London. He shared in the private conversation writers engage in across generations, in both his teaching and his friendships. \u201cThere would always be young writers or painters around he\u2019d invited to stay,\u201d says Ann Kjellberg, who first met Walcott as an editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux, his longtime publisher. \u201cThey were just people Derek saw something in.\u201dNot all of his dealings with younger writers were positive: In 1982, a Harvard student charged that Walcott pressured her sexually and retaliated when she rebuffed him, for which he was reprimanded by the university. One former graduate student, Nicole Mary Milligan, sued Walcott and Boston University for sexual harassment in 1996, eventually settling out of court. \u201cI think that his work stands for the ages, and that\u2019s born of a deep humanity he has,\u201d she says now, her voice navigating a suite of complex emotions. \u201cIf this is about his work and how he should be remembered, it\u2019s: He was a great poet.\u201d He was also, she says, \u201cperhaps more human than God intended.\u201dMost artists, however great, remain at the height of their powers for only a brief arc of life, making it even more remarkable that Walcott produced some of his best work in his final volume. \u201cWhite Egrets\u201d is a book of loss and regret, a majestic settling of accounts, a monument to a lifetime of writing and friendship. He dedicated it to a group of younger writers he had invited into his inner circle. In the years since its publication in 2010, I have run into most of those writers \u2014 a far-flung lot, British and Greek and West Indian, some world-renowned and others still rising. At some point in each conversation, after the small talk and gossip, I mentioned \u201cWhite Egrets,\u201d sharing the same sentiment on each occasion: It was a book that made me want to be a writer all over again. Each of them, at whatever station in life or career, looked across the table and said the very same.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said.

Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth.

{"Headline": "The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 Path to Bitcoin Fortune: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday morning. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune\u2022 There is a paucity of women in corporate America\u2019s c-suites.\u2022 Not every analyst is in love with Apple\u2019s stock price.\u2022 A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.\u2022 Apollo\u2019s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.\u2022 They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.\u2022 They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.\u2022 They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.\u2022 The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.And that\u2019s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.Here is Breakingviews\u2019s take:A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.What catalyst will propel Apple\u2019s market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple\u2019s services business?While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple\u2019s market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark.But Nomura Instinet\u2019s Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple\u2019s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:\u201cWe argue that the stock\u2019s gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.\u201dApple\u2019s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.\u201cBefore today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u201cWhile Tuesday\u2019s findings won\u2019t lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.\u201cGermany\u2019s case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service\u2014which include consent for the collection of third-party data.\u201dThe investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.At a hearing on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: \u201cYou have to be the ones to do something about this. Or we will.\u201d\u201cSuch words, coming from tech\u2019s senior hometown senator, shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and Facebook may have the most to lose. The world\u2019s largest social network offers a tempting target for those seeking to spread malicious content, yet Facebook\u2019s financial performance still depends on maintaining the trust of its users.\u201dOver the past five years, an index that tracks hedge fund performance has risen 27.83 percent. Over the past four years, the Pantera Bitcoin Fund exceeded that by nearly 1,000 times.But Dan Morehead, who founded the Pantera fund after an earlier career at Goldman Sachs, said that it was not an easy decision to create a Bitcoin-focused hedge fund in 2013, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a currency for online drug markets.\u201cThe first hard part was actually deciding to launch a crypto currency fund when everyone else thought that was crazy,\u201d he said on Monday.The digital currency flyaroundThe advisersFor Apollo: Deutsche Bank, PJ Solomon, Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & GarrisonFor Jack in the Box and Qdoba: Morgan Stanley, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher-- Michael J. de la MercedMore from David George-Cosh and Jacque McNish of the WSJ:If the stock continues to rise, BlackBerry\u2019s two biggest shareholders, Pasadena, Calif.-based Primecap Management Corp. and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., could support a potential sale, which would allow them to recoup an investment that has long performed poorly, people familiar with the matter said.

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Is a Trivia App the Answer to Questions About Live Streaming?", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are heady times for the creators of HQ Trivia.The app, which broadcasts live shows to iPhones and iPads twice a day, has taken off since its debut in August. Its ability to attract tens of thousands of people to log in for each 15-minute segment in hopes of winning money by answering a dozen trivia questions has some wondering if it has reimagined the TV game show for the cord-cutting era.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of attention on us now because this thing has blown up overnight practically,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said in an interview. \u201cWe have ambitions to essentially build the future of TV, and, yeah \u2014 there is a lot of pressure to get everything right all the time, and I admit that I made a mistake.\u201dThe show, which can be glitchy, is typically hosted by an energetic comedian, Scott Rogowsky, who cracks jokes as he asks a dozen multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty. Players use their touch screens to respond in less than 10 seconds, and the app shows how many people are eliminated after each round. Players can also share their reactions via a rapid-fire chat function at the bottom of the screen.Early questions tend to be on the easier side, like: \u201cWhich president is featured on the U.S. one dollar bill?\u201d Those who answer all the questions correctly share in a prize that has fluctuated between hundreds and thousands of dollars and is distributed via PayPal.Mr. Kroll, a Twitch fan, said that much of what people knew as live video from apps like Twitter\u2019s Periscope lacked a sense of urgency and participation.\u201cThere\u2019s a point-of-view live, where you\u2019re experiencing something through someone else\u2019s phone, and then there\u2019s this idea of interactive video, where the audience is actually a key component of driving the content,\u201d he said. \u201cI became really interested in the latter and saw there was a real absence in the market of that sort of experience.\u201d\u201cWe schedule our lives, but the apps on our phones have been designed to make content available anytime, anywhere,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. \u201cWe suffer from the paradox of choice ultimately \u2014 you search Netflix for 20 minutes and end up watching nothing.\u201dMr. Kroll added that HQ\u2019s schedule was inspiring people to play with co-workers in the afternoon and again with family and friends in the evening, making it more akin to a broadcast TV program.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit trite to say, but things grow because they\u2019re fun,\u201d said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \u201cThis is way more fun than playing a quiz game on your phone and way more fun than watching \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 on TV.\u201dStill, whether HQ can turn its sudden popularity into a long-term business is an open question. Could it ultimately serve as a blueprint for bigger tech companies that have been looking for ways to drum up interest in live video content? Mr. Kroll and Mr. Yusupov were hesitant to share details around how they produce the show and what, if any, parts of HQ could be patented. They also declined to disclose the number of people they employ.\u201cI learned what I do know, and that\u2019s apps and engineers and designers, and I learned what I don\u2019t know, which is how to work with talent and celebrities,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. He added that the company had since hired a public relations representative and a person to manage talent.The men said that HQ had been approached by a bevy of ad agencies and chief marketing officers but that they were still determining how sponsorships could be worked into the app. Mr. Yusupov said brands could potentially fund the prizes, adding that a goal was offering a $1 million prize.Mr. Liew said he was confident in the start-up and its eventual business plan even as he expected other companies to mimic what HQ Trivia had done.\u201cYou have to let time talk and figure out how people are interacting and using something before you have clarity with a business model,\u201d he said. More important, he added, \u201cif you can become part of popular culture, you can figure out a way to make money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Isn\u2019t Watching Too Much TV. He\u2019s Watching the Wrong Kind.", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookWe need to talk about the president\u2019s TV habit. The one he doesn\u2019t have.But I will defend Mr. Trump at least this far: I don\u2019t care how much time he spends watching television. As a TV critic, I am the last person to judge someone for spending too much quality time with their DVR.The problem is not how much TV Mr. Trump watches. It\u2019s the kind of TV he watches.As Mr. Trump\u2019s associates report and his Twitter feed confirms, his video diet of choice is cable news, the most agitating, psychically toxic programming you can immerse yourself in, even if you don\u2019t have possession of the nuclear codes.This is not to say cable news is bad journalism. There are talented people in the business doing great reporting. But it is to say that cable news \u2014 as a genre, a gestalt, an environment to spend hours a day in \u2014 is by nature agitating and provoking.That\u2019s the cable-news business model. Conflict means urgency, and urgency means viewers glued to the channel. So it seeks out arguments and pushes buttons. It is a machine designed to generate stress and negative emotion.Mr. Trump does not exactly lack for that as it is. His entire career philosophy has been that fighting is humankind\u2019s most productive state, that the fight-or-flight response is to be savored and cultivated.So he seeks out more of it on cable, using it for affirmation and motivation, to pump himself up for battle. He stews in its acidic anger-juices, seething and tweeting and sending out more waves of hostility for cable news to reflect back.Because this feedback cycle results in news everywhere, all of us end up trapped in the mind-set of an angry cable-news junkie, even if we\u2019re not watching. It\u2019s like secondhand smoke.But honestly, I don\u2019t see much evidence that Mr. Trump has the level of introspection to be changed by a work of fiction. That requires some ability to recognize that perspectives besides your own are valid and that you might have something to learn from them.So color me skeptical that Mr. Trump might binge a season of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and become a believer in high-minded, reasoned debate. Art doesn\u2019t work that way under the most hospitable circumstances. It\u2019s not medicine or hypnosis.That\u2019s fine: TV doesn\u2019t need to be a vehicle for self-improvement. Sometimes it can just be an escape. But Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct is to use it as exactly the opposite, like a bull waving a red cape in front of itself.Much has been reported about the efforts of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to control the flow of information and visitors to the president. Maybe the most effective step Mr. Kelly could take would be to quietly get the White House\u2019s TV provider to drop everything except the Golf Channel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Herbs From the Underground", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "A hydroponic garden in a TriBeCa basement is growing rare herbs and edible flowers, and many prominent chefs are flocking to it.Supported byIn the basement of a loft-style building in TriBeCa that houses a vet, a dog swimming pool, an eye-and-ear infirmary, and a two-Michelin-starred restaurant, there is a working farm.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to pay for a space with great retail frontage,\u201d said Robert Laing, the farm\u2019s chief executive and founder. \u201cAll we need is a floor drain, water, power, temperature control, and the ability to seal the space so bugs don\u2019t get in.\u201d The farm does deliberately bring in a few types of insects that are beneficial for plants, like ladybugs. \u201cYou can buy them on Amazon,\u201d he said.Seeds are planted in materials like coconut husks and are put in a tray so water and nutrients can circulate below them. LED lights above simulate the sun. Growing time is not long; many plants, like microgreens, are ready in a little over a week.People who find it weird to eat food grown in a basement have no reason to worry, said Neil Mattson, associate professor and greenhouse extension specialist at Cornell University. \u201cThere is nothing icky about it. Plants don\u2019t care whether they get light from the sun or the lamps. It\u2019s the same thing.\u201dThe plants grow on shelves that can be expanded or contracted like the stacks in a university library (this setup almost doubles the growing space.) On one level there might be anise hyssop, an herb with tiny lavender-colored flowers and square stems that tastes strongly of mint and licorice. On another, mustard green, a plant that tastes a lot like spicy horseradish. The colors are so diverse and vibrant that the head horticulturalist, David Goldstein, has taken to arranging them on trays for parties.Mr. Laing, a British-Australian entrepreneur with a sharp sense of humor, can walk around the farm and tell you exactly what every variety is and to whom it is being delivered. \u201cThis is my favorite,\u201d he said, pulling off a leaf of papalo. \u201cCrush it up a little bit in your hand and smell it first \u2014 there is cilantro, citrus peel. It\u2019s super fresh and quite grassy.\u201d He paused. \u201cI never want to sell software again.\u201dIn a previous life, Mr. Laing worked in Japan, where he started a translation software company. After eight years he turned his attention to his true passion: food. He took culinary classes and visited farmers\u2019 markets across the world, discovering many rare herbs he had never heard of along the way. \u201cAnd I was someone I thought knew about food,\u201d he said. So he started researching ways to bring these herbs to chefs.Farm.One is also poised to cash in on the Instagram-driven food world, where chefs are willing to pay extra money for novelty items like rare herbs and flowers. Mr. Hyland, for example, is besotted by pluto basil. \u201cThey are really beautiful looking on a pizza with the little leaves everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCustomers know it\u2019s a custom-made product.\u201dFarm.One is not the only place chefs can procure these herbs; chef farms or wholesalers in California or Ohio ship a variety of rare products across the country. However, New York chefs like that the greens at Farm.One are grown locally and haven\u2019t been sitting in a warehouse or delivery truck for days. \u201cFarm.One snips the herbs in the morning for an afternoon delivery,\u201d said Victor Amarilla, the executive chef at Le Turtle. \u201cI actually see my delivery guy walking up now. I see him twice a week.\u201d Farm.One boasts on its website that delivery is just a 30-minute bike ride away from 90 percent of the restaurants in the city.Other insiders say that hydroponic farming is essential, especially as climate change makes growing seasons volatile and unreliable. \u201cOne of the most important things people will need to do over the next 100 years with climate change is bring food creation and cultivation back to cities where people are moving,\u201d said Dan Nelson, an entrepreneur in Brooklyn who is researching the urban agriculture movement and who took a Farm.One seminar on hydroponics. \u201cThat\u2019s my humanity-level thesis,\u201d he added.The main concern of chefs, though, is having ingredients they can cook with today. And many are applauding Farm.One\u2019s contribution to their operations.\u201cNew York has the greatest summer vegetables and fruits and leafy greens, and in the winter, we are in a real dead zone,\u201d said Mr. Hyland. \u201cHaving a product year round that we can really be proud of, would be a great win for New York City food.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000. Companies like Intel, Cisco and Oracle appear on the all-time list, too.When you adjust for inflation, the ranking changes.Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAK1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.AppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAKAppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Apple\u2019s margin in first place is dramatically reduced.In December 1999, Microsoft\u2019s market cap was $647 billion. That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "Inside the Home of Instant Pot, the Kitchen Gadget That Spawned a Religion", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "The ShiftThe electric multicooker is a true viral phenomenon. We went to the company\u2019s Canadian headquarters to learn why.Supported byKANATA, Ontario \u2014 Truth be told, the headquarters of Instant Pot don\u2019t look much like a church.But inside this sterile, gray office building on the outskirts of Ottawa, behind a door marked only by a small metal sign, a new religion has been born.\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d reads a fairly typical Amazon rave, one of more than 25,000 reviews on the site for the Instant Pot. \u201cThis is the best kitchen gadget to ever exist in the history of ever.\u201dMr. Wang, 53, did not set out to be a kitchen mogul. An engineering whiz who grew up in Harbin, China, as the son of two professors, he earned a Ph.D. in computer science and intended to develop artificial intelligence systems for a living. After a series of telecom and tech jobs, he was laid off from his dot-com position in 2008, just as the global financial crisis hit.After a brief and unsuccessful attempt to start his own tech company, Mr. Wang turned his attention to kitchen appliances, a market that hadn\u2019t yet been visited by the tech industry\u2019s disruption fairies. A lapsed home cook whose busy schedule rarely allowed him to make healthy meals for his wife and two children, Mr. Wang recruited two other engineers and spent 18 months and $350,000 of his savings developing a high-tech device that would combine pressure-cooking, slow-cooking, saut\u00e9ing and other common cooking functions in a single appliance. In a news release announcing his invention in 2013, he called it the \u201ciPot\u201d \u2014 an Apple homage that his trademark lawyer soon nixed.In person, Mr. Wang is soft-spoken and earnest, with a nerd\u2019s enthusiasm for the technology that powers the Instant Pot. (That enthusiasm extends to his other creations as well: At various points during our interview, he read me excerpts from his doctoral dissertation on logic programming languages, and showed me the hand-built website he made to host photos of his family.)In 2010, after several months of sluggish sales in and around Ontario, Mr. Wang listed the Instant Pot on Amazon, where a community of food writers eventually took notice. Vegetarians and paleo dieters, in particular, were drawn to the device\u2019s pressure-cooking function, which shaved hours off the time needed to cook pots of beans or large cuts of meat.Sensing viral potential, Instant Pot sent test units to about 200 influential chefs, cooking instructors and food bloggers. Reviews and recipes appeared online, and sales began to climb.You wouldn\u2019t know it from his small, bare-walled office, but Mr. Wang, who cooks steamed sweet potatoes and soft-boiled eggs in his three Instant Pots at home, has built a profitable empire. Exact figures are elusive because the company is private and has never raised money from outside investors, but there is no doubt that as the company\u2019s largest shareholder, Mr. Wang has done very well.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding as fast as they can produce the appliances,\u201d said Coco Morante, a food writer and author of \u201cThe Essential Instant Pot Cookbook.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve built this word-of-mouth advertising and community around their appliance that\u2019s pretty fervent.\u201dBut why, and why now? After all, pressure cookers aren\u2019t new, and most of the Instant Pot\u2019s functions are replicated by other common kitchen appliances. Mr. Wang credits the device\u2019s technological advances \u2014 most notably, a group of sensors that keep the cooker from overheating or exploding under pressure.Amazon has played a particularly large role in Instant Pot\u2019s rise. Early on, Instant Pot joined the \u201cFulfillment by Amazon\u201d program, in which Amazon handles the packing and shipping of a seller\u2019s products in exchange for a cut of each item sold. Eventually, Instant Pot sent Amazon wholesale shipments directly from factories in China, and Amazon began promoting the machines in its major annual sales. At one point, more than 90 percent of Instant Pot\u2019s sales came through Amazon.\u201cWithout Amazon, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Kitchen appliance fads tend to come and go (R.I.P., George Foreman grill). And major appliance makers like Cuisinart and Breville have taken note of Instant Pot\u2019s success and introduced electric multicookers of their own. But Mr. Wang said he believed that the Instant Pot\u2019s passionate online following will protect it from being crushed by a larger rival. He showed me videos in which fans sang the Instant Pot\u2019s praises, and a blog post about a woman who credited her Instant Pot with helping her lose 83 pounds.He also revealed a secret: in every official photograph of an Instant Pot, the unit\u2019s timer is set to 5:20 \u2014 a series of numbers that, when spoken aloud, sounds like \u201cI love you\u201d in his native Mandarin.\u201cIt\u2019s a subliminal message,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows how much we care about our customers.\u201dMr. Wang declined to comment when I asked about Instant Pot\u2019s plans for future products. He said the company wanted to modernize other \u201clegacy appliances\u201d in the kitchen by adding sensors and microprocessors, and eventually using Wi-Fi to connect them to the cloud.Not that Instant Pot needs to branch out just yet. According to the NPD Group, only 11.5 percent of American households own electric multicookers. Which means that there are still millions more potential Potheads out there, still making their vegetarian curries and chili con carne the hard way.Mr. Wang wants to convert these poor souls, and bring them into his flock.\u201cWe know we really make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Shopping: Disrupting Retail, and Drivers\u2019 Lives", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkAt lunchtime Thursday, Miguel Lopez paused on his rounds in Elmhurst, Queens. He got hired part-time for United Parcel Service when he was 23. That was two decades ago. A small start-up mail order company called Amazon was then in its early days selling books online, a blip that became a behemoth. The part-time job has ballooned so much that what is part-time is his life outside work.\u201cYesterday, I did 113 stops,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \u201cI touched a little less than 200 pieces.\u201dGustavo Escobar, 36, a U.P.S. driver on a route in Forest Hills, Queens, looked over a list of his own work. \u201cIt\u2019s 209 stops,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are multiple packages.\u201dThis year, a cascade of online purchases the weekend after Thanksgiving swamped delivery companies. U.P.S. had hired 95,000 seasonal workers, but that was not enough. Packages were delayed. Last Friday, thousands of workers around the country were told that they would have to work a sixth day.\u201cThey told me to come to work on Saturday, less than 24 hours beforehand,\u201d Mr. Escobar said. \u201cI had scheduled medical appointments. With my personal situation, I had visitation with my son, who is 9.\u201dDespite the instruction, Mr. Escobar, who has been with the company 14 years, did not go to work Saturday. On Monday, he got notified about a disciplinary process. So did about 70 other workers in the New York area. The same conflicts arose in a half-dozen other U.P.S. hubs around the country, Steve Gaut, a spokesman for the company, said. Eddie Villalta, the president of Local 804 of the Teamsters, protested, and the workers around the country are also represented by Teamsters locals, so presumably this will be thrashed out.The dispute is a reminder, though, that Mr. Escobar and Mr. Lopez and legions of others in the delivery business work on the edge of the tectonic shift in how people buy goods. Bricks and mortar have dissolved into flesh, blood and trucks.\u201cI\u2019m very grateful,\u201d Mr. Escobar said. \u201cThis volume brings us security.\u201dBut, he said, his workweek runs 48 to 60 hours, making a day off more precious. He will report to work this Saturday for his sixth day \u2014 reluctantly, because he will have to make arrangements for child care.Mr. Lopez is a shop steward with the union. \u201cI knew what I signed up for close to 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \u201cI tell people, this is not a nine-to-five job. Sometimes, it\u2019s nine to seven, or nine to nine, or nine to 10. They put a lot more pressure on us to deliver everything.\u201dMr. Gaut of U.P.S. said the company had planned for growth from last year, but had been surprised by the sheer number of packages it had to deliver last week. Measures that it took to spread out the delivery period, like charging higher prices at certain times, had not been enough, he said.\u201cThere has to be a level of predictability for the company and for the employees,\u201d he said.Federal rules limit the hours that truck drivers can work to 60 hours over seven days, or 70 hours over eight days, Mr. Gaut said. Then a worker must get 34 hours off.Mr. Lopez said that the employees are pressed to watch the limits, while being pushed to carry more packages. \u201cThe demands have been getting worse and worse as the years go on,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. \u201cThe volume has skyrocketed. There\u2019s so much work that they don\u2019t even know what to do with it.\u201dIt bothered Mr. Escobar that he was pushed at the last minute to work an extra day, and that he was threatened with disciplinary action because the company was apparently unprepared.\u201cI want to say this: I love this job,\u201d he said. \u201cBuilding relationships, seeing the joy on people\u2019s faces when you bring their stuff, that feels good. Somehow, I\u2019m going to have get that extra cup of coffee and do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I would be surprised if there was an immediate reaction, especially from people like UnitedHealth who don\u2019t like to be seen as reactive.\u201dCritics cornerThe flurry of last-minute changes, which Democrats loudly criticized, led Goldman Sachs economists to slightly raise their estimates of how much economic growth the bill would create.How companies plan to spend their tax-cut moneyThe latest signs of the Bitcoin frenzyThe two stock indexes and the VIX calmed down by day\u2019s end, perhaps because of the Senate tax overhaul\u2019s progress to passage.

And, she wrote, \u201cI did try \u2014 in some small ways, some larger \u2014 to do something about raising the visibility of women and increasing the sensitivity toward matters of particular concern to them.\u201dAlthough occasionally apocryphal, \u201cThe Post\u201d captures Ms. Graham\u2019s transformation to towering from timid through her decision to publish the classified documents.\u201cIt\u2019s as though Hollywood had made a movie about the Times\u2019s triumphant role in Watergate,\u201d Mr. Goodale added.\u201cPunch was absolutely heroic in publishing the Pentagon Papers,\u201d The Times\u2019s lead reporter on the project, Neil Sheehan, 81, told me in a statement. \u201cHe was all alone in making his decision. He had the backing of his senior editors like Abe Rosenthal, who was equally courageous. There was a precedent for Kay Graham. Punch had no precedent.\u201dThe more important lesson is that, in both cases, family-led newspapers placed their journalistic missions ahead of business imperatives. And they did so under intense governmental pressure, a reminder of the important role that principled family leadership plays in the news business.Given all this, \u201cThe Post\u201d strikes a fitting end note to a tumultuous year for journalism and democracy. Even the debate over whether the movie unfairly credits The Post for one of The Times\u2019s proudest achievements is fitting.The competition between the two news organizations \u2014 each now much more than a newspaper \u2014 has spurred both of them along. It happened in the 1970s and it happened again in 2017, a golden year for investigative reporting.For good measure, he added, \u201cOnly a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.\u201dJaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Herbert Axelrod, a Hustler Who Built an Empire on a Fish Tale", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.The rise of the cardinal tetra \u2014 Paracheirodon axelrodi, now one of the world\u2019s most popular aquarium fish \u2014 helped make Axelrod, in the words of the trade publication Practical Fishkeeping, perhaps \u201cthe single most influential fishkeeper the hobby and industry has seen.\u201d But Axelrod\u2019s tale of discovery is a myth: As he himself admitted early on, he had actually acquired the tetras not in the Amazon but from a dealer in Irvington, N.J. (The dealer got them from the discus monopolist. Nonetheless, after a technical yet dramatic dispute, an international commission named the fish for Axelrod.) Inventing a new origin story, Axelrod didn\u2019t just change the facts; he spun a personal legend, which he clung to as he self-promoted his way to pet-industry fortune. After all, it not only legitimized his \u201cdiscovery\u201d but also, accompanied by digressions about befriending Indians and swimming with piranhas, presented him as \u201cthe Indiana Jones of ichthyology,\u201d as one hobbyist put it, which he must have preferred to the P.T. Barnum of pet fish.Raised in North Jersey during the Depression, Axelrod supposedly spoke five languages by age 5 and swam across Lake Ontario at 10. He was also crazy about pet pigeons (which he collected, alongside fossils and rare violins, in adulthood too). The pivot to fish came in his 20s, when he studied at New York University, served in the Army and found time to publish tropical-fish handbooks and start Tropical Fish Hobbyist. In 1965, Sports Illustrated called him \u201can intrepid ichthyologist and explorer,\u201d trumpeting dozens of claims: He could recognize more than 7,000 kinds of fish by sight. He once landed at the Trinidad airport, approached a pool near the runway and, as onlookers gasped, netted a new species. \u201cHe was once censured by a professor,\u201d the magazine reported, \u201cfor performing a Caesarean on a guppy.\u201dGuppy surgeon or not, his importance was undeniable. In an era before web forums and Google, collectors turned to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and Axelrod\u2019s dozens of books: \u201cKoi of the World,\u201d \u201cThe Allure of Discus,\u201d \u201cTropical Fish for Those Who Care.\u201d His company, TFH Publications, became a dominant pet-book publishing conglomerate, which catered to gecko and gerbil fanciers alike and invested in tetra farms and chew toys. He smoked Cuban cigars and boasted of collecting sea slugs with Emperor Hirohito, spearfishing with King Leopold III and corresponding with Winston Churchill about goldfish. He also, reportedly, became pen pals with prisoners in Indiana, who, he claimed, had for decades hidden pet fish in vials strapped to their bodies.In his later years, Axelrod restyled himself as a philanthropist: After he sold TFH Publications in 1997 for $70 million and a $10 million loan, he became best known for collecting Stradivarius violins and other prestigious stringed instruments, many of which he gave to the Smithsonian or sold to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. (A 2003 Times Magazine profile of Axelrod was headlined \u201cMedici of the Meadowlands.\u201d) But this narrative didn\u2019t last. In 2004, he was indicted on federal tax-fraud charges and accused of hiding money in Switzerland; separately, in one of many lawsuits he attracted, TFH\u2019s new owners sued him for misrepresenting its finances, and a Senate committee investigated whether he inflated the value of some of his instruments. He fled to Cuba \u2014 \u201cHerbert Axelrod sits in an oceanfront bungalow at the Hemingway Marina, a fugitive from justice, poring over photographs of hamsters,\u201d The Star-Ledger reported from Havana \u2014 and was later extradited from Germany. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax fraud. Paradoxically, as a hobbyist observed on MonsterFishKeepers.com, Axelrod, confined like a tetra in a tank, ended up \u201cliving the life of a fish.\u201d\u201cI will be remembered as someone who disrespected the law,\u201d Axelrod lamented in 2005. But after his death in May in Switzerland, tributes rang out from admirers as disparate as the violinist Joshua Bell and the Australian Society for Fish Biology. And his name still adheres to more than a dozen species, including, of course, Paracheirodon axelrodi. For Axelrod, the tetra wasn\u2019t just a discovery or a pet. It wasn\u2019t just the profound beginning of fortune and notoriety. It was a symbol of our all-too-human foibles and obsessions, real and imagined, the stuff of emperors and prisoners and priests.Daniel Fromson is a copy editor for the magazine. He is the author of \u201cFinding Shakespeare,\u201d published by The Atavist Magazine.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerAdvertisement"}

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse.

His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

His short video statement immediately raised eyebrows.The first thing most people noticed was that Diddy was not entirely clear on the name of the team he is interested in, twice calling it the \u201cNorth Carolina Panthers.\u201d Nevertheless, he said, \u201cI will be the best N.F.L. owner that you can imagine.\u201dThen he plunged right into one of the most contentious issues facing the N.F.L.: the decision of every N.F.L. team not to sign quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

{"Headline": "Why the CVS-Aetna Merger Could Benefit Consumers ", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConsolidation in health care has generally not been good for Americans. Here\u2019s why this seems to be an exception. But by disrupting the pharmacy benefits management market, and by more closely aligning management of drug benefits and other types of benefits in one organization, CVS could be acting in ways that ultimately benefit consumers.Pharmacy benefits managers are companies that help insurers devise and run their drug benefits, including serving as middlemen in negotiating prices between insurers and drug manufacturers.Anthem would not be the first insurer to forgo external pharmacy benefits management and take on the role internally. The insurer UnitedHealth Group also runs a leading pharmacy benefit management business, OptumRx. And CVS\u2019s purchase of Aetna would also remove it as a middleman acting between that insurer and drug companies.\u201cWhile it\u2019s still early, the moves by Anthem and Aetna have the feeling of the beginning of the end of the stand-alone pharmacy benefits manager business,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist with Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. These insurers, and UnitedHealth Group, have concluded that outsourcing pharmacy benefits management may not serve their interests.Typically, mergers in the sector have led to higher prices and no better outcomes. But a CVS-Aetna merger might be different because their business lines complement each other. The most significant overlap is in the management of Medicare drug benefits: Both companies offer stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans.But there is a lot of competition in the Medicare drug plan market, so this overlap may not be a leading area of concern.The CVS-Aetna merger is primarily about a supplier and its customer joining forces, what economists call a vertical merger. This type of merger can enhance a firm\u2019s ability to coordinate across interlocking lines of business.In this case, CVS-Aetna might more effectively manage certain patients with chronic conditions (those insured by Aetna), reducing costs. Let\u2019s imagine that Aetna could leverage CVS\u2019s pharmacies and clinics to help patients \u2014 who require medications to avoid hospitalizations \u2014 stay on their drug regimen. That could save the merged organization money. It could also translate into both better care and lower premiums, though there\u2019s no guarantee at this stage of either.So there\u2019s reason to believe that a combined CVS-Aetna might find ways to reduce costs \u2014 and represent an instance when consumers actually come out ahead after health care consolidation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bookstore Chains, Long in Decline, Are Undergoing a Final Shakeout", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAPPLETON, Wis. \u2014 This fall, at a moment when retailers traditionally look forward to reaping holiday profits, the owner of the fourth-largest bookstore chain in the country surrendered to the forces of e-commerce.Book World, founded in 1976, sold hardcovers, paperbacks and sometimes tobacco in malls, downtowns and vacation areas across the Upper Midwest. It had endured recessions, the expansion of superstores like Borders and Barnes & Noble, and then the rise of Amazon. But the 45-store chain could not survive the shifting nature of shopping itself, and so announced its liquidation.\u201cSales in our mall stores are down this year from 30 to 60 percent,\u201d said Bill Streur, Book World\u2019s owner. \u201cThe internet is killing retail. Bookstores are just the first to go.\u201d\u201cBooks aren\u2019t going away, but bookstores are,\u201d said Matthew Duket, a Book World sales associate waiting for customers in the West Bend, Wis., store.In a famous passage in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d a novel that Book World used to sell, a character is asked how he went bust. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d he answers. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201dThat more or less mirrors what happened to Book World and other bookstore chains.A few years ago, e-books were widely assumed to be driving the physical book \u2014 and the physical bookstore \u2014 to extinction. Instead, e-book sales leveled off, and the physical book has retained much of its appeal.But readers are increasingly ordering those books online, getting them delivered with their clothes and peanut butter and diapers. Bookstore sales were $684 million in October, the Census Bureau said this month, off 4.6 percent from a year earlier and down 39 percent from a decade ago.\u201cThere aren\u2019t many businesses that can survive a 20 to 30 percent drop,\u201d said Mr. Streur, 68. \u201cClosing was the last thing in the world I wanted. But reality sets in.\u201dIt was an abrupt decision that surprised even his 300 full- and part-time employees; a few said that at least some of the stores \u2014 especially those that catered to tourists \u2014 seemed to be holding their own. Book World had opened a store in Jefferson City, Mo., just a few weeks before.But a search for buyers for the chain or even some of the stores came up short. The chain swung from a profit in 2014 to break-even in 2015 to a loss in 2016, although Mr. Streur declined to provide numbers.\u201cThere was nobody interested in buying us,\u201d he said.A walk around some of Book World\u2019s stores in its home state, Wisconsin, underlines the tough retail environment. The store in Mequon is in a strip mall with at least eight empty storefronts. In Oshkosh, the store is on the main street, but at 10 a.m. there was no foot traffic. The stores in Fond du Lac and Manitowoc were almost as bleak.These streets look as if an overpowering recession had hit, but the unemployment rate in Wisconsin fell this year to a 17-year low. Mequon is especially affluent: Its household income is double the national average. This is Amazon Prime territory, its shoppers drawn to the fast-shipping membership program that some analysts say half the households in the country have joined.Since Amazon dominates online book sales even more than it dominates other online retail, its coffers will likely get a boost from Book World\u2019s demise.Glenn Butts, a flight instructor and pastor browsing among the bargains in West Bend, said he bought books \u201c50 percent in person, 50 percent online.\u201d In the future, he said, \u201cit will probably be all online.\u201dStill, he had his regrets. \u201cPeople are getting their information these days from God knows where,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go into a bookstore to get something a bit more in-depth, to read it and digest it. That acts against fake news.\u201dOther customers remained resolute.\u201cI don\u2019t like doing things online, so I won\u2019t be buying books there,\u201d said Susan Briggs, a former substitute teacher buying a collection of Emerson essays in Mequon. \u201cTechnology is going to be the downfall of civilization.\u201dStoicism is a classic Midwest attribute, which probably helped keep Book World alive for years.\u201cConvenience changes our expectations, and then erodes our taste,\u201d said Michael Schutz, who grew up riding his bike to the Book World in Portage, where he bought everything Stephen King wrote. That pushed Mr. Schutz to become a horror writer himself.Looming over the fate of the stores is Amazon. Mark Dupont, Mr. Streur\u2019s son-in-law and Book World\u2019s senior vice president, said in an interview at the chain\u2019s headquarters here that he, unlike others in the industry, did not hold any animosity toward the retailer.\u201cTo go online is so easy, so convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cTo draw people into a store now is a monumental challenge. This is a huge sea change for retail. I don\u2019t see any end to it.\u201dSome Book World managers were less forgiving.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to compete against Amazon, which doesn\u2019t care if it makes a profit,\u201d said Erik Sanstad, the manager of the Mequon store. Still, he added: \u201cI\u2019m a little reluctant to say the internet killed Book World. We never advertised, never got our name out there.\u201dThe biggest bookstore chain is Barnes & Noble, which has been struggling for many years and has closed about 10 percent of its stores since 2011. Its most recent pivot was to go back to its roots and concentrate on bookselling.Books-a-Million, taken private by its investors in 2015 after its market capitalization plunged, is ranked second. Half Price Books, many of whose books are secondhand or remainders, is third.\u201cThe age of the physical chain of bookstores is behind us \u2014 unless you don\u2019t need to be profitable,\u201d said Daniel Goldin, the owner of Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee, the sole surviving descendant of a local chain that began in 1927.\u201cYou can never save enough money through centralization to be able to compete with Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, you have to go in the other direction \u2014 be so rooted in your community you can turn on a dime.\u201dThat is what Michael Bauer hopes to do in Minocqua, a town near the Michigan border. He owns a gift shop where he sells a small quantity of children\u2019s books, local guides and cookbooks. When the Book World across the street announced its demise, he saw an opportunity.This month, Mr. Bauer, 63, signed a contract to buy the Book World building and its fixtures for more than $300,000. He hopes to open it as a new bookstore, which he\u2019ll run with his fiance\u00e9, by March 1.\u201cI like tradition. I like antiques,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for kids to read, and do it the old-fashioned way.\u201dBut he\u2019s aware of the challenges. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that Amazon, Walmart, all those places made it more difficult for a single store,\u201d Mr. Bauer said. \u201cBut if you work hard, and provide a good product, you will\u201d \u2014 and he settled for the bare minimum \u2014 \u201cexist.\u201dAdvertisement"}

China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.Others were more blunt in their assessments.\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201dNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Deal for 21st Century Fox Is Said to Be Close", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisney was closing in Tuesday on an all-stock transaction to cleave out most of the assets of 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the Murdoch family, with an agreement possibly coming as soon as Thursday, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks \u2014 now down to the final details \u2014 were private.\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dThat would leave Mr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox with three properties: Fox News, the relatively young FS1 cable sports channel, and a broadcasting unit formed by the Fox network and local TV stations. His plans for those operations were unclear, but almost all of them involve news, a business that has long been dear to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s heart. Analysts have suggested that they could be combined with the family\u2019s newspaper-focused company, News Corporation.Disney did not respond to queries on Tuesday. A Fox spokesman declined to comment.Behind Disney\u2019s interest in a deal is a zealous effort to dramatically lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable and satellite subscriptions that surged for the last two decades but is now in decline. Instead, Disney has begun pivoting toward what it sees as a new growth engine: subscription streaming services that bring its movies and TV shows directly to consumers. Disney\u2019s first major streaming effort, ESPN Plus, will arrive in the spring. A second and still-unnamed offering, built around the company\u2019s Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, will roll out late next year.Disney has sought the 21st Century Fox assets to bolster those efforts and add a third service to its streaming portfolio. That would be Hulu, which focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows and original programming like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney, which already has a stake in the service, would own about 60 percent of Hulu if it completes the deal with 21st Century Fox.By self-distributing content in a major way, Disney would help fortify itself against competition from Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google. Those companies have built online entertainment operations that have become wildly popular, particularly with the young viewers coveted by Disney.Netflix has shrugged off the loss of Disney content by noting that it has aggressively moved toward making its own movies and shows. Next year, it will spend an estimated $7 billion on original programming. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox would be another matter entirely, dwarfing Mr. Iger\u2019s previous deals and creating complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney management.The Murdochs were not seen as sellers as recently as October. \u201cThis potential about-face is startling,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.One question that has not been resolved, and may not be by the time a deal is announced, is whether James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s younger son and the current chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney. Were he to do so \u2014 and leave the family business \u2014 the younger Mr. Murdoch could potentially oversee the international broadcast operations, one of the people briefed on the matter said, though negotiations over any such role were still under review. Disney insiders have downplayed speculation that he could eventually take the chief executive reins from Mr. Iger.Though Comcast had also vied for 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, the cable giant never gained as much traction. In a statement on Monday, Comcast conceded that it was out of the running. \u201cWe never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer,\u201d the company said.A deal between Comcast and Fox could have posed antitrust issues, especially at a time when the Justice Department has sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. A deal with Disney was seen as potentially posing fewer problems, but deal makers have said that little is certain in the current regulatory environment.Analysts said that Disney\u2019s two biggest governmental hurdles would most likely involve the regional sports networks, which would add to ESPN\u2019s dominance, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which employs 3,200 people and has been controlled by Mr. Murdoch since 1985. Together, Disney and Fox last year controlled about 40 percent of the movie tickets sold in the United StatesBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "1,000 Miles, Four Families, One Christmas Tree", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "A balsam fir tree\u2019s journey from a farm in Nova Scotia to a living room in Ridgewood, Queens, reveals the hard work necessary to deliver holiday cheer.Supported byBefore it reached Lisa Maichin\u2019s cozy living room in Queens, her Christmas tree \u2014 now speckled with delicate crochet angels and glinting bulbs \u2014 spent five days being hacked, hauled and hawked across a supply chain in flux.The tree originated on a farm owned by the same family for nearly two centuries, in a part of Canada known as the balsam fir capital of the world, where reliable labor is increasingly scarce.A trucking company run by a father and his two sons delivered the tree across a thousand snow-dusted miles, past a border that might become harder to cross if a key trade pact falls through.The salesman in Queens, who leans on his wife and five children to help on his lot where the tree was sold, worries about competition from online rivals and nearby national chains like Home Depot.Even Ms. Maichin, who bought the tree, is caught up in change. Around her home, which she shares with three other generations of her family, her neighborhood is rapidly gentrifying. Christmas is getting costlier.\u201cThis year, the trees are definitely more expensive,\u201d she said.In Lunenburg County, a chunk of Nova Scotia pockmarked by lakes and patches of balsam firs, Silver\u2019s Farm hugs a hill with 45 acres of farmland splayed out in front and 150 acres of Christmas trees behind, all growing naturally and tightly \u201clike the hairs on a dog\u2019s back,\u201d said Wayne Silver.His operation is small, felling just 3,000 trees a season. Some Nova Scotia farms cut down tens of thousands of trees annually and even ship some overseas.Mr. Silver took over the farm in 1991 from his father, who took it over from his father, who began cutting Christmas trees in the 1930s. Trees \u201care in my blood,\u201d he said.Planting the trees is unnecessary; they sprout abundantly on their own. When they are 2 feet tall, Mr. Silver selects the best specimens, and then trims back the neighboring firs to give the future Christmas trees room to grow.As they get taller, he shears them to give them the proper shape, and pats fertilizer into the soil around their trunks.In early October, he tags the trees destined for the holiday market, using an internal calculus perfected over decades. Trees marked \u201c#1\u201d are deemed \u201cperfect.\u201d The \u201c#2\u201d trees are \u201cfancy\u201d and the \u201c#3\u201d trees are \u201cchoice.\u201d Mr. Silver charges lot owners $5 to $16 for most firs.Cutting, using a chain saw that can topple a fir in 20 seconds, starts in November, and the work is grueling. Mr. Silver puts in 12-hour days, felling, dragging and packaging the trees in twine. Even in the winter chill, sweat percolates on his face.Help is scarce. In a tight labor market with low unemployment, many other tree farmers are hiring migrants from Mexico and Jamaica. Mr. Silver will likely follow suit next year.\u201cI just work too many long hours,\u201d he said.Cutting a batch of trees for clients in New York, he stopped at sundown for a supper of venison and French fries and then worked until 1 a.m. The skeleton crew resumed at 6 a.m., and by noon, when the truck arrived to pick up the load, they had packed 700 trees into the trailer. Among them was the one that would soon claim a corner of Ms. Maichin\u2019s living room.Mr. Silver pays 4,500 Canadian dollars (about $3,500) to get a load of trees to New York. With fuel prices rising, he expects that will jump to 4,700 dollars in 2018, requiring him to mark up his tree prices by 50 cents each to compensate.For the past five years, Mr. Silver has sent several truckloads of trees to the Eastern Seaboard via G.K. Morse & Sons, a Nova Scotia trucking firm.The company brings in $6.5 million in revenue a year, said Robert Morse, an occasional trucker who handles dispatching. He and his brother, Richard, work for their father, Ken, who bought his first truck in 1956 as a way to travel.\u201cMost of our trade is south of the 49th parallel,\u201d Robert Morse said, referring to the line that roughly divides the United States and Canada.After collecting the trailer from Silver\u2019s Farm, he hauled it half an hour away to Bridgewater. There, he met up with Keron Roberts, a driver who would take it the rest of the way.Mr. Roberts, who has worked for G.K. Morse for nearly a year, came to Canada in 2013, looking for opportunity. He regularly sends money back home to relatives in Spanish Town, Jamaica.Truckers, like farm hands, are in short supply.\u201cDrivers are getting old and getting retired, and the younger people want to be making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year,\u201d Mr. Morse said. \u201cTruckers make pretty good money, but it\u2019s not a get-rich-quick scheme.\u201dAfter setting out with the trees, Mr. Roberts exhausted his 13-hour daily driving limit that Canada enforces on truckers and stopped in New Brunswick. He slept in the back of the cab.Upon entering the United States, he hit a snowstorm and had to park, again, in Portsmouth, N.H.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating on the road sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster I reach my location, the more rest I can get.\u201dBy the time Mr. Roberts and his truck finally pulled up to the Greenpoint Trees lot in Middle Village, Queens, Stephen Leddick was becoming anxious. Mr. Leddick, the owner, figures he needs a supply of about 300 trees to meet demand.That morning, he had just 30 firs. His other lot in Brooklyn was stripped bare.To supplement his stock, Mr. Leddick bought 80 trees from the Brooklyn Terminal Market. But they were not cheap: he paid an 80 percent premium over the cost of buying and shipping a fir from Silver\u2019s Farm.The 24-hour Queens lot, bunched onto a sidewalk near the Atlas Park Mall, has no permit to operate. Few Christmas tree sellers in New York do.Some sellers take advantage of the lack of paperwork, disappearing once the season ends and stiffing their suppliers, Mr. Leddick said \u2014 quickly adding that he was not one of them.A week earlier, Ms. Maichin purchased grave blankets from Mr. Leddick for her father, who is buried in the cemetery nearby. Today, she came for trees, and haggled for three, one for each floor of her brick townhouse in Ridgewood, ultimately paying $45, $65 and $75.Mr. Leddick opened the Brooklyn lot in 1990 and the Queens location in 2005. Someday, he said, he would love for one of his sons to take over the business, allowing him to open his own \u201csoup to nuts\u201d gardening center. But for now, with multiple children on the college track, he cannot spare the capital.Besides, working 18 hours a day at the lots and at his day job as a construction superintendent, he is simply too tired.The next day, Ms. Maichin and her family began decorating the tree on the top floor, in a living room ringed with family portraits and wedding photos. The group \u2014 Ms. Maichin, her daughter Melissa Babb, son-in-law Keaton Babb and infant granddaughter, Karolina, observant in her bouncer seat \u2014 rifled through a collection of family ornaments compiled over three decades.Many of them were knitted by Ms. Maichin\u2019s mother, who lives downstairs.Ms. Maichin\u2019s parents, who were Austrian immigrants, bought the house when she was in fourth grade. A recently retired administrative assistant, she now barely recognizes her neighborhood.Real estate prices have surged. The population, once predominantly German, now includes more Polish residents, more millennials crowding into new bars, more investors snapping up properties and renting them out through Airbnb.But the family vowed to retain its community spirit, pledging to patronize Greenpoint Trees again next year.\u201cWe try to shop small and shop local whenever we can,\u201d Ms. Babb said, adding, sheepishly, \u201cwith the exception of Amazon.\u201dText by Tiffany Hsu and photographs and video by Roger Kisby.

{"Headline": "That Game on Your Phone May Be Tracking What You\u2019re Watching on TV", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the gaming apps \u2014 with names like \u201cPool 3D,\u201d \u201cBeer Pong: Trickshot\u201d and \u201cReal Bowling Strike 10 Pin\u201d \u2014 seem innocuous. One called \u201cHoney Quest\u201d features Jumbo, an animated bear.Yet these apps, once downloaded onto a smartphone, have the ability to keep tabs on the viewing habits of their users \u2014 some of whom may be children \u2014 even when the games aren\u2019t being played.It is yet another example of how companies, using devices that many people feel they can\u2019t do without, are documenting how audiences in a rapidly changing entertainment landscape are viewing television and commercials.The apps use software from Alphonso, a start-up that collects TV-viewing data for advertisers. Using a smartphone\u2019s microphone, Alphonso\u2019s software can detail what people watch by identifying audio signals in TV ads and shows, sometimes even matching that information with the places people visit and the movies they see. The information can then be used to target ads more precisely and to try to analyze things like which ads prompted a person to go to a car dealership.Some of the tracking is taking place through gaming apps that do not otherwise involve a smartphone\u2019s microphone, including some apps that are geared toward children. The software can also detect sounds even when a phone is in a pocket if the apps are running in the background.The spread of these technologies, combined with the proliferation of internet-connected TVs and tools that can identify video content through pixels and audio snippets, has resulted in some questionable practices.Companies gathering such data, especially through games, need to make their business practices clear to consumers \u201cbecause it\u2019s so inherently unexpected and surprising,\u201d said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union, and a former policy director at the trade commission who worked on the Silverpush case.\u201cWhen you see \u2018permission for microphone access for ads,\u2019 it may not be clear to a user that, Oh, this means it\u2019s going to be listening to what I do all the time to see if I\u2019m watching \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cThey need to go above and beyond and be careful to make sure consumers know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThrough its software, Alphonso can follow the ads that people see in friends\u2019 homes and elsewhere. The company has also worked with movie studios to figure out theater-viewing habits, Mr. Chordia, Alphonso\u2019s chief executive, said. Smartphone apps that are running Alphonso\u2019s software, even if they are not actively in use, can detect movies based on film snippets provided by the studios ahead of time.\u201cA lot of the folks will go and turn off their phone, but a small portion of people don\u2019t and put it in their pocket,\u201d Mr. Chordia said. \u201cIn those cases, we are able to pick up in a small sample who is watching the show or the movie.\u201d Mr. Chordia said that Alphonso has a deal with the music-listening app Shazam, which has microphone access on many phones. Alphonso is able to provide the snippets it picks up to Shazam, he said, which can use its own content-recognition technology to identify users and then sell that information to Alphonso.Founded in 2013, Alphonso initially focused on working with apps to capitalize on ads through so-called second-screen viewing, as people increasingly turned their attention to smartphones and tablets during TV breaks. Now, the company has broadened its focus to gathering troves of viewing data from companies like TiVo and directly from TVs and streaming devices through deals with manufacturers.The disparate viewing information is tied to IP addresses, which can be matched to characteristics like age, gender, income and more through big data brokers like Experian without using personally identifiable information like names and addresses.\u201cWe have to be really careful as we have more devices capturing more information in living rooms and bedrooms and on the street and in other people\u2019s homes that the public is not blindsided and surprised by things,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s legal. It is what\u2019s not creepy.\u201dOn the other hand, many people have had issues recognizing audio through apps like Shazam if there is too much background noise, so it\u2019s not clear how much information Alphonso\u2019s apps can pick up on a daily basis.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not normally, I don\u2019t think, going to be expected that an application is going to be listening for what you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily expecting your TV to be watching what you\u2019re doing either.\u201dNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Provides Hedge Against Tech Backlash", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAuthorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it\u2019s likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon\u2019s listing of own-label products ahead of competitors\u2019 offerings.The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It\u2019s probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere \u2014 reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.Parts of Europe\u2019s agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it\u2019s no monopolist. The iPhone\u2019s combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects\u2019 phones. Apple\u2019s inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.Apple is not carefree. The company\u2019s attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine.

That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses.It was an all-consuming job.\u201cI have had dreams about Fingerlings,\u201d she said.On Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25 minutes, Ms. Oliver said.\u201cThey are the only one that if I throw it up on social media I feel like my people have a chance to get it before it disappears,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had readers comment that they\u2019ve put the Fingerlings in their cart on the Walmart website and when they go to check out, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWalmart did not respond to a request for comment.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us says on its website that Fingerlings are available in its brick-and-mortar stores. When asked about the cyber bots, the retailer declined to comment, referring instead to a statement from Christin Fernandez, vice president for communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association that said retailers and suppliers \u201care working around the clock to make sure American families have access to the season\u2019s hottest items\u201d and are \u201ccommitted to taking precautions to mitigate fraud and illegal transactions.\u201dAmazon said Tuesday that it monitors bot buying activity, and attempts to limit the purchase of high-demand products.Target has also taken measures to deter resellers, said a company spokesman, Eddie Baeb, \u201cincluding quantity limits for purchases and technologies designed to help us monitor and prevent reseller activity.\u201dOther hot toys, like the Barbie Hello Dreamhouse, the L.O.L. Surprise! Doll and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition have also sold out, but are appearing on Amazon and eBay advertised at prices several times higher than retail.\u201cThe entire ecosystem breaks down,\u201d Mr. Iluz said. Bots are making legal purchases, but they don\u2019t become loyal customers, and they won\u2019t leave positive reviews.And customers get frustrated.\u201cWhen an advertised item is unavailable because of out-of-stocks, customers don\u2019t blame bots, they blame the retailer,\u201d Roger Beahm, a professor of marketing at the Wake Forest University School of Business, said in an email.On Sunday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, asked retail trade associations to take action.\u201cWhen it comes to purchasing products online, major retailers should put forth policies that will help prevent future Grinch bots from stealing the season\u2019s hottest toys,\u201d he said in a statement.Unusual purchases ought to raise a red flag said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.\u201cSay there\u2019s a suspicious order placed \u2014 for example a massive quantity at extreme speed \u2014 they should be able to have some human intervention in that transaction and potentially block the sale,\u201d Mr. Roefaro said in an email.David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Monday that the federation shares Mr. Schumer\u2019s concerns, \u201cand we look forward to working with him and all interested parties to strengthen enforcement against bad actors and take away the tools being used against innocent consumers, particularly during the holiday season.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who also co-sponsored the BOTS Act, said in a phone interview Tuesday that he aimed to introduce new legislation to combat the \u201cplague\u201d of bots that buy up toys, sneakers and other popular retail items.\u201cI think if there was a specific law it would encourage and empower the Federal Trade Commission or criminal investigators to go after them, and we might learn more about them and identify some of the specific culprits,\u201d he said.The yearly rush to buy the hottest toy is often guided by emotions, Mr. Beahm said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Moshe set his film in that state after falling under the spell of a historic ranch outside the town Whitehall, which is in the shadows of the Tobacco Root and Highland Mountains \u2014 and about 20 minutes from Mr. Pullman\u2019s home.Boston-based photographer Nicholas Nixon has been shooting an 8-by-10, black-and-white portrait of his wife, Bebe, and her three sisters every year since the mid-70s.But the series has neither the narcotizing nostalgia nor the impersonal monumentality that such cross-sections of fleetly passing life might fall into. Instead it catalogs, by means of changing postures, hairstyles, clothing and expressions, a range of human possibility that feels very much rooted in the present moment, whatever that moment happens to be.Advertisement"}

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch.

By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old.

Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bobby Cannavale, Tough Guy, \u2018Can Handle a Pink Couch\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "He charms Martin Scorsese and thrills his co-stars, so isn\u2019t it time you recognized that Mr. Cannavale isn\u2019t \u201cthe guy you went to high school with\u201d?Supported byBobby Cannavale answered his own door. There was no assistant hovering. We had to be quiet, Mr. Cannavale said, because on the first floor of their new house, the first proper house in which he has lived, his fianc\u00e9e, the actress Rose Byrne, was tending to their baby, Rafa, two weeks old.Softly up the stairs (stairs! Mr. Cannavale had always been confined to one floor, a lifelong apartment dweller) we went. Mr. Cannavale, 47, half Cuban and half Italian, grew up in New Jersey with a stint in Florida in the middle, and spent years looking longingly toward Manhattan until finally he lived there. But life intercedes, and he and Ms. Byrne had a son, Rocco, 22 months, and then another. So he did what dads with their hands full do: He moved to Brooklyn.There\u2019s a star-studded section of Brooklyn, but this isn\u2019t exactly that: Around the corner, a beverage distributor was noisily loading Coronas into a street-side warehouse. Though Mr. Cannavale, who has been working as an actor for about 20 years, isn\u2019t exactly a star.He\u2019s a workhorse (three movies coming out in December alone), with carpet-thick brows and hair he\u2019ll take with him to the grave, and has been in so many things that he\u2019s easily recognizable, if not always placeable.\u201cI\u2019m the guy you went to high school with when I walk down the street,\u201d he said.Actually, many believe he is one of the most talented actors of his generation, a syringe of adrenaline in whatever he appears. Two Emmys, but who\u2019s counting. Two Tony nominations, but no hard feelings.There\u2019s too much work to do. Every morning lately, he gets picked up at 6 a.m. by a chauffeured car to head to the set of the film \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d his third collaboration with Martin Scorsese \u2014 what\u2019s that guy know about talent? \u2014 the latest in a line of mentors. The playwright Lanford Wilson was another, along with his ex-father-in-law, Sidney Lumet.\u201cHe likes saying to me, \u2018I feel like we\u2019ve worked together our whole lives,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cannavale said. \u201cAnd I say, we haven\u2019t, because I\u2019m 40 years younger than you.\u201d (28, technically.)It wasn\u2019t always thus. The young Bobby Cannavale used to come to the city from Jersey with just enough money for the bus and maybe 10 extra bucks for a slice and a soda, and audition and audition and audition.\u201cI always wanted to make a living as an actor living in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cA New York actor. What\u2019s better than that?\u201dHe offered a tour of his new pile, a three-story 19th-century house in brownstone Brooklyn, which he and Ms. Byrne renovated and then moved into in the final moments of her pregnancy.In the early days, untrained (aside from church-group productions as a child), it was slow. \u201cI did so many acting jobs for nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a play that opened on Christmas Eve above a police precinct on 54th Street. Three people showed up. One of them was an agent. It was my first agent.\u201dIn person he is gentle and accommodating \u2014 did I want a coffee? Something to eat? \u2014 not the tough he\u2019s often called to play. He settled onto a pink couch (the color scheme is, in the main, green and pink) in his living room to talk. \u201cI don\u2019t mind pink,\u201d he said. \u201cI can handle a pink couch.\u201dBut in his work, Mr. Cannavale has a boiling intensity his hangdog jowls and puppyish eyes belie. He was raised on the greats, worshiping Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in their primes. (His current co-stars: Mr. Pacino, Mr. De Niro.) He has a sly way of becoming the best part of whatever he\u2019s in, however good or bad it may be.\u201cThe thing that\u2019s so infectious about Bobby \u2014 you see it in his work and you see it in his life \u2014 is wherever he is is the best place ever,\u201d said the director and screenwriter Tom McCarthy (\u201cSpotlight\u201d), who wrote Mr. Cannavale\u2019s breakthrough film role in \u201cThe Station Agent\u201d for him. It allows him to elevate even what ought to be throwaway roles \u2014 Will\u2019s thick boyfriend in \u201cWill & Grace\u201d (Emmy No. 1), say \u2014 into something more.\u201cHe\u2019s entirely un-self-conscious,\u201d said Olivia Wilde, who played his wife on \u201cVinyl.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never trying to look cool, which holds back a surprising amount of people, I find. He\u2019s never trying to maintain some sense of control. He gives in completely. It allows the scenes to become really thrilling. You don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to take it. He doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s just very present.\u201dMaybe because his gift is his presence, he is even more at home, and more alive, on stage. He was a trembling tour de force in \u201cThe _______ With the Hat\u201d in 2011 (the full title is unprintable here), him and Chris Rock together on a Broadway stage. It led to his Emmy-winning role on \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d with Mr. Scorsese.\u201cHe\u2019s ferocious,\u201d said Ethan Hawke, a friend since they appeared together in \u201cHurlyburly\u201d in 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s a great combination when somebody is wildly intelligent with a wicked intellect who also works from their gut. He\u2019s just all in, wherever you find him.\u201dThis month, he is a hard-boiled \u201cHard Copy\u201d producer in \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d trailing Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly through their tabloid travesties. He is a glowering supervillain in \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d facing off with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart for ownership of a mystical jewel. He is the voice of an animated bull in \u201cFerdinand.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m on the studio president\u2019s list: \u2018The movie\u2019s going to star Cannavale,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201dWith film and television, the ancillary calculus that drives projects forward \u2014 what does your name mean in foreign markets? Will your casting secure financing? \u2014 doesn\u2019t favor him. The variables that govern every element of its making don\u2019t interest Mr. Cannavale. And, unlike with a play, he has no sense of how good or bad it may be until it\u2019s out.\u201cIf I did, maybe \u2018Vinyl\u2019 would still be on the air,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I told you I wasn\u2019t really disappointed by that decision. It didn\u2019t hit me for a few months, and then it hit, and it hit hard.\u201dHe sighed.\u201cThis game is baseball,\u201d he said, leaning back on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to bat a thousand. We all have things that missed. You never know. You keep trying and trying. The best hitters are .300 hitters, right?\u201dAfter \u201cVinyl,\u201d he went to Sydney, Australia, to spend time with Ms. Byrne, who was performing there, and Rocco. (The two have been together since 2012.) He licked his wounds. Then came the call for \u201cThe Hairy Ape,\u201d and he threw himself into it and it brought him back from the brink.\u201cIt allowed me to feel like I was part of something again,\u201d Mr. Cannavale said. \u201cI felt like it was contributing to the culture. They don\u2019t all feel like that. Sometimes it\u2019s \u2018Snakes on a Plane.\u2019\u201dMr. Cannavale has also found himself navigating the tsunami of sexual harassment and abuse claims embroiling the entertainment industry.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything until everybody else did. I think it was an extremely brave thing for her to do.\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to be quiet about this anymore. People can stand up and have their power, take back their lives. I support Jenny.\u201dThe widespread revelations of sexual misconduct dominating the news have changed the entire conversation for him and those in his orbit. \u201cIt is something that we have never really sat and talked about socially,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I am. I feel so stupid. I\u2019m reading these accounts and really rethinking my behavior, my silence and all those things \u2014 it\u2019s a good thing, but it comes with a lot of regret.\u201dBack at the house, the baby had begun to cry. The next day, Mr. Cannavale would cook Thanksgiving dinner for the four of them; Jake, also an actor and now a sometime co-star, was elsewhere. Then they\u2019d head to Los Angeles, where Mr. Cannavale will soon begin shooting \u201cHomecoming,\u201d a new Amazon drama by Sam Esmail, the creator of \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d with Julia Roberts.The prospect of escaping the cold of the New York winter was appealing, but Mr. Cannavale has always preferred to live here, not in Los Angeles \u201cThe big business, Hollywood? I don\u2019t really work in that business,\u201d he said. \u201cI peripherally work in it, but I\u2019m not involved in it the way some people are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Shape of Water\u2019 and \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Lead Golden Globe Nominations", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGolden Globes BriefingGolden Globes voters nominated a wide mix of movies on Monday, pulling smaller dramas like \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d deeper into the Oscar race, throwing support to Ridley Scott\u2019s last-minute effort to erase Kevin Spacey from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and embracing diversity among the nominees.The largest number of movie nominations \u2014 seven \u2014 went to Guillermo del Toro\u2019s fantasy \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d including ones for best drama, director, actress (Sally Hawkins), supporting actress (Octavia Spencer) and supporting actor (Richard Jenkins). Close behind with six apiece were \u201cThe Post,\u201d a Watergate-era drama about the struggles of Katharine Graham to lead The Washington Post, and \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d about a mother (Frances McDormand, a nominee for best actress) who pushes local authorities to investigate her daughter\u2019s murder.All of those films come from 20th Century Fox, which led film companies with 27 nominations, including 15 from its Fox Searchlight specialty label.\u201cAll three come from filmmakers with something important to say \u2014 uncompromised, singular, strong, auteur voices,\u201d said Stacey Snider, Fox\u2019s movie chief. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we have differentiated ourselves as a place for that kind of filmmaking.\u201dThe other nominees for best drama were \u201cDunkirk,\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s World War II epic, and the romance \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d Voters also gave Mr. Nolan a directing nod but unexpectedly disregarded the \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d filmmaker Luca Guadagnino.But timing is everything in show business, and Academy Award voters (some 8,400) cannot help but pay attention to the Globes. The 75th Globes ceremony will be hosted by Seth Meyers and broadcast live on NBC on Jan. 7. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce Oscar nominations on Jan. 23.Among television categories, HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d emerged as the one to beat on Monday, taking six nominations, including for best limited series and all four of its actresses \u2014 Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in the lead category and Laura Dern and Shailene Woodley in supporting. \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d helped push HBO to 12 total nominations, the most of any television network.The nominations were announced by Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell and Sharon Stone in a pre-dawn presentation at the Beverly Hilton Hotel timed for the East Coast-based morning news shows. The press association handed out Champagne before 5 a.m. Pacific Time to toast the 75th anniversary of the awards.\u201cThe Post\u201d also picked up nominations for its screenplay, written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the score by John Williams.Because the press association gives a prize for best drama and best comedy, Hollywood often looks to directing nominees for clues about what film truly rose to the top at the Globes. Joining Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Nolan and Mr. del Toro were Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d and Mr. Scott, who abruptly reshot portions of his kidnapping thriller \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d after one of its original stars, Mr. Spacey, became embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal.Mr. Spacey\u2019s replacement, Christopher Plummer, received a nomination for his supporting role. In a surprise, Michelle Williams, who stars in \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d as the desperate mother of J. Paul Getty III, who was kidnapped in 1973, was nominated alongside Ms. Streep, Ms. McDormand and Ms. Hawkins as best dramatic actress. Jessica Chastain (\u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d) filled out that category.The press association has worked hard in recent years to jettison its reputation for oddball nominations that were interpreted more as efforts to populate its televised banquet with stars than honor the year\u2019s best performances. The list on Monday contained no outright embarrassments. But there were some nods that assured pretty young faces: Ansel Elgort, an acting nominee for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d for instance.Foreign film nominees were Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d (Cambodia), \u201cA Fantastic Woman\u201d (Chile), \u201cIn the Fade\u201d (Germany and France\u201d) \u201cLoveless\u201d (Russia) and \u201cThe Square\u201d (Sweden, Germany and France).Globes voters like to make agenda-setting choices with their television awards. They paid early attention to \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d helping to catapult those series into the cultural firmament. But Emmys voters may have beaten them to the punch this year.But Globes voters also bestowed multiple nominations on \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cSMILF.\u201d They even found ways to throw attention toward the new ABC hit \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d which has received middling reviews, honoring its star, Freddie Highmore, in the best actor category. Joining him is Jason Bateman \u2014 nominated for his work in the new Netflix crime series \u201cOzark\u201d \u2014 Sterling K. Brown (\u201cThis is Us\u201d), Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) and Liev Schreiber (\u201cRay Donovan\u201d).A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified an actress in Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d She is Alex Borstein \u2014 not Susie Myerson, which is the character Ms. Borstein plays in the show.John Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1934John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Read more \u25beB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

He paid $7.50 a share for his initial stake. That\u2019s an increase of roughly four million percent.\u201dMr. Buffett currently owns 17 percent of the company, worth about $85 billion.Here\u2019s what Denise Morrison of Campbell had to say about her company\u2019s acquisition:The acquisition of Snyder\u2019s-Lance will accelerate Campbell\u2019s strategy and is in line with our Purpose, \u2018real food that matters for life\u2019s moments.\u2019 It will provide our consumers with an even greater variety of better-for-you snacks.And here\u2019s what Michele Buck of Hershey said:The acquisition of Amplify and its product portfolio is an important step in our journey to becoming an innovative snacking powerhouse as together it will enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle.\u201dThe advisersFor Campbell: Credit Suisse, Rothschild and Weil, Gotshal & MangesFor Snyder\u2019s-Lance: Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Jenner & BlockFor Hershey: JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & FlomFor Amplify: Jefferies and Godwin Procter\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFor decades, the company best known for its sometimes maddening-to-assemble low-priced furniture has also had a reputation as a master tax avoider, making use of complex legal structures to minimize its tax bill.The company\u2019s business model was changed to a franchise structure in the early 1980s, with Inter Ikea operating its franchise business. Inter Ikea, through a Dutch subsidiary, receives franchise fees equal to 3 percent of the revenue from Ikea stores worldwide, according to regulators. Although Ikea was founded in Sweden in 1943, the parent company is based in the Netherlands.European regulators are concerned in particular about a 2006 Dutch ruling that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of its franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to a company in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Over the years, Ikea has argued that its business structure was perfectly legal.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIncreasing optimism that the Republican tax overhaul will be signed into law this week has pushed shares of bank stocks to levels not hit since before the financial crisis.Goldman Sachs in a note Monday said lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent could lead to a 14 percent increase in earnings per share on average for banks. Wells Fargo, according to Goldman\u2019s analysis, stands to be the biggest beneficiary, with an 18 percent increase in its earnings per share.Andrew writes:The narrative of the week is clearly going to be the tax plan, which is almost certain to pass Congress this week. The real question is how the business community will react (not everyone is applauding) and whether the overhaul will change corporate America\u2019s view of President Trump.Last week, I attended Jeffrey Sonnenfeld\u2019s Yale C.E.O. Summit, where some of the biggest business leaders in the world participate and talk candidly about issues from business to policy \u2014 and, this year, did so just as the tax plan seemed to turn a corner.The event is considered off-the-record, so I can\u2019t share exact details of what was said. But Mr. Sonnenfeld sent me the results of a survey he took electronically during the event, and they are eye-opening.\u2022 \u201cMore than 2,000 arbitration cases have been filed against UBS and other broker-dealers, including Santander Securities, Popular Securities and Merrill Lynch. UBS had disproportionately more litigation because the firm had at one point about half of the island\u2019s market share.\u201d\u2022 \u201cBy the end of 2012, more than $10 billion in assets were invested in UBS\u2019s bond funds. That represented about 10 percent of the island\u2019s gross domestic product at the time.\u201d\u2022 Residents of Puerto Rico who invested in the island\u2019s bonds were told their investment would be safe and would generate greater returns than comparable investments. And when the value of those bonds began to tumble, they were told to hold on, prices would eventually rebound.\u2022 \u201cThis year, eventually became never after Puerto Rico triggered bankruptcy-like proceedings, and the island began restructuring its debt to seek protection from creditors \u2014 pushing the already depreciated bond prices within the funds lower.

{"Headline": "Barkley Hendricks Rejected the Label of Black Political Painter", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus. Another wrote, \u201cConsider taking his courses during 2nd semester because he hates winter, so he\u2019s more sympathetic when grades close in the spring!\u201dHendricks really did hate the winter. On his holiday break, he often traveled to Jamaica with his wife, Susan, where he painted landscapes. He began painting professionally in the mid-1960s; frustrated by a lack of black representation in the Western canon, he created life-size portraits of mostly black subjects: family members, people he met on the street, himself. The audacity of his subjects, who often faced forward in braggadocious stances, wearing monochromatic clothing, combined with the charged politics of the era, made critics label Hendricks a capital-B Black painter with political aims, which he vehemently rejected. In his most famous work, \u201cBrilliantly Endowed (Self-Portrait),\u201d he stands nearly naked in a pair of bright white tube socks and a brimmed hat, his thumb and forefinger framing his penis. It wasn\u2019t a major political statement: He\u2019d just heard that your own self is a good subject \u201csince,\u201d he once said, \u201cyou are always around.\u201d One of his first portraits, \u201cLawdy Mama,\u201d of a light-skinned woman with a luxuriant Afro, was rumored to be a militant activist, maybe, inevitably, Angela Davis or Kathleen Cleaver, but it was Hendricks\u2019s cousin. He maintained that he painted solely what he liked, without any hidden messages. His landscapes, which he loved, never received the same attention his portraits did.In March 2016, Hendricks had what turned out to be his final solo show at the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York. The news release called the exhibit his \u201cmost political to date.\u201d The show included the monochromatic portraits he was known for \u2014 like \u201cManhattan Memo,\u201d a shadowy depiction of a man in an expletive-laden black T-shirt and paint-smeared jeans, or \u201cPhoto Bloke,\u201d of a man outfitted in a soft pink suit \u2014 but art-world coverage of the show focused on paintings that seemed to strike a new tone. \u201cIn the Crosshairs of the States\u201d features a young black man with his arms raised, a gray hoodie flipped up around his face. On the front of the garment, a messianic figure, also black, looks up; a Confederate flag and the fabric of an American flag engirdle the portrait.In interviews about the exhibition, Hendricks rebuffed any assumptions that he had adopted a new radical bent. \u201cAnything a black person does in terms of the figure is put into a \u2018political\u2019 category,\u201d he chided one reporter. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I want to do. I paint because I like to paint. I paint because I\u2019m motivated for a variety of reasons that I don\u2019t think are always necessary to blab about.\u201d He was just painting, he insisted to the end, what he saw.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: \u201cI ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE. LET NOT ANYONE STOP YOU.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1933None of it compensates for the lack of a man\u2019s touch. The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1946Read more \u25beB. 1928This was the dilemma facing Adam West, the former William West Anderson, as he contemplated becoming TV\u2019s Batman in the fall of 1965. He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.Read more \u25beB. 1974John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1954At the end of a school day when Irina Ratushinskaya was a fifth grader in the 1960s in Odessa, her teacher stepped out of class and an exuberant student seized the moment to throw a chestnut across the room. The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt! How much more to my liking was his answer than mine!\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1934John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Read more \u25beB. 1927John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Henry \u2018Enrico\u2019 Quarantelli Proved That Disasters Bring Out the Best in Us", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1924He was small, bald, smiley, unthreatening; he liked to find a corner, blend in, take notes. It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dIn 1963, he and his two colleagues, Russell Dynes and Eugene Haas, established the Disaster Research Center at Ohio State University. (The center later moved to the University of Delaware.) Their idea was simple: to rush off to wherever a disaster struck, often within hours, and document who did what and why. The center was initially funded by the Department of Defense, which saw natural disasters as proxies for nuclear war, full-scale laboratories in which it might learn to control the pandemonium that it assumed would follow a Soviet strike. But imagining the behavior of human beings turned out to be quite different from actually looking at it.\u201cIn general,\u201d Quarantelli and Dynes wrote in 1975, summarizing their findings, \u201ccooperation rather than conflict is encouraged.\u201d Hysteria was largely mythical; actions mistaken for panic, like running, en masse, as fast as you can from a collapsing building, were actually reasonable responses to danger. \u201cNatural disasters democratize social life\u201d and \u201cstrengthen community identification,\u201d they wrote. Class distinctions disappear, at least temporarily, as people suffer and work together. Looting is exceedingly rare, while fears of looting are rampant. Government bureaucracies, which are designed to be rigid and dependable, not to improvise or adapt, are often left rudderless. But ad hoc groups of ordinary citizens arise to pick up the slack. The center\u2019s sociologists observed these \u201cemergent organizations\u201d forming again and again after disasters around the world: teaming up and switching on, like a kind of civic immune response. Victims of disasters often wind up with heightened feelings of kinship and purpose. A mentor of Quarantelli\u2019s, Charles Fritz, posited that \u201cas social animals, people perhaps come closer to fulfilling their basic human needs in the aftermath of disaster than at any other time.\u201d Quarantelli wasn\u2019t inclined to philosophical extrapolations, but he spent his career gathering the data to suggest this was true.He visited dozens of disasters himself, around the United States and abroad, and dispatched more than 200 graduate students elsewhere, building up the literature of a new field, disaster studies, while simultaneously peopling it with acolytes. (\u201cHe\u2019s written everything, and everything I\u2019ve read in this field cites him,\u201d a former graduate student remembers thinking, while picking raffle winners beside him at her first Christmas party at the center.) At 76, frail and retired, he scrambled to Lower Manhattan within days of the Sept. 11 attacks. What was he doing there? \u201cLooking,\u201d one of his colleagues said.This year was an especially disastrous one. We were battered by hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, landslides and floods. And yet, amid all the devastation, confusion, suffering and mismanagement, people still responded in the ways they always have. There was the Houston mattress magnate who opened his showrooms to those displaced by Hurricane Harvey; the bands of civilian topos, or \u201cmoles,\u201d who dug through the rubble in Mexico City; and all the small instances of cooperation and selflessness that went unrecorded. Still, we tended to see these acts as exceptional, evidence of what makes a particular community special, rather than as consistent with a half-century of rigorous social science.Why do we struggle to see ourselves outside the myths Quarantelli debunked? He wondered that himself. It\u2019s hard to accept that goodness might be ordinary, hard to imagine a truth as deflating and reassuring as that.Jon Mooallem is a writer at large for the magazine and the author of the book \u201cWild Ones.\u201dB. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch.

By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what.

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures.

On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said.

She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maryam Mirzakhani Drew Her Way to Mathematical Greatness", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Mirzakhani moved to the United States in the fall of 1999, for graduate school at Harvard. Her passion was geometry, and she was particularly drawn to \u201chyperbolic surfaces,\u201d which are shaped like Pringles potato chips. She explored a universe extreme in its abstraction \u2014 with \u201cmoduli spaces,\u201d where every point represents a surface \u2014 and dimensions that exceed our own. Somehow Mirzakhani was able to conjure aspects of such spaces to consider, doodling on a white sheet of paper to try an idea, or remember one, or search for a new one; only later would she transcribe her adventures in the conventional symbols of mathematics. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to write down all the details,\u201d she once told a journalist. \u201cBut the process of drawing something helps you somehow to stay connected.\u201d Her Ph.D. thesis began with counting simple loops on surfaces and led to a calculation of the total volume of moduli spaces. This allowed the young scholar to publish three separate papers in top mathematical journals, one of which contained a surprising new proof of the famous \u201cWitten conjecture,\u201d a milestone in theoretical physics connecting mathematics and quantum gravity. Mirzakhani\u2019s mathematics is treasured for its great creative leaps, for the connections it has revealed between distant fields, for its sense of grandeur.When Jan Vondrak, who would become her husband, met her in 2003, he had no idea, he says, that \u201cshe was a superstar.\u201d Mirzakhani was finishing up at Harvard, and Vondrak, now a Stanford mathematics professor, was in grad school at M.I.T.; they met at a party, each recognizing a kindred spirit who didn\u2019t especially enjoy parties. Vondrak introduced her to jazz, and the two went for long runs along the Charles River. Mirzakhani was both modest \u2014 Vondrak learned of many accomplishments through common friends \u2014 and bracingly ambitious. Vondrak recalls her dreams of future discoveries in moduli space, but also her resolve to explore more distant fields, like number theory, combinatorics and \u201cergodic theory.\u201d She had, Vondrak said, \u201c100 years of plans.\u201dThree years ago, Mirzakhani, 37, became the first woman to win the Fields Medal, the Nobel Prize of mathematics. News of the award, and the obvious symbolism (first woman, first Iranian, an immigrant from a Muslim country) sat uneasily with her. She was puzzled when she discovered that some people thought mathematics was not for women \u2014 it was not an idea that she or her friends encountered growing up in Iran \u2014 but she was not inclined, by personality, to tell others what to think. As she became a major celebrity among Iranians, people would approach her to ask for a photo, which she hated. The Fields Medal was also announced when she had just finished a grueling treatment for breast cancer.In 2016, the cancer returned, spreading to Mirzakhani\u2019s liver and bones. Everyone who knew Mirzakhani describes her as unwaveringly optimistic; they always left conversations feeling energized. Eventually, though, it became impossible for Mirzakhani to continue with what her young daughter, Anahita, called her \u201cpainting.\u201d At a Stanford memorial service, Curtis McMullen, Mirzakhani\u2019s thesis adviser and chairman of Harvard\u2019s Department of Mathematics, said that when she was a student, she would come to his office and pose questions that were \u201clike science fiction stories,\u201d vivid scenes she saw in some unexplored corner of the mathematical universe \u2014 strange structures and beguiling patterns, all in motion and interconnected. Then she would look at him with her blue-gray eyes. \u201cIs it right?\u201d she would ask, as if he might know the answer.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J. Edgar Hoover by telegram: \u201cI ADVOCATE AND ENCOURAGE ALL FBI AGENTS TO GO AFTER DICK GREGORY IN FULL FORCE.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace. So, one October day in 1999, you write 30 words that will appear as a personal ad in The New York Review of Books. \u201cBefore I turn 67 \u2014 next March \u2014 I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Your Mother\u2019s Maiden Name Is Not a Secret", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionResolutions to shake laziness, get organized and gain control of finances are ritually adopted each January and abandoned soon after. But there\u2019s one common bad habit that consumers and billion-dollar businesses alike should have quit long ago and can\u2019t afford to carry into 2018: the use of weak website security questions.Security questions are astonishingly insecure: The answers to many of them are easily researched or guessed, yet they can be the sole barrier to someone gaining access to your account. The cryptology and security expert Bruce Schneier once described them as an \u201ceasier-to-guess low-security backup password that sites want you to have in case you forget your harder-to-remember higher-security password.\u201dStill, this technology has persisted despite the availability of two-factor authentication, and on sites that we use frequently and that contain important, sensitive data \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, eBay, PayPal and many banks and airlines.There has been no shortage of incidents demonstrating these questions\u2019 vulnerabilities. In 2005, Paris Hilton\u2019s T-Mobile account was hacked by a teenager who, like anyone who searched \u201cParis Hilton Chihuahua\u201d on the internet, knew the answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite pet\u2019s name?\u201d In 2008, Sarah Palin\u2019s Yahoo account was hacked by a college student who reset her password using her birth date, ZIP code and the place where she met her spouse. In 2014, after nude photos of several Hollywood actresses were leaked, Apple reported that their iCloud accounts had been hacked through \u201ca very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions.\u201dIf you aren\u2019t famous enough to be a target, you may still be a victim of a mass data breach. Whereas passwords are usually stored in hashed or encrypted form, answers to security questions are often stored \u2014 and therefore stolen \u2014 in plain text, as users entered them. This was the case in the 2015 breach of the extramarital encounters site Ashley Madison, which affected 32 million users, and in some of the Yahoo breaches, disclosed over the past year and a half, which affected all of its three billion accounts.The Equifax breach this year may have revealed some users\u2019 security questions and answers outright, and it certainly gave thieves enough personal information to answer common questions. TransUnion evidently did not heed this warning: Users wishing to freeze their credit files in the wake of the Equifax breach have to create an account, and to do so they must choose a security question, such as \u201cWhat city were you born in?\u201dAccording to Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, organizations continue to use security questions because they are easy to set up technically, and easy for users. \u201cIf you ask someone their favorite color, that\u2019s not a drama,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to give you a straight answer. If you say, \u2018Hey, please download this authenticator app and point the camera at a QR code on the screen,\u2019 you\u2019re starting to lose people.\u201d Some organizations have made a risk-based decision to retain this relatively weak security measure, often letting users opt for it over two-factor authentication, in the interest of getting people signed up.Security questions ask for something you know about yourself, and to be even moderately secure, they should ask for something only you know. It\u2019s exceedingly difficult to design questions that do this. Many security questions ask for biographical information that is publicly available, whether in open records or via social media: where you were married, your first phone number, your paternal grandfather\u2019s middle name.Aside from these questions\u2019 vulnerability to a little research (to say nothing of nosy parents or malicious exes), none of them are relevant to all adults. How many of us can answer the premillennial \u201cWhat city were you in to celebrate the year 2000?\u201d or \u201cWhat year did you take out your first mortgage?\u201d And how many Indian- or Brazilian-born users went to a high school without a mascot, or grew up on a street with no name? How many of our mothers never changed their names?The other main type of security question asks for a subjective answer. Such questions imagine lives punctuated by distinct firsts and bests and filled with enduring favorites, but favorites and bests and even firsts can change when people maintain accounts for decades. At some point, both factual and subjective security questions become archaeological. \u201cIn what month did you meet your significant other?\u201d requires a framing question: Whom were you with when you set up this account?A 2015 study by Google engineers found that only 47 percent of people could remember what they put down as their favorite food a year earlier \u2014 and that hackers were able to guess the food nearly 20 percent of the time, with Americans\u2019 most common answer being pizza. (Google has been phasing out security questions in recent years.) Even when people remember their answers, they sometimes forget their precise form. This hazard has prompted some websites to offer a fixed set of answers. To \u201cWhat is your favorite type of reading?\u201d United Airlines offers a pull-down menu with 19 options, including blogs, cookbooks, professional development and self-help, but nothing like literary fiction (the death of the novel?).As long as security questions are going to be used, professional consensus holds, they should have many possible answers, and each of those possible answers should be simple, stable, memorable and not easily researched or guessed. But questions that are sufficiently general to apply to most people almost never fulfill these requirements: \u201cWhat is your favorite season?\u201d \u201cWhat is your favorite fabric?\u201d \u201cWho is your favorite person in history?\u201dEven exceptions that look good at first fall short. \u201cWhat is the last name of the teacher who gave you your first failing grade?\u201d includes an assumption about academic records; strangely, it appears on the LSAT registration website, whose users\u2019 transcripts are likely to be too unblemished to furnish an answer. \u201cWhat was the name of the boy/girl you had your second kiss with?\u201d is impossible in its Proustian hyperspecificity. Then there\u2019s the State Bank of India\u2019s vertiginous \u201cWhat is the website that you rarely visit?\u201d which reads like a Zen koan whose purpose is to make you reflect on the unknowability of the answer.What would a truly powerful security question be? The ideal is a science-fiction scenario where your future self calls your past self, and your past self asks your future self to prove it\u2019s you. When given the chance to write their own questions, though, most people choose not an intimate secret but something more like \u201c1+1=?\u201dThe temporary solution, Mr. Hunt says, is to create false answers and to keep them somewhere safe, whether in a password manager (which can generate and store a random string for each answer field) or even on a piece of paper. Security questions pit \u201cusability against security,\u201d said Mr. Schneier, the cryptology and security expert, and the former usually wins.Security questions are premised on a paradox: Our experiences are at once universal and particular to us. Yet it seems we are all lazy in exactly the same way.Anne Diebel is a senior investigator at the private investigations firm QRI.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Russian Ploy: Competing Extradition Requests", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian spam kingpin had long been in the cross hairs of the F.B.I., and agents finally got their shot when the man scheduled a vacation in Spain. At the agency\u2019s request, Spanish security officers in April arrested the man, Pyotr Y. Levashov, who is accused of stuffing untold millions of inboxes with ads for pornography, pills and penny stocks.But then the Russian authorities sprang a trap of their own, filing an extradition request with the Spanish authorities for a crime they said Mr. Levashov had committed in Russia years ago. Currently, he is languishing in a Spanish jail, but soon the authorities will have to decide which extradition request to honor: the United States\u2019 or Russia\u2019s.This was by no means the first time that Russia had filed a competing extradition request. Far-fetched as it may seem, the Russians\u2019 tactic has in several instances prevented Russians suspected of being computer criminals from being deported to the United States while detained in Europe.The tactic has raised suspicions that the Russian authorities are more interested in derailing American investigations and possibly protecting criminals they find useful than they are in fighting cybercrime.\u201cPeople always ask me about this,\u201d Timofey S. Musatov, a Moscow lawyer whose Russian client is the subject of competing extradition requests. \u201cIt\u2019s the most common question.\u201dThree similar cases are pending in courts in Greece, Spain and the Czech Republic. In two of the three, either the defendants\u2019 lawyers or relatives have said that their cases have some bearing on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States. While that may be true, they have not provided any proof.Their theory is that with the politically charged atmosphere in the United States over the election meddling, the accused could not possibly get a fair trial there, so they should be returned to Russia.In accordance with extradition treaties in all three countries, Russian lawyers say, the decision about where to send the accused resides with a government minister. That opens the prospect of the United States\u2019 being powerless to stop the return to Russia of a suspect who may be able to offer valuable information on Russian meddling in the election.The Russian case, Mr. Musatov said, surfaced soon after Mr. Vinnik\u2019s detention in Athens, possibly because the Russian police had read about his client in news reports and decided to investigate him.\u201cI\u2019m a procedural lawyer who works with documents and law,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work in the category of conspiracy theories.\u201d Mr. Vinnik has no known links to election hacking, he said.\u201cThis norm is in effect everywhere,\u201d said Vladimir V. Makeyev, a lawyer for another Russian cybercrime suspect, Yevgeny A. Nikulin, who was detained in Prague while on vacation with his girlfriend.Mr. Makeyev argues that the United States is seeking Mr. Nikulin\u2019s cooperation in the election-hacking investigation and that an F.B.I. agent from the San Francisco field office, Jeffrey Miller, traveled to Prague to offer asylum in exchange for testimony. The F.B.I. has said the agent was there only to read Mr. Nikulin his rights, and it remains unclear how he may have been connected to election hacking.One theory for the travel, he said, is the \u201cgirlfriend effect\u201d: \u201cYou are a little hacking nerd and now you have a good-looking girlfriend, and it gets cold in Russia, and she says, \u2018It\u2019s cold; I hate it here,\u2019 and it wears him down, so he goes somewhere sunny, and that\u2019s it.\u201dThe American indictment asserts that Mr. Levashov, using the nickname Peter Severa, or Peter of the North, ran a spam operation powered by a sophisticated, evolving family of computer viruses called Waledac, and later Kelihos. Mr. Levashov\u2019s nickname may be derived from his northern hometown, St. Petersburg, or the name of a porn movie star, referring to the pornography promoted by spam email.Mr. Levashov told a Spanish court that the case should be viewed politically because he had worked for United Russia, a political party that backs President Vladimir V. Putin, and he is an army officer with access to Russian classified information.In an online chat room for hackers years earlier, using the nickname Peter Severa, Mr. Levashov had gone further, suggesting that he had enlisted in a broad recruitment effort by the Russian government, begun about four years ago, to engage students, computer professionals and criminals in government hacking teams, sometimes called science squadrons.\u201cGood day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy name is Peter Severa. Many people know me for my service distributing email.\u201d But \u201ceverything is in flux, everything changes, and the time has come for me to change the direction of my work.\u201dHe said he had a new role: The Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., had appointed him to lead a group of hackers who would work for the security service, which he called a \u201cspecial battalion for information security.\u201dMichael Schwirtz contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Russia.Advertisement"}

Despite years of replanting, it isn\u2019t making much progress.The loss of frozen ground in Arctic regions is a striking result of climate change. And it is also a cause of more warming to come.The United States has emitted more planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than any other country. Now it is walking back a promise to lower emissions.The party\u2019s fast journey from debating how to combat climate change to arguing against its existence is a story of big political money and Democratic hubris.The new E.P.A. administrator has a long, helpful history with Devon Energy, going back to his days as attorney general of Oklahoma.The list shows dozens of environmental policies that the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry.The Federal Emergency Management Agency is trying to prepare for bigger floods even as the White House is hostile to talking about climate change.A peculiar confluence of history, legal precedent and defiance has set the stage for a regulatory mutiny in California that would reverberate throughout the country.Even as conversations about the subject remain contentious, the environment is becoming a concern no one there can ignore.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.In the Pearl River Delta, breakneck development is colliding with the effects of climate change.In the waterlogged Netherlands, climate change is considered neither a hypothetical nor a drag on the economy. Instead, it\u2019s an opportunity.The Texas city\u2019s response to a powerful storm says much about polarized visions of the country and diverging attitudes toward cities, race, liberty and science.Countless human-made troubles in the Indonesian capital pose an imminent threat to the city\u2019s survival. And it has to deal with mounting threats from climate change.Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.Japan has spent billions on an underground system to control water around the capital, but some fear that the city is vulnerable as global warming brings more extreme weather.A concerted effort is underway in dozens of states to roll back solar power incentives.

{"Headline": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Rivals This Holiday: Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that a blockbuster fourth-quarter album by a music superstar could rescue a record company from financial ruin, or at least a slow sales year. Think of Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cKingdom Come,\u201d which sold 680,000 copies during Black Friday week in 2006 and showed up beneath plenty of Christmas trees that year.But in today\u2019s world of Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music, music fans are paying less attention to those kinds of late-in-the-year releases. They\u2019re too busy streaming Christmas music.\u201cFor the first time, this year, we are actually dissuading our labels from releasing albums in the December time period,\u201d said Vinnie Freda, the Warner Music Group\u2019s chief data officer. \u201cIt\u2019s like the world stopped between Dec. 7 and Dec. 28. It\u2019s like people stopped listening to music.\u201dThese are boom times for holiday music, with overall streams increasing to nearly 2.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year from almost 1.3 billion in the same period in 2015, according to Nielsen Music.Many in the record business are encouraging the biggest stars to put out albums in other months like January, after people receive iTunes gift cards and streaming subscriptions for Christmas presents, and September, when students get ready to go back to school.\u201cThe business is shifting,\u201d said Steve Berman, vice chairman of the Interscope/Geffen/A&M label. \u201cAs you look at where consumption is going, it certainly will become less and less reliant on that big, fourth-quarter tent pole.\u201dEarlier this year, after the pop star Sia informed her manager, Jonathan Daniel, that she liked Christmas music, he encouraged her to write two holiday originals. She responded with a full album. The result, \u201cEveryday Is Christmas,\u201d has 10 songs that have streamed a combined 55 million times on Spotify, generating revenue of nearly $385,000 via that service alone, according to estimates based on data from the Recording Industry Association of America. It has also sold 16,000 physical CDs and 17,000 digital versions.\u201cIt feels like streaming is the way people are going to listen to Christmas music in the future,\u201d Mr. Daniel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so practical and logical. Giving CDs as gifts \u2014 if it\u2019s still a thing, it\u2019s probably as little of a thing as it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s not extinct yet. But at some point it will be, for sure.\u201dRevenue from paid subscription services increased to $2.5 billion last year from $780 million in 2014, according to the R.I.A.A. Amid this industry upheaval, artists and labels find it makes little sense to hew to traditional release-date dogma.Albums used to come out only on Tuesdays, for instance, until labels loosened that policy two years ago. Music fans, especially young ones raised on iTunes and YouTube, are so accustomed to instant singles on SoundCloud and surprise album releases that they cannot understand waiting until after Thanksgiving to hear a finished work.So December is now primarily for holiday music. Streaming has increased the popularity of chestnuts like the Vince Guaraldi Trio\u2019s \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d and Bing Crosby\u2019s \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d as well as newer stars like Michael Bubl\u00e9 and Pentatonix. (\u201cA Pentatonix Christmas\u201d sold more than 900,000 copies in the fourth quarter of 2016, dwarfing non-holiday themed releases by Metallica and Bruno Mars.)Mr. Berman pointed to Gwen Stefani, who, he said, released her new \u201cYou Make It Feel Like Christmas\u201d in part to become an \u201cevergreen,\u201d Mariah Carey-like streaming hit.\u201cIt will, for years to come, be an important holiday piece of music,\u201d he said, perhaps hopefully.A music-business emphasis on holiday music is not new \u2014 radio stations tend to flip formats from Top 40 or country to all \u201cGrandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\u201d all the time around Thanksgiving. But streaming services have increased the volume. Spotify has 16 in-house holiday playlists, like \u201cChristmas Pop\u201d and \u201cBlue Christmas,\u201d totaling nearly four million followers; SiriusXM has added eight holiday-music channels, including one devoted entirely to Hanukkah music.\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to stream holiday music,\u201d said Sig Sigworth, president of Craft Recordings for Concord Records\u2019 catalog division, which puts out Mr. Guaraldi\u2019s album. \u201cGo to a playlist, there it is.\u201dUniversal Music, the world\u2019s biggest label, has increased streaming from Mr. Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and the rest of its holiday catalog by 50 percent annually, according to Jane Ventom, the company\u2019s executive vice president of marketing and product development. \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d increased its streams by 57 percent this year, compared with the same period in 2016.Still, superstars do seem to be able to upend the holiday theme. Ms. Swift sold more than one million copies of \u201cReputation\u201d in its release week last month; Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d came out in November 2015 and sold 7.4 million albums by year\u2019s end. Alex Luke, global head of programming and content strategy for Amazon Music, which is emphasizing holiday content such as Smokey Robinson\u2019s new \u201cChristmas Everyday,\u201d said fans were simply consuming more of both holiday and pop music this time of year.\u201cI think it\u2019s additive,\u201d he said.John Fleckenstein, executive vice president of RCA Records, home of Sia and Pentatonix, noted that the fourth quarter, which the music industry considers the final three months of the year, was the time of prominent award shows and important TV appearances. The Country Music Association Awards and the American Music Awards, for instance, both take place in November.\u201cUntil those two things start to change, you\u2019ll still see a lot of the big names come out at the end of the year,\u201d he said.Indeed, data from Nielsen Music shows that the top five singles from the last two fourth quarters combined to stream just a little more than the overall holiday-music songs during the same periods. But that difference has been shrinking. And although it does not mean Mr. Crosby is about to pull even with Ms. Swift on the charts, it does suggest a shift in listener behavior.\u201cThe fourth quarter becomes a lot less important in a streaming world than it is in a physical world,\u201d David Bakula, Nielsen Music\u2019s senior vice president of industry insights, said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just because of holiday music \u2014 that\u2019s because of the way music is being consumed now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Christmas May Be Over, but Holiday Shopping Is Not", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGina Mezzacappa avoided the mall for her holiday shopping, but an ill-fitting pair of Michael Kors boots brought her back this week.The shoes, a gift for her daughter, had come from Macy\u2019s website, but Ms. Mezzacappa visited the Galleria at White Plains to return them in person.By the time she got her $50 back, she had spent $300 on other items.Christmas is over, but holiday shopping is still in full swing.The final stretch of December, traditionally a slow period used by retailers to purge outdated inventory, is generating so much traffic and sales that some chains are calling it the 13th Month or the Second Season. It is a recognition of the swarms of consumers who are flooding back into shops and websites on a rising tide of returns, exchanges and gift cards.Five years ago, only 5 percent of consumers planned to shop after Christmas, according to a Deloitte survey. This year, nearly 40 percent will.Retailers, as they do every year, are discounting leftover stacks of reindeer-emblazoned sweaters. But some are also displaying new merchandise at full price to attract impulse buyers emboldened by store credit and confidence in the economy. Seasonal workers are being assigned longer shifts. Stores are extending their hours.But the vibrant holiday season has kindled hopes among some that the \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d has perhaps hit bottom. Since sales forecasts were released in November, Macy\u2019s stock has climbed 45 percent, and Abercrombie & Fitch is up 40 percent.Recently, the last week of the year has started to feel \u201ca little like a stretched-out Black Friday,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a consulting firm.\u201cThis week has, over the years, been gradually assuming more and more importance in the overall mix,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailers want to get a second bite at the apple.\u201dAnd Ms. Mezzacappa, a homemaker, has still more spending planned.\u201cI wanted a shirt, I had it in my hand, but there was only one register open and a line out the door,\u201d she said of her trip to the New York mall. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just order it online.\u201dE-commerce continues to gobble up most of the growth in retail sales.More e-commerce means more returns, as more online retailers try to entice customers by allowing them to change their minds frequently and easily. Online return rates are frequently double that of brick-and-mortar businesses and are extremely costly to companies.But even returns can have a silver lining when the economy is strong and consumers are in a spending mood, as they are this year.And customers who receive store credit are often inclined to think of the value as free money, according to behavioral economists.A similar psychology applies with gift cards: Shoppers with a gift card in 2017 overspent its value by an average of $38, up $10 from last year, according to First Data, a payment technology company. Americans bought more physical and digital gift cards this year than in each of the previous three years, according to the company.Several brands are taking advantage, making a wider selection of fresh spring merchandise available at full price and mixing it in with clearance items in hopes of luring customers who are wielding new gift cards or who have just unloaded returns.J. C. Penney cut the number of discounts and deals in its print circular ad for this week by 72 percent compared with the same week last year, according to an analysis by Market Track, a retail and advertising data company. Kohl\u2019s cut its deals by 67 percent, and Target by 33 percent.\u201cThe race to the bottom is basically over,\u201d said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at RSR, a retail technology research firm.\u201cSome years, it\u2019s a panic game,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like retailers have woken out of a dream, a weird dream filled with doorbusters, and are now starting to play the game right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "CVS and Aetna Say Merger Will Improve Your Health Care. Can They Deliver?", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new company, combining one of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacies with one of its largest health insurers, will create a world where patients will get the \u201chuman touch,\u201d they said. Fewer people will fall through the cracks, they promised, and getting high-quality, low-cost medical care will be as close as your corner drugstore.With their merged data about people\u2019s health and vast reach, the two companies assert that they have the opportunity to make real change in a health care landscape that nearly everyone agrees is too convoluted, inefficient and expensive.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to immediately shake up the world, but I think you have two behemoths \u2014 two battleships that are slow to turn \u2014 and it will at least create an environment by which information can be shared and innovation can take place,\u201d said Nadina J. Rosier, the health and group benefits pharmacy practice leader at the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson.Whether this rosy future will become reality, however, is far from certain. The announcement of the $69 billion merger set off a wave of speculation over just how much it will upend the way people get medical care in this country. And few expect drug costs, which have been rising, to decline under this arrangement.Skeptics say CVS and Aetna entered into the deal not to benefit consumers but to strengthen their competitive positions at a tumultuous time for the industry, in the hopes that the combination will yield new business opportunities. The two are already major health care players. If they wanted to change the world, critics asked, why haven\u2019t they done so already? Others pointed out that a major rival, UnitedHealth Group, already owned a large pharmacy benefit manager, OptumRx, yet drug prices have continued to rise, and consumers remain frustrated.Some worry that the nation\u2019s health care system will come to resemble a series of kingdoms, where consumers are locked into separate ecosystems of pharmacies, doctors and health care clinics depending on their insurance provider.Given that many people change insurance plans frequently, \u201cyou may be bounced from kingdom to kingdom,\u201d said B. Douglas Hoey, the chief executive of the National Community Pharmacists Association, the trade group for independent pharmacists.The deal, which still needs approval by the two companies\u2019 shareholders as well as regulators, would create community-based hubs at the roughly 10,000 stores that CVS now operates, where consumers would be able to get some array of care. By overseeing patients\u2019 medical benefits as well as their pharmacy benefits, the companies hope to better coordinate treatments for customers.Instead of getting lost in what Aetna\u2019s chief executive, Mark T. Bertolini, describes as the \u201crat maze\u201d of health care, patients could go somewhere near their home to have a chronic condition like diabetes followed by a nurse or to a clinic to check out if a sore throat is strep.While the traditional health care system could be overseeing people\u2019s care, it isn\u2019t, said Larry J. Merlo, the chief executive of CVS, who described the merger as a way of capitalizing on \u201cthe opportunity to meet a huge unmet need.\u201d\u201cYou have a really good strategy,\u201d said Brian Tanquilut, a health care equity analyst for Jefferies. Aetna and CVS \u201creally want to transform the way care is delivered,\u201d he said, but \u201cunless you can really execute well, a good strategic goal and vision will not automatically translate into better health care and reduced costs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an industry highly in flux,\u201d said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor at Brandeis International Business School. \u201cWhat we have here is a remixing of assets.\u201dAnalysts and others said one of CVS\u2019s biggest obstacles, requiring significant investment and time, would be to transform its drugstores into a broader medical setting.\u201cIt\u2019s going to face many hurdles,\u201d said Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, who researches the drug-distribution industry. He said changing people\u2019s minds about what happened inside a CVS \u2014 and persuading them to seek out medical services there beyond getting a flu shot \u2014 could be difficult. And some have raised questions about whether the care will be disjointed and low quality.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t underestimate the barriers that existing providers\u201d will throw in the way, Mr. Fein said. He noted that in recent years hospitals had been competing in the same area, setting up urgent-care clinics and more closely coordinating with primary-care doctors.CVS was unable to develop this new model with its existing stores, said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University, who noted retail clinics had not yet shown they saved money over all, even if people found it easier to get care. \u201cWhat are they going to do different here?\u201d he asked.If the idea succeeds, the transformation could give patients more options and better convenience. Patients would also benefit if the new company got better at coordinating care, such as improving the transition from the hospital to home, or managing chronic conditions like diabetes.Employers could use the merger to their advantage, said David Dross, a pharmacy benefits expert for the consultant Mercer. With UnitedHealth owning OptumRx and CVS teamed with Aetna, employers may be in a better position to demand guarantees about overall costs, he said.\u201cThere is the ability there to move the needle a little bit,\u201d Mr. Dross said.Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, said, \u201cThere are elements of this that could be tremendously beneficial if it\u2019s executed on and flows through the system.\u201d But Mr. Marcotte, whose group represents large employers that offer health benefits to their workers, is wary of claims that mergers will result in savings for employers and consumers.\u201cIn most scenarios, I don\u2019t think we have these synergies flow back,\u201d he said.While the combination could lead to much lower costs, it may not ultimately change the existing pharmacy model, Mr. Marcotte said, but could \u201cfurther entrench an already entrenched business model.\u201d\u201cIt is too soon to tell,\u201d he said.Still, others said the merger could further limit options for consumers, who have already seen a steady narrowing of their choices, from which pharmacy they can visit to which doctor they can see.The deal could also have a ripple effect, leading other companies to team up in an effort to compete.\u201cRight now I love where we sit,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an independent company, we don\u2019t have stores to feed. We don\u2019t have health plans to feed.\u201dBut others noted that Express Scripts could also decide to merge with a health insurer \u2014 such as Humana or Cigna \u2014 or combine with a retail chain like Walgreens.David Mitchell, the founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs, a nonprofit that does not take money from the insurance or drug industries, said he was skeptical that consumers would see much benefit. He noted that CVS Health and Aetna were already industry behemoths that had had ample opportunity to improve conditions for patients.\u201cThey\u2019re not doing this to provide better care to people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to make more money.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Al Franken: From \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 to Congress", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said on Thursday that he plans to resign \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d amid mounting accusations of sexual harassment against him.Mr. Franken, 66, is from St. Louis Park, Minn. Raised in a middle-class household where education was emphasized, he went on to attend Harvard University. In 1969, he met Franni Bryson, his wife of more than 40 years, at a college mixer.A comedian who spent years at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Mr. Franken reinvented himself as a politician before being felled by a string of harassment allegations in recent weeks.After college, Mr. Franken and a childhood friend, Tom Davis, moved to Los Angeles to try their hand at stand-up comedy. Soon, they caught the attention of Lorne Michaels, who hired them as two of the first writers for \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which began in 1975.After a hiatus from the show in the early 1980s, Mr. Franken\u2019s star rose in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s with memorable recurring roles, including as the smarmy self-helper Stuart Smalley and as an intrepid journalist known as the one-man mobile-uplink unit.\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Fox\u2019s lawyers for filing one of the stupidest briefs I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d he said at the time.In March 2004, Mr. Franken began hosting the flagship show on the now-defunct liberal talk-radio network \u201cAir America Radio.\u201dOver three hours each day, he would heap scorn and ridicule on Republicans. He mocked Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2014 his radio show was initially called the \u201cThe O\u2019Franken Factor\u201d \u2014 and poked fun at President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Around that time, he had even begun hinting at a Senate run.The Minnesota Supreme Court ended eight months of legal challenges over the results of the November 2008 election and ruled that Mr. Franken had defeated the Republican incumbent, Norm Coleman. Mr. Franken was sworn in a few days later, on July 7.He was re-elected in November 2014.In May that year, Mr. Franken pressed executives from Google and Apple during a congressional panel about location information the companies received from cellphones.Mr. Franken took aim at proposed telecommunications mergers during his time in Congress, relishing his role as a congressional opponent to media conglomeration. He opposed the Comcast-NBC Universal merger, which got federal approval in 2011, and the unsuccessful merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.Mr. Franken, for his part, should have a good sense of Comcast \u2014 he said the company was his provider in both Minnesota and Washington, and added with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s great. The service is wonderful.\u201d Moments later, he doubled back to explain his tone. His chuckle, he said, \u201cwas more ironic than sarcastic.\u201d\u201cI would like your views on the relative advantage of doing assessments and using them to measure proficiency or to measure growth,\u201d he asked her.During her response, Mr. Franken cut her off. \u201cIt surprises me that you don\u2019t know this issue,\u201d he replied.By Wednesday, several more women had come forward to accuse Mr. Franken of making unwanted sexual advances.While Mr. Franken had hoped for vindication from a congressional investigation, he said on Thursday that his remaining in the Senate would be a distraction.\u201cThis decision is not about me.

{"Headline": "The Hidden Player Spurring a Wave of Cheap Consumer Devices: Amazon", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, Wyze Labs, a one-year-old start-up in Seattle, sent me its first gadget to try. It\u2019s a small, internet-connected video camera, the kind you might use for security or to keep tabs on your dog or your baby.On the surface, the camera doesn\u2019t sound special. Like home internet cameras made by Nest or Netgear, the Wyze device can monitor an area for motion or sound. When it spots something, it begins recording a short clip that it stores online, for access on your phone or your computer.That future? We\u2019re going to get better products for ludicrously low prices, and big brands across a range of categories \u2014 the Nests and Netgears of the world \u2014 are going to find it harder than ever to get us to shell out big money for their wares.There\u2019s a hidden hero in this story \u2014 or, if you\u2019re a major brand, a shadowy villain. It\u2019s Amazon.To understand Amazon\u2019s role, let\u2019s take a closer look at how Wyze piggybacked off Amazon. Nest\u2019s and Netgear\u2019s comparable indoor cameras sell for around $200 each, while Wyze\u2019s device goes for $20 plus shipping if you buy directly from the company\u2019s website. The only other place to purchase the WyzeCam is on Amazon, where members of the company\u2019s Prime service can get it for $30 including two-day shipping.Wyze did not create a home internet camera for a tenth of the price of rivals by skimping on quality. Though the camera comes in extremely spare packaging, it otherwise offers many features you would expect in big-brand devices, including tough security. (Although all internet-connected devices pose some security risk, Wyze said its devices and the data they recorded were locked down with encryption.)Wyze\u2019s low prices are instead born of two ideas, both connected to Amazon. The company\u2019s three founders all worked at the retail giant, and they said they had been inspired by Amazon\u2019s high-volume, low-margin approach to sales.To hit the $20 price, Wyze licensed the camera\u2019s hardware from a Chinese company, then created its own software. It also cut out just about every middleman, including most retailers. And it\u2019s banking on long-run success. While Wyze is just breaking even on its first camera, its founders believe internet-connected home devices will be a growth category. They plan to establish a trusted brand with the first camera, then release a succession of products that they hope to sell in large numbers, at low prices.But how do you establish a brand online? That\u2019s the second place Amazon comes in.Though they snubbed every other retailer, Wyze\u2019s founders recognized that they needed an Amazon storefront to help them establish an instant presence next to the big guys. Customer rankings and reviews on Amazon have become just about the most important factor in how consumers buy electronics products; because Amazon pages come up high on search results like Google\u2019s, a positive rating on Amazon can effectively make a brand \u2014 and a negative rating can break one.\u201cThat\u2019s why we had to sell on Amazon,\u201d said Yun Zhang, Wyze\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou just can\u2019t ignore them.\u201dIn an earlier time, you might have dismissed companies like these as \u201cChinese knockoffs.\u201d After all, like Wyze, most of them use commodity parts and global manufacturing efficiencies to create low-priced versions of relatively uncomplicated products.But knockoffs get a bad rap because they are of indeterminate quality: Even if it\u2019s selling at a good price, who wants to risk buying a no-name portable smartphone charger if it might blow up in your face? Allen Fung, the general manager of Sunvalley\u2019s American division, said that what was unique about Amazon was that its store encouraged low prices while heavily penalizing companies that made shoddy products.\u201cIt\u2019s not a race to the bottom,\u201d Mr. Fung said. \u201cSellers are forced to create better products at lower pricing, and sellers who aren\u2019t able to do that just get weeded out.\u201dMr. Fung recently spent a couple of hours providing an in-depth look at how he manages his company\u2019s brands on Amazon. To win a certain product category \u2014 portable chargers, say, or children\u2019s night lights \u2014 the company is obsessive about monitoring customer feedback, including the rate at which its products are returned. Sunvalley recently hired a team of customer service agents to respond to complaints. It has also hired industrial designers to improve the look of its devices \u2014 which also helps it stand out from other commodity devices on Amazon\u2019s results page.Sunvalley also spends heavily on Amazon ads (these show up as \u201csponsored\u201d results on Amazon\u2019s search page), and sometimes it will sell products at a loss during one of Amazon\u2019s daily or seasonal deals to get a boost that lifts all of its products in the website\u2019s search rankings.All of these investments are costly and time-consuming, and competition on Amazon is intense. Mr. Fung said Sunvalley\u2019s gross margins were under 25 percent, which is quite low for consumer electronics.\u201cIt\u2019s really tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real process of natural selection there.\u201dThis process is not going to affect just the consumer electronics business. Mr. Fung said his teams regularly looked to Amazon as a kind of product road map \u2014 they look for categories dominated by high-priced items from well-known brands, and then try to create better, cheaper versions. Sunvalley has expanded into home appliances like lamps and humidifiers, as well as into cosmetics.Amazon, which charges a fee for third-party companies to sell through its platform, is not a passive actor in this trend. It has long encouraged businesses to set up shop on its site. The company said that half of its products came from small businesses, and that in 2016, more than 100,000 businesses exceeded $100,000 in sales through its system. It also started a lending program to allow those businesses to scale up; last year, its loans exceeded $3 billion.\u201cAs this takes off, it really makes you start to question, you know, what is a brand in the Amazon age?\u201d said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm.It\u2019s an intriguing question, and one that raises fears of Amazon\u2019s rise. While the growth of high-quality, low-priced brands on Amazon seems unquestionably good for consumers, the trend does produce economic losers.The classic worry about Amazon is that it puts local retailers out of business. Now another worry is that by exposing global brands to the harsh reality of low-priced competitors, it may put them out of business, too. Mr. Wingo said global brands across a variety of categories \u2014 electronics, apparel, home improvement \u2014 regularly approached his company looking for a way to compete with low-priced rivals on Amazon.He has had to let them know there\u2019s no easy solution, he said.\u201cThere is this erosion of what it means to be a traditional consumer product brand,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cIn a way, Amazon is providing all this information that replaces what you\u2019d normally get from a brand, like reputation and trust. Amazon is becoming something like the umbrella brand, the only brand that matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When We Can No Longer Pass Through the Giant Sequoia", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.The Calaveras trees were well known to the Miwok and Washoe tribes before being discovered by a contract hunter, Augustus T. Dowd, when he followed an injured bear into the grove in 1852. Astounded by the size of the trees surrounding him, he thought he must be dreaming. When he returned to camp, he found it difficult to convince others of the giant trees\u2019 existence. But soon the trees, among the largest living organisms on Earth, were claimed, named and as ripe for exploitation as Sierra gold. In 1853, a gang of men took 22 days to cut down the first tree Dowd had seen, the Discovery Tree, in order to attract tourists; cut sections of its trunk were sent for exhibition in distant cities, and its vast stump was turned into a platform for dancing parties. Later, the grove\u2019s owners built a saloon and bowling alley over its felled trunk. Another tree, the Mother of the Forest, was clad in scaffolding and fatally stripped of over a hundred feet of bark. Reassembled into a hollow version of the original tree in far-flung exhibition halls, the stripped bark finally burned to ash in London\u2019s Crystal Palace fire. But the Pioneer Cabin Tree was spared.Singularly vast, ancient, rare, these monumental sequoias were a huge tourist attraction. Visiting them was a form of secular pilgrimage. But as more sequoia groves were discovered around the state and tourists were drawn away from the Calaveras trees, novel ways to lure them back were devised. In the 1880s, the owners of the grove cut that yawning tunnel through the Pioneer Cabin Tree so that it could compete with Yosemite\u2019s newly created Wawona tunnel tree.The Pioneer Cabin Tree\u2019s magnificent arch has been recorded in innumerable photographs, from silvered prints to saturated Kodachrome and pixelated screens. Early portraits show still, solemn faces posing for long seconds under the tree: women in crinolines with tight-drawn hair sitting before its dark interior, hands on their laps; men with hats, mustaches, hands on their hips. Horses, automobiles, thousands of humans passed through the tree. Each snapshot yoked together a suite of grand opposites: smallness, vastness, oldness, newness, humanity, nature. The shifting fashions and stances of the tree\u2019s visitors track how short our lives are compared with the unchanging arch above themThere\u2019s an ancient ritual found in many cultures called \u201cpassing through,\u201d in which people climb through or are handed through holes in trees and rocks. The action is sometimes considered a cure for disease, or a rebirth that cleanses a person of sin. The reverent delight that so many people experienced passing through the Pioneer Cabin Tree partook, dimly, of this tradition. In recent years, the tree was only accessible as part of a hiking trail. But before that it was famed for being a drive-through tree, and photographs of vehicles emerging from it have special historical resonance. They celebrate both an ancient natural wilderness and an America of forward technological progress: a horse-drawn buggy, an early automobile, a car passing through the tunnel, tracking time as they went. As modernity processed through it, the arch became at once a triumph and a warning, a synecdoche of American progress and American appetites \u2014 all in one eternal frame.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island.

Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen.

And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

California Today will take a break for the Christmas holiday. We\u2019ll be back on Tuesday.A proposal making its way through the Los Angeles Animal Services commission could require that all dogs in the city\u2019s public shelters be fed an all-vegan diet.Supporters say the roughly 336,000 pounds of animal-based dog food in the shelter system accounts for the deaths of more than 20,000 chickens, 10,000 turkeys and 1,000 lambs every year \u2014 figures they say have a devastating environmental impact.\u201cThis is about the long-term survival of every man, woman and child in this room, and all of the people in our lives,\u201d said Roger Wolfson, the commissioner and television screenwriter who first proposed the plan.But the idea has been met with a skeptical response from the city\u2019s veterinarians and others in the animal protection world.After dozens of comments supporting the change, the commission asked for a formal analysis on the benefits and risks of moving dogs in the shelters to a vegan diet. Staff members are expected to deliver the report in February.

{"Headline": "CVS to Buy Aetna for $69 Billion in a Deal That May Reshape the Health Industry", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe transaction, one of the largest of the year, reflects the increasingly blurred lines between the traditionally separate spheres of a rapidly changing industry. It represents an effort to make both companies more appealing to consumers as health care that was once delivered in a doctor\u2019s office more often reaches consumers over the phone, at a retail clinic or via an app.The merger comes at a time of turbulent transformation in health care. Insurers, hospitals and pharmacy companies are bracing for a possible disruption in government programs like Medicare as a result of the Republicans\u2019 plan to cut taxes. Congress remains at an impasse over the future of the Affordable Care Act, while employers and consumers are struggling under the weight of rising medical costs, including the soaring price of prescription drugs. And rapid changes in technology have raised the specter of new competitors \u2014 most notably Amazon.But critics worry that customers could also find their choices sharply limited. The deal risks leaving patients with less choice of where to get care or fill a prescription if those with Aetna insurance are forced to go to CVS for much of their care.On Sunday, the two companies emphasized their ability to transform CVS\u2019s 10,000 pharmacy and clinic locations into community-based sites of care that would be far less expensive for patients.\u201cWe think of it as creating a new front door to health care in America,\u201d CVS Health\u2019s chief executive, Larry J. Merlo, said in an interview.The merger would establish a new way of delivering care, with nurses, pharmacists and others available to counsel people about their diabetes or do the lab work necessary to diagnose a condition, Mr. Merlo said. \u201cWe know we can make health care more affordable and less expensive.\u201dMark T. Bertolini, Aetna\u2019s chief executive, said that by using CVS\u2019s locations, the company can provide people with a better way of accessing medical care.\u201cIt\u2019s in their community. It\u2019s in their home,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cCVS has the draw. People trust their pharmacist.\u201dIt is the development of community-based clinics \u2014 capable of delivering care with the technology and health information available from both parties \u2014 that could prove to be the biggest change brought about the deal.The hope would be that consumers would not only be able to see savings by going to a retail store to treat a sore throat but also have better oversight of a chronic illness, such as diabetes or heart disease. They could get advice on how to lose weight, or undergo tests to monitor their health.\u201cIf they can drive the adoption of the care delivery model, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Ana Gupte, a senior health care analyst for Leerink Partners.But CVS and Aetna have had a business partnership dating back seven years, and have steadily converged into similar visions of how the health care industry was evolving. Conversations about a deeper bond eventually crystallized into deal talks within the last two months, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions.Although neither chief executive mentioned Amazon by name, both said that what they were creating was a compelling opportunity in and of itself.\u201cChasing our competitors has never been a solution,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said. He added, \u201cOur competitors will do what they do.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, CVS will pay about $207 a share, based on Friday\u2019s closing prices. Roughly $145 a share of that would be in cash, with the remainder in newly issued CVS stock. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, subject to approval by shareholders of both companies as well as regulators.Antitrust approval has become an interesting question in the Trump administration, which bankers and lawyers had thought would be more tolerant of consolidation than its predecessor.A combination of a drugstore company and an insurer is considered less problematic than a merger of two players in the same business, which could reduce competition and hurt consumers. Such concerns ultimately sank Aetna\u2019s efforts to buy Humana, and Anthem\u2019s push to buy Cigna, when the Obama administration signaled its opposition to such consolidation.Both CVS and Aetna played down the prospects of regulators moving to block their deal. The breakup fee for the transaction is not especially large, reflecting that belief.Mr. Bertolini asserted that the companies would not raise prices for consumers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for us to charge people more when we want more people in the store,\u201d he said.But analysts and other merger experts warn that the deal could be blocked by federal antitrust officials who worry that it could lessen competition. One area of focus may be Medicare; both companies are significant players in offering prescription drug plans to Medicare beneficiaries.While the companies said they want to lower costs, CVS also makes money on rebates from drug makers and on filling prescriptions through its pharmacies.David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who has been sharply critical of combinations among insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, said that he was wary of having retailers in charge of people\u2019s health. He argued that doctors may be in a better position to treat illness than retail executives.\u201cWho do you want to run the health care system?\u201d he said.Katie Thomas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Amid the mysterious comings and goings, which include much kinetic rushing through the woods, the Portabella film emphasizes details like the crude bat puppets fluttering outside the window of a woman soon to receive Count Dracula\u2019s attentions. Ambient sound is almost entirely suppressed in favor of a musique concr\u00e8te score by the Catalan multimedia artist Carles Santos in which rolling thunder and tolling bells are interspersed with passages of incongruously languorous lounge music.Atmosphere is at least as important as action here. Images dissolve into shadows. Light is generally diffused. Mr. Portabella\u2019s focus is sharpest when he shows various on-set preparations, including the manufacture of fog, the creation of cobwebs, the fabrication of bloody bites and the arrangement of actors in coffins. Everything is equally fantastic.

Certainly, as the film that led Brakhage, then 25, to a new form of \u201cfirst-person,\u201d utterly subjective cinema, \u201cAnticipation\u201d can seem as puzzling today as it was nearly 60 years ago when his early supporters, like the critics Amos Vogel and Parker Tyler, deemed it unshowable.For the first time, Brakhage\u2019s protagonist was fully the entity behind the camera. Even more than \u201cVampir Cuadecuc,\u201d \u201cAnticipation of the Night\u201d (which has a running time of 40 minutes) is a film that is most analogous to a musical composition. The movie is silent; the only rhythm is visual. Like Mr. Portabella, Brakhage uses the hand-held 16-millimeter camera to dynamic effect \u2014 smearing light or blurring the image to achieve special effects that more timid filmmakers might consider mistakes.As with many Brakhage films, \u201cAnticipation\u201d is hard to describe although it is by no means abstract. The images are recognizable but enigmatic. The film\u2019s montage is even more so. \u201cAnticipation\u201d begins by acknowledging the filmmaker whose shadow is shown in a shaft of light on the floor. Soon the early interiors give way to the outside world \u2014 landscapes shot from a moving car, a rainbow produced by a lawn sprinkler.A bit less than halfway through, \u201cAnticipation\u201d becomes an intensely fragmented, at times frenzied, study of children in a nighttime amusement park. The movie\u2019s final movement is also nocturnal. There are numerous car-shots of empty road and onrushing trees in the moonlight (an image often used by David Lynch in \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d). A close-up of a sleeping child suggests that the various mysterious shots of birds and bears, evidently filmed at a zoo, are the child\u2019s dreams.Brakhage is often described as a lyrical filmmaker but his can be a most disquieting, even violent, form of lyricism. Forms coalesce and vanish throughout. Narrative only becomes obvious in the final minutes when it abruptly appears that the consciousness behind the camera is contemplating suicide.\u201cAnticipation of the Night\u201d is far from Brakhage\u2019s greatest film, but it is the one in which he hurled himself into the unknown. It embodies a desire to make something completely new, which, even after six decades, remains fresh.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking Out the Trash? That\u2019s Still a Man\u2019s Job, Even for the Liberal Coastal Elite", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst PersonOn a recent Monday night in San Francisco, as I lounged in the living room watching \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d out of the corner of my eye I also watched my husband, Josh, march around our house as he does every Monday night, collecting pails and tying plastic bags.This is our weekly ritual. There\u2019s no acknowledgment of the obvious inequity. No you-do-it-next-time admonishment. He accepts his role without a hint of bitterness. (In a way I do not when it comes to, say, driving car pool or coordinating play dates.) Every Monday around 9 p.m., I feel a tinge of guilt, except \u2026 not really.Almost every woman I know who lives with a man shirks this chore. It\u2019s as if all hard-won equality in the home is tossed on trash night. It may be the last bastion of accepted 1950s behavior. And in this case \u2014 and this case alone \u2014 women are fine with that.As one friend pointed out: \u201cWomen deal with the rest of the garbage.\u201dFor many, it\u2019s the simple ick factor. \u201cI don\u2019t do trash juices,\u201d said Gabriela Herman, 36, a photographer who lives with her husband and 17-month-old daughter in a brownstone in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.\u201cEw, it\u2019s the actual bins,\u201d said Ashita Trika, 39, a senior product manager with an M.B.A. who lives in a single-family home in San Francisco with her three children and husband, Noble Athimattathil. \u201cI have no idea what he does, I just know it gets done,\u201d she said of the garbage procedure. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll see the empties on the curb \u2014 but I don\u2019t bring them in or anything. Noble owns trash end to end. He takes the mental load and the physical load. It\u2019s freeing.\u201dMr. Athimattathil, 40, grew up in Yonkers, where he said his father always took out the trash, until he passed the job down. \u201cMy sister and I would both be sitting on the couch watching TV,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd my dad would always say: \u2018Noble, take out the garbage.\u2019 Why not my sister? She had two arms and two legs!\u201dNancy Casey, 41, a nurse practitioner in Portland, Ore., isn\u2019t fazed by garbage. (\u201cEh, I\u2019m up in vaginas all day.\u201d) Still, it\u2019s her husband\u2019s job. \u201cI do everything else,\u201d Ms. Casey said.Trash night in Portland is especially taxing, she said, because it occurs only once every other week. Moreover, the standard bin is half the size of the compost and recycling, which are picked up weekly. \u201cIt\u2019s the liberal hippie thing. There must have been some kind of movement,\u201d said Ms. Casey, who grew up in Chicago.She added: \u201cIf we ever have extra space in our can it\u2019s like Christmas! And we start running around the house looking for things to throw in.\u201dRarely is \u201cWho\u2019s on Trash?\u201d an actual discussion among couples. The division of labor just happens. But Deya Warren and her husband, Gus, likely talked about it, she said, if only because they were given a book before getting married called \u201cThe Hard Questions,\u201d which offers discussion topics like: \u201cDo we eat out a lot? Or a little?\u201d \u201cWhat kind of bed do we sleep on? A king size? A water bed?\u201d (Water beds?)\u201cThe whole idea was that you should talk about the little things because, over time, they inevitably become bigger things,\u201d said Ms. Warren, a 39-year-old entrepreneur and mother of three in Bronxville, N.Y. \u201cTrash beyond grosses me out. I know it\u2019s a gender stereotype, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m the one with the drill! I\u2019ve dismantled our broken dishwasher and put it back together! I\u2019m confident enough in my defiance of traditional roles. Gus can take out the garbage.\u201dWhat about all the single ladies, that highly scrutinized cohort?Sophie Galant, 24, a consultant, lives with female roommates in a San Francisco apartment and routinely passes the honor of trash duty to guy friends who come for dinner. \u201cI always ask them to take it out on their way out,\u201d she said. \u201cIt smells. And I don\u2019t want it to drip on me.\u201dLaura Manzano, 26, who moved from her college dorm in Virginia to a three-unit building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, has never dealt with the trash. \u201cAnthony does it all,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, referring to her superintendent. \u201cWe don\u2019t even tip him. Maybe I should start?\u201d (Yes.)Elizabeth Hand, 41, a stay-at-home mother in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, long had a helpful neighbor. \u201cThis elderly Italian man named Augie who\u2019d lived here forever,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would just do it for us. I had no idea how much work it was, until he passed away. We miss him.\u201dWhen quarters are close, there are often heated battles over bins, on whose property they should reside, and who lugs them out each week.(But are Manhattan\u2019s Hefty mountains any better? Apparently people think so. Rats seem to like them as well.)Recycling has added to the burden. \u201cIt\u2019s insane how much cardboard we generate,\u201d Ms. Herman said. \u201cWe get Amazon, like, daily. Fresh Direct, Blue Apron \u2026 We have a whole staging area! Sometimes, it\u2019s stacked to the ceiling.\u201d Some admit to such anxiety about box breakdown that they get packages sent to work.Dawn Perry, 38, the food director at Real Simple magazine, is a self-proclaimed recycling Nazi. \u201cI went to Boulder,\u201d she said, referring to the eco-conscious college in Colorado. When Ms. Perry and her husband, Matt Duckor, moved to a garden apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, they started seeing some \u201ccrazy behavior in the trash bins,\u201d she said. Like plastic where clearly only paper should be. (And don\u2019t even get her started about the lack of curbside composting.)\u201cOne day I semi-aggressively said to a neighbor: \u2018Are you going to break that down?\u2019\u201d Ms. Perry said. Mr. Duckor furthermore printed (and laminated) diagramed recycling directions to post above the shared bins. He also mentioned a recent maggot issue. \u201cAll he had to say was \u2018maggots,\u2019\u201d Ms. Perry said, \u201cand people listened.\u201dUntil one trash day, she had a revelation: \u201cI woke up and said, \u2018You know what? I\u2019ve got enough on my plate.\u2019\u201d She told her husband to take over trash. \u201cAnd he was, like, \u2018O.K.\u2019\u201dLauren Gersick, 36, a college counselor in San Francisco who shares the chore with her wife, believes that garbage night\u2019s gender divide isn\u2019t so much about women eschewing heavy bins or leaky bags. It\u2019s not about a fear of rats or raccoons, or some sort of contrarian feministic stance.It\u2019s about men\u2019s desire to get out of the house, Ms. Gersick thinks; a sanctioned opportunity to step out, away from the children and the chaos, into the dark solitude of night.\u201cI know at least when I do it,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Bye! I\u2019m going to do the trash.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maggie Roche\u2019s Songs Were Full of Harmony and Connection. Her Life Was Far More Private.", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Maggie Roche was raised, like her sisters, Terre and Suzzy, and their brother, David, in Park Ridge, N.J. She sang from the start, recruiting Terre (rhymes with \u201cfairy\u201d) and Suzzy (rhymes with \u201cfuzzy\u201d) to join her around the radio, in the church choir and even at rallies for a string of unsuccessful local Democratic politicians. As the oldest, she brought pop music into the house, endlessly replaying her treasured collection of 45s, including songs from Gene Pitney and the Four Seasons. But she loved Simon and Garfunkel most, especially Paul Simon\u2019s lyrics. After a brief enrollment at Bard College, she moved to New York to make music with Terre, and it was her hero who gave them a break, hiring them as background singers on the 1973 album \u201cThere Goes Rhymin\u2019 Simon.\u201dMaggie and Terre released their own album, \u201cSeductive Reasoning,\u201d in 1975, to commercial indifference. Columbia Records encouraged them to cultivate a more glamorous image, more like Carly Simon or Linda Ronstadt, but instead the album cover showed the sisters lounging on a musty couch, braless and bashful in casual tank tops. The songs, nearly all Maggie\u2019s, were world-weary and philosophical without ever quite revealing anything about her. Her persona instead came through in sideways yearnings like those in \u201cMalachy\u2019s\u201d: \u201cSometimes I used to write songs for you/As if you could feel it in the bottom of your heart.\u201d Even in her early 20s, she was most alive to moments when connection and intimacy proved elusive.She and Terre ended the duo in frustration. Soon Suzzy joined them in Manhattan, where, in need of money, they sang Christmas carols around the city in December 1977. After the holiday, they kept rehearsing in Maggie\u2019s apartment, singing songs she wrote. They were swiftly signed to Warner Bros. Records and, predictably, encouraged to put more legs or cleavage onstage. Instead they released \u201cThe Roches,\u201d a collection of songs about dogs, waitressing, smelly bus rides, cheating husbands and exploited women. It is impossible to overstate how odd this largely acoustic record sounded amid the heyday of punk and disco. The Roches were classified as folk by default, even though their vocals were disorienting rather than traditional. (Maggie sometimes sang so low that she sounded like a young girl impersonating her father.) They were clearly feminist but too awkward and eccentric to be spokeswomen for any cause. Maggie\u2019s songs depicted women as fully, complexly human: confused and self-doubting one moment, proud and defiant the next. As she told Rolling Stone in an interview after the album\u2019s release, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to be pissed off all my life, so I\u2019m just happy that I get real happy sometimes.\u201dSpeaking recently by phone, Suzzy Roche recalled that her sister \u201cthought differently than other people and seemed to always be coming up against conventions. She went tearing out into the world and kept hitting brick walls.\u201d Her essential subject was autonomy, its difficulty and its necessity. On the Roches\u2019 second album, \u201cNurds,\u201d she offered a punning capsule biography: \u201cOne season I was born/Fell down like an acorn/I am the only tree/And everybody leaves.\u201d She could also depict grim romantic unease, as in \u201cNocturne,\u201d from the 1989 album \u201cSpeak\u201d: \u201cSide by side we lay/Not touching/Listening to rain falling/In the darkness.\u201d That album also included \u201cBroken Places,\u201d inspired by the son she gave up for adoption before her career began, and whom she rarely spoke of before he turned 18 and tracked her down. In Maggie\u2019s classic spotlight-defying manner, it\u2019s written from multiple points of view and sung by Suzzy.Performed in regal harmony with her sisters, Maggie\u2019s songs of inner loneliness became joyful communal exercises. The Roches never had a hit song, but they recorded nine albums by 1995 and were clear influences on artists like Suzanne Vega and the Indigo Girls. They found their place \u2014 or, more accurate, made a new place, one that others discovered with relief.Maggie lived in Greenwich Village for the rest of her increasingly discreet life, relishing walks along the Hudson and baseball on TV. But her yen for invisibility only grew. She contributed no lyrics to the three records she made with Suzzy in the 21st century, or to the glowing 2007 Roches reunion album, \u201cMoonswept.\u201d She was uninsured when she received her cancer diagnosis; she found coverage after the Affordable Care Act, but the disease was already beyond hope of remission. As news of her death spread, Suzzy received thousands of messages from people who benefited from Maggie\u2019s songs and their generosity toward the cast-aside and the unseen. \u201cI ain\u2019t the only one/Who\u2019s got this disease,\u201d says the gone-away free spirit in the group\u2019s masterpiece, \u201cHammond Song,\u201d based on Maggie\u2019s own early exodus to Louisiana. Few others have made discontent sound so harmonious.John Lingan is a writer whose first book, \u201cHomeplace: A Southern Town, a Country Legend, and the Last Days of a Mountaintop Honky-Tonk,\u201d will be published in July. He lives in Maryland.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1927John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Kaplan Says Technology Is Holding Down Inflation", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy is gaining strength, and Mr. Kaplan said it made sense to raise rates while times were good, so that the Fed was in position to lower rates during a future economic downturn.Mr. Kaplan worked as an investment banker and a business school professor before joining the Fed in 2015, and he continues to view the economy through that lens. He said he saw a clear explanation for the slow pace of inflation in recent years: Technological change is increasing competition in a wide range of industries, making it difficult for many companies to increase their prices.\u201cI talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.The interview was conducted last week; Fed officials are not allowed to comment publicly on monetary policy in the week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Do you expect strong growth to continue next year?We certainly think next year we\u2019ll continue to grow at solid rates \u2014 sufficient growth to continue to take slack out of the labor market. There\u2019s the headline rate of unemployment, but the measure I look at much more is what\u2019s called U6 [which measures both people who are actively seeking work and those who say they\u2019d like a job]. That\u2019s back at 7.9 percent, at its pre-recession level, and that suggests we\u2019re either at or near full employment, and I would expect those numbers to improve. And Texas? How goes the recovery from the hurricane? Should the Fed raise its benchmark interest rate in December?Whether we\u2019re at full employment, we\u2019ll know in hindsight, but I believe we\u2019re going to continue to take slack out of the labor market. I\u2019m very aware that we\u2019re undershooting inflation, but my team believes we\u2019re going to get to 2 percent in the medium term. It may be slower and more uneven than people expect, but from a risk management point of view, I think it would be wise to take the next step. I\u2019m being very careful in the way I\u2019m saying it because I continue to believe that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient way. Why does inflation remain below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target?I am a strong believer that cyclical pressures are building and, as we continue to take slack out of the labor market, they\u2019ll continue to build. The issue is, there\u2019s a headwind in terms of inflation: technology-enabled disruption. What do I mean? Yes, of course, technology is replacing people, and that has been going on for a long time. Increasingly, though, consumers have more use of technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices \u2014 that\u2019s accelerating. And a third thing is the emergence of new models for selling goods, manufacturing goods or distributing goods.The obvious ones you think of are Uber vs. taxis, Amazon vs. retail, Airbnb vs. hotels. But every business is facing disruption. What we\u2019re finding is increasingly businesses lack pricing power. Even since I\u2019ve been sitting in this seat, I talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war. Give me an example of where that\u2019s happening.Autos. Fifteen years ago you\u2019d deal with a salesperson. Today the car is sold online. The salesperson is a much less important job. People shop online and walk in, and they\u2019re ready to transact. So there are fewer salespeople. The person who does your website is a much more valuable person. The automotive technician is a much more valuable person. And you can\u2019t find enough of them. Shouldn\u2019t those workers be able to negotiate higher wages? In your story, it\u2019s profits that should be squeezed. But instead, the opposite is happening.So companies are replacing people with technology. Older workers are getting bought out, and the work force is getting younger. And you\u2019ve got to segment this by educational attainment. If you\u2019ve got a college education and you\u2019re in a high-skilled job, I actually think you\u2019ve got pretty good negotiating capability for wages. If you\u2019ve got a high school education or less, what I\u2019ve been seeing \u2014 and this is more anecdotal, and we need to be doing more research on this \u2014 it is highly likely that your job is either getting restructured or eliminated and you don\u2019t have the educational background to easily move, unless you get retrained, which is an easy thing to say but a very hard thing to do. Do you see evidence for this in the available data?To collect data means it\u2019s already happened. I\u2019m confident that 10 years from now we\u2019ll have good data on this phenomenon in the same way I\u2019ve seen recently some great papers on big-box retailers replacing mom-and-pop retailers. That happened years ago. Is our deteriorating relationship with Mexico affecting the Texas economy?What I am concerned about is the presidential election in the summer of 2018, and I know people in Mexico are also concerned about it. We\u2019ve benefited as a country by having strong relationships with Mexico, and I think the concern I have is as a result of the rhetoric, the political atmosphere is now to the point where you might have to be negative toward the United States in order to be elected. You\u2019ve said in recent speeches that you\u2019re keeping a close eye on the market.If we could call a timeout right now and ask if you see imbalances, I\u2019ve said that they\u2019re manageable right now. But I do know that it pays to monitor these things very carefully at this stage in the cycle. All I\u2019m pointing out is that we need to be on our toes.

{"Headline": "Hospital Giants Vie for Patients in Effort to Fend Off New Rivals", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s all about the patient.Or at least about keeping patients and the revenue generated for their medical care.But the frenzy of mergers and other alliances taking place also reveals a frantic attempt to court and capture patients as people have more choices about where to go for care. Patients are increasingly relying on walk-in clinics, urgent care centers or an app on their cellphone to check out a nasty rash or monitor their diabetes, and they are looking for places that are both less expensive and more convenient than a hospital emergency room or doctor\u2019s office.The battle is over \u201cthe control of the patient,\u201d said Rob Fuller, a heath care lawyer at Nelson Hardiman and a former hospital administrator. As hospital executives see the continued decline of care being delivered within a hospital\u2019s four walls, he said they want to make sure they still have a say over where patients go after a hospital stay or to get treatment for a chronic condition.Hospitals competing for patients is a game of musical chairs, and \u201cthere might not be a chair for you,\u201d agreed Kenneth Kaufman, chair of Kaufman Hall, a firm that consults with hospitals. Hospital executives are realizing that someone else, including an insurance company employing the nurse at a walk-in clinic or the doctor at a surgery center, wants to take over their relationship with patients \u2014 and the potential revenue that those patients represent.And the move by the insurers into their traditional territory is making some institutions very nervous. UnitedHealth Group, the giant insurer, is viewed as the greatest threat, underscored by its recent purchase of DaVita Medical Group. The company, which has a diverse portfolio of health care businesses, already has a roster of some 30,000 doctors under its Optum unit, and a chain of surgery centers. The company \u201chas moved out ahead from a competitive perspective and a model perspective,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said.\u201cHospitals are very nervous about being small fry in the changing health care landscape,\u201d said Leemore S. Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School. Consumers frequently pay more when hospitals combine in the same market because the larger entity has more clout, she said, and there is some evidence that prices rise even when the hospital groups are in different markets in the same state.But these combinations will create more than large chains of hospitals. The hospital systems already include medical clinics, employ doctors and provide services ranging from imaging to care at home. Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives say their proposed deal would create a system that would consist of 139 hospitals, more than 700 sites of care and employ more than 25,000 doctors and other clinicians. The two systems will have annual revenue of roughly $30 billion a year.The mergers allow these systems to become much larger \u201cand have much stronger tentacles into the patient population they are trying to reach,\u2019 said W. Kenneth Marlow, a health care lawyer with Waller Lansden Dortch and Davis.The Affordable Care Act masked some of those underlying challenges facing hospitals by supplying a new source of insured patients, and the relative lull in merger activity since the law took effect reflected better financial footing. But the industry is now back to looking at shrinking profit margins and a decline in their core revenues. The Republicans\u2019 proposed tax overhaul could make it even worse by forcing cuts to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.In talking about the most recent mergers, much of the reasoning sounds familiar, including the promises around how being bigger will allow the hospital systems to achieve cost savings. Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives, for example, estimate about $500 million in efficiencies through their merger, and many of the groups point to a larger scale being necessary to pay for the sophisticated computer systems needed to better oversee patients.But many point to the promises of past mergers as reason to doubt whether the hospital mergers allow much more than an ability to demand higher prices from insurers. After the last wave of mergers that took place a few years ago, the hospitals didn\u2019t use that opportunity to bring their costs down, said Bret Schroeder at PA Consulting Group. They \u201cstill aren\u2019t that much more efficient than they were,\u201d he said.Getting hospitals to change as a result of these mergers will remain difficult, Mr. Schroeder said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for an industry that has been fairly monopolistic within a region to think way outside of the box,\u201d he said.Although all of the mergers and acquisitions will have to pass muster with federal and state antitrust officials, the recent combinations, even among hospitals merging with hospitals, generally involve facilities that are not direct competitors. Advocate, based in Illinois, is merging with a system in the neighboring state of Wisconsin. Dignity, which is based in San Francisco, and Catholic Health Initiatives, from Englewood, Colo., both products of earlier mergers, also say their locations do not overlap.The systems also insist they are not looking to get bigger for the sake of being able to throw their size around. \u201cIt\u2019s a very old model of thinking about size and higher price,\u201d said Dr. Nick Turkal, the chief executive of Aurora.They say they are already investing in new ways to deliver care at less expense, and the combinations will allow them to intensify those efforts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be focusing on becoming more efficient, certainly, and creating products that can be sold very competitively,\u201d said Mr. Skogsbergh of Advocate.In announcing their planned merger earlier this month, Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives, which declined requests for interviews, said they plan to use the merger to amplify their investments in \u201ccommunity-based care,\u201d which they describe as \u201ca variety of outpatient and virtual care settings closer to home\u201d as well as programs aimed at people with chronic health conditions.\u201cWe believe together we can build a stronger platform to foster healthier communities,\u201d Lloyd Dean, the chief executive of Dignity, said in speaking about the deal earlier this year.Hospitals will have no choice but to use these mergers to reinvent themselves rather than simply raise prices, said Thomas Cassels, a consultant at the Advisory Board, which was recently acquired by UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum unit. They know patients can go somewhere else, he said.\u201cHealth systems are considerably more concerned with being convenient and not unaffordable than they are making services less desirable because they are more expensive and on the hospital campus,\u201d he said.The fundamental question is whether hospital groups have what it takes to use their increased scale to radically change, Mr. Cassels said. Advocate and Aurora have been making strides to improve how they oversee care to reduce costs, and larger systems will be able to invest in the sophisticated technology and other changes necessary, he said.But the challenge cannot be underestimated in asking these massive institutions to come together and change into something radically different. \u201cYou\u2019re taking a zebra and a zebra,\u201d Mr. Cassels said. \u201cWhat they want to become is a unicorn.\u201dFollow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Valhalla, N.Y.: A Picturesque Hamlet with a Short Commute", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLiving In8 PhotosFor a hamlet named after the eternal banquet hall where the slain warriors of Norse mythology caroused, Valhalla is low on drama. Residents appreciate the forested hills, compact homes and soothing cul-de-sacs of this small Westchester community (population 3,400). The schools are excellent, and the commute \u2014 about 45 minutes by train to Grand Central Terminal \u2014 is short and direct.But Valhalla, which is part of the town of Mount Pleasant, is hardly ordinary. Its narrow residential area snakes between a large historic cemetery to the west and the 2,145-acre Kensico Reservoir to the east. The hamlet\u2019s hot spot is the granite-and-concrete-walled Kenisco Dam. Climb 300 feet to the top and you\u2019ll find smooth waters and distant trees that may make you wonder exactly when you crossed the border into Wisconsin.Carrie Vogel, 53, who lives with her husband, Olivier, in her childhood home on Beech Road, remembers the reservoir as a place of dark lore and happy mischief. She recalled her great-grandfather\u2019s tales of building the dam in the 1910s and watching a fellow worker perish from a fall into wet cement. As a child she fished (legally) and swam (illegally) in the waters. Her sisters had to be picked up at the police station after they were caught skinny-dipping.Today you can still fish in the reservoir, though security precautions after Sept. 11 have made access more difficult.And though Ms. Vogel complained about corporate developments replacing farm buildings and play areas, she is still enamored of her picturesque surroundings. \u201cI have a water view three seasons,\u201d she said. \u201cI have deer. I have turkey. I have rabbits.\u201dShe called herself \u201cblessed\u201d to remain in Valhalla, even with property taxes that have grown to $15,000 a year and her unremunerative choice to be a stay-at-home mother to four children. (Mr. Vogel is the controller at a Westchester synagogue.)Of particular value is an ordinance that allows the community to rent units within their residences. The Vogels created a one-bedroom apartment with a living room, eat-in kitchen and full bath. They rent it for $1,200 a month, including utilities and snow removal.After Sept. 11, Westlake Drive, the two-lane road on top of the dam, was blocked to vehicles, cutting off a popular route to Armonk to the north and White Plains to the south, and diverting traffic into the heart of Valhalla. Carl Fulgenzi, the supervisor of the town of Mount Pleasant, said a traffic light approved for the corner of Legion Drive and Broadway will help motorists, who sometimes wait many minutes for a break in the flow of cars.In addition to the crossing at Commerce Street, where the accident happened, an intersection at Cleveland Street to the south might be eliminated because of its steep approach and what Mr. Fulgenzi described as many \u201cnear misses\u201d there. \u201cAll crossings are considered inherently dangerous, and we will continue to review the residents\u2019 and professionals\u2019 concerns before we consider the closure of any crossing,\u201d he wrote in an email.Valhalla\u2019s homes are typically suburban comfort architecture: capes, split levels and raised ranches dating from the mid-20th century or later. Occasionally, large colonial-style houses usurp modest properties or otherwise drop into the landscape.Summit Estates at Westchester, a new Toll Brothers development near the neighboring hamlet of Hawthorne, N.Y., is offering homes on half-acre lots, starting at 2,723 square feet and $1.34 million.Valhalla also has older residences, some with unusual back stories. In 2011, Wei Huang, a computer engineer living in New York City, bought a 125-year-old house on North Kensico Avenue that had been moved from the adjacent village of Kensico before the area was flooded with the expansion of the reservoir.This gabled house with a wraparound porch, for which Mr. Huang paid $360,000, was in poor condition, but otherwise fit his needs. It was only an eight-minute walk from the train station and had a separate unit for his parents, who planned to move from Chinatown in Manhattan, but didn\u2019t drive. The quarter-acre lot on a verdant hillside was more than enough for a vegetable garden. \u201cI like fresh food,\u201d Mr. Huang said.Mr. Huang began repairing the home himself. But long before he finished, his parents found space in a senior residence in Chinatown. He recently listed the 2,000-square-foot property, as is, for $450,000.Valhalla has a small commercial district along two blocks of Broadway, parallel to the Taconic State Parkway. The offerings are slim, and several storefronts are vacant. Many residents buy groceries at the Acme market in the Rose Hill Shopping Center in the hamlet of Thornwood, N.Y., about five minutes from downtown, or at the ShopRite farther up the road. Some go to the Stop and Shop in North White Plains, about 10 minutes away. The nearest Trader Joe\u2019s is in Hartsdale, N.Y., about 15 minutes away.Residents said a lack of support for local business is the price a small community pays in the age of Amazon. The problem is complicated by a shortage of parking downtown.But Jonathan Gumowitz, a real estate broker in Valhalla who used to be president of the chamber of commerce, described the tiny business district as \u201can international food court.\u201d He pointed out that it has Italian, Chinese, Indian and Spanish restaurants, as well as an \u201colive oil guy\u201d and a liquor store. The Village Creamery and Sweet Shop, which opened three years ago, appeared to be thriving.The nearby Kensico Dam plaza has regular cultural events, including concerts, outdoor movies and Fourth of July fireworks displays. During December, it is hosting the annual Westchester\u2019s Winter Wonderland, with carnival rides, food trucks and a small\u201cI just think there\u2019s too many people going through the town and not enough people staying,\u201d Mr. Gumowitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why a lot of us don\u2019t rely on Valhalla for our business. But if you look at a map, we happen to be in the center of the county, which is convenient to go anywhere.\u201dMore business will be coming to Valhalla. A plan was announced this year for a 3 million-square-foot development near the Westchester Medical Center that will include a biotechnology research center; medical offices; a children\u2019s living science center intended to promote health; a hotel; and more than 100,000 square feet of ground-level retail. The project is expected to create 9,000 permanent jobs.Douglas Lombardo, a broker at Stone Bay Realty Services, said Valhalla offers better home values and lower taxes than other Westchester communities with comparable or inferior schools. This makes it highly attractive, especially to people who prefer small towns. The market is dominated by single-family homes.The downside is that the supply is low. As of Dec. 11, only two properties were available: a four-bedroom home on McKinley Avenue, priced at $449,000, and a two-bedroom house on Columbus Avenue that was valued mainly for its 1.6-acre property and was priced at $659,000. More are expected to be listed in the new year.Data from the real estate site Trulia showed a median price for all home sales in Valhalla of $569,500, as of mid-August, based on 144 transactions. This figure represented a year-on-year increase of 3.4 percent.On a recent drizzly Sunday afternoon in the Valhalla Park neighborhood, blocks from the Kensico Cemetery grounds, wood smoke perfumed the air and holiday lawn ornaments were ready for their frost.Sticking up among the crop of low midcentury houses was a reminder of what came before: a building with arched windows and decorative brickwork that was probably once used by workers who built the Kensico Dam and gave heft to the city. Valhalla is quiet, but still shows its muscle.Many homes in Valhalla are zoned for the Valhalla Union Free School District, which has four institutions, three of them in the hamlet.The Virginia Road Elementary School in White Plains, N.Y., enrolls 304 students in kindergarten through second grade.The Kensico School in Valhalla enrolls about 320 students in third through fifth grades. On 2015-2016 state tests, 50 percent met standards in English versus 39 percent statewide; 50 percent met standards in math versus 43 percent statewide.Valhalla Middle School, which shares a building with Valhalla High School and is next to the Kensico School, enrolls about 350 students in sixth through eighth grades. On state tests, 48 percent met standards in English versus 37 percent statewide; 44 percent met standards in math versus 40 percent statewide.Valhalla High School was one of 342 public and private high schools in the United States to be honored as a 2017 National Blue Ribbon School for overall academic excellence by the federal department of education. It enrolls about 500 students in ninth through 12th grades. Its 2016 mean SAT scores were 509 for reading, 522 for math and 511 for writing, versus 489, 501 and 477 statewide.The remainder of Valhalla\u2019s homes feed into the Mount Pleasant Central School District, with schools in Thornwood and Hawthorne.Metro-North Harlem line trains depart for New York City about every half-hour during morning rush hour. The trip to Grand Central Terminal takes between 42 and 48 minutes, and costs $13 each way, peak fare; the monthly fare is $289.How Valhalla got its name is a complicated aria. Here is the jingle version: In the mid-19th century, Valhalla was called Davis Brook and its train depot was Kensico Station. When the first post office opened in the depot building around 1860, it needed a name to distinguish it from the neighboring village of Kensico; the story goes that the postmaster\u2019s wife, a student of literature and mythology, proposed Valhalla. Then, in the late 19th century, Xavier Reiter, a German-born horn player who lived in the hamlet and was well acquainted with Richard Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle, made the persuasive case to a civic committee that Davis Brook should also adopt the name. In 1904, the Kensico train station followed suit. As Neil S. Martin, a local historian wrote in 1979, \u201cToo many mourners bound for Kensico Cemetery, further along the line, had been getting off at the wrong stop.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These are the small but indelible pleasures that our editors and reporters have been grateful for in the past year.\u201cGLOW\u201d culminates in a televised bout, and the pleasure of the to-the-brow eye shadow and belted lam\u00e9 is overpowering. But by that point the women have already turned themselves into TV-friendly caricatures \u2014 Liberty Belle, Welfare Queen, Fortune Cookie. So I have a soft spot for the costumes in the initial episodes, when the wrestling women aren\u2019t yet playing their in-the-ring roles. If most of them are dressing for comfort, they\u2019re also telegraphing how they\u2019d like to be seen \u2014 Ruth\u2019s serious blues, Arthie\u2019s soft pinks \u2014 before they realize that the camera won\u2019t want their real selves, Sheila\u2019s pelt excepted. (That some of the women find their wrestling characters empowering while others don\u2019t is one of the more interesting complications of the series.)One of the joys of being a podcast fan in 2017 was bearing witness to another era of transformation in the medium, which, three years after the \u201cSerial\u201d revolution and the leap in production values that followed, still feels like a simmering primordial stew: You never know what strange new species may rise to the surface.I haven\u2019t been able to shake John B. McLemore, the troubled and ferociously articulate protagonist of \u201cS-Town,\u201d since the series was released in March. His mesmerizing, acid soliloquies on clock repairing and climate despairing and small-town farce have no analogue in fiction. But the most delightful and surprising episode focused on another jewel of a subject, Olin Long.We meet Mr. Long \u2014 a friend and onetime love interest of Mr. McLemore\u2019s who, as we learn in one of the show\u2019s most endearing digressions, may be the world\u2019s biggest fan of \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d \u2014 in Episode 6 of the podcast, after we think we have a handle on its major contours. Some criticized \u201cS-Town\u201d for sidestepping the pulpy tale of murder and corruption teased by its cryptic prerelease marketing. But what made the series so exceptional was its insistence on examining the human riddle at its center, turning it over and over again to uncover astonishing new facets and missed connections.Episode 6 is not the most consequential in the arc of the show, but Mr. Long\u2019s interviews sketch a portrait of unquenched desire and suppressed heartbreak that recast everything we\u2019ve previously heard in new light. Not so unlike Mr. McLemore, many of us have bouts of misery and misanthropy. But most of us can\u2019t help but suspect that the cure for what ails us, if it can be found, lies somewhere in other people. My favorites of his jokes hint at an entire life beyond the joke. They share a quality that the best acting does, how a performer can evoke an odd subtext or back story in a gesture or piece of business. Jack Handey will begin a sentence in a blandly benign narrator tone, then take a sudden wrong turn, landing who knows where: \u201cOne bad thing about ice skating is you\u2019re always knocking over little kids.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in my right place,\u201d she sings. \u201cDon\u2019t be a downer.\u201dIn the episode, Sam (Ms. Adlon) \u2014 a single mother raising three daughters \u2014 blindfolds Max, her oldest, and takes her outside for her graduation present. \u201cTilted\u201d plays while Sam, along with her two other daughters and their grandmother, re-enacts Ms. Letissier\u2019s video.Wearing black, they perform the choreography \u2014 sometimes shakily, but with spectacular intention \u2014 on a shiny elevated stage against a background of trees. And Ms. Letissier\u2019s message endures: What does it mean when you lose balance? Are you falling or flying?Or make that 45 minutes or so, presented without commercials as the camera tracked first Elliot (Rami Malek) and then his friend-turned-nemesis, Angela (Portia Doubleday), through an E Corp headquarters thick with skulduggery, rioting and panic, as each tried to outwit the other. (There were camouflaged edits throughout.) Long takes stress out viewers by withholding the cutaways our minds crave, making us feel the anxiety racking the characters. In \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d this intensified the show\u2019s radically subjective perspective at a spot in the story when Elliot and Angela were not only under the gun but were so in opposition to one another. The episode also functioned as a microcosm of the entire series, Elliot using the size and disconnected structure of E Corp against it as he expertly manipulates its networks and vulnerabilities.How tranquil he looked in his pearlescent frock coat. But beneath the satin beat the heart of a revolutionary, and like his American cousins a decade before, he could look past the corruption of the capital and imagine a new kind of government, constituted by and responsible to all people. A great portrait is a likeness of an individual that takes on universal meaning, and this one \u2014 whether it depicts Zamor or not \u2014 radiated virtues I needed to be reminded of: liberty, equality and, above all, fraternity.As the stars, swaddled in their glamorous Catherine Zuber-designed costumes, walked onstage and started their separate opening numbers, the audience went into overdrive, clapping and shouting for several minutes.Ms. Ebersole happily took in the tribute, grinning at the other actors in her scene and waiting until the applause eventually died down before uttering her first line. A few minutes later, however, Ms. LuPone was all business, taking her place onstage with just a brief pause and a slight smile \u2014 and quickly holding up her hand to silence the audience, as if to say, \u201cChildren, enough; I have a show to do.\u201dYou cannot only count the number of pop stars performing at this level in their 50s on one hand, you can count them on two fingers: Ms. Jackson and Madonna. (Madonna, however, does it in heels.)But something else happened at the \u201cState of the World Tour\u201d I had never seen before at a major pop concert: One of Ms. Jackson\u2019s backup dancers was getting an ecstatic reception. She was fierce, charismatic and curvy; I would call her normal size. The fashion industry would probably call her plus size.A bit of babble has been on my mind since I heard it more than 10 months ago. It\u2019s part of a piece written in 2014, but the a cappella purity of the voices harkens back to the Renaissance. The words are simple: \u201cI want you/I want to,\u201d sung so quickly that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cto\u201d blur into each other. The mood is simultaneously anonymous and tense; it\u2019s heated, yet cool.The piece broadens from those initial seconds to encompass scattered fragments of love letters written by Mr. Hearne (in 2006) and his father (in 1962); Catholic and Jewish wedding rites; and text messages exchanged with one of the Steubenville High School students convicted of rape in 2013. The voices hover and slip past one another, find peace and then tumble into more eddies of perplexity.The rush of language, and the difficulty of establishing its source and legitimacy, captured for me so much about our contemporary predicament. Mr. Hearne is hardly sympathetic toward those who wrong women, but I hear \u201cConsent\u201d as compassionating all of us who have been bequeathed unequal, curdled social relations. Without judgment \u2014 this composer creates spaces of contemplation, not pat politics \u2014 his juxtapositions reveal how freely given consent (marriage, I\u2019m looking at you) has ended up systematically wronging women, just as rape and assault have.The confusion between desiring people and desiring what they can do for you; the overarching anxiety about, simply, possessing; the difficulty, when confronted with the language of love and caring, of distinguishing whether it\u2019s real or feigned \u2014 it\u2019s all here, uncannily beautiful, in a form that sounds as old as time. As a fan of the band\u2019s literary, word-drunk output, I was excited to see them in the Lincoln Center Songbook series, touring behind the new album \u201cAway.\u201d We\u2019d be able to sit and really listen to those private reveries and gnomic story songs, polished to dark shine, as we gazed through the oversize windows into the shadows of Central Park.He recalled growing up in rural New Hampshire in the \u201980s, before the internet and all that cable TV. About how paging through The Times every Sunday gave him a sense of what it meant to be creative and sophisticated. About how so many of the events that seemed thrilling from afar happened at Lincoln Center.I could only wish, he said, that one day this world would make room for someone like me.And so it had.Advertisement"}

Vance, author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d the best-selling book about the industrial decline of the Midwest, Mr. Case told him, \u201cI really love the book but there is a part of it I don\u2019t love.\u201dMr. Vance listened patiently.\u201cIt helped frame the problem but it didn\u2019t really offer up a solution,\u201d Mr. Case told him.\u201cWell, it is interesting you say that,\u201d Mr. Vance replied, \u201cbecause that\u2019s really what my next chapter is going to be.\u201dBut until now, at least to some skeptics, it seemed like a do-gooder vanity project.How could these two men significantly change the dynamic among serious investors on the coasts to reorient their focus on cities, many of them suffering from the erosion of manufacturing, in the Rust Belt and elsewhere?It turns out that while they were publicly crisscrossing America, they were also privately holding meetings with some of the wealthiest individuals and families in the country, urging them to not only invest in a new fund but become partners with some of the companies that will benefit from it.On Tuesday, the fund, called Rise of the Rest, will disclose its investors, which has turned into a Who\u2019s Who of American business. Among them are:All told, it may be the greatest concentration of American wealth and power in one investment fund.The idea \u2014 far grander than the money itself, which is only $150 million to start, pocket money for most of the investors \u2014 was to assemble a dream team and create a network effect for entrepreneurs in the middle of the country to align with the biggest names in business.The fund, said Mr. Vance, was meant to construct an ecosystem like the one in Silicon Valley that will provide support and connections to entrepreneurs in small towns.\u201cPeople tend to follow their networks,\u201d said Mr. Vance, who was recruited to the effort by Mr. Case. \u201cWhile the network in Silicon Valley is obviously something that is great, it can also have an exclusionary effect that prevents investors from looking at and finding opportunities that exist outside of their networks and outside of their geographies.\u201dMr. Case and Mr. Vance hope to seed investments in start-ups in underserved cities and then bring in some of their big names to invest even more money in them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be curating interesting companies,\u201d Mr. Case said.In other words, if they discover a nascent but promising e-commerce company in Allentown, Pa., they will not only invest in it, but they might also help it establish a relationship with one of the fund\u2019s investors \u2014 Mr. Bezos, for example \u2014 who might invest even more.Mr. Case was quick to say that the new enterprise should not be considered a social impact fund, which has become the hot nomenclature for investors seeking to do good. Some consider social impact investing a sort of pseudophilanthropy because the returns aren\u2019t always the main goal.Mr. Case said he would only succeed in changing the way investors think about the rest of the country if he can produce significant financial success stories.\u201cWe\u2019re fans of impact investing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we actually didn\u2019t position this as an impact fund. First and foremost, our goal was to generate top returns.\u201dMr. Schmidt of Alphabet said he was sold on the idea from the moment he first heard about it. \u201cI felt it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a large selection of relatively undervalued businesses in the heartland between the coasts, some of which can scale quickly.\u201dAnd while it isn\u2019t an altruistic investment, he said he hoped the effort creates \u201cmore jobs, more wealth, better products and helps our society deal with a lot of jarring employment changes.\u201dOne of the great questions about American capitalism is why big investors, who are always looking for opportunities and are often willing to fly halfway around the world to find them in places like China and India, put so little effort into finding investment in the middle of the country. California, New York and Massachusetts attract 76 percent of all venture capital money, according to the National Venture Capital Association.One answer may be that the nation\u2019s top talent is drawn to the coasts, but Mr. Breyer said he has seen that changing.\u201cEntrepreneurs are now creating start-ups in lots of places,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confluence of social networking technologies and cloud services makes it easier and less costly than ever before to develop and bring new technologies to market\u201d for entrepreneurs outside of centers like Silicon Valley.One example of a company that could be a model for the fund is one that Mr. Case has already invested in: 75f in Burnsville, Minn., which works to make commercial buildings more comfortable and energy-efficient.Critics may argue that the fund is a marketing exercise for elites trying to fix a problem of their own making. And there may be some truth to that. But like most great entrepreneurs, these investors have a genuine interest in finding the next Facebook or Google, and they get excited about the prospect of discovering a needle in the start-up haystack.And they recognize that the next big idea may come from someplace totally unexpected \u2014 somewhere not on either coast or in one of the other pockets of entrepreneurship.\u201cThere\u2019s still more talent (engineers, execs) \u2014 and resources (funding), but the costs and competition for talent and housing are extreme\u201d in Silicon Valley, Mr. Doerr wrote in an email, suggesting perhaps that it may be a less attractive location than before.\u201cIn the end, don\u2019t think of \u2018the Valley\u2019 as some ZIP codes in California,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a state of mind that can be anywhere, for everyone. Increasingly, for all of the rest of us.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the city where the company 75f is based. It is Burnsville, not Burnside, Minn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed, Perplexed by Low Inflation, Is Still Ready to Raise Rates", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate next week, at its final meeting of the year, as the economy continues to gain strength and the unemployment rate continues to fall.But it\u2019s not a straightforward decision.The problem is inflation. Prices continue to rise more slowly than the Fed regards as healthy. This year is on a pace to be the sixth straight with inflation below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target, a sign of continuing economic weakness. It also limits the Fed\u2019s ability to reduce borrowing costs during a future economic downturn.Most Fed officials, including Mr. Powell, a current member of the board, are ready to move on rates. While they don\u2019t completely understand why inflation is low, they are confident that it will rise as the economy continues to grow \u2014 as employers seeking workers are forced to offer higher wages.Other Fed officials want to wait to raise rates, saying they see evidence that the economy still needs help from the central bank. The Fed\u2019s benchmark rate is in a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent, and they would like to keep it there until inflation gained strength.The New York Times spoke with a pair of Fed officials, one on each side of the issue. The interviews were conducted last week; officials are not allowed to comment publicly on monetary policy in the week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.The obvious ones you think of are Uber vs. taxis, Amazon vs. retail, Airbnb vs. hotels. But every business is facing disruption. What we\u2019re finding is increasingly businesses lack pricing power. Even since I\u2019ve been sitting in this seat, I talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delia Graff Fara Explored a Philosophical Concept With a Heap of Sand", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?This paradox, which originated with the ancient Greeks, is troubling because it is ubiquitous. It applies not just to being a heap but also to being tall, or red, or bald, or soft \u2014 or any other gradient-like property. When Fara began working on this paradox as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1990s, philosophers had come to view it as an instance of a larger problem: vagueness. We want to take seriously our talk of hot and cold weather, bald and full-haired men, day and night, but the boundaries that distinguish such things can seem blurry to the point of incoherence.These solutions were advanced with argumentative ingenuity and technical sophistication, often in ways that minimized their oddities. But Fara, herself a skilled practitioner of logic and formal semantics, was looking for a solution that addressed a common-sense question: If there is a precise point at which a heap becomes a nonheap \u2014 and unless you want to abandon natural language or classical logic, it seems there must be \u2014 why are we so inclined to think otherwise?Fara\u2019s theory, which she presented in a 2000 paper called \u201cShifting Sands,\u201d had an answer. She argued that vagueness was an expression of our ever-changing purposes: that there is a precise point at which a heap becomes a nonheap, but it \u201cshifts around\u201d as our objectives do. In fact, because the act of considering two comparable heaps accentuates their similarity, \u201cthe boundary can never be where we are looking.\u201d No wonder we think it doesn\u2019t exist.Imagine that a gym teacher has hastily divided a large class of students into two groups according to height. If you enter the gym, you will have no trouble declaring one group the tall students and the other the short ones. But had you been presented with the undivided class and asked to say where the tallness boundary was, you would have despaired of an answer. Tallness is not just a matter of height, Fara concluded. As with all such properties, what gets to be tall is also shaped by our interests at a given moment.\u201cShifting Sands\u201d became an influential and highly cited paper, not least because it had implications for other areas of philosophy. It was also notable for being written by a young woman in a field that skews heavily toward men, both demographically and in terms of works cited. Concerned about such imbalances, Fara devoted considerable effort to helping women in the profession.When it came to racial diversity, an area in which philosophy is similarly lopsided, Fara was also a champion, if more circumspect. Her mother, who raised Fara as a single parent in New York, was African-American; her father, who died when she was a child, was of Irish and Jewish descent. Because of her appearance, Fara was often assumed to be white or queried clumsily about where she was \u201cfrom.\u201d She told her husband she hoped to avoid being defined by her race. But as much as she let misperceptions slide, or answered politely that she was \u201cborn in Queens,\u201d it was an issue she could never fully escape.At the end of her life, Fara became interested in the philosophy of race. She wondered if her ideas about vagueness \u2014 about how seemingly independent properties of the world are infused with human interests \u2014 might be relevant. It would have been more blurry boundaries to think about.James Ryerson is a senior staff editor for The Times\u2019s Op-Ed page and the Ivory Tower columnist for the Book Review.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S. Allen Counter\u2019s Mission to Desegregate History Itself", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Even as a boy, Counter could remember participating in a \u201cwade-in,\u201d when blacks appeared at an all-white beach to swim in the ocean. His awareness of these charged physical and social spaces only heightened as he matured, and he himself moved seamlessly between worlds \u2014 black, white, other \u2014 unafraid and inquisitive. After college, he earned a Ph.D. in communication, then went to Sweden to get a medical degree. He taught prison inmates, did research on brain injuries and took expeditions to the Andes to study lead and mercury poisoning in the mountain communities. At one point, he traveled to villages of the descendants of slaves in Suriname.Energetic, persuasive, ambitious and a deep listener, Counter hobnobbed with presidents, celebrities and royalty. His Rolodex was a thing of wonder, and he used it to organize trips to Louisiana and Haiti in the aftermath of storms and earthquakes. Once, when he returned home to Boynton Beach, his arrival was heralded as front-page news. Soon enough, according to a friend\u2019s recollection, the phone rang at his grandmother\u2019s house, her old employers on the line, white and rich and never before interested, asking if her grandson would come by for a visit.It was as founding director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations that Counter perhaps found his most powerful voice, trying to improve relations between racial and ethnic groups on campus. He stood up for Peter Gomes, the black minister at Harvard who announced he was gay. He stood up for the idea that Palestinians and Jews, if only at Harvard, must find rapprochement. And he initiated the Portraiture Project, commissioning paintings of people of color, to join those on the college\u2019s walls symbolizing status-quo white privilege. The faces matter, he believed, the ones looking down on you from history.There was one face conspicuously absent in most history books, though. As a boy, Counter heard the story of an explorer named Matthew Henson, an African-American who accompanied Adm. Robert Peary on expeditions between 1891 and 1909 to explore Greenland and try to be the first to reach the North Pole. Henson was sometimes described as Peary\u2019s \u201cmanservant\u201d but shared a close if unusual relationship with Peary, given the racism of that era. He made himself invaluable in the Arctic North as well, repairing sledges, hunting and communicating directly with the Inuit.As Peary plotted his last attempt in 1909, he was convinced that the best approach would be to start with a large party but scramble the final stretch with a small one. Peary sent members back toward the Roosevelt, their ship, without warning. But Henson remained. The rest of the crew understood his importance. \u201cPeary knew Matt Henson\u2019s real worth,\u201d the expedition member Donald MacMillan wrote later. Henson \u201cwas of more real value to our commander than Bartlett, Marvin, Borup, Goodsell and myself all put together. Matthew Henson went to the pole with Peary because he was a better man than any one of us.\u201dWhat happened at the pole \u2014 most now agree that the group was in proximity of the pole, perhaps not exactly at it \u2014 has been a matter of controversy for decades (especially given the fact that Frederick Cook also claimed the North Pole for himself, days before Peary\u2019s telegram reached America). It became the subject of congressional hearings at the time and fodder for a barrage of headlines. Only Henson, along with four Inuit, accompanied Peary. They claimed to have made excellent time in clear, cold weather. Henson, 10 years Peary\u2019s junior, was still in fine fettle. Peary, who was an old man at 52, suffered from the effects of previous frostbite and the loss of eight toes. Eventually, there was confusion about whether they\u2019d gone too far, and when they returned to the place where Peary\u2019s readings determined the North Pole was, Henson would later claim that Peary found his \u2014 Henson\u2019s \u2014 footsteps.To emphasize: That would have put a black man at the top of the world first.But months later, Peary\u2019s telegram reached the public \u2014 \u201cStars and Stripes nailed to the Pole\u201d \u2014 and with it went Henson\u2019s place in the story, relegated as he was to invisibility. While Peary eventually gathered the accolades, awards and remuneration due an Arctic explorer of his day \u2014 hailed as the white explorer who brought white America the glory it sought on the global stage \u2014 Henson went from working as a parking-lot attendant to a messenger in the Customs House in New York. Only at the end of his life was he partially recognized for his feats, thanks to the book \u201cDark Companion,\u201d by Bradley Robinson, that told some of the story.What it didn\u2019t tell was the part that stuck with Allen Counter, however, fond as he was of unerasing the erased, of putting discrimination to some higher use, of hauling the hidden into bright light. Peary and Henson had each taken what were called \u201cInuit wives,\u201d an unabashed practice of some polar explorers, and each had children by them: Peary, two sons; Henson, one. Those children existed somewhere in Greenland. Could one recover part of Matthew Henson\u2019s own dignity by finding them?To look back now, you realize how similar Henson and Counter actually were, how the possession might have taken place. Each was socially gifted, exceptionally hardworking and structurally instrumental in their communities, traveling long miles uncomplainingly for a result. When Counter arrived in Moriusaq, a tiny village at the top of Baffin Bay, to meet Henson\u2019s son, Anaukaq, the son \u2014 an old man by then \u2014 insisted that Counter must be a Henson. \u201cI have often wondered whether the curious urge to search for Matthew Henson\u2019s descendants way up here might not be based on some unknown biological kinship to the Henson family,\u201d Counter would write in his book \u201cNorth Pole Legacy.\u201dThe events that followed can be attributed to the pure force of Counter. By submarine and helicopter, dog sled and transport jet, the space between became compressed, lines scumbled, people of different language and background were pressed into meeting. Counter brought two of the abandoned Inuit sons to the United States, to their American brethren. Through a series of letters, including to President Ronald Reagan, Counter called for the United States to recognize Matthew Henson\u2019s achievement by disinterring his body, along with his wife\u2019s, from Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx and burying them next to Robert Peary at Arlington National Cemetery.To desegregate history itself.At the ceremony, both American and Inuit descendants and a sizable crowd \u2014 black, white and all others \u2014 were in attendance. Emotions ran high. From the bones of old explorers emerged this new world.\u201cWe had all become one big family,\u201d Counter later wrote. And it wasn\u2019t wishful thinking.Michael Paterniti is a contributing writer for the magazine and a GQ correspondent. His forthcoming book, \u201cNinety or Nothing,\u201d is about Matthew Henson, Robert Peary and their attempt to reach the North Pole.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers.

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "The Streaming Landscape After Disney\u2019s Deal", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming wars are about to get a lot more interesting.It has been roughly five years since services like Netflix and Hulu started making original programming. So far, Netflix has been the clear winner. It spends billions of dollars a year and has seen subscriptions soar, especially internationally, with the critical and popular success of shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at some of the leading streaming services.And it still has the rights to old episodes of big TV shows, including some from 21st Century Fox. The first season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d about the O. J. Simpson murder trial that was a ratings smash for FX and a big award winner? Netflix will continue to hold onto that.On the other hand, Hulu remains a relatively small business that bleeds money. The last time it disclosed the number of people who subscribe to the service (a year and a half ago) it was a relatively teeny 12 million. As a comparison, Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. And there are plenty of indications that Hulu\u2019s growth has only inched a bit in the time since.Still, Disney will assume Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu, and will now own more than 50 percent of the streaming service. Whether that means Disney can simply merge Hulu\u2019s enormous array of content into its forthcoming service is unclear. Some analysts are skeptical that NBC Universal\u2019s parent company, Comcast, will allow Disney to simply buy it out.\u201cWe see no reason why Comcast would want to enable Disney to have a more successful streaming service that hampers the legacy bundle that is vital to Comcast,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, at analyst at BTIG.Plus, even with leadership changes, Amazon sits on a mountain of cash. That has many Hollywood executives convinced that Amazon could become a real rival to Netflix if it deploys its resources in the right way.Facebook and YouTube are still looking for a signature hit.Meanwhile, there are live TV services for people who are just looking to shed an expensive cable package. Hulu and YouTube have offerings with a suite of cable channels, and so do services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happens When the Richest U.S. Cities Turn to the World?", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy has changed, so have the relationships between places, to the disadvantage of smaller cities and rural areas.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Well before anyone thought of this place as the center of the tech economy, the Bay Area built ships. And it did so with the help of many parts of the country.A changing economy has been good to the region, and to a number of other predominantly coastal metros like New York, Boston and Seattle. But economists and geographers are now questioning what the nature of their success means for the rest of the country. What happens to America\u2019s manufacturing heartland when Silicon Valley turns to China? Where do former mill and mining towns fit in when big cities shift to digital work? How does upstate New York benefit when New York City increases business with Tokyo?The answers have social and political implications at a time when broad swaths of the country feel alienated from and resentful of \u201celite\u201d cities that appear from a distance to have gone unscathed by the forces hollowing out smaller communities. To the extent that many Americans believe they\u2019re disconnected from the prosperity in these major metros \u2014 even as they use the apps and services created there \u2014 perhaps they\u2019re right. Such a picture, Ms. Sassen said, \u201cbreaks a past pattern where a range of smaller, more provincial cities actually fed the rise of the major cities.\u201d Now major cities are feeding one another, and doing so across the globe.\u201cThese links have been broken,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. Of course, some remain. And antipathy toward prosperous big cities is not a new theme in history. \u201cBut this is different: This is deeper,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. \u201cIt is also, as far as we can see, permanent, simply because the economy that supported the earlier relationships has gone away and shows no sign of coming back.\u201dThe Rise of Global Cities\u201cBig changes have been happening over the last 30 years,\u201d Ms. Giannone said. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually seeing the impact of them.\u201dThose changes have come from multiple directions \u2014 from globalization, from computerization, from the shift in the United States away from manufacturing toward a knowledge and service economy. These trends have buffeted many smaller cities and nonurban areas. The uncomfortable political truth is that they\u2019ve also benefited places like San Francisco and New York.For all of the talk of how globalization has cost America manufacturing jobs, it has created American jobs, too \u2014 but the high-paying ones have tended to go to such cities.Ms. Sassen argues that a global economy has created new kinds of needs for companies: accountants specializing in Asian tax law, lawyers expert in European Union regulation, marketers who understand Latin America. Global cities must connect to other global cities to tap these resources, which have become more valuable to them than lumber and steel.Inventors in these global cities are also increasingly connecting to one another. Using the addresses of patent co-inventors, Mr. Mudambi has traced a steep rise starting in the early 1990s of global connections from a few American metro areas, which are today among the most prosperous in the country.Inventing \u2018New Stuff\u2019 Before Anyone Can Catch UpBut these kinds of ties aren\u2019t truly spreading the Bay Area\u2019s prosperity. Server farms don\u2019t create mass middle-class employment. Using Google isn\u2019t the same as having a hand in engineering it.To put it more harshly, when global cities need other communities today, Ms. Sassen said, it\u2019s often to extract value out of them. New York bankers need Middle America\u2019s mortgages to construct securities. San Francisco start-ups need idle cars everywhere to amass billion-dollar valuations. Online retail giants need cheap land for their warehouses. The rest of the country may receive the innovations that flow out of global cities, and the benefits to consumers are real. \u201cBut by the time that\u2019s done, the cities have already invented something new and made themselves richer again,\u201d Mr. Storper said. \u201cBefore anywhere else can catch up, San Francisco has already leapt ahead again with new stuff they\u2019ve invented.\u201d\u201cThe Torontos, Ottawas and Waterloos in countries like Canada and the U.S., they will link with Shenzhen in China, they will link with Munich and Stockholm in Europe,\u201d Mr. Bathelt said. \u201cAnd other places will be kind of left out.\u201dIn the international network that emerges, global cities stand out. Other places connect to the global economy by going through them.An earlier version of this article misstated a type of ship that was assembled in the Bay Area during World War II.

{"Headline": "The F.C.C. Wants to Let Telecoms Cash In on the Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission wants to let Comcast, Verizon and other broadband companies turn the internet into a latter-day version of cable TV, in which they decide what customers can watch and how much they pay for that content.Net neutrality prevents those companies from having companies like Amazon pay a fee to get their content delivered more quickly than their rivals\u2019, and from having the firms throttle other services and websites, even blocking customer access to, say, Netflix or an online newspaper.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, telecom companies would effectively be allowed to sell you a basic internet plan that might include only limited access to Google and email. For Facebook and Twitter you might need a slightly more expensive deluxe plan. The premium plan might include access to Netflix and Amazon. Oh, and by the way, media businesses eager to gain more users could pay broadband companies to be included in their enhanced basic or deluxe plans.That might sound like a far-fetched scenario. But there is reason to fear that some version of that awful vision could become a reality, because most Americans have just one or two choices for broadband access at home. People have access to four national wireless companies, but those connections tend to be slower and less useful for data-intensive applications than wired service provided by cable and telephone companies.Instead of making sure that broadband companies can\u2019t take advantage of their gatekeeping power over the internet, Mr. Pai wants to let them do whatever they want. All they would be required to do is be \u201ctransparent\u201d about what they are doing. In other words, they could simply tell customers what to expect in endless contracts filled with legalese and printed in tiny type. Mr. Pai further argues that the Federal Trade Commission would then make sure that companies were living up to their promises, essentially abdicating any responsibility the Federal Communications Commission has for the most important communications system in the country.Broadband companies are delighted by Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, which the three-vote Republican majority on the commission is expected to adopt at its meeting on Dec. 14. And they are quick to say that customers have nothing to fear.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 What\u2019s at stake in Alabama\u2022 Will Republicans enact their tax plan by year\u2019s end?\u2022 What does Apple spend its cash on? Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future.

{"Headline": "Disney Said to Be Nearing a Deal With 21st Century Fox", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company is in advanced discussions to buy significant parts of 21st Century Fox, the media company run by the Murdoch family, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.And a deal between the two companies could end up splitting up the Murdochs as an operating team, with James Murdoch potentially leaving his father and brother to work at Disney.Fox is also in negotiations with Comcast, but the talks with Disney are moving faster, these people said. An agreement with Disney could be announced as soon as next week, these people added, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.If a deal is reached, it would be the latest instance of upheaval in the media industry, as giants like Disney and Comcast seek to get even bigger to compete against newer players like Netflix. And medium-size companies like Fox are under pressure to also gain scale through acquisitions or to shrink and focus on specific businesses.Under the terms of the talks, Disney would buy big parts of Fox\u2019s empire in an all-stock transaction, including its movie and television studios, international assets like the Star cable and media company in India and a stake in the British broadcaster Sky, and a stake in the Hulu streaming service, these people said.James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, could take a senior executive role at Disney with oversight of the Sky and Star companies as part of his portfolio, these people added.Adding assets like the Fox movie and television studios would give Disney more sources of content at a time when it is rolling out its own streaming video service to challenge companies like Netflix and Amazon. And Star and Sky would help give Disney an international broadcasting presence.For Fox, a transaction with Disney might pose fewer regulatory risks than one with Comcast because the latter would bear some similarities to AT&T\u2019s proposed takeover of Time Warner \u2014 which the Justice Department is seeking to block.What would be left of 21st Century Fox would be several highly profitable operations, including Fox News Channel, a broadcast network and the FS1 sports channel. It would be overseen by Rupert Murdoch and his other son, Lachlan, who are executive chairmen of the company.The Murdoch family also still controls News Corporation, a separate publicly traded company that owns The Wall Street Journal, the British newspaper The Times and other news publications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Expanded From Silicon Valley to Bubblegum Alley", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetSAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. \u2014 San Luis Obispo has a reputation for being a sleepy town in central California known for its laid-back charm. Top tourist draws are a nearby 18th-century Spanish mission and Bubblegum Alley, a walkway lined with chewed gum. But Rick Stollmeyer, the chief executive of MindBody, envisioned it as a bustling tech hub.Nestled along the coast about 230 miles south of San Francisco, San Luis Obispo is far from Silicon Valley. The distance presented a challenge for Mr. Stollmeyer, who sought to lure talent to a small college town known by the acronym SLO, where nature buffs and health food junkies go to find their nirvana.Today, the tech community is growing, Mr. Stollmeyer said: \u201cIt is hopping. I\u2019ve seen a dozen tech start-ups launch in the past year.\u201dVenture capitalists are also chiming in. \u201cMindBody has proven that a billion-dollar company can grow up in SLO, and that is a massive milestone,\u201d said Stephen Beck, managing partner at Serra Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. \u201cThe tech scene has become authentic, dynamic and real enough to pay attention to.\u201d He is so convinced, he has invested in WhiteFox Defense Technologies, a local start-up selling devices that mitigate drone threats.To date, more than 7,800 tech employees work in San Luis Obispo County, an increase of more than 20 percent in the last five years, according to the California Center for Jobs and the Economy.At the crux of this growth is a rebounding economy and a pool of engineering and computer science students from California Polytechnic State University. Added to that is a network of support from government, education and community agencies that provide access to real estate, funding and business connections to encourage fledgling enterprises.And not only are new companies sprouting up, but renowned high-tech firms are moving in. Amazon leases two spaces downtown, and in October, Amazon Web Services announced a strategic partnership with Cal Poly. Called the Digital Transformation Hub, the organization will be staffed with employees from both entities to help solve \u201cpublic-sector business challenges,\u201d said Amy Schwartz, a university spokeswoman.GE Digital is moving into offices at the Cal Poly Technology Park. Erected on the former campus softball field, the tech park will be expanded to include four more facilities over 10 years, said Jim Dunning, the director of economic development and technology transfer at Cal Poly.The SLO HotHouse brings together the center\u2019s students and entrepreneurs, who rent shared work space. HotHouse inhabitants have access to mentors, venture capitalists and sources to help with prototypes. In the center\u2019s 13-week accelerator program, each student business gets $10,000 in seed money.Since the center\u2019s inception in 2010, Cal Poly students and graduates have started 75 companies and generated more than $150 million in venture capital funding, said Tod Nelson, the center\u2019s executive director.The SLO HotHouse has proved so energizing that when a building across the street that was once home to a bread bakery was up for lease, the university jumped at the chance to transform it into the Cal Poly Lofts, 32 apartments rented exclusively to the center\u2019s students. The apartment building opened last year, allowing residents to connect, brainstorm and participate in one another\u2019s companies. One student hired a fellow resident who was an accounting major to do the books for his start-up, said the Cal Poly media relations director, Matt Lazier.Start-ups in the city are typically clustered downtown or near the regional airport, where MindBody has its headquarters. It operates four eco-friendly buildings, including fitness facilities with yoga classes and a health-conscious cafeteria selling items like acai bowls.The growth in the number of new firms in San Luis Obispo means that office space is becoming harder to find. Derek Senn, a broker at Anderson Commercial Real Estate Services, said it was possible for a start-up to find office space of up to 3,500 square feet.\u201cBeyond that, it\u2019s challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cInventory for larger spaces is low, and it\u2019s not easy to build something right away since not much land is available for development.\u201dThe firm offers over 31,000 online guides on how to fix everything from broken iPhone screens to torn jeans. Luke Soules, a founder and a Cal Poly graduate, said the company is a 10-minute bicycle ride from campus.\u201cWe have a lot of employees tired of the Silicon Valley pace and come to raise a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest contention we have is not having enough bike parking spaces.\u201dSeveral recent decisions by the city should help offset the shortage. For instance, it has approved more than 2,000 new homes and housing units over the next 10 years, Mayor Heidi Harmon said.But residents have already started to grumble about the newcomers encroaching on their quiet town.And Gary Dwyer, a former Cal Poly professor who taught urban design for more than 30 years, said the tech workers were using San Luis Obispo as a playground to surf and ride mountain bikes.\u201cThe techies are building and buying secondary homes they can use as time shares,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are already here, and more are on the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Biggest Tech Failures and Successes of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s face it: Technology this year was one big \u201cfail\u201d after another. And the biggest loser from all of this was you.It\u2019s easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money. So here\u2019s a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.Epic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.Hackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What\u2019s worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax \u2014 if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.Equifax\u2019s top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.Juicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year\u2019s tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.Juicero\u2019s product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).Remember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake. Facebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.On the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.When Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn\u2019t a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous. An initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly. This is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.For the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn\u2019t a Nintendo. The Japanese game company\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, was a flop. People are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console\u2019s first 10 months.Year after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms. That vision is finally becoming a reality. Advertisement"}

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter. They were in pain, and he was lost.Read more \u25beB. 1928John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1944Counter, a friend once wrote, was \u201cthe most interesting man in the world.\u201d Born in Americus, Ga., he grew up in Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach, Fla., a community full of fruit-pickers and maids and servants, there to support the resort town and the wealthy whites living in seaside mansions like Mar-a-Lago. Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all. They were an exotic and beautiful new species.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January. Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Read more \u25beB. 1927John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

For instance, Mr. Tambor was widely believed to be leaving \u201cTransparent\u201d after he issued a statement saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see how I can return.\u201d Yet a representative for the actor disclosed to The Times recently that, in fact, Mr. Tambor had no plans to quit.In interviews, several cast and crew members said that the socially progressive values of \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 with its embrace of transgender characters and its commitment to workplace inclusivity \u2014 made the accusations of sexual harassment all the harder to process.\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a former writer and producer who is still in touch with many of the show\u2019s staff members. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly sad that that happened in the midst of something that felt so revolutionary.\u201d\u201cEven in the safest of sets, where there were people who were really thinking constantly about how do we make sure we\u2019re heart-connected at work, things happened, or things may have happened,\u201d the show\u2019s creator, Jill Soloway, said on a panel a few days after the second of three women, the \u201cTransparent\u201d actress Trace Lysette, came forward with accusations about Mr. Tambor.Mx. Soloway dotted the set with at least 60 transgender and gender nonconforming writers, actors and crew members, as well as many more extras, through what Mx. Soloway called the show\u2019s \u201ctransfirmative action\u201d program. A pair of transgender artists-turned-producers vetted the story lines to ensure authenticity. There were sessions to teach set decorators, drivers and other staff members how to speak and write sensitively about transgender issues.\u201cWe all feel like we\u2019re part of a greater good,\u201d Andrea Sperling, an executive producer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to entertain, but it\u2019s part of something bigger than all of us.\u201dWriters referred to Mx. Soloway\u2019s writers\u2019 room, with joking affection, as the \u201cwriters\u2019 womb,\u201d a nurturing yet unpasteurized space where the intimate details of their own lives \u2014 including sexual proclivities, extramarital affairs and more quotidian memories \u2014 were discussed and then stirred into the show.Their willingness to explore any personal experience, no matter how graphic or private, gave the story lines some of their emotional rawness and sexual frankness, and the set its warm, freewheeling atmosphere.Yet the absence of boundaries could also create uncomfortable moments for anyone less willing to share; one former writer, speaking anonymously to discuss private work sessions, recalled texting a friend out of unease when the writers were asked about their masturbation habits. (Mx. Soloway said in a written response to questions that sex was just one of many things the writers talked about, and that it was common practice among television writers to mine personal experiences for content.)In interviews with writers, producers and an actress arranged by Mx. Soloway\u2019s personal publicist, Mr. Fitzerman-Blue was one of the few to say he believed the women\u2019s allegations against Mr. Tambor; most others would not discuss them.The first accusations surfaced last month when Mr. Tambor\u2019s former assistant on the show, Van Barnes, wrote in a private Facebook post that the actor had sexually harassed and groped her.Two of Ms. Lysette\u2019s friends \u2014 Rain Valdez, an actress who worked as a producer on \u201cTransparent,\u201d and Mindy Jones, a singer \u2014 said in interviews that Ms. Lysette had confided in them about Mr. Tambor\u2019s actions at the time. Another actress, Alexandra Billings, said in a statement to The Times that she had overheard Mr. Tambor tell Ms. Lysette, \u201cMy God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually.\u201dIn an interview with The Times, Ms. Lysette said she hoped the show would evolve to focus on transgender experiences beyond those of Mr. Tambor\u2019s character. \u201cLike, come on,\u201d said Ms. Lysette, who is transgender. \u201cWe have a lot to share, and the world wants to see it, and I just think that it sucks that so much rides on these leading men.\u201dMr. Tambor, too, produced a supporting account. In a statement provided by the actor\u2019s publicist, Allan Mayer, a hairstylist on the show, Terry Baliel, said that he had never witnessed the actor doing anything of an \u201cinappropriate sexual\u201d nature.A few days later, in a new statement provided to The Times, Mr. Mayer expanded on Mr. Tambor\u2019s position: \u201cWhat he said was that given the toxic atmosphere and the politicization on the set, it\u2019s very hard for him to see how he can possibly return. But no final decision for next year has been made, either by Jeffrey or by Amazon.\u201d He declined to elaborate on what Mr. Tambor meant by toxic atmosphere and politicization of the set.Responding to questions, Mx. Soloway wrote, \u201cI take what Van Barnes and Trace Lysette are saying very seriously,\u201d but declined to discuss the accusations, citing Amazon\u2019s internal investigation.Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of Glaad, the L.G.B.T.Q. media advocacy group, said \u201cTransparent\u201d had \u201cbroken the mold, or created the mold\u201d for hiring transgender actors and other industry workers, who have historically faced barriers to employment in Hollywood.Mx. Soloway had become \u201cdeeply aware\u201d of the issue, but had \u201choped that being able to invite mainstream audiences into this family using a well-known actor was worth the trade-off,\u201d Mx. Soloway wrote in response to questions.Rhys Ernst, a producer, said he had argued to friends that Mr. Tambor was a \u201csocially responsible exception\u201d to the principle of casting transgender people in transgender roles, given the show\u2019s overall benefit to the movement.But Mr. Ernst, who is transgender, said he thought \u201cTransparent\u201d had made casting transgender people in transgender roles a more urgent issue.\u201cIf we were to start this whole thing all over again,\u201d Mr. Ernst said, \u201cit would probably go a different way.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the distinction achieved by Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s Golden Globe for his role on \u201cTransparent.\u201d It was not the first Golden Globe given to an actor for a transgender role; Hilary Swank won a best actress award for \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d in 2000.Advertisement"}

Then, late in the show, he abruptly dropped the effort to cheer us all up and began to sing a Jimmy Webb tune called \u201cThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.\u201d Webb\u2019s songs had always been Campbell\u2019s True North, and as he launched into this mournful, lyrically complex song about the conflict that had always been central to Campbell\u2019s art \u2014 the immense difficulty of \u201cloving well\u201d \u2014 something seemed to be emerging from the singer\u2019s reserves.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it.

The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.Read more \u25beB. 1974John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1977Mirzakhani grew up in Tehran with dreams of becoming a writer. In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R.

And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

He said to me, \u2018You can\u2019t help who you fall in love with.\u2019\u201dMs. Olivier said that when the people closest to her came to know Mr. Jennings, they were more accepting.\u201cI told them, \u2018Once you meet him, you\u2019ll understand,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they saw how nice he was and how well he treated me, they loved him.\u201dBy the time Mr. Jennings asked Ms. Olivier to accompany him on an annual trip to New York in late August 2016 to attend the United States Open tennis tournament and meet some of his New York friends, they were talking marriage.\u201cMy friends loved her too,\u201d Mr. Jennings said, \u201cthough I will admit that a few of them were looking at us with raised eyebrows.\u201dOn Jan. 7, 2017, Mr. Jennings picked up Ms. Olivier for dinner wearing a coat and tie, a very unusual occurrence. He had made a reservation at the same restaurant where they first had lunch.There, he asked her to marry him.\u201cHe\u2019s someone I look up to and enjoy spending time with,\u201d Ms. Olivier said. \u201cAs far as our ages, those numbers don\u2019t mean a thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Restaurant Where You Can Order a Dish, Literally", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey\u2019re all listed on a dim sum-style illustrated card available from the waiter. Fill it out, and the items can be delivered that day \u2014 along with, say, palmiers and croissants from Ms. Rose\u2019s adjoining bakery.Blackbarn\u2019s co-founder, Mark Zeff, says immersive shopping like this is the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which he believes is being clobbered by online shopping in part because \u201cpeople are sick of walking down the street and seeing these homogeneous big brands, one next to the other.\u201d\u201cWe just wanted to do something that was that comprehensive that we had real ownership and authorship of,\u201d Ms. Standefer said. When designing other people\u2019s restaurants, she said, \u201cwe could only control so much.\u201dNow they run the entire show, weighing in on Ms. Rose\u2019s menu and, of course, how \u2014 and on what \u2014 it is served. In keeping with its \u201csimple but refined\u201d style, Ms. Rose\u2019s food will be plated on a high-low, intentionally mismatched combination of ceramics sourced from Japan, Sweden, Australia and Denmark, eaten with vintage French silverware and dabbed away by linens made in Sweden. A light soup might arrive in a substantial Japanese clay donabe; a homey ch\u00e8vre cheesecake on a delicate plate (also Japanese).The cultural, and textural, misappropriations are intentional. While Mr. Alesch says that he and Ms. Standefer are seasoned business professionals, \u201cwe really try to take a chill pill when it comes to all the rules and regulations of interiors.\u201dAs for food, Mr. Alesch, an avid home cook and host, said: \u201cAt home, we\u2019re pretty wild. We use our donabes for Western food, we use the wrong wineglass \u2026 .\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re interested in a strange tension and mix of things from a lot of different places,\u201d Ms. Standefer said, adding that those who don\u2019t wish to mix pieces can simply match, as most of the selections on the table are part of a full collection.To demonstrate the range of styles and prices, she held up a lunar-surfaced teapot (a look that Mr. Alesch described as \u201chigh folk\u201d) made by the Danish ceramist that sells to the restaurant Noma in Copenhagen, and \u2014 to the other extreme \u2014 a classic French coffee glass that she said was \u201ccompletely reasonable: like, Amazon reasonable.\u201d A set of six will sell for $85; that teapot, though, will cost $350.All of the tableware was subjected to a stress test designed by their operating partner, Stephen Starr: put through the dishwasher 20 times to see if that metallic glaze remained intact. About one-fifth of their original choices didn\u2019t survive. Even for those objects that can withstand the heavy use, Ms. Rose said, additional dishwashing and polishing staff will be required.For Mr. Alesch, the idea of experiencing the goods in situ is a counterbalance to today\u2019s online marketplace. \u201cI spent the last decade exercising the glory of internet shopping,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a little fatigued by getting the wrong things, doing returns \u2026 .\u201dHe also wanted to reintroduce what he calls the \u201cOld World\u201d idea of having purchases put on a house account and delivered with flair from their warehouse in Industry City, in Brooklyn. (They can also be ordered online.)Ms. Standefer said she understood that their soup-bowl-to-nut-dish approach might be overreaching in today\u2019s shopping climate. \u201cWe just don\u2019t believe \u2014 and we might get schooled \u2014 that retail is dead,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t have any soul.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Walmart Will Let Its 1.4 Million Workers Take Their Pay Before Payday", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, Walmart has taken heat for how it treats its work force, including paying low wages and creating unpredictable schedules. Now, the giant retailer is trying to ease some of its workers\u2019 financial strain, allowing them to receive wages before their next payday.Instead of waiting two weeks between paychecks, Walmart workers can now use an app to access a portion of wages for hours they have already worked.But Walmart\u2019s new service also highlights, albeit unwittingly, the financial struggles of the low-wage workers in the retail and service industries. Even as the economy strengthens, many workers in stores and restaurants are not earning enough to make ends meet.Walmart said the new initiative is intended to help workers avoid costly payday loans and other debt traps, and reduce the stress that comes with financial hardship.Workers who are less worried about cash issues \u201cfeel more confident and more settled at work,\u201d Judith McKenna, Walmart\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview.\u201cWe believe this is the right thing to do, and we are happy to champion it,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Labor groups say the best investment Walmart could make is not in a new app, but in increasing pay.\u201cIt sounds like this may be a useful service but it doesn\u2019t tackle the fundamental problem Walmart workers suffer,\u201d said Paul Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group. \u201cTheir paychecks are too small.\u201dThe minimum starting wage at Walmart is $9 an hour, which is $1.75 higher than the federal minimum wage. But it is lower than the starting wage at retailers like Costco, which pays $13 an hour, and Target, which recently raised its entry-level wage to $11 an hour.The average hourly wage for a full-time Walmart worker is $13.85, while the average hourly wage at Costco is about $24.50.Walmart executives say that raising wages alone will not solve the problems many Americans have managing their cash flow. Rather, the company says, the new service is meant to help workers with the broader issues of financial management.The app, called Even, has been used by other employers, but never on such a large scale as Walmart.With the new service, every Walmart employee can obtain a portion of his or her earned wages eight times a year free of charge. For most of the workers, the so-called Instapays will be deducted from their next paycheck. The workers can pay extra if they want more than eight Instapays.Alexis Adderley, who works nights in a Walmart distribution center in Fort Pierce, Fla., has started using the Even app as part of a pilot program.At first she was suspicious, she said, that the app was yet another in a long line of financial products like payday advances and \u201coverdraft protection\u201d that end up driving low-income workers deeper into a hole.But Ms. Adderley, the mother of boys ages 8, 7, 4 and 2, said she had been pleasantly surprised.The app, which connects to her bank account, calculates how much she pays for housing, food and phone bills and tracks when she makes big monthly payments. With that data, Even provides Ms. Adderley a real-time estimate of how much she has to spend before payday.She earns $19.25 an hour, more than the average Walmart employee, and works 30 hours a week. But money is still tight, especially since she was forced to leave her home after Hurricane Irma. Earlier this week, the app warned Ms. Adderley, 30, that she had only enough money to safely spend $9.08 before her next paycheck.\u201cI would love to save more,\u201d she said.These partnerships reflect Walmart\u2019s broader effort to make inroads in Silicon Valley, where the old-line retailer is seeking to acquire talent and ideas to increase its digital heft in its battle with Amazon.Before creating Even, one of the firm\u2019s founders, Jon Schlossberg, had developed an app called Knock, which allows phone users to unlock a Mac computer by knocking on their phone.Idealistic and flush with money from the success of Knock, Mr. Schlossberg said he began studying how a cash shortage affects people\u2019s physical and mental well-being.\u201cIt is a fundamental problem with the capitalistic society,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said in an interview.Mr. Schlossberg, 30, said he set out to create a product that could reduce the stress associated with money problems, joining a crowd of other so-called fintech start-ups seeking to disrupt the traditional banking model.Walmart pays a small fee to Even to allow workers to withdraw their wages ahead of payday. Workers can take out only a portion of wages that they have already earned during the two-week pay cycle \u2014 so technically, Even says, these are not loans.\u201cYou have earned this money,\u201d said Safwan Shah, founder of PayActiv. \u201cWho decides you should get paid every two weeks?\u201dFor years, consumer advocates and regulators have warned about the dangers of using high-interest loans to pay for unexpected expenses.Walmart workers will not be charged interest if they opt to obtain their wages in advance. But getting paid early, while it may solve an emergency cash shortage, will leave the workers with less money on payday.\u201cIt is still going to be a struggle for most people,\u201d said Alex Horowitz, a senior researcher at the Pew Charitable Trusts who focuses on consumer finance.Matt Fixel, 29, a Walmart worker in Tucson, lives on the financial edge. He works part time earning $10.20 an hour unloading trucks and stocking shelves. When he ran into trouble paying rent one month, he overdrew his bank account, incurring huge fees. Unable to obtain a credit card because \u201chis credit is just shot,\u201d Mr. Fixel pays for services like Hulu with gift cards.\u201cThat app sounds helpful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fixel said of the Even service, but added, \u201cI would prefer it if they gave me more hours.\u201dMs. McKenna said Walmart was making a \u201creasonably substantial investment\u201d in paying for the Even service for its employees. The company raised starting wages nearly three years ago, and Ms. McKenna pointed out that Walmart has also increased employee training programs that aim to advance workers into management, where they can earn more.\u201cWe continue to look at investing in our associates,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Holiday Windows Brighten a Bleak Retail Scene, but How Long Will They Last?", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOne of my fondest childhood memories is of my family\u2019s annual holiday trip to St. Louis to see the department store windows. I was transfixed by the corner window at Famous-Barr, where model trains wound their way through a labyrinth of tunnels and bridges in a snow-covered mountain landscape.Even after a decades-long decline of America\u2019s urban centers as shopping meccas, New York remains a redoubt of holiday tradition. The Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade officially kicks off the Christmas shopping season, and elaborate department store windows are still a major draw for tourists.\u201cIt would be a public relations disaster to eliminate them,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201cI suspect they\u2019ll quietly cut back, spend less, become less elaborate. And they\u2019ll disappear when the companies themselves eventually disappear.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to fault struggling retailers for trying to recoup some of the cost, but part of the windows\u2019 allure has always been that they were pure fantasies untainted by any overtly commercial appeal. Those days seem to have passed.At Lord & Taylor, this year\u2019s windows are co-branded by the Hallmark Channel, which is promoting its \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d holiday programming. Farther uptown, the windows at Saks Fifth Avenue not only carry the Mastercard logo, but the \u201cSnow White\u201d theme on display is basically a plug for the Walt Disney Company, which said it had entered a \u201cpromotional partnership\u2019\u2019 with Saks for the windows. (To both stores\u2019 credit, there are no paid product placements in the windows, a trend that has infected some other holiday windows in the city.)The crowds jostling to see Lord & Taylor\u2019s displays used to be so large that ropes were deployed to maintain an orderly flow. But when I stopped by this week, the pedestrians on Fifth Avenue were rushing by, and few paused to take a look. No ropes were needed. Down the street, the repurposed B. Altman department store, which now houses the City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center, sat like a hulking ghost of Christmas past.Still, there was plenty of greenery and lots of twinkling lights on the Lord & Taylor facade, and holiday music wafted over the sidewalk. The windows themselves were charming, although less elaborate than the ones I remembered from years past. Saks also featured an impressive full-facade light show after dusk. Its windows were attracting somewhat larger crowds during the day when I stopped by.Tiffany Bourre, a spokeswoman for Hudson\u2019s Bay, the parent company of Lord & Taylor and Saks, assured me the sale of the Lord & Taylor building to WeWork would not affect the window displays in the future, and that the company was committed to the store\u2019s \u201crich history\u201d of holiday traditions. After the sale, Lord & Taylor will still occupy some of the building. She said that the holiday windows and light show at Saks would continue \u201cfor years to come.\u201dHudson\u2019s Bay does not break out the cost of the window displays, but they are expensive. Ms. Bourre said the Lord & Taylor windows were created by nearly 75 artists, craftsmen and engineers who put in more than 35,000 hours on the project. She did not try to justify the expense in purely economic terms. \u201cThe holiday windows are considered a gift to the city,\u201d she said.Mr. Cohen said he got \u201call kinds of grief\u201d from executives at Federated Department Stores after he spent over $100,000 to renovate the holiday windows at the flagship Lazarus department store in downtown Columbus, Ohio, in the early 1990s; at the time he was chairman and chief executive of Lazarus, then a division of Federated.The window displays and holiday traditions \u201cwere never overtly commercial,\u201d said Jan Whitaker, the author of \u201cService and Style: How the American Department Store Fashioned the Middle Class,\u201d and other books about department stores. \u201cIn their heyday, they did a lot of things that weren\u2019t directly linked to sales.\u201dThe goal was to attract people to the stores with amenities like tearooms, restaurants, fashion shows and even nurseries. But the rise of Walmart and other discount chains in the mid-1960s, Ms. Whitaker said, \u201cdrove a stake into the heart of the downtown stores.\u201d As shoppers focused on price above all else and old-line stores moved to the suburbs, she added, \u201cThe department stores dispensed with just about everything \u2014 the displays, the decorations, the free gift wrap and alterations, the free delivery.\u201dIt now seems ironic, Ms. Whitaker continued, that department stores were once criticized for overcommercializing Christmas with their window displays. (A religious revival in the mid-1950s, she said, prompted a short-lived focus on angels, carolers and manger scenes.) \u201cThe department stores created a magical sense of occasion,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies came and brought their children. Years later, they wouldn\u2019t remember the gifts they got in any given year, but they remembered the windows. Those children became future customers.\u201dShopping now, she said, is \u201cnot an experience.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just about buying something at the lowest price,\u201d she said. \u201c I find it kind of depressing, but there\u2019s no point in wallowing in nostalgia.\u201dMr. Cohen agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve crossed the Rubicon into gross commercialism,\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be an almost spiritual sense of kinship that gift-giving and gathering together enhanced, and the store displays and marketing tried to embrace that. Now the holiday is just the trigger for an extreme state of acquisitiveness. Holiday d\u00e9cor and atmosphere just get in the way of that.\u201dFor holiday purists, it\u2019s an ominous sign that traditional department stores are getting battered by the stock market. As of this week, Hudson\u2019s Bay shares were down nearly 20 percent for the year. Macy\u2019s stock was down about 28 percent. Both companies have attracted activist investors who have been pushing to use their real estate holdings to raise money. They have shown scant interest in maintaining expensive holiday traditions.By comparison, shares in Best Buy, one of the few success stories among brick-and-mortar retailers, have gained nearly 56 percent this year. Best Buy has withstood the combined onslaught of Amazon and Walmart by focusing relentlessly on price, product selection, technical support and internet sales and marketing. It spends almost nothing on traditional holiday attractions.A visit to the new Nordstrom Rack store just south of Herald Square may be a vision of Christmas future. Under the glare of unadorned florescent lights, it might as well have been January.\u201cI can\u2019t possibly imagine these traditions ever coming back,\u201d Ms. Whitaker said.The Famous-Barr store I visited as a child was rebranded after Macy\u2019s bought its parent company, the May Company, in 2005, and Macy\u2019s closed the flagship downtown location in 2013. The holiday train window, with its seven passenger and freight trains and 300 feet of track, had been maintained since 1988 by a group of local model railroad enthusiasts, the American Flyer \u201cS\u201d Gaugers of St. Louis. After the Famous-Barr store closed, the group moved the display to the National Museum of Transportation, in Kirkwood, Mo., where it is now the centerpiece of a holiday train exhibit.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the amount of space Lord & Taylor will occupy in its Fifth Avenue building after WeWork acquires it.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Peltz Gets His Seat on Procter & Gamble\u2019s Board", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention. This inquiry from you about whether I am doing this is a good example of why we need one.\u201dThe question is whether any of usual suspects among Wall Street\u2019s crisis management world will take this on? Here are some of the firms:Joele FrankBrunswick GroupAbernathy MacGregorSard VerbinnenGladstone Place PartnersRubensteinAnd it seems they got it.Mr. Rubio, in a tweet on Friday, called it \u201ca solid step\u201d and suggested he would now vote for the bill.Here are the details from The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.The change intended to shore up Mr. Rubio\u2019s support would allow 70 percent of the $2,000 per-child tax credit to be refundable, up from 55 percent in the original draft of the bill, according to lawmakers and those briefed on the change. The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren. For that reason, the index has been particularly sensitive to the likelihood the tax bill will pass.With Disney\u2019s bid for a large portion of 21st Century Fox, four of the five biggest deals have been announced in the past three years. The pursuit of scale has driven the deal making. Telecom, cable and media companies all want to get bigger to better compete with the likes of Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix.That dynamic got us to wondering: How has the competitive landscape of media change during the past decade? To help answer that question, at least partially, we asked Thomson Reuters for the 100 biggest companies by market value at the start of 2007 and today. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest telecom, cable, and media companies then and now as well as the tech firms they are up against.Here\u2019s what Mr. Murdoch told analysts on a call yesterday:I know a lot of you are wondering, \u201cWhy did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u201d Are we retreating?

{"Headline": "The Truck Gene", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CheckupMy younger son, I used to say, had the truck gene.We hadn\u2019t particularly tried to develop this child\u2019s interest in trucks, mind you, and we had plenty of books on other subjects, including a massive inheritance from his older brother which skewed toward pirates \u2014 but given the choice on any given night, it would be a truck book, and then another truck book, and then, just for variety\u2019s sake, maybe a tractor book or a bulldozer book.When I mention the truck gene to a group of doctors, a certain number of the mothers and fathers in the room nod knowingly \u2014 they\u2019ve been there, and sometimes back.But even as neuroscience finds new and fascinating ways of looking at the fine points of neural processing and the interconnections of children\u2019s developing brains, that remarkable and somewhat inspirational individual essence remains elusive: Why do you find some particular topic interesting, compelling, memorable, when it leaves me completely unmoved (and, of course, vice versa)?This is the mystery of personal taste and personal interest, as in, what interests you and what doesn\u2019t, and it is part of what makes us human, and what makes us individual humans. But it\u2019s kind of amazing that it\u2019s present so early, and so powerfully, as children look around the world; that they are capable of being bitten \u2014 hard \u2014 by some particular bug (and yes, there are kids with the bug gene).How come you can go into a room full of children, 3 or 4 or 5 years old, and talk to them about dinosaurs, and most of them will be somewhat interested \u2014 but one or two will be truly grabbed, truly converted, truly obsessed? They won\u2019t all grow up to be paleontologists, though Stephen Jay Gould wrote in the dedication for \u201cEver Since Darwin,\u201d his 1977 book of essays on evolution: \u201cFor my father, who took me to see the Tyrannosaurus when I was five.\u201dSo sure, some space kids grow up to be astronauts or aerospace engineers, some horse kids grow up to ride, or go to vet school, some bug kids go into entomology. But the point is not that these are necessarily lifelong interests; many have been known to outgrow the pirate stage, and even the horse stage, the bug stage, the dinosaur stage and, thank goodness, the truck stage. The point is that you cannot make a truck kid into a bug kid; they know what\u2019s interesting, though, like the neuroscientists, they may not know why.And when something interests a small child, all bets are off in terms of memory and vocabulary. The world is full of sweet little voices pronouncing dinosaur names. My own child, and his collection of truck books, enriched my own vocabulary tremendously; I would point at the picture and he would say, for example, \u201carticulated crash rescue vehicle!\u201d (puts out fires at airports, articulated means it has a flexible part in the middle so it can bend as it goes around curves). Lots of syllables there, no helpful little rhymes in the book, and it didn\u2019t matter a bit. Those words were graven on his soul.Even by age 2 or 3, it\u2019s easy to remember all kinds of stuff, from complex terminology to obscure facts, about the subject that interests you. And that doesn\u2019t go away; when I study for my medical recertification exam, I am still working harder at the topics that interested me less in medical school (how many times have I memorized the kidney?) and still feeling smug about the ones I liked and learned properly the first time around (those fascinating parasitic worms).Most of us have had occasion to learn as students and as adults, over and over, that you cannot just decide to be interested in something, even if it would do you some personal or professional good. You can bring yourself closer and learn more and try to work up a relationship to the subject, but be it wine or be it nephrology, if it doesn\u2019t grab you, you\u2019re not going to find great pleasure in reading about it, and the details may not stick in your memory.For the most part, children\u2019s interests and preferences are an occasion for adult appreciation: you may never come to see the magic in trucks, but that just teaches you over and over that your child is a separate person, looking out from a different brain through different eyes.Of course, some children develop interests that actually veer toward perseveration and obsession, and that children on the autism spectrum may be prone to \u201chighly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus.\u201d That is, in fact, one of the possible criteria for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in the latest edition of the DSM. (Back when Asperger\u2019s syndrome was recognized, this kind of special interest was thought to be particularly typical of what Dr. Asperger himself called the \u201clittle professor syndrome.\u201d)So we do sometimes worry about a child with a particularly unusual special interest \u2014 vacuum cleaners, for example, or string, or about a child whose special interest seems rigid or restrictive, a narrowing down of the child\u2019s world, rather than a special portal into a larger and more fascinating sphere.But for most typically developing kids, special interests and special subjects are a source of endless bedtime stories, specialized vocabularies, themed birthday parties and Halloween costumes (we put in quite a few pirate years in my house). Above all, when our children develop strong intellectual preferences \u2014 and never doubt it, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here \u2014 it should bring on that mildly bemused parental headshaking sense that each child is an individual, with a remarkable, fascinating individual brain.Advertisement"}

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse.

His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Last Post\u2019 Shows an Empire Awash in Adultery and Gin and Tonics", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe growing violence, and the occupiers\u2019 reactions to it \u2014 occasionally subtle, mostly rigid \u2014 carry the story forward. But \u201cThe Last Post\u201d is really all about the texture of expatriate life and the brutal beauty of the desert landscapes. (It was filmed in South Africa.) The show\u2019s creator and principal writer, Peter Moffat, was the son of an R.M.P. officer and lived in Aden as a child, and its primary seductions have to do with nostalgia: the British Overseas Airways Corporation logo stenciled on an airport hangar; the tight, colorful print dresses on the women; the crisp khaki shorts on the men.The action is decidedly adult, both in the desert, where the body count is surprisingly high, and in the officers\u2019 apartments, where adultery and alcohol figure prominently. It seems as if it\u2019s being seen from a child\u2019s point of view, though \u2014 everything a little larger and sexier than life, everyone good-hearted and noble despite their flaws. A senior officer\u2019s son who is full of questions about his father\u2019s work plays with a set of toy soldiers, which become a metaphor for the overmatched military policemen.It helps that the third \u2014 who\u2019s sleeping with her sensitive husband\u2019s superior and starts her days by pulling a bottle of gin from the freezer \u2014 is played by Jessica Raine of \u201cCall the Midwife,\u201d who brings a sultry, complicated vibe to a show that\u2019s mostly square-jawed and obvious. She communicates the depths of boredom, loneliness and depression that afflict expatriate communities, and \u201cThe Last Post\u201d gets interesting, rather than just pretty, whenever she\u2019s onscreen.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article reversed the identifications of the women shown.

{"Headline": "Erin Moran, TV\u2019s Darling Daughter, Fended for Herself When the Cameras Stopped Rolling", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1960Young children are not an obvious audience for nostalgia, but those of us who grew up in the 1970s watching \u201cHappy Days\u201d consumed it regularly. We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.In this world of innocents, the most innocent of all was Joanie, the Cunninghams\u2019 daughter, played by Erin Moran, the rare seasoned child star who could act otherwise. Preadolescent in the show\u2019s early seasons and hardly boy crazy, Joanie spoke for all the unimpressed females of the world. (Her first line on the show, about her brother Richie: \u201cHe\u2019s got stinky stuff on his hair!\u201d) As she got older, the protection of Joanie \u2014 from boys who wanted her, from boys who did not want her \u2014 became a recurring theme.Those story lines were surely poignant to her cast mates; some of them worried that Moran was, in fact, in need of protection, though they could only provide a simulacrum of it. They sensed her parents were troubled, were trouble. In the years after \u201cHappy Days\u201d went off the air, Moran spoke openly in interviews of her father\u2019s drinking problem and her mother\u2019s resentment of her success. And there was much, Moran suggested, that the cast did not know about, like the time her father, too drunk after an ABC party to drive them both home, insisted that his daughter, then 13, take the wheel.\u201cHe turns to me and says, \u2018Erin, you are going to have to drive me home,\u2019\u2009\u201d Moran recounted to the talk-show host Maury Povich in 1992. \u201cI\u2019m going down Beverly Glen, and it\u2019s a windy mountain road. And I didn\u2019t even know anything about driving. ... And I just kept praying to God, \u2018Please, please, help me, God, we can do it.\u2019\u2009\u201d At home, she said, her father beat her brother.But on the set, Moran danced the first dance at her sitcom Sweet 16 with her television father and enjoyed late-night bedside chats about the facts of life with her television mother. \u201cI even thought for a time she was confused about thinking that we were family,\u201d says Marion Ross, now 89, who played Marion Cunningham on the show. \u201cBut you see, we weren\u2019t her family. And that\u2019s very confusing for a young girl. We forget that show business is a hard choice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Moran, in that 1992 interview, sounded conflicted about those relationships. \u201cI needed more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut their job wasn\u2019t to take care of me.\u201dMoran and Scott Baio, who played her love interest, Chachi, on \u201cHappy Days,\u201d did turn that on-screen affection into something real. \u201cThey were in love,\u201d recalls Cathy Silvers, who played Jenny Piccalo, Joanie\u2019s best friend on the show. But that romance had ended by the time they made \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi,\u201d a \u201cHappy Days\u201d spinoff, and then that, too, failed. Even Joanie and Chachi watched their dreams dwindle, as they gave up hopes of celebrity in Chicago and settled into a quiet life back in Milwaukee.Life as a star was not a dream for Moran; it was all she knew, until the show ended in 1984 and the fame morphed into something kitschier and less exalted. Moran, unlike her co-star Ron Howard, never translated her early success into real professional opportunity; she fell from public view, aside from tabloid reports of drinking and downward mobility. Moran never lost that bright smile that made her an audience favorite, says Anson Williams, who played Potsie, and who saw her at the occasional personal appearance. \u201cBut after \u2018Happy Days,\u2019 all these demons rose,\u201d he says.In 1992, when the rest of the cast reassembled to make a reunion special, Moran was noticeably absent, as if she could not indulge in the kind of hazy idealization necessary for programmed nostalgia. But by her mid-50s, she seemed more like the person the cast once knew than she had in years, Williams says. In the months before Moran learned of the carcinoma in her throat, which ended her life \u2014 she died at 56 \u2014 she was in steady, texting contact with members of the cast; the last photo she took was of a bouquet of roses Silvers sent her. And in the end, she died quietly, her husband, Steve Fleischmann reported, finding some peaceful last moments in bed, the glow of the television providing its flickering comforts.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again.

The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts.

Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap). Which bullet to bite?Read more \u25beB. 1927\u201cThe most profound change in my life,\u201d Herbert R. Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Comedy Specials to Watch: Seasoned Stand-Ups Making Debuts", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyComedy takes time \u2014 at least, good comedy does. That\u2019s part of the reason comics often don\u2019t release their first specials or albums until they\u2019ve been telling jokes for many years, even decades. Which explains why some of the funniest new stand-up available is in debuts by seasoned performers with honed acts.Here are four first efforts that will add to your holiday cheer. \u201cNice Lady\u201d (HBO)Silly fart jokes tied to meaty social commentaries that spin out into unexpected personal confessions interrupted by nicely crafted one-liners (\u201cA soft penis looks like the sound of sad\u201d): This comedic Rube Goldberg device is a quirky and delightful contraption, far sturdier than it appears. Michelle Wolf\u2019s range is anchored by a distinctive persona: a goofy but slyly forceful mischief maker determined to get you to see her view of the world, one way or the other.She starts by saying it\u2019s an unpopular time to be a feminist, then goes into a bit about activist woman not being focused enough. It\u2019s an off-key opening, considering that feminist arguments are currently upending the culture. But no comic can anticipate the news cycle, even one as savvy about gender and politics as Ms. Wolf, a workaholic who appears on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and in seemingly every comedy room in New York.Her act has always been smart, but over the years, she has developed a level of flashy showmanship that matches her shiny high-top sneakers. Her jokes crackle with character work and strategic shifts in her nasal voice to deeper registers.She remains at her best in intricate bits like one sending up the impossibility of a woman \u201chaving it all\u201d: She runs down a litany of unrealistic expectations for women before juxtaposing it with the simplicity of male ambition, which involves a sandwich and part of the garage. If there\u2019s a thematic core to this hour, it\u2019s a proud affirmation of single-minded professionalism. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a relationship for the same reason I don\u2019t want a kid: I don\u2019t want anything in my life to be more important than me,\u201d she says, adding that that might be selfish, before deepening her voice and saying, with a chuckle, \u201cThe jig is up: I\u2019m not a nice lady.\u201d \u201cAmerica Is the Greatest Country in the United States\u201d (Netflix)Judah Friedlander, who has been performing regularly since 1989 without putting out an album or special, uses more than a dozen punch lines in the first two minutes of his new special, a pace he sustains for more than two hours. If comedy were measured by volume, an argument could be made that no one offers a better deal on Netflix.In the age of Trump, Mr. Friedlander\u2019s preposterous arrogance, which extends to believing he can solve every political problem in a quick sound bite, does not seem so silly, which he seems to understand. His jokes arrive refracted through a left-leaning lens, and while he doesn\u2019t parody the president, he increasingly seems to pivot off him. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to bring back coal,\u201d he says dismissively. \u201cBut I am going to bring back all the VCR repairman jobs.\u201d\u201cComedy Central Stand-Up Presents\u201d (Amazon and Comedy Central)After explaining that a bride for whom she was the maid of honor asked her to wear a pumpkin-spice-colored dress, Yamaneika Saunders freezes, silent onstage, waiting a beat. Then her face seems to retreat, flattening out, her pupils dancing from one side to the other and back again, veering farther from her nose than seems possible. This contortion transitions into a mask of confusion as her shoulders rise, the only help her body offers to the wonderful above-the-neck physical comedy that turns the punch line that follows into a mere coda. (\u201cThat\u2019s not even a color. That\u2019s a drink at Starbucks.\u201d)Is she better live? Of course. But this Comedy Central special is still really good. She doesn\u2019t waste a second on anxious embarrassment after confessing that she lost her virginity at age 27, heading right to anger, explaining how her grandmother\u2019s warning that \u201cJesus is watching\u201d paralyzed her. \u201cWhen I had sex for the first time and the guy called out, \u2018Jesus!\u2019 I was like, \u2018Where?\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s not a bad line, but what makes you really laugh is the panic on her face. \u201cEstablished 1981\u201d (iTunes)Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t cover a consumer technology company. I cover the people and the ideas that are driving the next wave of technologies. And I took at where these technologies will take us \u2014 for better or for worse.But here is what I would like: a service that automatically transcribes my recorded interviews. There are services that use humans to do this, but they\u2019re expensive. Speech recognition technology has improved to the point where machines should be able to quickly and accurately do this for me on the cheap.What are the potential pitfalls of so much A.I. in our lives?The other worry is that the rise of certain technologies \u2014 including autonomous cars and other robotics \u2014 will significantly shift the job market. This is sure to happen at some point, but experts disagree on when.Tech companies have hyped up virtual reality for the last few years. But VR is still mostly a gaming accessory. Do you think it will ever be used by everyday people?Like A.I., V.R. is overhyped. The difference is that A.I. is changing the everyday world in very real ways. Look at the Amazon Echo, the autonomous cars now being tested in places like the Phoenix area, the enormous improvements of widely used services like Google Translate. V.R. is, as you say, still mostly a gaming accessory.But everyday use? That is not happening anytime soon \u2014 especially for people like me, who wear glasses and don\u2019t like heavy equipment strapped to our heads.What tech product do you love using in your daily life?Apple\u2019s iTunes. And the Amazon Kindle app. And Stitcher, a podcast app that reliably delivers everything from Revisionist History to archived episodes of Desert Island Discs. I also like my headphones.The beauty of technology is that you can read, watch and listen to anything you want when you want it. Almost.This fear is blown way out of proportion. But that might be a good thing. Though the Skynet scenario is unlikely to be a problem for many, many years \u2014 the far more immediate worry is the coming shift in the job markets from automation, and that is still years away \u2014 we certainly don\u2019t want Skynet catching us unawares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Luxury Brands, the Musical Chairs Whirled Faster in 2017 ", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly every month this year saw a major departure from a fashion label. The managerial musical chairs at the top of the fashion and other luxury industries reached newly feverish levels in 2017: Every month of the year \u2014 save August, when most companies go on vacation \u2014 saw at least one big shake-up. And a big announcement came just days before Christmas: Phoebe Philo of C\u00e9line was leaving the brand after a decade as artistic director. In part, the reshuffling is because of the shifting balance of power between creative and corporate executives; designers and creative directors appear to be gaining more control and territory than ever as brands combat the challenges of more collections, more demanding consumers and more competition than ever before. Managing a company matters, but design that reflects a distinct point of view may now matter just as much, if not more.The middle-market brands continue to be hit by shifts in the retail landscape and the omnipresence of Amazon, while at the upper end of the spectrum, currency fluctuations and recovering emerging markets have been highlighting the triumphs \u2014 or pitfalls \u2014 in specific boardroom strategies.Here, a chronology of some of the biggest hirings and firings of the year:Turnaround at the creative top of Tiffany & CompanyThe upheaval started early in the year, and at one of retail\u2019s best-known companies. First, after three years as Tiffany\u2019s design director, Francesca Amfitheatrof left to \u201cpursue other opportunities\u201d; her efforts to woo millennials and offer more fashion-forward collections failed to spur sales at the famed American jeweler. Into the frame stepped Reed Krakoff, the former executive creative director of Coach, who despite having no experience in jewelry was appointed to the newly created role of chief artistic officer.Not done yet: Tiffany boardroom is upendedThen, only weeks later and just hours before Tiffany debuted its first Super Bowl ad, Frederic Cumenal abruptly left the company as chief executive, a move that followed disappointing financial results and a lack of investor confidence. His replacement, Alessandro Bogliolo, the former chief executive of Diesel, arrived in October.Power struggles and a departure at Ralph LaurenRiccardo Tisci exits GivenchyMr. Tisci left the French fashion label after 12 years as its creative director. After rampant speculation that he would move to join Versace, he has yet to join another house.Clare Waight Keller moves from Chlo\u00e9 to GivenchyIn one of the worst-kept secrets of the year, Ms. Waight Keller joined Givenchy from Chlo\u00e9, replacing Mr. Tisci. At Chlo\u00e9, the Richemont-owned fashion house known for its airy bohemian style and which is in the midst of ambitious expansion plans, her position was filled by Natacha Ramsay-Levi, the former right-hand woman of Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Louis Vuitton.Luke and Lucie Meier hired to revitalize Jil SanderRalph Lauren recruits his latest right-hand manTo replace Mr. Larsson, Ralph Lauren appointed Patrice Louvet, a Procter & Gamble veteran, and gave him the task of continuing the difficult turnaround effort amid falling sales, layoffs and the changing American retail landscape.Paul Surridge joins Roberto CavalliThe beleaguered Italian fashion house appointed Mr. Surridge as creative director after the exit of Peter Dundas the previous October.At J. Crew, 2 top names departBouchra Jarrar leaves LanvinAfter just 16 months as its creative director, Ms. Jarrar left the ailing French fashion house. She had had a falling out with Lanvin\u2019s Taiwanese owner and was struggling with the internal fallout created by the departure of her predecessor, Alber Elbaz. Ms. Jarrar was succeeded by Olivier Lapidus, a fixture on the French design scene for decades, who promptly unveiled plans to turn it into the French version of Michael Kors. His first collection, shown in September at Paris Fashion Week, was poorly received.More movement at J. CrewAfter a quiet August in the fashion world, J. Crew was back in the news this month when Somsack Sikhounmuong, who had replaced Ms. Lyons as the head of design, left the company.Exits at Ferragamo Just 11 months into his role as design director for women\u2019s wear, Fulvio Rigoni left Ferragamo after a tepid reaction to his collections. Paul Andrew, formerly the Italian group\u2019s design director for accessories, is now creative director for women's collections.Bailey leaves BurberryAfter 17 years with Burberry, Christopher Bailey announced that he would leave Britain\u2019s iconic luxury group in March 2018. Mr. Bailey, who had been widely credited with transforming the brand from a local heritage name to a global fashion powerhouse, had stumbled in recent years in the joint role of creative director and chief executive, as Burberry weathered the effects of currency volatility, slowdown in China and overexpansion.The great internal Dior/LVMH reshuffleAfter almost two decades as chief executive of Dior, Sidney Toledano moved within LVMH to become executive chairman of the LVMH fashion group. He replaced Pierre-Yves Roussel, who moved into a new position as special adviser to the group chairman and chief executive, Bernard Arnault. And Pietro Beccari, who has been praised for his steering of the Italian fashion house Fendi, was hired to replace Mr. Toledano as head of Dior. The reshuffling came six months after LVMH had consolidated its control over Dior, buying out minority investors in a $13.1 billion deal.Leaving Kate SpadeHaving spent almost a decade as creative director, Deborah Lloyd exited less than six months after the brand was bought by Tapestry Inc. She will be replaced by Nicola Glass, who currently oversees the accessories division at Michael Kors.And the revolving door spun until year\u2019s endFirst, after four years at the helm of Mugler, David Koma stepped down to focus on his namesake label, which is based in London. Casey Cadwallader, most recently the design director for pre-collections at Acne Studios, replaced him and started in the role on Dec. 1.Next, after just three seasons as chief creative officer of Diane von Furstenberg, and despite critical acclaim for his collections, Jonathan Saunders abruptly left the New York-based fashion house, which is on the hunt for new investors to fund its expansion efforts. The move was seen as yet another failure by a founder in the fashion world to successfully hand over the reins to a new generation of leadership.Less than a week later, Nicola Formichetti stepped down from his post as the creative director of Diesel. The Italian-Japanese designer, a onetime stylist for Lady Gaga who joined Diesel as its first artistic director in 2013, announced that he would be leaving at the end of the year. Diesel has yet to name a successor.Advertisement"}

Since Mr. Iger took over Disney, annual profit has more than tripled, totaling $8.98 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September.\u201cTo get Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm to even operate on the same planet is a herculean task,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. \u201cAs media barons go, I would put Bob in a category of one.\u201dTo a large degree, ESPN, bought as part of the Capital Cities deal, has powered Disney for two decades. But traditional television, built on third-party cable and satellite subscriptions, is now in decline as people watch more content online. Mr. Iger sees Netflix-style subscription streaming services as a new growth engine and has announced plans to rely on three of them, with each benefiting from the Fox assets. (Two of the services will be new, and one will be Hulu, which Disney would now control.)Success is far from guaranteed.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the impact of this transaction on American consumers,\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement on Friday. Ms. Klobuchar, the Senate antitrust subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, asked for a hearing to ensure \u201cappropriate oversight.\u201dMr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, expressed confidence on Thursday about winning the approval of regulators.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dAs Hollywood began to get its head around the acquisition, it was seen as either the sad ending of an era or the exciting beginning of one.The film business has not seen significant consolidation in generations \u2014 perhaps not since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox, going on to deliver classics like \u201cHow Green Was My Valley,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and \u201cWall Street.\u201d Now that Disney is a content colossus, analysts expect a wave of Hollywood mergers, as companies like Viacom, CBS, Sony, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer look to gain scale.Filmmakers, writers and producers began to moan that all of their creative impulses would now be subject to algorithm approval.But others had the opposite perspective: By supersizing Disney \u2014 the only major pieces of 21st Century Fox not included in the deal were Fox News, the FS1 sports channel and the Fox broadcast network \u2014 Mr. Iger had engineered Hollywood\u2019s best chance for survival. After all, rather than being swallowed by a Silicon Valley giant, Fox\u2019s creative businesses will be managed by an entertainment veteran.\u201cWith this deal, Bob is really saying, \u2018You can all make bets on platforms and algorithms,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chernin said. \u201c\u2018I am going to make my bet on content and control how that content reaches consumers.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch.

You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children.

Her fastidious privacy underscores just how much headstrong independence was poured into the Roches\u2019 breezy, blended sound. Maggie\u2019s songs were vignettes of emotional hypersensitivity, and she wrote from experience.Read more \u25beB. 1927John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1987Jun Sui didn\u2019t plan to get naked for the Chinese art photographer Ren Hang. But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots. Born on a reservation in Minnesota, Banks was shipped off by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to a boarding school at age 5, the better to erase his heritage. When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}

The journals can offer a refuge from the weighty, pressing and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 tragic news that tends to fill the headlines. Like postcards, they offer glimpses of communities and subcultures, often touching on food, history, sociology and the arts.Here are some of our favorites from 2017.Tourist traffic clogs Venice\u2019s narrow streets, choking its glorious squares and pushing the locals of this enchanting floating city out and onto drab, dry land. The lingua franca is a foreign mash-up of English, Chinese and whatever other tongue the mega cruise ships and low-cost flights have delivered that morning. Hotels have replaced homes.A small hip-hop festival on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Chengdu reveals how hip-hop, once an underground subculture, has stormed the Chinese mainstream. Fans are flocking to nightclubs and music festivals to see their favorite local rappers and D.J.s perform, while English terms like flow, freestyle and even diss have made their way into popular urban parlance.Norilsk, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, is a place of brutal extremes. It is Russia\u2019s coldest and most polluted industrial city, and its richest \u2014 at least when measured by the value of its vast deposits of palladium, a rare mineral used in cellphones that sells for more than $1,000 an ounce. Beyond the city, a former gulag, lies an endless, mostly uninhabited wilderness.In Buenos Aires, the \u201cfalsa boda,\u201d or \u201cfake wedding,\u201d is on the rise. It\u2019s really a good excuse for a party. Real weddings have been on the decline in Buenos Aires \u2014 less than half of what they were about 20 years ago \u2014 as couples are simply living together or waiting longer to marry.\u201cWandergesellen,\u201d or journeymen, a vestige of the Middle Ages in modern Europe, are hitchhiking across Europe. These young men \u2014 and these days women, too \u2014 wear wide-bottomed, corduroy trousers, white shirts and colored jackets that identify them as bricklayers, bakers, carpenters, stonemasons and roofers. They have finished their required training in any number of trades and are traveling to gather experience. Most are from German-speaking countries.Ian Austen, a Canadian who covers Canada for The Times, looked back at Expo 67, the Montreal fair that showed Canada off to the world. It marked the country\u2019s celebration of its 100th birthday (or, more accurately, the centennial of its current political structure) in a way that no single event marked its 150th this year.Liberians consider their presidential mansion to be both haunted and jinxed, according to Helene Cooper, a Washington correspondent who grew up in Liberia. No president who has slept at the house for any extended period has come to a decent end. Spirits are said to roam the hallways, while the applause of ghosts can be heard late at night, as if clapping at the end of a speech.Deliveries are rarely simple in Kabul, Afghanistan, which has about five million people but few street names or addresses. Fahim Abed, an Afghan reporter for The Times, followed Mohammed Rahim Khaksar as he tried to deliver the notice for a package for one Atta Mohammed \u2014 a common Afghan name. He biked from neighborhood to neighborhood, navigating dirt roads that can resemble obstacle courses.The city once known as Stalingrad, a pivotal battle that helped turn the tide in World War II, was completely rebuilt, and in 1961 renamed Volgograd, an effort to erase Stalin\u2019s legacy. But memories of the fighting, 75 years ago this year, are strong. Volgograders walking the streets or going to work pass by many kinds of memorials to those who sacrificed their lives.Manila North Cemetery is home to an estimated one million of the dead \u2014 and a few thousand of the living. The final resting place of presidents, movie stars and literary icons, the cemetery is also inhabited by some of Manila\u2019s poorest people. Many live in the crypts and mausoleums of wealthy families, who pay them a stipend to clean and watch over them.The Roman\u00e8s family spends most of the year in the upscale 16th Arrondissement of Paris \u2014 in a small park where their circus caravans have a permanent spot and where they perform their show. The rest of the time, they take their show all around France. The Roman\u00e8ses, who originally came from Romania, are part of a community that is often the object of stigmatization.Fuad Sahyoun and Zuheir Sahyoun are brothers \u2014 and fierce rivals \u2014 with competing falafel shops next door to each other in Beirut.India has some of the most pro-dog laws on the planet. It is illegal here to kill healthy strays, and the result is millions of them \u2014 perhaps as many as 30 million across the country. Packs of dogs trot through the parks, hang around restaurants for scraps (which they usually get), and sprawl on their bellies inside railway stations as rushing commuters leap over them.The weirdest town in Canada\u2019s Yukon Territory might be Keno City, a gold-rush-era relic with about a dozen full-time residents, tap water not fit for human consumption and two bars whose owners haven\u2019t been on speaking terms for more than a decade.

{"Headline": "Scharlette Holdman\u2019s Quest to Find Out How Murderers Were Made", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1946Holdman was not a lawyer \u2014 she studied anthropology. She hurled herself into the civil rights protests of the \u201960s and saw the death penalty, especially the racist, classist way it was meted out in the United States, as the ultimate human rights fight. Holdman did not argue her clients\u2019 innocence. (Capital cases have two phases: one to determine guilt, the other to dispense punishment. She was primarily involved in the second.) But she would do anything to keep her clients off the lethal-injection gurney or out of the electric chair. Visit inmates dozens of times to prove that no matter what horrible things a person said or did, Holdman would keep coming back; absorb a defendant\u2019s family\u2019s anger until they trusted her with their secrets; track down childhood neighbors through property records and ask if they recalled abuse. She also trafficked in the absurd. In 1981, on the second anniversary of the first execution in Florida after the United States Supreme Court briefly outlawed capital punishment as cruel and unusual, she sent the state attorney general a \u201chappy deathday\u201d cake, decorated with licorice crosses. She moved to introduce a tick-tack-toe-playing chicken into court \u2014 a gambit to counter one prosecutor who had argued that the defendant\u2019s ability at that game proved he was smart enough to understand his crime and punishment and, therefore, to be executed. (The court refused to allow the chicken, on the theory that the bird would demean the court. Holdman suggested that killing a mentally impaired man would demean the court more.)She grew up in Jim Crow Memphis in the \u201950s. Her father was a K.K.K. member who liked doing what he called \u201cniggering,\u201d by which he meant collecting rent from black families who lived in properties he owned. Holdman learned, firsthand, what the world looked like from the bottom up. Her father locked Scharlette, her sister and her mother in a closet, and took them out, one at a time, to abuse them. One of the worst beatings came after Holdman answered the family phone and said, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s a lady for you.\u201d The woman on the line was black. \u201cLady\u201d was not a title her father would tolerate for a black woman. Holdman was never going to stay there.Holdman\u2019s final case was defending Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, often referred to as the mastermind behind 9/11. When she started, the reasoning on the defense team \u2014 the reasoning in the whole country \u2014 was that there was nobody like him. Mohammed was the boogeyman. The government opened Guant\u00e1namo to contain his evil. He was too monstrous for the rules to apply. Holdman did not agree. To her, Mohammed was like everybody else: a terribly flawed human. We\u2019re going to do what we know how to do, she told the team. Go back generations. Find out what happened. What transpired to make a person capable of this?In pursuit of understanding this man, she rode around Saudi Arabia on a motorcycle in a hijab. She studied with Muslim scholars. She performed the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, with gout, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, vomiting in the horrible heat.Back home, when the hospice nurse asked Holdman her religion, Holdman replied that she was Muslim, which was true \u2014 she had converted. The nurse\u2019s shock pleased her no end.Shortly before Holdman died, her house filled up with friends. At one point, all the women left, and a group of six or seven men stood around as Holdman lay unconscious in her bed. She snapped to for a moment and blurted out, \u201cAll right, boys, let\u2019s get cracking!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going through your mind right now?\u201d one man asked, eager for a last bit of her wisdom.Holdman said, \u201cMisogyny.\u201dElizabeth Weil is a contributing writer for the magazine. She last wrote a feature about a Chinese-mafia don.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

Although he is a billionaire many times over, he revels in his reputation for saving money.Now, European regulators are accusing Mr. Kamprad\u2019s company of pushing the concept of thriftiness beyond the limits of the law by maneuvering to reduce its tax bill in the countries where it operates.Although Ikea is Swedish \u2014 the acronym combines Mr. Kamprad\u2019s initials with those representing the bucolic area of the country where he grew up \u2014 the company is effectively owned by a Dutch trust controlled by the Kamprad family, with various holding companies handling its franchising, manufacturing and distribution operations.The arrangement is designed to ensure maximum financial independence for Ikea, Mr. Kamprad has said.On Monday, in a separate statement issued in response to the regulators\u2019 accusations, Ikea said it was \u201ccommitted to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate.\u201d It said it had operated \u201cin accordance with E.U. rules\u201d and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry.Mr. Kamprad established the parent company, now called Inter Ikea, in the 1980s in the Netherlands, a country with attractive tax structures that have attracted Apple, Starbucks and many of the world\u2019s biggest multinational companies. Using a Dutch subsidiary, Inter Ikea Systems, Inter Ikea collects fees from Ikea\u2019s franchise businesses around the world equal to 3 percent of the revenue from all Ikea stores.European regulators say that Ikea received a favorable ruling from Dutch tax authorities in 2006 that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of those franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to another company that Ikea created in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Investigators are also examining how Ikea got a second favorable ruling from the Dutch authorities in 2011, after European regulators deemed the Luxembourg tax structure illegal under the European Union\u2019s rules prohibiting companies from receiving state aid. That ruling endorsed a model that let Inter Ikea send a substantial portion of its franchise profit, via interest paid under an intercompany loan, to a company based in Liechtenstein.The case is similar to one that Ms. Vestager brought against Starbucks in 2015. At issue were tax rulings, also issued by Dutch authorities, that she said helped the company artificially reduce its tax burden, an arrangement that ran afoul of the bloc\u2019s state aid rules.In addition to targeting companies like Ikea and Starbucks directly, Ms. Vestager has focused on employing a separate legal tactic to pursue countries that may be providing state aid to companies through special tax rulings. The rulings, known as comfort letters, often help the companies find the most favorable tax jurisdiction.The Ikea inquiry is the latest investigation by European regulators since 2013 into the tax structures of multinational companies operating in Europe and how local tax authorities treat them.The European Commission has ordered several members of the 28-nation bloc to collect billions of euros in back taxes from companies such as Amazon, Apple, Fiat and Starbucks.The commission is also investigating Luxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019s and Engie, the French power utility formerly known as GDF Suez, and a British tax program for multinational companies.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In an effort to answer that question, one of our producers, Lynsea Garrison, reached out to Derek Black.Derek had been on track to become a powerful figure in the American white nationalism movement \u2014 his father was the creator of Stormfront, the internet\u2019s first and largest white nationalist site, and his godfather was none other than David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Derek was called the \u201cleading light\u201d of the movement. But he rejected that destiny, turning away from his family and upbringing. If anyone might help explain the movement\u2019s recent emboldening, and the perception by its members that, after decades on the fringes, they had an ally in the country\u2019s highest office, it seemed it would be Derek.Lynsea was skeptical that he\u2019d agree to talk; she had tried to book him for interviews in the past, on behalf of other news organizations, and he had said no. But the scene in Charlottesville had shaken him as much as it had our listeners. He was ready to talk.On today\u2019s episode:We listen to the original interview and, afterward, speak with Derek in our New York studio about what\u2019s happened to him \u2014 and the movement he was poised to lead \u2014 since we last spoke.Background reading:If you don\u2019t see an audio player on this page or to subscribe to The Daily for free, follow the instructions below.From your mobile device:From a desktop or laptop:Click the \u201cplay\u201d button above to start the show.

{"Headline": "Reminding E-Commerce Customers Who Delivers", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingFor a recent commercial, FedEx tried something unusual. It was not set in a bustling office. It did not feature one of its distinctive delivery trucks, or even a single package.Instead, there was a smiling Drew Brees, quarterback of the New Orleans Saints, ringing a doorbell and waving an app in the face of an unsuspecting homeowner. The message was simple.\u201cIt\u2019s about letting the customer know they can have control over the destiny of their package,\u201d Raj Subramaniam, FedEx\u2019s chief marketing and communications officer, said.Increasingly, its customers are consumers themselves. And as the holiday shopping season approached, with online retail surging, the three giants of package delivery services \u2014 FedEx, United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service \u2014 had to strategize on new ways to address people at home.That represents somewhat of a departure for the major parcel services, specifically FedEx and U.P.S., which have traditionally focused on their relationships with retailers and that business-to-business connection. The Postal Service has been the nation\u2019s mail carrier since 1792, yet only more recently have packages become an area of emphasis.But with e-commerce sales expected to eclipse $100 billion this year for the first time, according to research by Adobe, somebody has to deliver all those goods to all those doorsteps. Today, there is more competition over the \u201clast mile\u201d \u2014 getting packages into the hands of consumers \u2014 than perhaps ever before. Companies like Uber, Postmates and LaserShip are trying their hand at on-demand and same-day deliveries, while Amazon may soon introduce its own delivery service, Seller Flex.This has prompted some couriers to rethink what they are offering and how their messages are reaching different customers.James Cochrane, senior vice president and chief customer and marketing officer for the Postal Service, said that, for most the year, the company tries to showcase e-commerce brands and the packages they deliver in its advertising. But, now, during the peak shopping season, it is emphasizing households and neighborhood relationships.\u201cThis time of the year, we get on the porch,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said. \u201cThe rest of the year we\u2019re in the warehouse.\u201dU.P.S. said it expected to deliver 750 million packages between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s, a 5 percent increase over last year. It expects about 65 percent of those packages to be delivered directly to homes, a spokesman said, about the same as last year.That has prompted a variety of initiatives aimed at the \u201cend customer,\u201d said Louis DeJianne, U.P.S.\u2019s vice president of retail marketing. Though Mr. DeJianne said ad spending remains steady throughout the year, the company has tried to highlight some of its e-commerce-related offerings through an increase in digital ads. Among them are U.P.S. Access Point, which allows customers to pick up packages from a locker at a designated location; Saturday deliveries; and a program that makes it easier for customers to handle returns.\u201cWe looked at how consumers engage with the retailer from searching, buying, checkout, delivery, on through to return,\u201d Mr. DeJianne said. \u201cWhen we analyze the needs of retail, we recognize that reverse logistics is also important to the consumer.\u201dA few years ago, the Postal Service sought to end its Saturday delivery practices for budget reasons. Now, the Postal Service is delivering packages even on Sundays in major cities during the holiday rush. An estimated 6 million parcels a day will be delivered this December.\u201cEveryone is being held to a new norm,\u201d Mr. Cochrane said. \u201cHaving seven-day delivery gives us an advantage in the marketplace. We don\u2019t talk in business days. We\u2019re delivering every day.\u201dThe National Retail Federation said that more people planned to shop online this year (59 percent) than ever before, and already there have been delivery hiccups. Last week, U.P.S. said some package deliveries had been delayed as it struggled to handle a surge of online orders on Cyber Monday.The rate of growth for e-commerce has not been surprising, Mr. Subramaniam said. But, increasingly, he said FedEx \u2014 which counts e-commerce as 20 percent of its overall portfolio \u2014 is being held to a higher standard for three elements of its service: reliability, convenience and control.That\u2019s shaped the corporate messaging, which has focused on informing residential customers about ways to customize delivery options (such as the ad featuring Mr. Brees) and emphasizing the scope of FedEx\u2019s logistical network, which one recent ad described as working like \u201cmagic.\u201d\u201cThat infrastructure is not something that can be achieved overnight,\u201d Mr. Subramaniam said.Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx\u2019s senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications, said same-day delivery accounted for only a small percentage of the overall shipping landscape.Satish Jindel, the founder of the SJ Consulting Group, which advises transportation and logistics firms, said he did not expect Amazon to pose a major threat to the existing couriers. But, he said, the explosion of delivery demand has been a catalyst for change.\u201cIf they don\u2019t do it, there are a lot of small companies coming into business who are glad to do it on Sundays and Saturdays,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will create a whole new dynamic in the parcel industry.\u201dMr. DeJianne said Amazon remains an open and communicative customer of U.P.S.\u201cAs we\u2019re moving forward with our strategies, we\u2019re often at the table with them discussing their strategies as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a good relationship.\u201dStill, even without Amazon in the mix, delivery services are dealing with changing customer demands.\u201cIt used to be that shipping was more about business days,\u201d Mr. Cochrane, of the Postal Service, said. \u201cOr you\u2019d shop and shipping would be five to seven days. But expectations have changed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "IFAt the November New York Times DealBook conference, executives indicated in a survey that A.I. is becoming a much bigger priority. In the survey, 64 percent said they plan to invest in A.I. over the next three years.Still, while executives know that A.I. is critical, 35 percent said their top challenge is understanding exactly what an A.I. solution involves, while 22 percent said budget is an obstacle to implementation. Even so, more executives know that if they don\u2019t adopt A.I., their companies are at risk of being left in the digital dust.\n To get a better idea of how these technologies are reshaping the business world, we spoke with three business leaders about their approaches to A.I.We\u2019re looking at it. It\u2019s possible it could help us value some of the lower valued items we sell.  Researching a particular item often involves finding and organizing data from the past, and A.I. could empower our specialist staff to be much more efficient in their estimating.Within the next year or two. We\u2019ve hired a data analyst and a data scientist, and we have a technical team ready to start automating pieces of the process. It can be transformative. Routine manual processes are already being done in many different businesses by machines, and the price of those machines is falling rapidly. Cognitive routine processes are also moving to machine learning rapidly. You\u2019ve seen this with banks, credit card processing and real estate decisions. There are very few businesses where some portion of the employment base is not doing some version of manual or cognitive routine tasks.Some larger companies may be saying \u201cWe do this the best, and we can do it the old way.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s is not, so is this a lesson for other big, legacy brand names?\nI struggle to come up with an industry that\u2019s more than 10 years old that isn\u2019t facing some version of material disruption. In March next year it\u2019ll be our 274th birthday. You don\u2019t last that long unless you have a very strong business model, but you also have to keep innovating. What we\u2019re trying to do now is embrace technologies and accelerate that rate of innovation.Typically, if I buy a couch, someone shows me the couch and then leaves me to my own devices to figure out the rug, and end table, and lamps that go with it. It\u2019s similar in the clothing world, where we usually buy just a shirt, but we all wear a whole outfit every day. So, we take all the information a brand has and, through machine learning, create new outfits out of every product in their catalogue. We use a lot of natural language processing to parse through the text associated with a product to determine information about it that may not be available to others.We work with major corporations, and it is often hard for them to move fast or do anything different. So, we said let\u2019s work with whatever data or processes you already have. Most retailers have product feeds, which is a giant file that has all their products and all their attributes listed out. We\u2019ll get a copy. Once we get that file, the machine learning processing happens. We calculate outfits in real-time, on the fly, when a customer visits a product page online. This has made our clients happy and increased their revenues considerably.We\u2019re not replacing jobs. We\u2019re helping the merchandisers who hated doing this. It lets them use their skills for something only a human can do. That\u2019s the positive promise of A.I. \u2014 it might replace some tasks, but hopefully you can shift what you\u2019re doing to the more high-level tasks that only a human can do within your company.The threat they\u2019ll be disrupted. In some organizations, like universities, change is not a friendly partner. What we can see is places just going out of business because they can\u2019t adapt, and in some cases they don\u2019t have the resources to adapt. But there is potential, because there are venture capitalists who can begin building organizations that can do this.It can \u2014 I think around disease, for sure. But it may be dealt with by businesses instead of philanthropy. The people who really should deploy A.I. are those such as governments, but that\u2019s not a general practice yet. They\u2019d need to work with a company like Intel that can help speak out on the potential for disruption, help build leadership groups in the business community and then make available its skills and technology to develop solutions.Some organization are trying to figure out ways to help people that have questions related to their jobs. They see A.I. as an opportunity to answer those questions, without having workers fight their way through all the different personnel programs or H.R. people inside of a company. An organization can essentially build a set of services that are really not available otherwise, all based on A.I.

{"Headline": "Supplements Claiming to Ease Opioid Addiction Come Under Scrutiny", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChris Beekman, whose company sells the dietary supplement Opiate Detox Pro, does not understand what all the fuss is about.\u201cIf it works, it works,\u201d Mr. Beekman, the owner of NutraCore Health Products, said in an interview. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d His customers, addicts trying to shake a dependence on opioids, can always get their money back, he said.Opiate Detox Pro\u2019s label says, \u201cOpioid addiction ease,\u201d and the company\u2019s website claims, \u201cOur ingredients are the most effective on the market for treating withdrawal symptoms.\u201dMr. Beekman said he did not have scientific evidence to prove that the product worked, and would not be conducting research to buttress the company\u2019s claims.\u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d he said, citing what he called the prohibitive cost of scientific studies and clinical trials.In general, the agency can fine companies that make and distribute them, or take other enforcement actions. In the past few weeks, reacting to other agency warnings, Amazon has stopped making available some products claiming to assist in opioid withdrawal.\u201cWe monitor the products sold on our website, and when appropriate, we remove products from the website,\u201d said Erik Fairleigh, an Amazon spokesman.The move has upset those who sell the supplements.\u201cThey pulled us all down,\u201d said Allen Wetmore, a spokesman for NutraCore Health Products. \u201cThey claim we were trying to treat addiction as a disease.\u201dBecause dietary supplements are regulated differently than food and drugs, these products do not require clinical trials before entering the market. But the trade commission, which regulates advertising, and the drug agency can enforce rules against fraudulent health claims. And the drug agency\u2019s website notes that the array of dietary supplements making health claims has grown tremendously in recent years. \u201cThough the benefits of some of these have been documented, the advantages of others are unproven,\u201d the website says.When they claim to treat diseases, including addiction, supplements shift into the category of drugs, and companies wanting to make such claims must follow the drug agency\u2019s approval process to show that their products are safe and effective.Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, has made expanding available medical therapy for treating opioid-use disorders a key goal of the agency, which has approved several drugs and devices for opioid-withdrawal treatment.The Center for Science in the Public Interest recently conducted a market analysis to identify companies promoting dietary supplements as effective aids for opioid withdrawal. The group contacted eight online sellers and requested any scientific evidence they had to substantiate health claims made by their products.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at hundreds of thousands of people who are addicted to opioids, many of whom are desperate,\u201d Dr. Lurie said. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation with very limited treatment options compared to the demand, and unto the breach come these unscrupulous dietary supplement manufacturers, who know people are desperate and likely to try them.\u201dAnother company, Opiate Freedom Center, markets a product called the Ultimate Recovery System, saying it is \u201cmade to help you ease withdrawal symptoms, shorten detox length, improve emotional well-being, provide nutritional support to the brain during detox.\u201dAs with some other companies contacted by The New York Times for this article on Thursday, the Mitadone supplement sellers appear to have changed the wording on their website. Jay Lal, a spokesman for Mitadone, said it had hired a law firm to help it become compliant with drug agency guidelines.Several of the companies named in the center\u2019s report defended their practices, pointing out that their websites offer disclaimers and advise customers to consult their doctors.On Friday, the F.D.A. responded to the Center for Science in the Public Interest\u2019s complaints about these companies.\u201cUnfortunately, unscrupulous vendors are trying to capitalize on the opioid epidemic by illegally marketing products as dietary supplements, with unproven claims about their ability to help in the treatment of opioid use disorder, or as all-natural alternatives to prescription opioids,\u201d said Theresa Eisenman, a spokeswoman for the drug agency.\u201cHealth fraud scams like these can pose serious health risks, and the F.D.A. cautions the public to instead seek out medication-assisted treatments that have met the scientific rigor of F.D.A. approval,\u201d Ms. Eisenman said.Advertisement"}

And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can\u2019t even fathom what the price is going to be.I\u2019m not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high.

There is even WASP.love, a dating site for white nationalists and others \u201cwishing to preserve their heritage.\u201dRecently, I spent several days testing a number of these alt-tech services. I created accounts, explored their features and interfaces, and interviewed users of each site about their experiences. (With my wife\u2019s permission, I even created a WASP.love profile and advertised myself as a New York journalist looking to interview lovelorn white supremacists. Oddly, I got no takers.)What I found on these sites was more pitiful than fear-inspiring. Sure, some alt-tech platforms were filled with upsetting examples of Nazi imagery and bigoted garbage. But most were ghost towns, with few active users and no obvious supervision. As technology products, many are second- or third-rate, with long load times, broken links and frequent error messages. A few had been taken offline altogether.If the alt-right\u2019s ideology harks back to 1940s Germany, its web design might transport you to 1990s GeoCities. Even the movement\u2019s own adherents have grown frustrated. One Gab user, who claimed to be using the site while temporarily suspended from Twitter, complained in a public post about the site\u2019s technical inferiority.\u201cI\u2019m an investor in Gab,\u201d wrote the user, who goes by the username @AnewThomasPaine. \u201cI believe in the idea, but I\u2019m disappointed in the platform.\u201d In another message, he wrote: \u201cI barely use it as there are few active users, and few essential features even after a year.\u201dGab\u2019s founder, Andrew Torba, declined to comment on the site\u2019s progress, telling me in a Gab message that \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews with fake news outlets.\u201dInstead, I spoke with Cody Wilson, a developer in Texas who is behind another alt-tech service. Mr. Wilson\u2019s product, a crowdfunding site called Hatreon, was meant to give alt-right personalities and others a way to raise money for projects deemed too risqu\u00e9 for mainstream crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon and Kickstarter.Hatreon got off to a fast start, with more than 400 creators raising about $25,000 per month on the platform. But lately, it has fallen into disrepair. According to Mr. Wilson, a major credit card company, which he declined to name, kicked Hatreon off its network last month, preventing many users from funding projects on the site and all but killing the company\u2019s prospects for growth. Today, visitors to Hatreon are greeted by a message saying that \u201cpledging is currently disabled while we upgrade our systems.\u201dMr. Wilson, who does not describe himself as alt-right, said he has accepted that building a viable alt-tech business might be impossible, given the practical constraints.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how any of them plan to be profitable,\u201d he said.Far-right activists have been trying to build alternative tech platforms for years, with little success. A decade ago, white nationalist websites with names like New Saxon and PodBlanc sprang up to compete with Myspace, Friendster, and the other social giants of the era. But most of those sites fizzled when their creators ran out of money or got into legal trouble. And none came close to reaching a large mainstream audience.But Mark Pitcavage, who studies right-wing extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, told me that alt-tech companies face several structural barriers. Not only do they have to build a compelling product and attract users \u2014 a steep challenge even in the best of circumstances \u2014 but they must do it without access to mainstream funding sources, such as venture capital firms and angel investors, which provide much of the fuel for other tech start-ups. They also rely on finding companies that are willing to host their services and process their payments.\u201cBeing on the internet is a group venture,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said. \u201cYou rely on an internet service provider, a domain name service, a credit card processor. It\u2019s a very common thing for one or more of these entities not to want to do business with a white supremacist group.\u201dThere is also a talent shortage among alt-tech companies, many of which rely on volunteers, and few of which can afford to pay the kinds of salaries demanded by top-tier programmers.\u201cSpeaking frankly, you\u2019re not getting 10x engineer talent with these people,\u201d said Mr. Wilson of Hatreon, using a popular Silicon Valley term for a star employee. \u201cNo one\u2019s lining up for this.\u201dAlt-tech is also a victim of the same market forces that have held back other small tech start-ups. Much of the internet\u2019s basic architecture is controlled by a handful of gatekeepers \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon among them. Those companies run back-end services that allow developers to build reliable products, the app stores that allow them to reach a mass audience, and the advertising platforms that allow them to make money. Without the support of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants, it\u2019s nearly impossible to compete, no matter what your political views are.\u201cIf someone with sufficient money and determination magically materialized, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, but even then it wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said.The good news for the alt-right\u2019s detractors, then, is that the movement\u2019s vision of a flourishing parallel internet seems doomed to fail.The bad news is that, without a functional alternate ecosystem, it may be harder to quarantine the views of neo-Nazis and other noxious ideologues to little-used corners of the internet, far from the vast majority of users. Facebook, Twitter, and other mainstream services will continue to be the dominant venue for ideological battles, and keeping these platforms free of hate and misinformation will remain those companies\u2019 responsibility. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re up to the challenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Missed Out on China. Can It Flourish in India?", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJODHPUR, India \u2014 Every month, about four million more Indians get online. They include people like Manju, a 35-year-old seamstress in this city of ancient palaces, who got her first internet phone last week.\u201cIt\u2019s all finished,\u201d she complained on Monday when a Google researcher came to visit to ask about her online habits.Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make the same mistake in India. It has marshaled some of its best developers, designers and researchers to figure out how to adapt or completely rethink products like YouTube to serve the needs of mobile internet users with smaller budgets but big aspirations.\u201cWe have to figure out how to build the right products for them,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, the Google vice president who oversees Next Billion Users, its unit dedicated to creating products for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. \u201cThis is a very high priority for Google.\u201dMany of the new Indian users have basic phones, which make it difficult for them to run certain apps or to store big files like videos. Data plans are limited, and despite a telecom price war that has cut the price of a megabyte of data by as much as 97 percent, some customers are unable to afford more data when they run out.Google\u2019s Android software and apps like the Chrome browser, Maps and YouTube are often included with smartphones. But Facebook also makes products that vie for the attention of Indian consumers and advertisers.In fact, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram \u2014 all Facebook products \u2014 occupied three of the top six spots this year when the research firm App Annie measured how Indians spent their time online.Arjun Vishwanathan, associate director of emerging technologies at IDC India, said that search, Google\u2019s core expertise, was \u201cculturally not that important to Indians.\u201d\u201cWhere Google scores is its ability to keep it simple and keep it convenient while letting the consumer decide what she wants to do without being in her face,\u201d he said. Google also has vast amounts of data about its users that can be valuable in developing new products and targeting ads, he said.All of the work is backed by an extensive research effort by Google in India and other developing countries to examine how people really use their phones, what needs are unmet and how the company\u2019s apps are received.Datally was a product of such research. When a user opens it, a big screen pops up and shows how much mobile data the person has used, measurable by day, week or month. It also shows which apps are using the data and allows users to block some or all of them. A recent tweak added a feature for finding nearby Wi-Fi hot spots.Ted McCarthy, a Google user experience researcher, was in Jodhpur on Sunday and Monday to gather feedback on Datally and another app, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that is made to work on a $23 feature phone. He quizzed Indians about their internet use, their habits, even how they commuted to work, collecting information to take back to the team.One of the interview subjects, Deepika Panwar, 22, works in a bookkeeping job while trying to start a clothing and jewelry business. Most of her salary, Ms. Panwar said, goes to her parents to help support her younger brother and sister. She spends 179 rupees a month, or about $2.77, for a cellphone line with one gigabyte of data.She said her monthly data pack was often gone in 15 days as she browsed YouTube for fashion videos, used WhatsApp or surfed the web.When Mr. McCarthy showed her Datally, Ms. Panwar quickly grasped what it was about. \u201cIt is showing me what each application is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a great help to me.\u201dThe interviews confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that Datally\u2019s fundamental premise was sound: The tool would be useful to people with data constraints. But they also revealed a couple of problems. The app\u2019s Wi-Fi finder had few public hot spots to suggest. And the technical language on the sign-up screen \u2014 with a warning that the app was creating a virtual private network to monitor network traffic \u2014 stymied potential users.On Monday, Mr. McCarthy visited Manju and showed her the Google Assistant on her new Reliance Jio feature phone. The app allows her to speak commands to the phone in Hindi or English.Language has been a particular barrier for internet adoption in India. The voice-driven assistant has been very popular in India, with 28 percent of all Google searches conducted by voice.At first, the app had trouble understanding her. But before long, she had it answering her questions.\u201cI just say it, and it\u2019s there,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney Makes $52.4 Billion Deal for 21st Century Fox in Big Bet on Streaming", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion.Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video.\u201cThe pace of disruption has only hastened,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. \u201cThis will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.\u201dBut lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content \u2014 namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood.Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal.The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks.There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in theaters on Friday.)\u201cI know a lot of people are wondering, \u2018Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u2019\u201d Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. \u201cAre we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.\u201dMr. Murdoch\u2019s older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman, added that the move was \u201cabout returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand\u201d that would be \u201cfocused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports.\u201dThere has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dThe Murdochs declined an interview request.Mr. Iger is buying 21st Century Fox\u2019s minority stake in Hulu, resulting in majority control of the streaming service by Disney, which previously owned 30 percent. Comcast and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.The Disney-Fox merger is happening as the Justice Department fights AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in court. Mr. Iger acknowledged that antitrust regulators would heavily scrutinize Disney\u2019s purchase but expressed confidence about winning their approval. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that President Trump had spoken with Rupert Murdoch and \u201ccongratulated him\u201d on the deal.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Iger said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dWhen Mr. Iger announced Disney\u2019s streaming strategy in September, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot.\u201d At the time, his comment was viewed in Hollywood as old-fashioned showboating.Not anymore.To augment ESPN Plus, Disney is adding 21st Century Fox\u2019s chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, including the YES Network, which carries New York Yankees games.As part of the deal, Disney will also get the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. That component of the deal would seem to contradict Disney\u2019s push to lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable subscriptions that is now in decline as people turn to streaming services for home entertainment.With the acquisition, \u201cDisney goes from being a juggernaut to being a megajuggernaut,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Cahall and other analysts said the acquisition would likely prompt other entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation immediately surrounded Viacom and CBS, which share common ownership; Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls rights to the James Bond franchise; and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has struggled with low box office market share.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox dwarfs those deals and will create complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney cost-cutting. Disney said it expected the acquisition to yield at least $2 billion in total cost savings.And though Mr. Iger played down any antitrust issues, others in Hollywood have already disagreed.\u201cThe antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant,\u201d the screenwriters\u2019 union, the Writers Guild of America West, said in a statement on Monday, calling media consolidation a \u201crelentless drive to eliminate competition.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adam West Was a Superhero for His Life and Times", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1928This was the dilemma facing Adam West, the former William West Anderson, as he contemplated becoming TV\u2019s Batman in the fall of 1965. He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part. He took it.The show flamed out after three seasons \u2014 by the spring of 1968, real-world crises like Vietnam and assassinations and campus unrest were raging, and the Caped Crusaders\u2019 utility belts (that is, the show\u2019s scripts) were coming up empty. West was soon consigned back to the pilot graveyard and, as he feared, was never quite able to shed the cape and cowl. He might have reached a low when, years later, he was shot out of a cannon in his Batsuit.West lived long enough to see the albatross of the role turn into a medal of honor; he even lent his voice to a few of the subsequent Batman animated series. And he grew philosophical about the character that defined his career. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Hamlet,\u2019\u2009\u201d he wrote in \u201cBack to the Batcave.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re a teenager, you read the play and it\u2019s \u2018Hey, I get it! Hamlet\u2019s having a few problems at home and they drive him crazy.\u2019 Twenty years later, you\u2019re not so sure.\u201d But one key to the enduring appeal of Batman, no matter who was playing him, was that, as West wrote, he was a superhero without superpowers, that maybe just by doing your push-ups and your homework, you, too, could accomplish great things. (It didn\u2019t hurt that he was rich.)What West ultimately conveyed in his portrayal, though, was something slightly different: His Batman showed us that occasionally we need our superheroes to be a little more like us. It\u2019s no wonder that when he finally got his next major role, at age 71, on the animated \u201cFamily Guy\u201d series, he was a ludicrous, deranged but nevertheless lovable mayor named ... Adam West. Pow! Zap!B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it.

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

Axelrod once recalled, began in 1955, when Axelrod, a New Jersey-based aquarium-fish dealer and the publisher of Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine, took a steamboat up the Rio Negro, deep in the Brazilian Amazon. He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures.

{"Headline": "\u2018Porch Pirates\u2019 Steal Holiday Packages as They Pile Up at Homes", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 It is a season for giving and, according to law enforcement officials in Washington County, Ore., taking as well.Two weeks ago, its Sheriff\u2019s Office ran a sting operation to catch porch pirates, thieves who swipe packages from Amazon and other companies from doorsteps. Detectives from the department\u2019s property crimes unit put several electronics items worth more than $500 in a box, dropped in a tracking device and \u201cbaited\u201d a volunteer\u2019s front porch in the town of Aloha.Sure enough, a pirate struck just after 2 a.m., and deputies traced him to a home two blocks away. In an apparent effort to cover up his deed, the 27-year-old suspect microwaved the tracking device, so he was charged with evidence tampering in addition to theft.Porch pirates have darkened people\u2019s doorsteps for years. Law enforcement agencies say they think the crime is on the rise, along with the growth of online shopping. \u201cThere\u2019s more packages for them to grab,\u201d said Angela Sands, a spokeswoman for the Police Department in Lincoln, Neb.And the rewards are especially attractive during the holiday season. United Parcel Service plans to deliver 750 million packages this season, up from 500 million five years ago.\u201cOne of the outcomes is you\u2019ve got one of the easiest ways to steal something ever,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, chief executive of Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhoods that has become a popular outlet for residents to gripe about stolen boxes.It is yet another sign that the endless capacity of technology to improve lives has led to endless criminal innovation as well.Mike Armstrong, a general contractor in Memphis, has earned a reputation on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor forums as something of a vigilante. By his own estimate, Mr. Armstrong has confronted suspected package thieves more than a dozen times over the last four years, once on his own porch with the aid of his surveillance system.He said his neighbors call him the \u201cstrong arm of the law,\u201d a play on his last name.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like this sick perversion I have, catching thieves,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.Technology is also amplifying awareness of the problem, while serving as a deterrent. Internet surveillance cameras from Google\u2019s Nest and Ring have made it easier for residents to capture video of package thieves in the act. Ring makes internet-connected doorbell cameras that start at $179. Homeowners can speak through the device to visitors \u2014 or bad guys \u2014 at their front doors using a smartphone app, even if they are not home.YouTube, Facebook, Nextdoor and other social media are popular places for frustrated residents to share the footage. Camera companies like Ring have used the videos as marketing.Law enforcement agencies are stepping up their efforts to deter package thieves. On Cyber Monday, postal inspectors and police officers in the Portland, Ore., area put out 21 bait packages. They made four arrests and recovered a stolen vehicle, according to Sgt. Christopher Burley, a spokesman for the Portland Police Department.Steve Gaut, a UPS spokesman, said public perception of the problem was rising, \u201cdriven by the greater use and affordability of home surveillance technology and the pervasiveness of social media and related user-generated social content.\u201d The company does not think there has been a significant increase in the per-capita incidence of package theft, he said, but many victims never report their problems to the company.Amazon, by far the nation\u2019s largest online retailer, said the vast majority of packages made it to customers without being stolen, but declined to provide specifics. The company typically replaces deliveries that are reported stolen.Walmart, the nation\u2019s second-largest online retailer, did not respond to requests for comment.Steven Kenworthy, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus, expected a large box from Amazon with a $400 electric skateboard to arrive at his home in June. Amazon told him its carrier had delivered the item, but there was no trace of it.\u201cSome rascal snagged my package,\u201d Mr. Kenworthy said. He went on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor discussion forums and found reports of missing packages and suspected thieves tailing FedEx trucks through the area.\u201cEverybody\u2019s problems start feeling like your problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were talking about how it was every single day packages would go missing.\u201dAmazon sent him a replacement skateboard at no charge within two days, he said.Mr. Kenworthy said he had no intention of installing a camera outside his home because he thought it would make him feel more violated.\u201cIt\u2019s going to make me mad,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cheo Found Solace in the Mountains of Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Many of Heredia\u2019s family members had never set foot outside the village, and with the storm coming, they had no intention of doing so now. Like their native Ta\u00edno ancestors, they were superstitious, so Heredia doodled while speaking to her aunt, as if sketching out the verbal gymnastics that she was performing to keep either of them from speculating about what might happen next. Cheo, whose full name was Jos\u00e9 Heredia Medina, was 87. He needed an oxygen tank to breathe. Heredia could feel Luisa begin to zero in on something that neither of them wanted to hear. \u201cThis storm is going to bring death to us,\u201d Luisa told her.As a young man, Cheo was an adventurer. He was tall, with small almond-shaped eyes under a protruding brow line and hands that were permanently cracked and swollen from the endless heaving and hiking that life in the Puerto Rican mountains requires. While the topography had insinuated itself onto his body, Cheo\u2019s heart and mind were elsewhere, gripped with fascination for Americans, who controlled the island politically, making him an American citizen. He studied hard \u2014 especially in English classes \u2014 and when he was drafted into the Army in 1952 at age 21, he practically leapt off the plot of land that had been in his family since at least the 1850s to explore this unknown part of his identity.But when Cheo began to serve his country, he discovered that his connection to the mainland was not necessarily mutual. He served in a Puerto Rican-only unit in Korea and told his family that they were sent into dangerous areas ahead of white soldiers, and that as a result, more of them were sent home in body bags. Like many veterans of his generation, he later refused to go into detail about his service. For years afterward, he occasionally lost the battle to forget \u2014 springing up, cold and sweating, in the middle of the night, with no idea where he was.After Cheo was discharged in 1954, he moved back to Puerto Rico briefly to marry Esther Gonz\u00e1lez, who was also from Sabana Grande Alta. She was strikingly beautiful, spoke no English and had only a second-grade education, and she was won over by his swashbuckling spirit and vision for their future. They had five children, then set off to try to penetrate American culture. After uncomfortable stints in New York and Florida, they settled in Milwaukee, where, as the only Latinos in their neighborhood, they had few stereotypes to burden them. They each worked multiple jobs to cobble together enough money to buy a house and support eight children. Cheo\u2019s American dream had begun a second time, but it looked much different from what he had imagined.Cheo hated the snow and kept the heat blazing year round. A divide grew between the children born in Puerto Rico, who struggled to make friends and learn English, and their younger siblings, whom they resented for being fully American out of the womb. The friction began to chip away at Cheo\u2019s spirit. His eyes darkened, and he rarely smiled anymore. As his flashbacks to the war became worse, he drank more and became violent.The disillusionment peaked around 1971, Heredia remembers, when Cheo became fed up with the managers at one of his jobs, who said Puerto Ricans were lazy and dirty and passed him over for a series of promotions. He filed a lawsuit against his employer for workplace discrimination, and after losing because of insufficient evidence, he had reached a breaking point. He left his wife and children and moved back to Puerto Rico, retreating into the three-room structure where four generations of his family were raised.He supported himself by selling hand-squeezed juices and spicy vinegars made from the fruits and peppers that grew outside his home. After he left the United States, a few of his children vowed never to speak to him again. Those with whom he kept in touch communicated with him by sending letters because he did not have a phone. Over time, even his English deteriorated.The sting of rejection that he felt in the United States never left him. Besides his children, the only connection that Cheo maintained with the mainland was through the V.A., which provided his health care. He locked up the other reminders of that time \u2014 the lawsuit, his service medal from Korea \u2014 in an old suitcase and shoved it under his bed.After the hurricane, parts of Puerto Rico were unreachable for weeks. In California, Heredia couldn\u2019t sleep, so she lay in bed at night, staring up at the ceiling. She called her Puerto Rican family members over and over, but telephone networks had been wiped out, so she couldn\u2019t get through. On Facebook, she pleaded for anyone with information about conditions to share it. She and her siblings found a hotline for a Puerto Rican government office in Washington, and they reported their family members missing.On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, a cousin contacted the family after trudging through mud for hours and hitchhiking to a working phone. The cousin said Heredia\u2019s aunt Luisa, who had fractured her hip, was alive but too unwell to travel or talk on the phone. Cheo had run out of oxygen and died. His ambulance never came.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up. Page 264 of the first of eight installments of his government file includes a warning from someone who was clearly afraid of this empowerment \u2014 so much so that he sent his concerns directly to J.

The conventional avenues for dating at your age \u2014 senior hikes, senior bird-watching, senior mixers (you even hang out in hardware stores) \u2014 have netted little. Online dating is not yet commonplace.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else, he figured, he could have some fun with the part.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry. As a high school junior, she and her best friend, Roya Beheshti, became the first Iranian women to qualify for the International Mathematical Olympiad, and the next year, in 1995, Mirzakhani took a gold medal with a perfect score.Read more \u25beB. 1918John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1945For 38 years, Barkley Hendricks began his Art 111/112 class by asking each student to bring in three small objects that meant something to them. The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know. I was there.) He made a striking reputation for himself: Students either loved him or hated him. Either way, they warned one another about him: \u201cKnows what he\u2019s doing but kinda mean about it,\u201d read one review on RateMyProfessors.com, a virtual bible of student-generated reviews that was popular on campus.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic. And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen. Martin, who worked with Dotrice on the TV series \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d recruited him to record his books because he recognized Dotrice\u2019s voice as an instrument of sorcerous potency.Read more \u25beB. 1943John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1937Dennis Banks, whose Ojibwa (Chippewa) ancestors\u2019 names were not registered on a ship\u2019s manifest, was looking to put down roots.

When he returned home after 11 years, his mother had moved and started a new family.In 1968, after a stint in the Air Force in Japan that ended with Banks going AWOL, and two and a half years in jail on a burglary rap, he helped found the American Indian Movement (AIM) to advance the interests of Native Americans.Read more \u25beB. Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California.

The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good.

The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

In sixth grade, she started at Farzanegan, a school for the city\u2019s most gifted girls, and earned the top marks in all of her classes \u2014 except math. Near the school year\u2019s end, the instructor returned a math test marked 16 out of 20, and Mirzakhani ripped it up and stuffed the pieces in her bag. She told a friend that she\u2019d had it when it came to math: \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to do better.\u201d Mirzakhani, though, was constitutionally incapable of not trying, and she soon fell in love with the subject\u2019s spare poetry.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

The chestnut landed in an inkwell and broke it, splattering ink. Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it. Ratushinskaya lied and hedged: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t see anything, when it happened I was searching for something in my satchel.\u201d But when it was his turn, Seryozha simply said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d His answer was a revelation. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t even entered my head to say that,\u201d she writes in the second of her two memoirs of Soviet dissent, \u201cIn the Beginning\u201d (1991). \u201cHow ashamed I felt!

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse. Quarantelli looked around and realized, he recalled, \u201cThis is a different world than what had been assumed.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1985DeMarlon Thomas was a native son of Saginaw, a struggling Michigan city hit hard when General Motors plants closed. As he came of age, employment tumbled and crime soared, and Saginaw became the sort of place where it was way too easy to fall into trouble.As a kid, Thomas mostly dodged Saginaw\u2019s perils, because he was busy playing football in middle school and high school. His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh.

The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay.

And it was largely set among everyday people in a place that was often viewed as a backwater of history \u2014 a derelict Caribbean outpost of England\u2019s fallen empire, fit for nothing but a future tourist resort.In 1930, when Walcott and his twin brother, Roderick, were born, the island of St. Lucia was a British colony with a scant population of around 57,000. The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit.

During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R. R. Martin\u2019s epic fantasy series, \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the source material for HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The five audiobooks, totaling 201 hours, have all the strengths of Martin\u2019s novels, which plumb the grim subjectivity of their many principal characters with patient thoroughness. And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Before 1000The giant sequoia was made of more than a thousand years of light and air and rain and Sierra Nevada soil. It was a survivor. It endured the fire that hollowed its base, and a lightning strike that reduced its height to around 150 feet from between two and three hundred, and it lived on for more than a century after a tunnel was cut through it in the 1880s, though it was ravaged by decay. Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California. Once upon a time tourists carved upon its walls, punched their names into pieces of tin and nailed them inside. Vehicles and hikers made their way through it, posing for pictures. Its demise is the end of one more iconic tunnel tree, those peculiar artifacts of the 19th-century tourist trade.Read more \u25beB. 1932John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dJohn Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dThings They Loved interviews by Jaime Lowe, a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental: Lithium, Love, and Losing My Mind.\u201d She last wrote a feature about incarcerated female firefighters.Lettering by Stacey BakerProduced by Gray Beltran, Rodrigo de Benito Sanz, Kyle Ligman and Alice Yin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules, which required internet service providers to offer equal access to all web content without charging consumers for higher-quality delivery or giving preferential treatment to certain websites.Many consumer advocates have argued that if the rules get scrapped, broadband providers will begin selling the internet in bundles, not unlike how cable television is sold today. Want to access Facebook and Twitter? Under a bundling system, getting on those sites could require paying for a premium social media package.\u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that,\u201d David Callicott, who sells paraffin-free candles on his website, GoodLight, said last month.\u201cIt\u2019s basic economics,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a speech at the Newseum in April. \u201cThe more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you\u2019re likely to get.\u201d\u201cDid these fast lanes and slow lanes exist? No,\u201d he said in the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the special interests pushing Title II weren\u2019t trying to solve a real problem but instead looking for an excuse to achieve their longstanding goal of forcing the internet under the federal government\u2019s control.\u201dSeveral internet providers have made public pledges in recent months that they will not block or throttle sites once the rules were repealed. The companies argue that Title II gives the F.C.C. too much control over their business, and that the regulations make it hard to expand their networks.He wrote that the biggest American internet companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 \u201ccontrol much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business.\u201dMeanwhile, most American homes and smartphones connect to the internet through a \u201chandful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
