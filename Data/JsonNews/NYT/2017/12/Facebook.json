Television commercials are running in key districts. On Tuesday, evangelical Christians supporting the immigrants were arrested after demonstrating outside the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.With their future now in jeopardy, a wide range of well-organized, well-financed supporters are lining up behind the Dreamers, including celebrities, philanthropists, religious groups and pillars of corporate America.Republicans control Congress but cannot keep the government running without Democrats, and several Democrats have said they will not vote for a spending bill unless it also resolves the plight of the immigrants. \u201cWe will not leave here without a DACA fix,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said on Thursday.The multipronged campaign to help the young immigrants underscores how much the country has come to identify with them and how extensively they have been integrated into the economy. Many Republicans have joined Democrats in supporting DACA beneficiaries, and polls show overwhelming support for them. It is no longer politically risky to get behind them.In a recent conference call with religious leaders who supported helping the immigrants, one Republican, Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, told them he would support legislation to shield the immigrants from deportation only if it came with enhanced border measures. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Roskam\u2019s office said his view had not changed.The mobilization began in September, as soon as the Trump administration announced the repeal of the deferred-action program.The companies, which have a substantial lobbying presence in Washington, began leveraging relationships with lawmakers from districts where they have major operations. In mid-November, a lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill involved officials from 40 large companies introducing DACA recipients who work for their firms to lawmakers.\u201cWe held dozens of meetings with members of Congress from both parties and we heard consistently that they want a solution,\u201d said Christopher Padilla, vice president of government affairs for IBM, which employs more than 30 DACA recipients. He added that the company wanted lawmakers to \u201cgive Dreamers the clarity and stability they deserve.\u201dAmong those photographed was a DACA recipient named Laura Cruz, a public-health major who clutched the cap and gown she had just picked up to wear at her December graduation. Given the uncertainty over her future, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to decide what to do next.\u201dDavis Darnsman, a junior studying corporate communications, said his best friend had received DACA protection. He also said he would be amenable to bolstered border security. \u201cThere has to some compromise that can be made to benefit everybody,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, the dozens of evangelical Christians who gathered outside Mr. Ryan\u2019s office bore boxes stuffed with cards on which young immigrants in their communities had written messages relating their \u201cdreams.\u201d Several protesters poured the cards onto the floor as if they were an offering, then knelt, prayed and sang \u201cSilent Night\u201d before being arrested on civil disobedience charges.Cheryl Miller, a lifelong Republican who had traveled from rural Texas to the demonstration, said, \u201cThis is the first time I have done anything like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "You Asked, Ron Lieber Answered: How Will This Tax Bill Affect You?", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAhead of President Trump signing a sweeping tax bill, readers had lots of questions to ask the \u201cYour Money\u201d columnist, Ron Lieber.More than 500 readers left comments during the Facebook Live event on Wednesday or submitted questions to our website. They asked about issues including the bill\u2019s effects on small businesses, its effects on itemized deductions and what it will mean now to live on a fixed income.Did the bill change anything about how capital gains are taxed? \u2014 Anne-Marie Hislop, from Chicago The answer to that question is no, for the most part. Not only do capital gains taxes not change at all, but they\u2019re actually going to be based on the old brackets.There is one twist here, though. Many of you out there may be familiar with 529 college savings plans. The way those work is that you put money in and then you take money out, and if you use it for higher education expenses you do not have to pay the capital gains taxes on growth of that money over time.Why is the corporate tax cut deemed to be permanent? Couldn\u2019t it be lowered by a Democratic-controlled, or as you put it saner, bipartisan Congress, at a later date? \u2014 PDXGirl in Vancouver, Wash.The answer to that question is yes, but the terminology \u201cpermanent\u201d is meant to distinguish it from what is happening on the individual side. A lot of the tax cuts on the individual side are not in fact permanent \u2014 they are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. That had to be done for budget reasons so that the changes that were made could fall into line with procedural rules requiring the cost of this bill to remain under $1.5 trillion.So the corporate tax cut is in fact permanent, unless and until some other Congress changes it in the future.But the personal tax cuts, those are going to expire in 2025, which of course makes it difficult for people to plan long term. Apparently it was deemed more essential that the corporations are able to make long-term tax plans than the individual. So that is where we are. Thank you, PDXGirl in Vancouver. I\u2019ve seen lots of commentary about how this will hurt the middle class, the tax bill will. But no mention of those of us in the working class. How will this affect people making less than $35,000 a year? \u2014 Roxanne JonesAs a columnist, I occasionally sort of make note of the ways in which people define themselves in terms of social class terms. So Roxanne, I don\u2019t know how you define working class and how you distinguish that from middle class.There\u2019s a lot of people here in New York City in particular who define themselves as middle class, even though they make $150,000 or $200,000 or $250,000 a year. Basically if they know more than a handful of people who make more money than they do, then they think that they\u2019re middle class. And so I don\u2019t know quite how to frame this one.But I can tell you this: For people who earn less than the median household income, which is less than $50,000 a year, a fair number of those people, in fact the vast majority, will see a little bit more in their paycheck or take-home because of these tax cuts. Not everybody, but I\u2019d say the majority, probably the vast majority of people will.Now everybody\u2019s situation is different. And your situation could change next year, so you\u2019ll want to consult a tax professional before you make plans.But here\u2019s one thing worth noting: The way in which the government calculates inflation in this particular context has changed and changed permanently with this bill. That\u2019s going to cause some complicated consequences that will eventually lead \u2014 in five or six or seven years \u2014 to more people seeing whatever savings they got from this tax bill effectively eroding.So for all the people in the lower sort of income categories who will see a gain, who will see savings from this bill, the number of people who actually do when you take inflation into account will change and will lower over time. So that may or may not be you depending on your circumstance. Roxanne, thanks for that question.Will there still be tax deductions for student loan payments? \u2014 Jasmine HopeThe answer to that question is yes! Jasmine, you probably saw a lot of the rumors about the fact that this might go away. I know the House bill was trying to get rid of student loan deductions \u2014 there was a huge outcry. If you were involved in some of that outcry or the lobbying around that, congratulations. You won. Student loan deductions stay.Has flexible spending for medical and child care changed? Also commuter benefits? Thanks. \u2014 Edward HadadSo what Edward is talking about here is that many employers \u2014 large employers in particular, but increasingly smaller ones as well, and also employers in certain states where employers are required to offer this benefit \u2014 offer workers the option of having money yanked out of their paychecks and put aside in a separate account before they pay any income taxes on it. It\u2019s money that a worker can use to pay for public transportation, to pay for parking, to pay for medical expenses, to pay up to $5,000 in legitimate authorized child care charges.I love those programs, I use every single one of them myself. I encourage all of you to do that too.The House at one point had talked about taking away the child care benefit. So that $5,000 that people had been able to set aside for day care, or day camp, or even elder day care, which is what some people use it for, that was going to go away. And there was so much anger, so quickly, that it didn\u2019t even make the final House bill, was never in the Senate bill.So Edward, I understand why you might have been worried about that, because that was kind of in the air for a little while. But none of that has changed. So you\u2019ll still get to put aside that $5,000 or so for dependent care expenses.Commuter benefit changes were not on the table for the most part. So no changes there vis-\u00e0-vis your subway. But for reasons that nobody understands, they went after bicycle commuters on this one. There\u2019s a 20 buck-a-month bicycle commuting tax benefit that\u2019s existed for a little while. That is now gone at a savings of not very much money to the Treasury. Not clear why bicycle commuters were deemed so offensive that that needed to be removed, but here we are. No more bike benefits for you, Edward, if that is what you were concerned with, and if so, I apologize.Elizabeth Hunter asks about the status of charitable deductions. She mentions the fact that this can affect both the givers and the receivers.This is true. So let\u2019s start here.The standard deduction \u2014 i.e., the deduction on your tax returns that you can take without having to itemize and write down all the little expenses that you had all year \u2014 that\u2019s gone up significantly. It\u2019s gone up to $12,000 for individuals, $24,000 for couples, and many people who used to itemize, including all of their charitable deductions, will no longer need to and they\u2019ll get perhaps a bigger tax benefit than they got before.The concern among nonprofits is that this would cause some people not to give as much money anymore, thinking that part of the reason they were giving the money was to get the tax benefits. So we don\u2019t know how people will change their charitable behavior here. This is in some ways a great experiment.So if you are kind of right on the line between getting a deduction or not getting a deduction, itemizing or not itemizing, one thing you might do is bunch up your charitable deductions in one year, right, so to kind of put yourself over the top. So you can still itemize your deductions, including the charitable deductions, and then get that juicy tax benefit from doing so.Or, if you want to smooth out your giving so that your favorite causes get money each and every year, or if you can\u2019t make up your mind before Dec. 31 about who you want to give to, you can set up something called a donor-advised fund.Fidelity and Vanguard set these up. They\u2019re basically like charitable gift funds. You put the money in there. You get the deduction right away and then you can sort of parcel the money out from those accounts to the charities and the nonprofits over however much time you want.There are a few fees associated with it, but it\u2019s probably worth it if you want to sort of bunch up your donations in this way. You can do that until Dec. 31 as long as you\u2019re willing to wire the money into the accounts that quickly.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "High Jewelry Today. Clients Tomorrow?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s like meeting famous people in real life,\u201d said Katie Sutton, 24, of Ames, Iowa. \u201cYou see it in the movies, you see it in pictures, but to see it in real life, it blows you away, to see how amazing and how big they are, to see the quality and to see how it\u2019s made.\u201dOn this particular sunny afternoon, Ms. Sutton was walking through the display in the Manhattan store with her sister, Teran Stark, who lives in Queens. Ms. Stark had heard about the exhibition on Facebook.In the past, such collections were heralded by invitations printed on snowy-white correspondence cards, addressed in calligraphy and sent to the rich and the worthy. Jewelry houses created displays in rented h\u00f4tels particuliers or their own salons, placing new creations on velvet or Perspex stands, lighting for twinkle. And, of course, there was Champagne.While many collections had such a debut during the Paris couture shows this summer, and Cartier showed a selection of R\u00e9sonances pieces to clients then, the New York event was something of a strategic move, more concerned about the house\u2019s future than a sale, even a large one, today.\u201cThe selling of the dream is the real essence of how a luxury brand goes to market,\u201d said Nick Pope, Deloitte\u2019s lead analyst on fashion and luxury in Britain. \u201cAs part of that, they would, of course, be typically marketing aspects of that dream that are unattainable. You really want to build up your brand equity in the eyes of all the consumers, in recognition that only a few of them are really going to engage with you.\u201dIn the Chelsea neighborhood of New York last month, on a block lined with art galleries, an exhibition inside a former garage displayed several dozen one-of-a-kind brooches created by Van Cleef & Arpels, valued, in total, at more than $10 million.When L\u2019Arche de No\u00e9 was shown in Paris last year, visitors typically had to wait around two hours to get in. (In Hong Kong, in March, the wait was usually about an hour.)Showing the high jewelry and the B.zero1 Collection, along with the house\u2019s fragrances, eyewear and leather goods, helps Bulgari \u2014 and many other jewelry houses with similar ranges \u2014 to groom the young shopper of today to be the big-gem purchaser of tomorrow. \u201cBy showing the high jewelry, you create a very high image for your brand and you maintain desirability for the products that people can afford,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. And, \u201cwhen people buy the accessibly priced products, they believe that they have been able to buy something from this magic brand that is so revered and loved by the royals and the jet set all over the world.\u201d\u201cWhen you do a grand exhibition, it is to move the brand needle,\u201d said Larry Pettinelli, president of Patek Philippe in the United States. \u201cIt is a branding opportunity that you want to develop not only something for the expert enthusiast \u2014 you want people who know nothing about the brand to also get engaged, so in that educational process you have to think differently about the marketing.\u201dAs comments like those from Ms. Sutton, the Iowa visitor to the Cartier exhibition, indicate, the ability to convey the quality and craftsmanship of creations is one of the primary goals of public exhibitions. After all, houses hope, being impressed is something a future client won\u2019t forget.Of course the business strategy of jewelry houses is focused on profit, but their other goal, supported by such exhibitions, is to create beautiful things.\u201cIn the same way that you go to the [Museum of] Modern Art and you see a Marc Chagall or a Mark Rothko, not everyone can buy, but everyone can feel,\u201d Cyrille Vigneron, Cartier\u2019s chief executive, said one morning at the company flagship. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the exhibition to drive people here where they would have an impulse need to buy \u2014 probably not \u2014 but the fact that they can appreciate the beauty, I think that\u2019s something important to share.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Point Hope, a gravel spit in northwest Alaska, is along one of the new routes.Supported byPOINT HOPE, Alaska \u2014 This is one of the most remote towns in the United States, a small gravel spit on the northwest coast of Alaska, more than 3,700 miles from New York City. Icy seas surround it on three sides, leaving only an unpaved path to the mainland.Getting here from Anchorage, about 700 miles away, requires two flights. Roads do not connect the two places. Basics like milk and bread are delivered by air, and gas is brought in by barge during the summer.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people even know that we exist,\u201d said Daisy Sage, the mayor.Needless to say, this is not the sort of place you expect to be a hub of the high-tech digital world.But in a surprising, and bittersweet, side effect of global warming \u2014 and of the global economy \u2014 one of the fastest internet connections in America is arriving in Point Hope, giving the 700 or so residents their first taste of broadband speed.High-speed internet cables snake under the world\u2019s oceans, tying continents together and allowing email and other bits of digital data sent from Japan to arrive quickly in Britain. Until recently, those lines mostly bypassed the Arctic, where the ice blocked access to the ships that lay the cable.But as the ice has receded, new passageways have emerged, creating a more direct path for the cable \u2014 over the earth\u2019s northern end through places like the Chukchi Sea \u2014 and helping those emails move even move quickly. Quintillion is one of the companies laying the new cable, and Point Hope is one of the places along its route.Financial companies would certainly welcome \u2014 and pay for \u2014 a faster connection between London and Toyko. Over the past decade, traders have increasingly relied on powerful computer programs to buy and sell securities at huge volumes and lightning speeds. A millisecond can be the difference between a big profit and a big loss. Quintillion\u2019s faster connection would also appeal to the operators of data stations around the world that store and send information for social media sites, online retailers and the billions of gadgets that now connect to the internet.But it will be years before the full connections between countries are made. For now, Quintillion\u2019s undersea cables are just around the northern part of Alaska, and the company is taking advantage of a nascent business boom in the Arctic. Oil, shipping and mining companies that can benefit from a faster internet are rushing into the more open waters.Quintillion is also teaming up with local telecommunications companies to use the undersea cables to bring faster internet service to some of the nation\u2019s most disconnected communities.In Point Hope, the new connection could mean better health care, as patients in the town and doctors in faraway cities communicate via seamless webcast. It could help improve education, too. Teachers, now used to waiting hours to download course materials, will now be able to do it in minutes.Many of Point Hope\u2019s older residents cringe at the incursion of technology. For the most part, this is still a traditional community of Inupiaq native Alaskans. Until the 1970s, many families lived in sod houses framed with whale bones.People here also have no illusions about the overall effect of global warming. They see the waters rising and worry about sea mammals disappearing. They rely on the sea for food, and their year is built around festivals for berry picking and whaling.\u201cInupiaq people are taught to be patient,\u201d said Steve Oomittuk, a leading local whale hunter whose family has lived in Point Hope for many generations. \u201cWe wait for animals to come to us for our food, our shelter, our medicine, our clothing. The internet makes people impatient for everything. This is not our way of life.\u201dBut interviews with dozens of Point Hope residents suggest that people here see Quintillion\u2019s cable as a way of connecting with an outside world that has long been beyond easy reach \u2014 and something that could change their lives for the better.Leona Snyder, for one, is excited about what the connection could do for her Justice Jones, who turns 16 on Sunday. She wants him to go to college, which would mean leaving the village. Having broadband internet could help him study and research outside opportunities.\u201cInternet means exposure to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want that for Justice. I want him to be a judge. Judge Justice Jones. It has a ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIn June, three ships carrying huge rolls of cable traveled through waters in the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea to lay the final miles of Quintillion\u2019s undersea internet network.The boats unfurled 40 miles of fiber optic cable into the dark, choppy water. An enormous shoveling tool plowed the sea floor and buried the cables for protection. It was the final stretch of a 1,200-mile network connecting six coastal towns, including Kotzebue, Nome and Point Hope.\u201cA project like this has been discussed for 20-plus years but was formidable from a cost and weather standpoint,\u201d said Tim Woolston, a Quintillion spokesman. \u201cThe ice situation has evolved to the point where it\u2019s now physically possible.\u201dAn infusion from Cooper Investment Partners, a private equity firm in New York, has helped Quintillion finance the laying of the cable. The company would not say how much the network had cost to build so far. But it insisted that supplying high-speed internet service to an estimated 20,000 people along the cable\u2019s route would be a good business.Quintillion makes money leasing the bandwidth from its undersea cable network to local telecoms that then bring internet service directly to homes and businesses in Alaska. The company has not announced its business plans for connecting internet service between Asia and Europe, but will probably use a similar model.Although that is a relatively small number of people, Quintillion believes it will increase along with what the company expects to be broader commercial growth in the region driven by oil and mineral exploration. With broadband service available, Quintillion is also betting that more data centers, research centers, hospitals and schools will make the Arctic Circle home.Other broadband-internet providers have the same idea. Cinia, a telecom company owned by the Finnish government, has completed the first stage of a multiyear plan to lay a subsea broadband network between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean. Cinia, which expects the Arctic network to cost about $700 million, just completed the first leg, from Germany to Finland.\u201cThe financial sector wants the shortest route for trading, and we are talking about fractions of milliseconds, but it makes a difference,\u201d Ari-Jussi Knaapila, Cinia\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. Multiplayer video games that connect participants around the world also demand faster internet traffic with less delay, he added.After Alaska, Quintillion plans to bring its undersea cables to Asia. A third stage would extend the network to Europe. The company would not predict how long the project would take to complete.In the meantime, Quintillion is offsetting some of its costs by joining forces with local telecom companies to sell the internet service directly to customers. In Point Hope, several local companies, including the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative, have rushed to prepare homes. Alaska Communications, another telecom, has signed up city offices and businesses at other sites.The fiber network will bring connection speeds of 200 gigabits per second to the village, among the fastest rates in the country. Point Hope will not feel the full effect right away. Residential customers will initially be able get service at 10 megabits per second under plans starting $24.99 a month, while service will be faster for businesses.That is still 10 times faster than the existing phone-line connections here, and good enough for streaming video on a service like Netflix. The companies said they planned to offer faster speeds if demand warrants doing so.People here are already thinking that the new broadband lines could transform the local economy.The one general store, the Native Store, will be able to order new supplies more easily. The phone association has installed computer terminals at City Hall to provide free internet service to the public. Point Hope\u2019s transportation director is building a conference center with Wi-Fi and web video conferencing above a bus garage to host state events. Artists are planning to sell native crafts and jewelry online.Last month, about 25 residents, including the mayor, gathered at City Hall and talked about how internet service could turn Point Hope, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in North America, into a tourist destination with a museum with interactive displays and a website. The village\u2019s small motel with 20 beds would offer Wi-Fi.\u201cThe trigger to all of this is lower-cost broadband that will bring a whole new economy and hope to places like Point Hope,\u201d said Jens Laipenieks, president of the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.Nome, a few hundred miles to the south and with 4,000 residents, offers a glimpse into Point Hope\u2019s future. Climate change, and broadband connections, have already altered education and commerce.With the warming of the Bering Sea, the Crystal Serenity cruise ship, 820 feet long and with a capacity of more than 1,000 passengers, has started to anchor offshore, bringing new tourism. The ship has only recently been able to navigate around the ice.If local politicians have their way, it will be only the beginning. They are lobbying the state to build a deep water port so that even larger cruise ships can dock in Nome. The officials have indicated Quintillion\u2019s broadband service improves its case to state officials, who want to make sure Coast Guard and tourist boats will have access to high-speed internet service.\u201cThe future is here and there is not anything changing that,\u201d said Richard Beneville, Nome\u2019s mayor, who also runs a tour company.Nome has had broadband internet service for years. The arrival of Quintillion\u2019s lines, which were turned on Dec. 1, will make the connections much faster.Like the changes that Point Hope is experiencing, the ones in Nome worry some residents. Austin Ahmasuk, a marine environmentalist who lives along the coast, is among them. He is concerned that the change will dilute some of the local culture and result in harm to the environment.\u201cThe very thing that kept most global development away from the north \u2014 ice \u2014 is disappearing in all its formats,\u201d Mr. Ahmasuk said. \u201cHistory shows that outside people don\u2019t have the same interest in our culture and environment.\u201dBut residents here are mostly embracing having a stronger connection with the rest of the world.Early on a weekday evening, Bryan and Maggie Muktoyuk organized more than a dozen people at the Lutheran Church on Bering Street for a weekly rehearsal of native dance and drums.Seated in a row, men and teenage boys pounded on round drums made of stretched walrus stomach. Women with mittens and ornate mukluk boots swayed their hips to the beat.Ms. Muktoyuk held up her iPhone and, with a Wi-Fi connection, started to stream a video of the rehearsal on Facebook. Mr. Muktoyuk had set up a group page on the social network for other native dancers around the Alaska\u2019s North Slope region.A line of men took to the community room\u2019s floor, pounded their feet and shouted as they reached toward the sky. They were learning a new dance that Mr. Muktoyuk had choreographed, inspired by an exhausting whale hunt he had participated in months earlier in Wainwright, near Point Hope.\u201cMake sure you get this,\u201d he said to Ms. Muktoyuk.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Federal Government\u2019s Strange Silence About Gun Crimes", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "It rarely informs the local police or victims of abuse when a past abuser illegally tries to buy a gun.Last year, at least 117,407 Americans who were barred by law from buying a gun nevertheless tried to purchase one from a licensed dealer. These people had been convicted of domestic violence, another violent crime or a drug offense; had been committed to a mental hospital or found to be mentally unfit; or met other criteria that would have gotten them flagged in the national database used for instant background checks.For the A.T.F., running down every lead is simply not a priority \u2014 nor, probably, is it feasible. The Justice Department could help, by setting national guidelines to prosecute more of these cases. Former A.T.F. personnel say the agency will put resources only toward cases that it\u2019s confident the Department of Justice will prosecute, which isn\u2019t many right now. But this information matters a great deal to state and local law enforcement agencies, and the federal law should require that the F.B.I. also send it directly to them. If someone is motivated enough to lie to a licensed gun store, it stands to reason the person will be motivated enough to obtain a weapon by some other means.One of the last times Ms. Weaver saw her fianc\u00e9, he shot her in the face. Should he try to buy a gun after his release from prison in California, scheduled for 2019, she wants to know about it. \u201cIt would be the surest way to predict what he was going to do next,\u201d Ms. Weaver said.This is how it should work everywhere.For victims of domestic abuse, Washington\u2019s law is vital. \u201cThis is no longer just \u2018my abuser is out walking around,\u2019\u201d said Drew Hansen, a Washington state representative who championed the law. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018my abuser has taken active steps to make him or herself more dangerous, probably to me.\u2019\u201d If local law enforcement officials have that information, and pass it along, victims can take action.The National Rifle Association rarely opposes these state laws, at least openly, because they are meant to help enforce laws already in place. In 2014, Virginia arrested more than 500 criminals who had attempted to purchase weapons illegally, according to figures cited by Representatives Quigley and Meehan. In 2013, failed background checks in Pennsylvania led to 620 investigations, 346 arrests and more than 200 convictions.It\u2019s a call that no one ever wants to receive, but it surely saves lives.Advertisement"}

We were sitting together on his mother\u2019s couch near her Christmas tree earlier this month and I had just played him a short recording of the president of Fort Smith\u2019s Al Salam mosque.But the story, as it turned out, wasn\u2019t over yet.Despite the mosque\u2019s best efforts, Abraham ended up with a felony. He was also saddled with around $3,200 in fines and restitution. A reader of my article \u2014 a generous mother in Florida whose son had once made a similar mistake \u2014 sent a contribution. But most of the debt still remained to be paid. It was one of his life\u2019s daily stresses: If he stopped making monthly payments, he could end up in prison for six years.The last time I had seen Abraham was in the blistering heat of July, and he was dutifully showing up for his community service at a Goodwill store. But he didn\u2019t have a paying job, and everything seemed tenuous.Five months later, that worry was wiped away, when Hisham Yasin, the mosque\u2019s lively social director, climbed the stairs of the courthouse with a cashier\u2019s check. That was what had left Abraham speechless next to the Christmas tree.\u201cThere\u2019s no words,\u201d he said, his hands covering his face. \u201cEnglish. Find it.\u201dSome weeks back, Hisham had called me to say that the mosque had received a generous donation from the Jay Pritzker Foundation. No one at Al Salam had ever heard of the foundation, and they thought at first that it was a rip-off scheme \u2014 one of those send-me-your-bank-account-number-and-we\u2019ll-send-you-a-million-dollars ruses. A bit of Googling told them otherwise. Now they wanted to spread the good will: They had decided to pay off Abraham\u2019s court fines.Abraham\u2019s life had come crashing into theirs. They were now linked. They could not leave him behind.\u201cHe is part of our story,\u201d said Hisham, who owns A&H Auto Sales, a used-car dealership in town.I returned to Fort Smith to write the next chapter of their story. I also gave a talk at the University of Arkansas there. Abraham didn\u2019t come. His lawyer, Ernie Woodard, didn\u2019t think it was a good idea (his plea agreement forbade any contact with people from the mosque). But Abraham\u2019s mother, Kristin Collins, and the mosque\u2019s president, Dr. Louay Nassri, sat next to me onstage.It was a happy occasion. The town was now decked out in Christmas finery. My article had run so there was no longer a question of what I was up to. Hisham admitted that, for a while, he thought I was an F.B.I. agent. The New York Times business card didn\u2019t fool him.\u201cI can print you a thousand business cards that say, \u2018I\u2019m the pope,\u2019 \u201d he said.The article appeared shortly after Abraham\u2019s family had received an eviction notice. Donations from readers helped them pay the security deposit and first month\u2019s rent on a new place, and get some used furniture and a bed for their 5-year-old. Someone from Texas paid off their electric bill. Abraham was able to buy a bicycle. That meant he could get to work on his own.Hisham said the article had put Fort Smith on the map. One of the photographs we ran featured a sign for his car lot. He got calls from Atlanta, Cincinnati and Riverside, Calif. At first he thought they were telemarketers, but then he realized they were well-wishers. Dr. Nassri got calls from London and Switzerland.The article seemed to satisfy a deep craving for something healthy after months of gorging on outrage. At a time when each side of the political divide seemed sure the other side was crazy and maybe even evil, it was an antidote. It helped people see that Americans are much more moderate than Twitter and Facebook would have us believe, that we actually have a lot in common, and that our mutual capacity for tolerance and kindness is quite large.\u201cYou wove the lives of 2 men and their community in a way that for the first time I don\u2019t feel like everyday I have to fight or be militant & absolute about good & evil, right & wrong,\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter. \u201cThank you for that peace.\u201dA reader in Oregon said the story \u201cgives me something to hold onto, an amulet, a prayer bead.\u201d A woman named Linda Brown said the story was \u201ca reminder that most Americans aren\u2019t the caricatures we are presented with over and over.\u201dAbraham was stunned. He expected to be mocked. Instead he was praised. This flew in the face of his assumption that he didn\u2019t have the right to take up space on this earth. He had been written off \u2014 by school, by society, by the world of educated adults \u2014 but here were complete strangers telling him he mattered.\u201cIt just kind of blew me away to have people messaging me from all over the world,\u201d he recalled, \u201csaying, \u2018Hey, I read the piece about you. I want to tell you it inspired me.\u2019\u201dAbraham now works six days a week at the Hydration Station, a gas station and convenience store a few miles from his house. He seems to enjoy it \u2014 there\u2019s a certain satisfaction in stacking the boxes of beer in even rows and restocking the coolers. He banters with the customers: It\u2019s cold out there tonight. Breath mints? Can never have too many.On the couch, Abraham started to get his words back.\u201cIt\u2019s a great weight being lifted off of my shoulders,\u201d he said, looking at the floor. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t deserve it, but this act of kindness, it\u2019s just, wow.\u201dSo many people want so much for Abraham. Someone from the university called telling him to get in touch when he was ready to enroll. I realized I was rooting for him, too. I wanted him to finish high school.He had started taking classes toward his GED over the summer. But at some point he stopped. When I asked him about it, he offered a vague excuse. Maybe he didn\u2019t see the use. He was happy in his job. And as he\u2019d said to me before, he never saw himself as a college guy.But the news from the mosque seemed to unlock something.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because I was thinking of a lot of things,\u201d he said, \u201cand going back to school was one of them. It\u2019s like a whole new window just opened up. It\u2019s like somebody who has been locked in a padded room and has never felt the wind before. I\u2019m just in awe of this moment right now.\u201dHe sat back and looked at me intently.\u201cI want to say I regret what I did, but at the same time I don\u2019t,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a flower just sitting there waiting for the right drop of water to tap its petals.

{"Headline": "European Far-Right Leaders, Meeting to Condemn the E.U., Are Greeted With Boos", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRAGUE \u2014 As European far-right leaders gathered in Prague on Saturday for a two-day conference to unify their stance on immigration and other issues, they were met by throngs of protesters who booed, shouted \u201cShame\u201d and denounced populism and xenophobia.The members of the European Parliament, including Marine Le Pen of France and Geert Wilders of the Netherlands, met as part of the nationalist Europe of Nations and Freedom coalition at a heavily fortified hotel just outside the city center in the Czech Republic, which has seen a rise in far-right politics and nationalist rhetoric.At a news conference, Mr. Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom, called on the European Union to adopt more restrictive immigration policies and said the conference would serve to usher in a new era of cooperation among like-minded parties.\u201cIn 30 or 50 years, the Czech Republic will be surrounded by countries with population where 20 percent of people will be Muslims.\u201d Mr. Wilders said. \u201cThat is as if the Czech Republic became a Gaza Strip. We need to prevent mass migration even if we should build a wall.\u201dThe conference was hosted by the anti-Islam and anti-immigrant Freedom and Direct Democracy party, known as the SPD. The party emerged as a major force in Czech parliamentary elections in October, winning nearly 11 percent of the vote.Tomio Okamura, the Czech-Japanese leader of the SPD, said the gathering on Saturday was to demand a reformed European Union based on the tightest possible cooperation of sovereign nations, guided by mutual benefits without any dictate from Brussels, while maintaining free movement of people, goods, capital and services.\u201cEurope should not be a denationalized state directed by bureaucrats in Brussels,\u201d Mr. Okamura said. He added that he believed Europe was threatened by the degradation of traditional values and the suppression of patriotism.During the news conference, Mr. Okamura, Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Wilders accused the bloc of destroying the sovereignty of member states by adopting a mandatory quota for asylum seekers from the Middle East.\u201cBecause we like Europe, we say that the E.U. is going to kill her,\u201d said Ms. Le Pen, president of the National Front and a former French presidential candidate. \u201cWe are patriots; we defend our sovereignty,\u201d she added.The Muslim community in the Czech Republic is between 5,000 and 20,000, or less than 0.2 percent of the total population. So far, the country has taken in just 12 asylum seekers as part of the European Union quota. The bloc plans to take the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to court for failing to accommodate their fair share of refugees under a plan agreed to by the 28-country body.Mr. Wilders said he hoped the Czech capital would keep its doors closed to migrants.As in neighboring Poland and Hungary, anti-immigrant and anti-establishment rhetoric has become a mainstay in politics in the Czech Republic, helping the eccentric billionaire and Euro-skeptic Andrej Babis to become prime minister in the last elections.While he is also staunchly against the European Union\u2019s migrant quotas, he pledged during his campaign not to cooperate with the far-right groups. But since taking office this past week without a majority in Parliament to rule outright, he has shown a willingness to work with Mr. Okamura and his SPD party on a quid pro quo basis.Several leftist groups that opposed the meeting in Prague organized protests on Friday and Saturday in the center of the capital and on the outskirts of city, where the conference took place. About 400 people gathered Saturday outside the news conference, chanting, whistling and booing far-right supporters as they entered the compound, guarded by security and police officers.\u201cIn the Czech Republic, there is an increasing number of attacks against minorities due to the policies of the Czech SPD party,\u201d said Jan Cemper, the protests\u2019 organizer. \u201cAt the same time, we want to show that such congresses of xenophobes and populists are not welcomed here.\u201dFedor Gal, a former dissident and a public figure in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, referring to extreme right politicians, said, \u201cThose are people that do not care for a dialogue, and they do not deserve our tolerance.\u201dCzech politicians condemned the conference. Jiri Pospisil, chairman of TOP 09, a center-right party, wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cExtremists that threaten the interests of both the Czech Republic and Europe gather in Prague. They want to leave the EU and NATO and bring us close to Russia of Vladimir Putin. What a shame that the host is vice chairman of the Czech parliament.\u201dSecurity measures were tight for the far-right politicians, particularly Mr. Wilders, who has faced threats. No violence was reported, however, and the police did not intervene in the demonstrations.Though no public agenda for the conference was made public, the group introduced the Belgian right-wing politician Gerolf Annemans as the Europe of Nations and Freedom\u2019s new president and visited the Czech Parliament on a guided tour.Also expected at the conference were Janice Atkinson, an independent member of the European Parliament who was expelled from Britain\u2019s populist U.K.I.P. party two years ago amid a financing scandal; and Marcus Pretzell, a German member of the European Parliament formerly with the Alternative for Germany party, known as the AfD.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Muslims in the Czech Republic. Muslims make up less than 0.2 percent of the country\u2019s population, not less than 0.02 percent.Advertisement"}

Poroshenko, had been seized late Friday by police officers in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, and placed in a pretrial detention center.Scores of Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s supporters gathered overnight outside the detention center, which is operated by the domestic security agency, and chanted \u201cglory to Ukraine\u201d and other slogans. Vowing to stay until Mr. Saakashvili was released, they lit fires in the street to keep warm, just as protesters did in the winter of 2013-14 during an ultimately successful campaign to oust Ukraine\u2019s previous president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.A few hours before he was detained, Mr. Saakashvili had called for weekend protests against Mr. Poroshenko in Independence Square, an area in Kiev known as Maidan that was the center of the earlier demonstrations against Mr. Yanukovych.Mr. Saakashvili has not yet been formally charged. Mr. Lutsenko, the prosecutor general, this week accused him of receiving $500,000 for his political activities from a fugitive Ukrainian businessman close to Mr. Yanukovych, who has lived in exile in Russia since his ouster.Mr. Saakashvili, who is also wanted in Georgia on fraud charges, denied Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s accusations, calling them lies created to remove him as a rival to Mr. Poroshenko, a former ally turned bitter political enemy.David Sakvarelidze, a longtime supporter of Mr. Saakashvili, told the newspaper Ukraina Pravada that the former Georgian president had been detained in Kiev while hiding at the home of a friend. Local news media outlets identified the friend as Yuriy Pokinboroda, a police officer who was formerly the chief in Luhansk, an eastern region of Ukraine now occupied by pro-Russian rebels.Mr. Saakashvili, who ruled Georgia for nearly a decade, moved to Ukraine and was given Ukrainian citizenship after Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s removal. He initially voiced strong support for Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s successor, Mr. Poroshenko, who appointed him governor of Odessa, a notoriously corrupt region on the Black Sea.Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s detention ends an increasingly bizarre game of cat and mouse between Ukrainian law enforcement agencies loyal to Mr. Poroshenko and to Mr. Saakashvili.Mr. Saakashvili was detained briefly on Tuesday after he climbed to the roof of an apartment building in Kiev and threatened to jump. He then escaped after hundreds of his supporters blocked a van that was to take him to a detention center.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Losing Her Religion", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Modern Orthodox Judaism \u2014 a loosely defined sect that adheres to the strictures of Jewish Scripture, while engaging with the broader world, intellectually and economically \u2014 has always been something of a paradox: It embraces modernity and, at the same time, lives by the dictums of an ancient system. Tova Mirvis\u2019s memoir, \u201cThe Book of Separation,\u201d chronicles this paradox, and many others, in an intimate tale of leaving a community that served as the literary inspiration for her first two novels, and the bulwark of her life.Mirvis\u2019s story is less stark than recent memoirs of leaving ultra-Orthodox sects; Modern Orthodoxy, by definition, allows more mingling with the outside world. Nonetheless, her narrative is one of deep heartache, both in the predeparture attempt to quiet her own objections to the faith, and in the self-willed abandonment of certainty that departure requires. Early in the book, Mirvis writes about a childhood objection to the biblical verse that commanded Adam to rule over Eve; her mother quieted her objections with alternative explanations. Mirvis muses about the contradictions she felt: \u201cThe text couldn\u2019t be wrong; the rabbis couldn\u2019t be wrong. If sexism was wrong, the text couldn\u2019t be sexist. \u2026 The laws couldn\u2019t change, the words couldn\u2019t change \u2014 nothing, in fact, could change \u2014 yet you could turn the words, reframe them, and reshape them, do anything so that you could still fit inside.\u201dThe struggle to fit inside takes up much of the book, which skips from the aftermath of Mirvis\u2019s divorce from her husband and her faith back to the genesis of that faith, and of her marriage. Mirvis\u2019s tale is one of privilege \u2014 a prosperous Memphis upbringing, college at Columbia, graduate school in creative writing \u2014 run through with a red thread of anguish. In many ways, to those of Modern Orthodox background, it is a deeply familiar story: She attended an Orthodox school, studied Jewish texts for a year in Israel, got engaged at 22 to an Orthodox man after 12 weeks of dating and lived under the watchful eye of a tight-knit, conformist community. (A Jewish marriage manual she read during her engagement had a chapter entitled \u201cThoughts to Banish.\u201d \u201cI wanted to scream,\u201d Mirvis writes.) The choking tangle of laws that dictate how to handle everything, from dishware to vaginal discharge, was stifling. Orthodox Judaism, unlike other forms of American fundamentalism, largely avoids the question of belief; steadfast, granular obedience to the 613 commandments of the Torah, and the embrace of the community, preclude the question. The journey toward leaving is a slow awakening to her own suffering, and then a sudden leap to cut its bonds.The most powerful parts of the memoir are those in which Mirvis struggles against a belief system and community that demand rigid adherence and punish refusals to conform. Her steps to freedom are minute at first: engaging in a ritual bath of purification in a lake, and not a mikvah; declining to self-censor at an Orthodox Forum discussion of the role of art. \u201cIn this freedom, there are no preordained questions, no easy answers, no ready definitions,\u201d she writes. \u201cYou leave and you leave again.\u201d Her first willful transgression is checking email and Facebook on her phone, locked in the bathroom, on a Friday night.Yet for all the earned drama of that transgression, the present-day moments of the memoir \u2014 her post-divorce courtship with a secular Jewish lover, a rendezvous in Costa Rica \u2014 feel comparatively saccharine and unsatisfying, making the memoir\u2019s scattershot, nonchronological structure frustrating. She eats nonkosher cheese pizza; she dances at a yoga class. A repeated motif throughout is a Hasidic story, in which a rabbi cautions a would-be heretic student that he can never truly enjoy the forbidden pleasures in which he partakes. Yet the comparative banality of Mirvis\u2019s post-religious life reminds me of another Jewish aphorism: \u201cIf you are going to eat pork,\u201d as the Yiddish proverb goes, \u201clet the juices run down your beard.\u201dTalia Lavin is on the editorial staff of The New Yorker.Advertisement"}

It is a much better memory than the wildfire smoke that will forever be imprinted in my memory.It is made of the salamino grape, one of several used for Lambrusco. In the hands of Mr. Saetti, who farms organically, the wine is dry, earthy and meaty \u2014 not complex \u2014 and extraordinarily delicious. I\u2019ve had it maybe a half-dozen times in 2017, and always I am shocked by how much I love it.This wine, by the way, is made without any sulfur dioxide, the common stabilizer shunned by many natural wine producers. I have never had a flawed bottle. The salamino grape takes its name from its elongated shape, which resembles a small salami, another thing about the wine that makes me happy.His aligot\u00e9s are exceptional, but even he does not expect too much of them. They are meant to be unpretentious. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in that,\u201d Mr. Roulot told me. The 2007, at 10 years old, was rich, deep and still fresh, with savory, salty flavors. \u201cIt\u2019s less recognizable as aligot\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Roulot said.When a wine no longer tastes like a grape and tastes like a place instead, that is memorable.The reds are powerfully tannic, high in acid and low in alcohol, just about 12.5 percent. They must mellow for years before they can be sold. The current vintage on the market is 2008. I drank a bottle from the local cooperative, the Adega Regional de Colares, with the winemaker, Francisco Figueiredo. It was savory and spicy, with an almost balsamic character, structured yet graceful. There is no other wine like it.\u201cWe like to hunt, we like mushrooms, we like a glass of wine,\u201d Mr. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry said, speaking to traditions that have sustained P\u00e9charmant for centuries.In Madeira years, this was a baby. It will live for decades, if not centuries. It was already thrilling, striking a delicate equilibrium of sweetness and acidity, complexity and sheer refreshment. Wines like this are inspiring, giving birth to ideas and relationships. Unforgettable.The wines of Beaune are often among the most overlooked of Burgundies, and therefore can be relatively good values. This one was honest, old-fashioned, a bit rustic and delicious, a reminder of the days before billionaires started to buy grand cru vineyards, when the top wines were still affordable.I am not saying this Burgundy was better, nor did it diminish my reverence for the great wines. Still, it was refreshing in every sense and offered a useful moment of clarity.A bottle of grand cru Burgundy like this one is always a privilege to drink, especially one from a great producer at a peak moment. It was beautifully focused and precise, still young, with aromas and flavors that flowed in a linear, lasting progression. It smelled of exotic red fruits. On the palate the fruit gave way to a stony minerality that is often characteristic of the vineyard \u2014 \u201cpure rock,\u201d I wrote at the time.I cannot remember a wine that so captured the magical Burgundian formula of weightless intensity. This wine was ethereal \u2014 very much in keeping with the elegant style of Mugnier \u2014 yet powerfully deep, resonating long after swallowing. I still feel the echo today.It used to be widely planted in the vineyards of Barolo and Barbaresco. Today, it is mostly gone, though patches remain here and there. It made a pale-colored wine that, though gorgeously perfumed, was out of fashion in an era in which powerful, dark wines were prized.This producer no longer exists. The Podere del Pajor\u00e8 vineyard is now owned by Angelo Gaja, who \u2014 in Ian D\u2019Agata\u2019s book \u201cNative Wine Grapes of Italy\u201d \u2014 dismisses the notion that the vineyard ever contained nebbiolo ros\u00e9. So we do not know for sure whether this wine was nebbiolo ros\u00e9. But it certainly was good.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Dowdy Celtics Are Trying to Wear Supreme", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro BasketballBOSTON \u2014 You may long for the old Boston Garden and its parquet floor shot through with dead spots. You may miss the short shorts of John Havlicek and Larry Bird. But the championship banners \u2014 all 17 of them \u2014 are still here in this newer arena called TD Garden, and they tell the story of one of the most iconic franchises in sports.But I didn\u2019t come for history.Instead, I wanted to know how the N.B.A. has become the Netflix of sports properties, a league whose players are helping transform the way sports are being bought, sold and consumed in much the same way the streaming services have changed entertainment.Yet even the hidebound Celtics are trying to jump on board.\u201cOn the surface, we are a traditional old-school brand,\u201d said Rich Gotham, the Celtics\u2019 president, \u201cbut underneath we are quite evolved.\u201dThe team\u2019s ownership group, led by chairman Wyc Grousbeck, is composed of private-equity veterans. Fifteen years ago, the group bought the Celtics for $360 million, a bargain. They not only wanted to hang another championship banner here \u2014 the last had come in 1986 \u2014 but also sought to unlock the value in what had become a moribund franchise.Enter Gotham, a tech executive, charged with identifying the team\u2019s consumers and making it easy for them to fall in love again with the Celtics. It helped that money guys and tech evangelists were becoming part of other N.B.A. franchises as well as the league\u2019s front office.Both here in Boston, and around the league, executives came to the conclusion that their most valuable asset was a generation of basketball players who were bigger, faster and more talented than those who came before. Players who also cared deeply about how they dressed, what music they listened to and what was going on in the world.Even better, these players had come of age with smartphones and social media and were eager to broadcast their tastes and opinions to whoever was listening.\u201cWe have thoughtful, socially conscious and digitally savvy players,\u201d Gotham said. \u201cAll we needed to do is turn them loose.\u201dImagine hearing that from the Patriots owner Robert Kraft across town, or Jerry Jones in Dallas, or any N.F.L. executive.No one in the N.B.A.\u2019s league office flinches when LeBron James wears one black and one white shoe with the word \u201cequality\u201d written on them, as he did on Sunday in a game against the Washington Wizards in the shadow of the White House. He then posted a photograph of them on Instagram, which quickly garnered more than one million likes.This partnership has not only given voice and weight to different points of view, but it has also helped drive interest in N.B.A. players off the court.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember how black-dominated the N.B.A. is as a sport, and as a result you are getting viewpoints on civil rights and equality that you don\u2019t necessarily hear all the time,\u201d said Ramesh Srinivasan, a U.C.L.A professor and a scholar of technology, politics and society. \u201cThe league knows it can\u2019t stop these athletes, so instead they have embraced them and provided a bigger megaphone.\u201dThis is the same N.B.A. that in the late 1970s and early 1980s worried that it was losing popularity because it was too black. This is the same N.B.A. that in 2005 instituted a dress code to distance itself from hip-hop culture.Now Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper are courtside fixtures as well the source of the music blasted out of arena sound systems.Of the hundreds of millions of N.B.A. fans, 46 percent are under the age of 35, according to Gotham. Each morning, my soon-to-be-13-year-old-son watches the previous night\u2019s highlights on Snapchat. He heads to YouTube, where compilation videos of each basket can turn a two-hour game into 20 minutes.The players have, for the most part, used their elevated platforms judiciously and joyfully. James has attracted 96.6 million followers across all platforms by posting lighthearted fare, like his team\u2019s New York subway videos, to go with his social commentary.Irving has cracked the N.B.A.\u2019s top 10 with an active Instagram (11 million) feed and a knack for viral gestures, such as giving away his jersey and shoes to a pair of United States servicewomen in Brooklyn last month after a game against the Nets. He also knows social media helps move merchandise: He unveiled his Kyrie 4s with a video urging his fans to continue exploring their best selves.One of his teammates, Jaylen Brown, posted on Twitter a video of himself jumping out of his car and dunking on unsuspecting pickup players in one of this year\u2019s social-media fads, the Drive-By Dunk Challenge. Both Irving, 25, and Brown, 21, may be still finding their voice, but there is no doubt that there is an audience eager to hear them.\u201cWe are reaching a generation that doesn\u2019t see the same cultural barriers to the game that we once did,\u201d Gotham said.When one of the oldest and most accomplished franchises like the Celtics can trust its players with messages as far-reaching as the platforms, it\u2019s good for business today and will be even better for the N.B.A. tomorrow.Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @JoeDrapeAdvertisement"}

They might have unsteady tables and bony chairs, set too close together, and doors that don\u2019t shut properly, letting in every hiss of wind. They might keep erratic hours, close early without warning and never answer the phone. A dish might touch heaven on one visit and fall to earth the next.Everywhere I went, I was welcomed, and made to feel that this was my part of the city, too.Below, in descending order, are the places that taught me the most in 2017.This is the world, in a sprawl of stalls. No food hall or open-air food market in New York can match it: not its breadth, generosity or giddy sense of revelation. On any given night, you may find Malaysian burgers warm with curry, sheathed in a half-scramble of egg; Bolivian beef-heart skewers, all smoky tenderness; Persian tahdig, rice scraped nearly burnt from the bottom of the pot (the best part); Nigerian jollof rice under luxurious efo (spinach stew), shining plantains and pepper chicken; and my favorite, kue pancong, Indonesian coconut cakes shaped like moons with dark seas of hand-torched palm sugar.John Wang, the Texas-born son of Taiwanese immigrants, founded the market in 2015 with a mission to find vendors \u201cfrom every country represented\u201d in the city. His most important directive: No dish can cost over $6, with almost all $5 or less. They\u2019re snacks, not entrees, which means you can eat more of them.All the stars must align to lead you to Warung Selasa, which is open only one day a week (Selasa, or Tuesday), from 1 to 8 p.m., and hidden in the back of an Indonesian grocery. Warung is the word for the ramshackle food spots tucked under tarps along Indonesia\u2019s roadsides, and this one is almost as rudimentary, with a lone table leaning against a freezer.There, the chef, Anastasia Dewi Tjahjadi, might take a seat across from you, reminisce about her youth in Surabaya in East Java and give you a gentle schooling in the complexities of Indonesian cooking. Each Tuesday\u2019s menu consists of a single dish, an ever-changing collage of sour, salt, sweet and forthright funk, accompanied by sambal with enough heat to crack the mind open.Warung Selasa at Indo Java, 8512 Queens Boulevard (Grand Avenue), Elmhurst, Queens; 718-779-2241; no website.\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone\u201d is Mei Lee\u2019s hushed admonition to customers at her modest restaurant, which follows its own rules and measures of time, and might not be able (or willing) to accommodate hordes of new fans. Nevertheless, Ms. Lee deserves them, for her sincere renditions of Taiwanese xiao chi (small eats), such as lion\u2019s head meatballs, shaggy giants softened up by hours of braising until they practically shrug themselves apart, and an omelet seasoned by nothing but preserved turnip, its salt delicate but insistent, like a whisper.Ms. Lee, who has family roots in northern China, grew up in South Korea; Taiwanese is her adopted cuisine, learned at college in Taipei, where she met her husband. Every night he stops by the restaurant to help her clean up, and then, she said, \u201cWe close the door and walk home together.\u201dMama Lee, 213-12 48th Avenue (Bell Boulevard), Bayside, Queens; 718-767-8680, no website.This onetime fish-and-chips shop, freed of its bulletproof fiberglass, is still geared primarily for takeout, with no restroom for customers and only a couple of high tables. But there\u2019s a distinct artistry to the Filipino dishes (none over $12), presented in compostable bowls lined with banana leaves.The chef, Aniceto Re\u00f1a Jr. (known as J.R.), came to the United States at age 11 from Cebu City in the Philippines. After stints in high-end kitchens, he\u2019s returned to the food of his heritage, approaching it at a slant:\u00a0A\u00a0Filipino snack of Campbell\u2019s cream of mushroom soup poured over beef tongue is transformed by a foam of cold-smoked mushroom stock, and pancit (noodles) come buried under shorn leaves of brussels sprouts, curling garlic scapes and a flurry of cured yolk.Long before Filipino food entered the American mainstream, Filipino restaurants were quietly thriving in enclaves around the country. In 2006, Mario Albenio (known as Boyet), a native of Tacurong on the southern island of Mindanao, opened Tito Rad\u2019s a few blocks shy of Little Manila in Woodside, Queens.His menu offers unabashed comfort, in grand boomerangs of tuna jaw leaking smoke from the grill; taro leaves soused on coconut milk; bitter melon, bracing and uncompromised; and goat unshackling its muscles after a simmer with green olives and liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. Raucous birthday parties occasionally overrun the back room, passing slices of cake to surrounding tables; refuse at your own risk.At a counter in the back of a cramped bodega, the faithful gather for the dispensing of coct\u00e9l de mariscos, shrimp and octopus boiled with salt and submerged in a luminous red liquid that is only partly explained as crushed tomatoes, onions, clam juice and lime. (The rest is secret.)Pedro Rodriguez, the chef, left Mexico City nearly three decades ago to make a life in the United States, working as a painter and carpenter before setting up a sidewalk stand in 2012 to sell his seafood tonics. He has since moved indoors (although the stand reappears on weekends), where diners perch on benches, crumbling saltines into their cocktails and squeezing imposing bottles of Valentina hot sauce. The menu has grown to encompass tacos, bright lime-slaked ceviche and empanadas with seams cautiously pried open after frying, so that crescents of fresh avocado can be slipped in.Some may find the pho too strong, in which case there are supernally buoyant spring rolls, crackly and chewy at once; bun cha with charred meatballs wrapped in betel leaves, their smoke possessing the broth; and bo luc lac, filet mignon under a gloss of honey, soy and butter, sweet and salt setting aside their differences and making peace.Margarita Brito has been cooking \u201call her life,\u201d she said \u2014 and for the public since 1992, when she and her mother, Reyna Prospero, also called Margarita, stationed a Dominican food truck across the street from P.S. 130 in the Bronx. After Ms. Prospero died in the 2001 crash of American Airlines Flight 587, on her way home to Santo Domingo, Ms. Brito kept the truck alive in her memory.Now, at this bare-bones, mostly takeout shop, she continues to feed the neighborhood alcapurrias, dark fritters of mashed green bananas and plantains, with eggshell-fine crusts and a chewy underlay yielding to cloudlike interiors; and pastelillos, empanadas in full surrender to butter, the dough flaking as if ready to snow. Newer offerings include alb\u00f3ndigas, meatballs turned luscious in a stew of tomatoes and sofrito, and nubs of pork burnished and worthy of trading like coins, alongside tostones that rank among the city\u2019s best.Margarita\u2019s, 915 Avenue Saint John (Prospect Avenue), Longwood, the Bronx; 347-270-5541; no website.Playground was once a karaoke bar, and even at an early hour, the black-and-red dining room still has a slouchy, late-night feel. The chef, Sudarat Yingyong, known as Sue, cooked alongside her husband, Sompoch Siribongkoch, until he died three years ago. She was born in Bangkok but her family comes from the Isan region of northeastern Thailand, which is the menu\u2019s beating heart.Nothing is understated, nothing held back. Dishes might come strewn with staunchly funky bamboo shoots, black yolks of century eggs or raw red weaver-ant larvae, a delicacy in Thailand, where prices for the grubs sometimes outstrip those of pork and beef.

Chicken roast is not roasted but left to seethe quietly in a pan of sweet-hot masala. The crunch of tiny bones is shutki, sun-dried fish, broken down just enough to turn fluffy.

She knew it, and so did her friends and family. Her ex-boyfriend, Jaraun Render, the father of two of her three children, had threatened her, punched her in the face and dragged her around by her hair.On Nov. 14, Mr. Render allegedly took his 9-millimeter handgun and shot Ms. Jamerson 12 times at close range and wounded her friend as they sat parked at a convenience store in Muskegon, Mich. He absconded with Ms. Jamerson\u2019s children but was captured after a 43-hour manhunt. He\u2019s now in jail awaiting trial, and Ms. Jamerson is recovering from her wounds.A victim under a protective order is left to hope that her predator is a good rule follower. About half of the time, the order is violated.A better solution? Extend to temporary restraining orders the federal prohibitions on having or buying firearms that already apply to people under permanent restraining orders. There are few more consequential actions for Congress and the courts than removing a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights, especially without a criminal conviction. When safety is involved, however, courts have approved certain temporary restrictions of a person\u2019s rights \u2014 to see one\u2019s family, to return to one\u2019s home. Limiting gun rights under temporary restraining orders is a sensible extension of those checks.Conditions would apply: A judge or magistrate would have to review a victim\u2019s testimony or an affidavit, or other evidence. Eleven states \u2014 including Texas, North Carolina and New York \u2014 already bar people under temporary restraining orders from having or buying guns. Ten more states empower a judge to take that step.

{"Headline": "Confessions of a Digital Nazi Hunter", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLike many Jewish journalists who reported on Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, I spent the 2016 election being harassed by a motley crew of internet racists who coalesced around the future president. They sent me threats, photoshopped me into gas chambers and hurled an uncreative array of anti-Semitic slurs my way. A study by the Anti-Defamation League found that I\u2019d received the second-most abuse of any Jewish journalist on Twitter during the campaign cycle. My parents didn\u2019t raise me to be No. 2; fortunately, there\u2019s always 2020.As a result, I\u2019ve become something of an unintentional expert on alt-right trolls and their tactics. For the most part, these characters are largely laughable \u2014 sad, angry men hiding behind images of cartoon frogs, deathly afraid that their employers will uncover their online antics. But there are also more insidious individuals, whose digital skulduggery can be more consequential than the occasional bigoted bromide.And so last November, in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, I decided to turn the tables on them. My target? Impersonator trolls.You probably haven\u2019t heard of these trolls, but that is precisely why they are so pernicious. These bigots are not content to harass Jews and other minorities on Twitter; they seek to assume their identities and then defame them.The con goes like this: The impersonator lifts an online photo of a Jew, Muslim, African-American or other minority \u2014 typically one with clear identifying markers, like a yarmulke-clad Hasid or a woman in hijab. Using that picture as a Twitter avatar, the bigot then adds ethnic and progressive descriptors to the bio: \u201cJewish,\u201d \u201cZionist,\u201d \u201cMuslim,\u201d \u201cenemy of the alt-right.\u201dFalse identity forged, the trolls then insert themselves into conversations with high-profile Twitter users \u2014 conversations that are often seen by tens of thousands of followers \u2014 and proceed to say horrifically racist things.In this manner, unsuspecting readers glancing through their feed are given the impression that someone who looks like, say, a religious Jew or Muslim is outlandishly bigoted. Thus, an entire community is defamed.This deception is relatively simple, but it is disturbingly effective. Most casual users aren\u2019t likely to reverse image-search a troll\u2019s avatar to see if it was stolen from someone else or peruse the account\u2019s other tweets and realize that it only shares racist material. Twitter lacks the cultural competency to police such impersonators, even if it were interested in doing so.So I set out to unmask them.I asked my own Twitter followers whether it might be possible to create a bot that would reply to these impostors and expose their true nature to any users they tried to fool. Neal Chandra, a talented developer in San Francisco whom I\u2019ve never met, replied, \u201cI can try to throw something together this evening.\u201d And so, after a week of testing, Impostor Buster was born.Using a crowdsourced database of impersonator accounts, carefully curated by us to avoid any false positives, the bot patrolled Twitter and interjected whenever impostors tried to insinuate themselves into a discussion. Within days, our golem for the digital age had become a runaway success, garnering thousands of followers and numerous press write-ups. Most important, we received countless thank-yous from alerted would-be victims.The impersonator trolls seethed. Some tried changing their user names to evade the bot (it didn\u2019t work). Others simply reverted to their openly neo-Nazi personas. A few even tried to impersonate the bot, which was vastly preferable from our perspective and rather amusing.Then the problems began \u2014 but not from where you might expect. The Nazis realized they couldn\u2019t beat the bot, so they started mass-reporting it to Twitter for \u201charassment.\u201d Just as they duplicitously cast themselves as minorities, they disingenuously recast our response to their ongoing abuse as harassment.Twitter sided with the Nazis.In April, the service suspended Impostor Buster without explanation and reinstated it only after being contacted by the ADL\u2019s cyber-hate team. Over the next few months, we fine-tuned the bot to reduce its tweets and avoid tripping any of Twitter\u2019s alarms. As the trolls continued to report the bot to no avail, we thought the problem was resolved. But we were wrong.This month, Twitter suspended the bot again, and this time refused to revive it. The company\u2019s justifications were both entirely accurate and utterly absurd. \u201cA large number of people have blocked you in response to high volumes of untargeted, unsolicited, or duplicative content or engagements from your account,\u201d we were informed. This was true; Impostor Buster had been blocked by many neo-Nazis. \u201cA large number of spam complaints have been filed against you.\u201d Yes, by neo-Nazis. \u201cYou send large numbers of unsolicited replies or mentions.\u201d Yes, to neo-Nazis.The real threat, apparently, was not these trolls \u2014 who today continue to roam the platform unchallenged \u2014 but our effort to combat them.The great irony of this whole affair is that Impostor Buster was doing Twitter\u2019s job for it. The platform has been notoriously prone to abuse since its inception and has struggled to curb it. Rather than asking Twitter to provide a top-down solution, however, we created a bottom-up one. We used Twitter\u2019s tools to police itself \u2014 until Twitter fired the sheriff. If the platform is going to rescue itself from the trolls, it will need to foster these efforts, not fight them.Given the terabytes of data uploaded daily to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, it is simply unfeasible to expect them to effectively regulate their content. It is also unwise, because we should not trust giant corporations governed by profit motives rather than the public interest to decide what we can and cannot say on the internet.But perhaps more important, the top-down approach is wrong because it assumes that the problem of bigotry and abuse is something we can simply sweep under the rug through better censorship, rather than by building a better online community that actively sidelines bigots and abusers through self-policing and collective norms. Ultimately, the only way to fix social media is through nurturing a healthier culture below, not imposing diktats from above. The vast majority of users are not racists and can be mobilized through communal projects like Impostor Buster \u2014 a bot built by two people on different coasts using a database compiled by users around the world \u2014 to marginalize those who are.The problem with Twitter, in other words, wasn\u2019t too much Impostor Buster. It was too little. The sooner companies like Twitter understand this, the better off we\u2019ll be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Israeli Settler, a Dead Palestinian and the Crux of the Conflict", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQUSRA, West Bank \u2014 It started as a bar mitzvah hike through rocky, biblical terrain. It ended with a Palestinian man shot dead and 20 traumatized Israeli schoolchildren sheltering in a cave from Palestinian stone-throwers.The Palestinian man, Mahmoud Zaal, 48, was from Qusra in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and his widow has since added a sobriquet to his name: \u201cHabib al-Ard,\u201d Arabic for lover of the land.During a confrontation \u2014 how it started is a matter of dispute \u2014 Mr. Zaal was most likely shot by a parent escorting the school group, according to local residents, legal representatives and the Israeli authorities.This is the story of one Palestinian village and an adjacent settlement in the hills south of Nablus \u2014 formerly friendly communities now tinged with hostility and suspicion. The deterioration reflects the broader strife from a volatile mix of populations, 50 years of Israeli occupation and a competition over the same land that is only intensifying.The bar mitzvah party set out from the settlement of Migdalim on the morning of Nov. 30 to celebrate Avitzur Libman, 13, whose family moved there a few years ago. Most of his classmates came from other settlements nearby, like Yitzhar and Itamar. Two fathers accompanied them, armed with an M-16 rifle and a pistol. The father suspected of shooting Mr. Zaal is a senior officer in Israel\u2019s military reserves.Igal Kassus, a longtime resident of Migdalim, ran into the celebrants before they left and warned them to avoid Qusra. They said not to worry; they were heading to the hilltop outpost of Kida, through the valley and up the steep inclines dotted with olive groves.The area has also been the scene of horrific violence. Two Palestinians stabbed five members of a family to death in their beds in Itamar in 2011. Four years later, a deadly arson attack by Jewish extremists in the Palestinian village of Duma, visible from Mr. Zaal\u2019s land, killed a Palestinian toddler and his parents.Mr. Zaal had been waging his own, quiet campaign to defend his land. He had planted six acres with pistachio, fig, apricot, apple and olive trees, vines and berries for the birds. \u201cHe worked his land in an attempt to stop the settlers moving in,\u201d said Mahmoud Odeh, a cousin. \u201cHe turned the whole area into a paradise.\u201dThat November morning it was stained with his blood. There seems to be little doubt that Mr. Zaal was killed after the settler armed with the M-16 opened fire. The settlers have hailed that man as a hero, saying he fired into the air to save the children\u2019s lives as Palestinian youths pelted them with stones.Residents of Qusra, including Mr. Zaal\u2019s oldest son, Awad, 23, who was with him at the time, insist that the stone-throwing started only after Mr. Zaal had been shot.Both sides agree, more or less, on these facts: To protect the children, the two fathers pushed them into a cave. Palestinian youths blocked them from leaving, continued to throw stones at them, and robbed them of wallets, snacks and cellphones. Two older Palestinian men worked to calm the situation and prevent the violence from getting worse. Israeli soldiers arrived about 40 minutes later and extricated the group. The man suspected of shooting Mr. Zaal was treated at a hospital for a superficial head wound.The Israeli military\u2019s investigation concluded that the Palestinians had attacked the settlers first and that the escorts had opened fire in self-defense. It criticized the settlers for not coordinating their hike with the army in advance. The organizers said they had sent an email describing the route to the local command but had not received a reply.The Israeli police have also been investigating the escorts, as is routine in such cases, looking into whether the shooting was justified or whether they caused the death by negligence. The escorts were questioned but were not arrested. On Wednesday, the police said their investigation had so far backed up the settlers\u2019 version: that the Palestinians attacked first and that the hikers found themselves in a life-threatening situation.But Awad, Mr. Zaal\u2019s oldest son, said there was nothing random about the shooting and insisted that his father had posed no danger. Sitting by his grieving mother at home recently, he said his father had gone out to farm alone, but had called him at around 10 a.m. and asked him to come quickly because a settler was approaching.The settler, carrying an M-16, ordered them off the land, Awad said, but they refused. The settler shot once in the air, repeated his demand then fired once more, hitting his father in the upper body, Awad said, before fleeing downhill.\u201cI saw his face and I saw him pulling the trigger,\u201d Awad said. \u201cHe could have shot me instead of my father.\u201dMr. Zaal\u2019s widow, Manal, 46, is now seeking help to finish a house he had started building closer to their land. \u201cOur God will not forget,\u201d she said. Another son, Ahed, 18, said of the settlers: \u201cWe don\u2019t go there. They come to us.\u201dAdi Keidar, a Honenu lawyer representing the escorts, said Awad\u2019s version did not fit with any other testimony he had heard. Mr. Keidar suggested that because of the rough, steep incline of the land, it was hard to see what had been happening and where people had stood.\u201cIf they had panicked there would have been a disaster,\u201d he said of the parents. \u201cThey remained coolheaded.\u201d The children, he said, \u201csaw death before their eyes.\u201dEran Schwartz, a spokesman for Honenu from Yitzhar, and others briefed on the details of the episode, said the man suspected of shooting Mr. Zaal was unaware that he had hit anybody at the time.Qusra has since been seething with clashes between Palestinians, Israeli forces and settlers who have tried to revisit the cave. One of Mr. Zaal\u2019s cousins said with a hint of sarcasm that the settlers now considered the cave a holy site. The path below it is now planted with tiny olive saplings and strewn with bullet casings.One night the army raided Qusra and arrested 22 residents suspected of involvement in the recent disturbances. At dawn on Dec. 8 soldiers closed off the village while the settlers recreated the bar mitzvah hike as a \u201cpositive experience,\u201d accompanied by some right-wing politicians.This week the Israeli military announced that one of those arrested, Muhammad Wadi, was being charged with attempted murder after he hurled rocks at the head of one of the adults inside the cave.Qusra residents remember when things were different. Migdalim was established in the 1980s as a secular settlement, and residents would shop in Qusra, running up monthly tabs at the grocery store.Four years ago a group of religious, more nationalistic settlers moved into some empty houses there and quickly filled a new neighborhood of trailer homes. Migdalim has now doubled in size, from about 40 families to more than 80. The once-popular Balaclava pub, which used to operate over the Sabbath, has closed. A synagogue has been built.Amir Odeh, 19, one of two young men from Qusra who were shot and wounded during the recent skirmishes, was working on house renovations in Migdalim. He calls the original residents \u201cthe Jews\u201d and the newcomers \u201cthe settlers.\u201d\u201cAll the problems started since they came,\u201d he said.One of the religious newcomers, Rivka Harel, 34, who moved into a cramped trailer with her family three years ago, said she hoped the good relations with Qusra would continue.Mr. Kassus, 62, an artist and a building contractor who moved to this windy hilltop more than 20 years ago, employs workers from Qusra, speaks Arabic and maintains friendly relations with all the surrounding villages.\u201cI was na\u00efve,\u201d he said of when he first arrived. \u201cI thought it was a matter of talking to people and building trust.\u201dHaving become more religious a few years ago, Mr. Kassus has welcomed the influx of new families.But ultimately, he said, the newcomers\u2019 more radical outlook is that \u201cthe Arabs have plenty of places to go,\u201d and \u201call this land should be Jewish.\u201dRami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Spinach Lasagna Worthy of a Holiday Feast", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenSome pasta dishes are a breeze to make. Lasagna is not, and there is no getting around it. But it is absolutely worth the effort. Having a companion in the kitchen makes the process go much faster.That said, this particular lasagna can be achieved more quickly than some of the more elaborate and traditional ones made with a meaty Bolognese rag\u00f9 or tiny meatballs. My spinach lasagna is composed of Italian fennel sausage, wilted spinach, ricotta, b\u00e9chamel and Parmesan, which makes for a lighter, more digestible, but still quite luxurious rendition. (I fully expect comments calling this version inauthentic or even blasphemous, but it is delicious.) It is delicate but rich, best served in small portions.To make the pasta, I whiz raw spinach with eggs in a blender, then mix the bright green liquid with flour to make a soft, easily kneaded emerald-hued dough. As the dough rests, I whisk up a quick b\u00e9chamel sauce. It\u2019s important to season the b\u00e9chamel thoroughly with salt and pepper, nutmeg and a tiny pinch of cayenne. It must not be too thick, so be prepared to thin it with milk to the consistency of a milkshake (creamy, but still drinkable through a straw). Keep the sauce warm in a double boiler (it can be makeshift) so it doesn\u2019t thicken upon standing.You\u2019ll need a full two pounds of fresh spinach to produce bright, leaf-green pasta. If preferred, substitute chard or mustard greens. Combine the greens with ricotta and a bit of grated lemon zest.Next, roll the pasta dough into thin foot-long sheets. Dust the uncooked pasta sheets lightly with flour to keep them from sticking when stacked. (Of course, you may use store-bought fresh pasta sheets rather than make the pasta yourself, if desired.)You\u2019ll cook the pasta for only a minute, to keep it undercooked, then cool it in ice water and blot on kitchen towels. When the lasagna is baked, the pasta will cook further, and the result will be perfectly tender.I find it easiest to cook the pasta in small batches, two sheets at a time, enough to build one layer, then continue to boil two sheets for the next layer, and so on. Once the lasagna is assembled, you may bake it straight away, or keep it refrigerated up to 24 hours. Alternatively, it may be baked well in advance of serving and reheated.Rather than put the tomato sauce inside, I like to surround small squares of the lasagna with a light buttery tomato coulis. This keeps the spinach-rich interior fresh and green, and gives the dish a bit more elegance. For a vegetarian approach, I sometimes replace the sausage with roughly chopped green olives or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.A pretty picture in green and red, this luscious lasagna is quite festive for a holiday meal.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cooking, and Reporting, in the Thrall of the Instant Pot", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the perks of being a technology columnist is getting to test lots of gadgets before they\u2019re available to the general public. As a result, my apartment has at times resembled a Best Buy showroom. I have installed Bluetooth door locks; Wi-Fi-connected lights that can be turned on and off by talking to my Amazon Echo; and a remote-controlled bidet on my toilet. (Don\u2019t ask about that last one.)But of all the hardware products I\u2019ve used this year, my favorite wasn\u2019t the iPhone X or some newfangled VR headset. It was a $99 electric multicooker called the Instant Pot, made by a tiny Canadian company called Double Insight.Mr. Wang seemed surprised. (Ottawa in December is not exactly a dream destination for journalists.) But he agreed to host me, and give me a peek at the company\u2019s inner sanctum. I arrived on a warmer-than-expected Wednesday, and we spent nearly four hours talking about Mr. Wang\u2019s upbringing in China, his Ph.D. in computer science, and how he spent $350,000 of his own savings developing the Instant Pot after being laid off from his technology job in 2008. He also told me about some unorthodox ways people are using their Instant Pots, like the arts-and-crafts buff who creates sculptures out of popsicle sticks, and uses her Instant Pot to steam the sticks to make them bendable.The Instant Pot\u2019s main draw is its pressure-cooking function, which can cook unsoaked beans or soften tough cuts of meat in a half-hour or less. But it can also saut\u00e9, steam, and slow-cook, and its idiot-proof interface is perfect for \u2026 well, me. It\u2019s now my go-to device for weeknight dinners \u2014 in the past few weeks, I\u2019ve used my Instant Pot to make green Thai curry, butternut squash risotto, and a reasonable facsimile of a beef bourguignon.By the way: The best use I\u2019ve found for the Instant Pot is cooking raw beets. Beets are the greatest vegetable on God\u2019s green earth, but roasting them the conventional way takes hours and gets red stuff all over your hands. Now, I just put a few beets in the Instant Pot with a steamer rack and an inch of water, turn on the high-pressure mode, and wait 20 minutes. They come out warm and soft, with skins that slip right off. No more red hands!Normally, I\u2019m skeptical of new product hype. The tech industry has an ignoble record of overselling its innovations and making even the smallest incremental advances seem like huge leaps forward. (How many times have I been pitched a \u201cworld-changing\u201d start-up that turns out to be \u201cTinder for insurance agents\u201d or whatever?) But in the Instant Pot\u2019s case, I had already spent several months experiencing the product\u2019s benefits, and talking to Mr. Wang convinced me that this device might represent an actual, lasting shift in the way people cook and eat.I\u2019m still not a good cook. But I\u2019m a lot better than I was. And for that, I have Mr. Wang\u2019s invention to thank.Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a beef stew to make.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Colorblind Artist? Yes, With a Little Help From His Friends", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. and A.As an admirer of Mr. Long\u2019s beautiful \u2014 and colorful \u2014 picture books, like the Otis the tractor series, \u201cOf Thee I Sing,\u201d by Barack Obama, \u201cLittle Tree\u201d and his newest book, \u201cLove,\u201d which will be published Jan. 9, I was shocked too. I asked him if he\u2019d tell me more. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Why have you never revealed that you\u2019re colorblind?Early in my career I kept it secret because I was worried that it would hurt my ability to get hired. If an art director or editor knew I was colorblind, would they want to work with me? I also just didn\u2019t want to call attention to myself, when people have overcome far greater odds than mine. I think of it as an \u201cobstacle\u201d as opposed to a \u201cdisability.\u201dHow did you first discover it?I was a typical kid growing up in Lexington, Kentucky. My parents were not artists. I liked sports. I\u2019d realized I was not going to be a professional athlete, but the other thing I liked was art. I\u2019d been getting pats on the back from my art teachers. It was the one thing I loved in school, and I\u2019d started to think maybe it was my calling. Then I hear that I\u2019m colorblind. The optometrist said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that rare in males,\u201d 1 in 12 men have some color vision deficiency, and 1 in 200 women. He told my mom, \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal unless he wants to be an electrician or a dermatologist.\u201d Then he chuckled and said, \u201cor an artist.\u201dWe got in the car and tears started running down my face. My mom said, \u201cWhat is it, Loren?\u201d And I said, \u201cHe said \u2018artist.\u2019 \u201d And I\u2019ll never forget this, she gripped my knee while she was driving and looked over and gritted her teeth. \u201cLoren, your art is beautiful. Don\u2019t let anyone ever tell you that you can\u2019t be an artist.\u201dI look back at that and I think, what if I hadn\u2019t had that direct and immediate response from my mother? I might have given up right then on the idea of being an artist.Can you describe your colorblindness?I\u2019ll try, it\u2019s complicated. In general, I can\u2019t tell the difference between the many shades of brown and green or blue and purple. They\u2019re very similar to me. Light blue and lavender look the same, and tan and pale green are almost impossible to tell apart. My living room is a shade of gray, but if my wife had told me it was green I would have taken her word all these years. I see colors best when they are at their most pure. I see bright red pretty well, but burgundy starts looking brown to me. Yellows and oranges I probably see best.And yet you went to art school, and from there became a professional artist.I did. I learned color theory, the science of color. I could draw and compose a picture, but still, not being able to see subtle hues, I realized I could never be a classical portrait painter.All your books have many colors in them. How do you do that?I work with tubes of paint that have the names on them. I put colors on the palette in a certain order. I know color theory but when I get into a painting it\u2019s very intuitive.But you can\u2019t know for sure how it looks?That\u2019s the scary thing. If I\u2019m not careful I could paint brown leaves instead of green. I have to rely on values, and I think because of my colorblindness I have a heightened sense of values \u2014 darks, lights and middle tones. Saturation could be another way to describe it. So I have a solid grasp of lighting and lights and darks. I try to establish a strong light source and let value define the picture more than color.How did you get your first job as an artist?It was at a greeting card company. I had enough drawing skill to get hired, but the first week I struggled to match the colors. I thought I was doing great, and my supervisor kept calling me back to do it over. Finally they put me on probation and the director of the department said, \u201cWe would never have hired a colorblind artist.\u201dBut I managed to prove my value and they made a concession for me on matching Pantone colors. I\u2019d gotten good at knocking on my neighbor\u2019s door or looking over the cubicle wall, and asking people to help. Before that it had been my mother helping me with color, but then I had other people around me. I didn\u2019t want anyone in the world to know I was colorblind, but I had to. It\u2019s like an illiterate person who may be very intelligent, but just never learned to read, and many times leads a successful life because they learn ways around it.And now there\u2019s my wife. We\u2019ve been married 22 years, and she\u2019s my main color consultant. Then my two sons came along, and they started helping me, too.And your books have done so well.Yes, I\u2019m very fortunate and yet I\u2019ve always felt like a bit of an underdog because of my struggles with color.You\u2019re about to go on a national tour for \u201cLove,\u201d with the book\u2019s Newbery Medal-winning author, Matt de la Pe\u00f1a. You\u2019ll no doubt be getting lots of attention. Do you think you\u2019ll talk about your colorblindness?I\u2019ve come to a place where I\u2019m comfortable speaking about it. I would never want to make it seem like, \u201cOh, look at me, I have this problem and I\u2019ve overcome this major thing.\u201d But maybe there\u2019s some other 13-year-old boy or girl who wants to be an artist, and either has the same situation, or just something else in the way. Maybe there\u2019s somebody else who has an obstacle and could be inspired by this.Advertisement"}

In Egypt, Roller Derby Is Real Life", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCairo JournalCAIRO \u2014 Wherever it is played, roller derby, the skating contact sport that is enjoying a global revival powered by women, prides itself on a quirky subculture and jokey jargon \u2014 strange outfits, bawdy nicknames and players who wear makeup.In Egypt, they give it an archaeological twist.Novices are called \u201cmummies\u201d; players of intermediate skill are known as \u201cCleopatras\u201d; and those with six months training under their belt \u2014 who have paid their dues in bruises \u2014 graduate to \u201cCairoller,\u201d a full member of Egypt\u2019s only roller derby club.They practice, twice a week, under the floodlights of an outdoor handball court at the Cairo International Stadium, honing their skills in the essential aspects of the sport \u2014 moving fast, with dexterity, and barging opponents out of the way. A lot like daily life, in other words.\u201cIf you fall, you get up quickly,\u201d said Reem El Desouky, 29, a copywriter who goes by the moniker Lady Macdeath. \u201cIf you get hit, you absorb it and move it. These are things you carry into your everyday life. It toughens you up a bit.\u201dNada el Masri, 23, a customer service representative in a bank, deals with impatient, loud customers all day long. \"I have to be pleasant and smile,\u201d she said. \u201cSo on a good day I\u2019ll come here, play for two hours, and it all goes away.\u201dThe Cairo players might identify with that. Many of them wear headscarves tucked under their helmets, in deference to religious sensibilities. A number are married; others live at home with their parents. One 34-year-old player has three children, the eldest of whom is 12. Several are former ballerinas.Yet they have grown to relish the bangs and bruises of the sport, even the frequent injuries. Just about every player has a story of a sprained ankle, a bloodied knee or a knocked-out tooth. Bruises, known as \u201cderby kisses,\u201d are a badge of pride.\u201cI like bruises,\u201d said Sumer Abdelnasser, 26, a television scriptwriter. \u201cThey made me more comfortable with my body, more confident with contact.\u201dTwo American teachers at an international school founded the team in 2012, holding the first practice sessions in a school parking lot. It was time of heady change in Egypt. A year earlier, at the height of the Arab Spring, young Egyptians had massed in Tahrir Square to press for the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, their president of almost 30 years.\u201cOur dreams are down,\u201d Ms. Abdelnasser said. \u201cSince 2011 we\u2019re in a great depression. Nothing changes. We\u2019re stuck.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a sisterhood that resonates across the world,\u201d Ms. El Desouky said. \u201cWe see each other. We stay with each other.\u201dNoha Shalaby, 26, a graduate student nicknamed Missbehave.\u00a0What they lack are opponents.There are other new contact sports for women in Egypt. A national women\u2019s rugby team was established in 2015, and a women\u2019s dodge ball team recently won a major African tournament. But roller derby has been constrained by several factors, including cost.A full set of helmet, kneepads and skates runs into hundreds of dollars, and the sudden devaluation of the Egyptian pound last year effectively doubled the price.They had to improvise. Players take training advice from tutorials on YouTube, and donations of secondhand gear from teams in the United States. Their dream is to start a competitive league in Egypt. They are looking for a sponsor.Earlier this year the Cairollers played their first competitive games against visiting women\u2019s teams from Abu Dhabi and Marseilles, France. In the days before her game, Ms. El Desouky was sick with anxiety, she said.But once the starting whistle sounded, her worries vanished. \u201cIt\u2019s was really, really awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to do it again.\u201dNour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018A Cruel Irony\u2019: 2 Killed in Amtrak Crash Were Rail Fans Eager for Maiden Run", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrain enthusiasts \u2014 those people who plan their vacations by the lines they can ride, who can recite the numbers of their favorite locomotives, who collect vintage model trains and share photographs of them on Facebook groups \u2014 do not often get the chance to ride on the very first run of a newly opened line.Rail travel has been retrenching for decades in this age of the jet and the interstate. Rail buffs have tried hard to change that, and the new route south from Seattle looked like one of their successes: an old freight line upgraded to smooth out and speed up Amtrak\u2019s Cascades passenger service in Washington and Oregon.So quite a few of the people who boarded Train No. 501 on Monday for the maiden run were rail fans. And when the train crashed off the newly refurbished rails south of Tacoma with 77 passengers aboard, at least two of the three people who were killed in the accident came from that world.James Hamre, 61, was a train enthusiast to his marrow, the son and grandson of railway employees, who spent his retirement promoting train travel. Zack Willhoite, 35, his close friend, worked for a transportation agency in Washington State and volunteered his free time for a regional rail advocacy group. Mr. Hamre\u2019s family and Mr. Willhoite\u2019s employer confirmed their deaths.\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel irony,\u201d said Malcolm Kenton, a writer and consultant in the passenger rail industry who knew both men.Speaking by cellphone from an Amtrak train rolling through upstate New York bound for Montreal, a long-planned trip with a friend, Mr. Kenton said that as soon as he heard about the derailment of Train 501, he worried that it would be full of rail enthusiasts. \u201cIf I had extra time on my hands,\u201d he said, \u201cI would have been on it myself.\u201dLocal authorities in Washington State were still scrambling on Tuesday to treat people seriously injured in the accident \u2014 in all, nearly 100 were hurt \u2014 and to clear the debris from the freeway where one of the train\u2019s engines and several of its cars landed. State officials said they were not yet prepared to publicly identify the dead.\u201cWe talk about passion, but it\u2019s almost an inadequate word for what they have,\u201d Mr. Mathews said of rail advocates. \u201cYesterday should have been a celebration. It should have been a coming-out moment for a really vital new service.\u201dMr. Mathews and other rail advocates said they were now worried that the accident would make the public fearful about train safety. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be used to ill effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s lessons to be learned from any wreck. But the risk is that we learn the wrong lesson.\u201dBefore the inaugural trip on Monday, both Mr. Willhoite and Mr. Hamre told friends and colleagues that they planned to ride the new Train 501 \u2014 a thrill for two people who were vocal advocates for rail travel\u2019s potential in the Pacific Northwest.\u201cIt was just a given that they would be there,\u201d said Lloyd Flem, a colleague and friend. \u201cThey had wanted to be on that very, very first run.\u201dMr. Flem, the executive director of All Aboard Washington, a regional rail advocacy group, said on Tuesday that he had seen both men just a few days before the accident. They were their usual happy selves, he said, eager to board the new train early Monday morning.For Mr. Hamre, trains were a century-long family legacy, said his brother, Michael Hamre, who spoke from his home in Tacoma.Their grandfather worked for a railroad in the Midwest that has since been swallowed up in mergers. Their parents met in the early 1950s as employees for a railroad in Montana.\u201cWe have always had trains in our blood,\u201d Mr. Hamre said, recalling a childhood where model train layouts were always under construction in their home. He said his brother loved taking road trips to find scenic spots where he could photograph trains as they thundered by.James Hamre never married or had children, his brother said, and helped care for their mother, Carolyn, 89, who lived with him.He worked for the Washington State Department of Transportation before retiring several years ago, his brother said, and spent much of his time since then indulging his passion for travel and for trains.\u201cHe\u2019s been all over Europe and Africa, Australia,\u201d Mr. Hamre said. \u201cHe chases trains. He\u2019s got a radio that connects to theirs. He\u2019ll take trains to Montana. He\u2019s got quite a collection of photographs of them.\u201dJames Hamre formed a fast friendship with Mr. Willhoite; both men were volunteers for All Aboard Washington. Mr. Willhoite worked as an information technology specialist for Pierce Transit in Lakewood, Wash.Mr. Willhoite had worked for the agency since 2008 and was \u201cdeeply appreciated and admired by his colleagues,\u201d Pierce Transit said in a statement posted on its website.He was married, an avid comic book reader and a \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan, according to Mr. Flem. He also got a kick out of old buses, Mr. Flem said, and owned an old transit bus himself.Harvey Bowen, the president of All Aboard Washington, said he believed a proper response to the deaths of rail advocates \u2014 even in an accident on the mode of travel they loved \u2014 would be to intensify efforts to promote trains.\u201cI think it would be a disservice to them to do anything but redouble our efforts toward the goals that we shared,\u201d Mr. Bowen said. \u201cJim would be very disappointed if anyone would not ride the train or not expand railway service because of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Halifax Explosion and Au Revoir to Hi: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile I was in Halifax this week to write about the massive explosion there 100 years ago that killed 2,000 people and injured 10,000, I went to a screening of a documentary film without a soundtrack. But I wouldn\u2019t call it a silent movie.That includes the deaf. At the time of the explosion, Halifax was home to the only school for deaf children east of Ontario. Unlike other Canadian boarding schools of that era, its history is generally positive. It is widely remembered for creating a community for its pupils and advancing sign language and deaf culture.The blast blew out the school\u2019s windows and doors and it was closed for structural repairs. But while some students were injured, mostly by flying glass, none of them died.The film is subtitled for viewers who don\u2019t know American Sign Language, which is used in interviews and narration. Ms. Campbell said in an email that some hearing audience members have told her \u201cthat the lack of sound really changed the experience for them, making it much more immersive.\u201dAs well, Ms. Campbell wrote that Shawn Beckwith, the film\u2019s editor, took the producers\u2019 advice \u201cabout editing in \u2018A.S.L. rhythm\u2019 as opposed to Canadian English editing patterns.\u201dThe film also reveals another aspect of Halifax\u2019s deaf community. The subtitles sometimes indicate that someone is speaking in Maritime Sign Language.

Catch it if it comes to your community.From Dan Bilefsky, who began reporting for the Times from Montreal this week:When I came of age in Quebec in the 1980s, the province was being buffeted by a Catalan-style referendum on independence, and business was fleeing. French Quebecers were agitating to uphold their right to live in French. Stop signs across Montreal were painted over by vandals to say \u201cStop 101,\u201d a reference to Bill 101, a law strengthening the French language in QuebecToday, many young Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois switch effortlessly between French and English, French Canadian rappers perform in English and French; and separatism is largely in retreat. The top official in Quebec, the Liberal party\u2019s Philippe Couillard, recently appealed to Anglo-Quebecers who fled the province to \u201cplease come home!\u201dNevertheless, nearly three decades after I left, it only took me a few days back in Montreal to see that the culture wars of the past are far from dead. Barely had I set foot on Canadian soil before the province\u2019s legislature passed a resolution calling on merchants to say \u201cBonjour\u201d instead of the hybrid \u201cBonjour-Hi,\u201d the quintessentially Montreal bilingual greeting. It had an eerie sense of deja-vu. Judging by the backlash against the move \u2014 and the backlash against the backlash \u2014 these questions of identity politics are here to stay.\u2014Lorsque j\u2019ai eu 18 ans dans les ann\u00e9es 80, la belle province venait de tenir un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance, comme l\u2019a fait la Catalogne derni\u00e8rement, et les entreprises fuyaient vers Toronto.

{"Headline": "Black Voters in Alabama Pushed Back Against the Past", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, Ala. \u2014 The word traveled, urgently and insistently, along the informal networks of black friends, black family and black co-workers: Vote.Joanice Thompson, 68, a retired worker at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, scrolled Tuesday through the text messages on her phone from relatives reminding each other what needed to be done. Byron Perkins, 56, a trial lawyer, said his Facebook feed was clogged with photos of friends sporting the little \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers given out at polling places. Casie Baker, 29, a bank worker, said her family prodded and cajoled and hectored each other until the voting was done.The message was largely received: African-American voters played an essential role in electing the Democrat, Doug Jones, over his scandal-scarred Republican rival, Roy S. Moore, in a special election on Tuesday for an open Senate seat that proved to be one of the most shocking upsets in recent memory.They said they were motivated by the specific fears that Mr. Moore would help President Trump cut government aid programs, reduce access to health care and neglect criminal justice reform. But they also voted out of a more general concern that the country, in the Trump era, was going back to a place best left in the past.\u201cThere\u2019s no state in America where black people recognize the horrors of turning back the clock more than the State of Alabama,\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, which is based in Montgomery. \u201cThere is a consciousness about this history in the African-American community.\u201dIn Alabama, he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t go two miles without some Confederate emblem or icon or flag taunting you.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not a fantasy in this state to say we want to turn back the clock.\u2019\u2019The effort was nourished by a concerted, well-organized get-out-the-vote effort started by Democrats and their allies that was custom-built for black Alabama voters. One program, a partnership between two national political action committees, boasted that its activists knocked on more than 520,000 doors, with 200,000 knocks coming in the last four days of the race.They often had to do little by way of convincing. At Mr. Jones\u2019s jubilant victory celebration on Tuesday night, several black voters said they had long harbored a distaste for the fiery brand of evangelical politics that Mr. Moore had relied on to court working-class whites. Devon Crawford, 24, a divinity student at the University of Chicago, said he came home to vote against Mr. Moore.Mr. Moore\u2019s version of Christianity, he said, \u201csanctifies the truth-making power of white men\u201d and was \u201creally just a masquerade for white supremacy.\u201dMs. Thompson, 68, said that she and many of her fellow black voters were worried that Trumpism and a Republican-led Congress would chip away at protections for poor and working-class Americans. \u201cBut it\u2019s a matter of character for us, too,\u201d she said.\u201cTrump has disrespected the United States,\u201d added Walladean Streeter, 68, a retired government worker. \u201cHow can you teach children in high school and college to respect their leaders when he\u2019s acting like a child?\u201dIn Alabama, Mr. Stevenson argued, black voters are intimately aware of the state\u2019s civil rights struggles and particularly sensitive to any gestures that might augur a regression. It was the bloody police violence against peaceful protesters in Selma that helped prod Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A crucial part of the act was invalidated by the Supreme Court in 2013, in a case brought by Shelby County, a suburb south of Birmingham.The voting wars have hardly abated. Many blacks and white liberals continue to harbor suspicions that a 2011 Voter ID law was passed by Republican lawmakers to suppress black votes. And blacks are about three times as likely than others to be denied the right to vote by a state felony disenfranchisement law, said Corey Goldstone, a spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group focusing on election law.A law passed last year clarified what had been a broad and vague list of the felonies that permanently disqualify people from voting. The Rev. Kenny Glasgow, an activist, has been visiting jails and prisons to register newly eligible voters, most of them black.There are thousands more eligible to register under the law, most likely a greater number, and possibly far greater number, than the margin of Mr. Jones\u2019 20,715-vote victory.Mr. Jones, 63, a former federal prosecutor, entered the race as a not particularly well-known face for many black voters. But he had a deeply resonant story to tell them, having successfully prosecuted two white Klansmen for their roles in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four African-American girls.As Mr. Moore was hobbled by allegations that he had engaged in inappropriate relations with teenage girls while in his 30s, Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign coffers grew fat, and in November his campaign manager said the team would try to make contact \u2014 by mail, phone or otherwise \u2014 with every likely black voter five or six times before Election Day.At the same time, national Democrats quietly pumped money into an unannounced independent-expenditure campaign aimed at African-Americans. Senate Majority PAC, the primary \u201csuper PAC\u201d for Democratic senatorial candidates, spent $2 million on a grass-roots program aimed at the black vote, strategists said \u2014 the same amount of money the group dedicated to television ads. In many cases, it poured money into Alabama-based groups to nourish their efforts.In addition, about half of the $750,000 the group spent on digital ads, was directed specifically at black voters.Democrats were careful to look for ways to reach out to black voters without stirring up white Republicans. Mr. Jones toured black churches in Selma with Representative Terri Sewell, an African-American congresswoman. Other prominent black supporters made appearances on his behalf, including Representative John Lewis of Georgia and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.Analysis of the U.S. Senate election results, both statewide and broken down by key counties and voter groups.A few hours later, in a hotel ballroom, Michael Nabors, 54, and his wife, Ella, 55, were among the black voters soaking up the Democratic good cheer after news agencies called the race for Mr. Jones.\u201cWe knew the world was looking at us,\u201d he said.And he said they paid attention to Mr. Jones\u2019s most famous case as a prosecutor.\u201cThose four little girls are on their feet tonight at 16th Street Baptist Church, celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re celebrating in spirit.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Birmingham and Campbell Robertson from Pittsburgh.

{"Headline": "How the Fingerling Caught On (Robot Grip and All) as 2017\u2019s Hot Toy", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout two years ago, Sydney Wiseman had a challenging assignment for an engineer at her family toy company.Sure, the engineer told her. What do you want the little monkey to do?Thus was born the Fingerling, a five-inch monkey that grips your finger with its legs and arms, as it babbles, blows kisses and blinks its eyes. Cradle a Fingerling in your hand and it drifts off to sleep. Press the Fingerling\u2019s head and it passes gas.Created by the Canadian company WowWee, the Fingerling has been anointed one of this year\u2019s hot toys for the holidays, a designation that most toymakers only dream of achieving.For decades, there has always been a must-have holiday toy \u2014 Cabbage Patch Kids, Beanie Babies, a Tickle Me Elmo doll. Parents drive long distances to scour stores for the one item in short supply at exactly the moment when everyone wants it. Scalpers sell the toys at ridiculous markups, while counterfeiters dupe desperate families into buying knockoffs.At stake are the tears \u2014 of joy or misery \u2014 of the children whose dearest wishes are fulfilled, or dashed.How the Fingerling reached this tipping point \u2014 when suddenly millions of children cannot do without a $15 farting monkey \u2014 is the story of a promising idea\u2019s going viral on social media, a large retailer\u2019s savvy pricing strategy and the science of managing scarcity.The monkey\u2019s journey from Ms. Wiseman\u2019s imagination to holiday sensation also shows how the making of a hot toy has evolved through the generations.The $84 billion global toy industry is struggling for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing each year, but at a slower pace than video games.The average life span of a toy fad is about eight months from its launch until it\u2019s marked down, said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and publisher of Global Toy News.\u201cThe life of an item is a little rockier\u201d than it used to be, said Anne Marie Kehoe, the Walmart vice president who runs the retailer\u2019s toy division in the United States. \u201cWe move as a country faster from one thing to the next.\u201dWowWee says it did not intentionally create the shortage. But whether by design or happenstance, there is no question that scarcity fuels a toy\u2019s mystique.\u201cThe reality is that you are better off having some disappointed children this year in order to excite them next year,\u201d said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, a supply-chain analytics firm.But extended shortages can be perilous. Empty shelves can tantalize for only so long before would-be buyers might give up.This fall, WowWee increased the number of Chinese factories producing Fingerlings to three, from two. Fingerlings started arriving by plane because it was taking too long for the toys to reach the United States from Asia on container ships.\u201cIt\u2019s like coming up with a hit movie or a hit song,\u201d Richard Yanofsky, one of WowWee\u2019s founders, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf you see signs of success, you pour gas on it.\u201dOne bitter cold morning last month, Ms. Wiseman scrolled through her phone in the WowWee offices in a former industrial building on Rue Saint-Patrick in Montreal.She pulled up the picture of a wild pygmy marmoset that launched the idea for the Fingerlings.\u201cBringing animals to life is something that is in our DNA,\u201d said Ms. Wiseman, who, ebullient and energetic, sounds as if she is about to burst into joyous laughter at any moment.WowWee is owned by Ms. Wiseman\u2019s uncles, Richard and Peter Yanofsky, with Richard living and working in Montreal and Peter in California. Her mother, a former veterinarian, also works at the company, as do two cousins. Ms. Wiseman is a brand manager at WowWee.But pricey robots are more difficult to sell these days. The challenge for WowWee\u2019s designers was developing a monkey with just enough sounds and movements to entertain children, but not so many sensors and circuitry that it would be prohibitively expensive to make.Ms. Wiseman worked with Davin Sufer, the company\u2019s 38-year-old chief technology officer, on the design.The first prototype looked like a primordial creature that had crawled out of the jungle. \u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d recalled Mr. Sufer, who has three daughters, an 8-year-old, a 6-year-old and a 4-month-old.Over time, the monkey\u2019s face softened into something cuter. It developed a curly tail and plump arms and legs. Ms. Wiseman reviewed dozens of monkey sounds until she settled on the right voice.A Fingerling can snore, say hello and babble in monkey gibberish. If one Fingerling starts singing, it triggers sensors in nearby Fingerling monkeys \u2014 the company hopes you\u2019ll buy several \u2014 that get them to join in.Ms. Wiseman and her team came up with the name Fingerling \u2014 not Finger monkey \u2014 so the brand could produce other miniature animals. (One of them, a sloth, moves, sings and, yes, farts about 10 percent slower than the monkeys.)\u201cYou know you can trust a toy company if its toys fart,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cIt knows what kids want.\u201dWowWee\u2019s offices look like a hip playroom for grown-up kids. Techno music is piped into the design lab, while Japanese anime plays on a screen mounted on the wall above a row of 3-D printers.Every shelf in the conference room was filled with robots that WowWee has produced over the decades: Robosapien, a guard dog, a panda, a Minion on wheels.The company, with about 100 employees, also has the intensity of a Wall Street trading floor, where everyone is in constant motion and new ideas are flying. Its executives travel to Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Bentonville, Ark., site of Walmart\u2019s headquarters.Whenever possible, staff engineers, designers and executives sit down and have lunch together, often at an old-style deli known for its smoked meat sandwiches and matzo ball soup.\u201cWhen the toy business is good, it is really fun,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky, 59, after parking his Tesla outside the deli one afternoon. \u201cWhen it is bad, it is really bad.\u201dMr. Yanofsky got his start as a trader. He used to buy items from wholesalers in the old part of Montreal and resell them out of the trunk of his car to retailers at a markup.\u201cIf I thought I could sell it, I would buy it,\u201d he said.The Yanofsky brothers started developing toys in the 1980s. After some early success, Hasbro bought their business in 1999, and the brothers were incorporated into Hasbro. The marriage was short lived. Mr. Yanofsky said that the toy giant hadn\u2019t been willing to take the risks he wanted, but that they had parted amicably.The brothers eventually bought back their business, then sold it to another public company and then took it private again.Over the decades, Mr. Yanofsky has watched as the industry consolidated and retailers struggled. (Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy in September.) The rise of social media \u2014 where toys can be instantly validated or just as quickly panned \u2014 has raised the stakes for companies like WowWee.\u201cThere are less shades of gray,\u201d Mr. Yanofsky said. \u201cYou either fail or you succeed.\u201dAnne Marie Kehoe, the high-ranking toy executive, is Walmart\u2019s real-life Santa Claus. She plays a big role in determining what millions of children will get for Christmas.Ms. Kehoe knew right away that the Fingerling would be a hit.\u201cThis monkey creates an emotional connection right in front of your face,\u201d Ms. Kehoe said in an interview this month. But it is sales potential, not emotion, that drives her decisions. Ms. Kehoe views even a wacky toy like the Fingerling through the lens of a retailer with troves of data on what customers are willing to buy, and at what price.\u201cIt\u2019s such an art and a science,\u2019\u2019 she said.WowWee\u2019s wooing of Walmart began in June 2016 when Ms. Wiseman flew to Bentonville to pitch the Fingerlings.Walmart was sold almost instantly on the toy\u2019s appeal, but the price was a problem. WowWee had originally planned on selling the Fingerling for $20, but the giant retailer was insistent: About $15 was the magic number. Drop $5 from the price and Walmart would buy as many as 10 times more Fingerlings.Walmart had been doing this for decades \u2014 pushing down the price of paper towels, toothbrushes, avocados and now robotic monkeys in order to sell as many as possible.Back in Montreal, the WowWee executives debated the price cut; it would mean sacrificing significant profit on each monkey.\u201cIt was pure margin,\u201d Mr. Sufer recalled.Ms. Wiseman pleaded with the team. In the past, WowWee had stood firm on keeping a higher price, only to mark down the toys later when they didn\u2019t sell.\u201cI said, \u2018I am telling you, I don\u2019t want to fight this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman recalled. \u201cThey are saying it for a reason. They know.\u201dThe price was set at roughly $15.In July, Walmart invited hundreds of children to a convention center to play with a range of new toys, including the Fingerling.Based on the children\u2019s feedback, the retailer named the Fingerling one of its 25 top-rated toys for the holidays and purchased more monkeys.When Fingerlings hit stores across the United States in August, Maya Vallee-Wagner, 7, was overcome with emotion.\u201cFingerlings,\u201d Maya said, through sobs. \u201cThey\u2019re in stores. I am so happy.\u201d\u201cThis made my life,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said of the video.The video was a marketing coup, just as WowWee was launching its social media push \u2014 an effort that in many ways resembled the rollout of a Hollywood movie.Gone are the days when a toy company could simply blitz Saturday morning cartoons with ads.WowWee focused much of its effort on YouTube, where children go to watch other children play with toys in a phenomenon called \u201cunboxing\u201dThe toy company sent Fingerlings to key \u201cinfluencers\u201d on YouTube \u2014 two preschool \u201cbesties\u201d who make videos about their trips to a playground and a skinny girl with faded fingernail polish who publishes daily posts about toys. Some influencers were paid to promote the monkeys; others did it for fun.Mackenzie Ziegler, a dancer with more 1.7 million YouTube subscribers, and her friend Lauren wrapped multiple monkeys around their fingers and mugged for the camera.Not long after the social media push in August, the monkeys were basically sold out everywhere, and WowWee was able to pull back on its marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful problem when your demand outstrips supply,\u201d said Mr. Gottlieb, the toy analyst.But managing supply can be a delicate balancing act. If WowWee fails to deliver enough Fingerlings by Christmas, it could miss the moment when the fad reaches its peak, or alienate desperate parents who feel manipulated by the hype.\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair,\u201d one woman posted on Facebook. \u201cPeople work and no one has time to stalk\u201d toy stores.Last year, there was a run on Hatchimals, furry birds that hatch from an egg, causing shortages. Parents complained that when they did manage to get their hands on the birds, some failed to hatch on Christmas morning. \u201cMy four-year-old is gutted,\u201d a father wrote on Twitter.WowWee ramped up shipments of Fingerlings in October and November \u2014 way ahead of the number of Hatchimals that were shipped to the United States at this time last year, according to data supplied by Panjiva. Retailers say Fingerlings are being bought up as quickly as they can be stocked.WowWee executives are confident the Fingerling\u2019s popularity will live on past Christmas, but the company\u2019s designers are already pitching their next big toy for 2018.\u201cOur lives are at the whim of 5- to 9-year olds,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky\u2019s son Michael, vice president of sales at WowWee. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Leakers, Travel Ban: Our Most Commented-On Articles of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNot surprisingly, the articles that resonated most with our readers this year concerned politics. These are the five most talked-about stories this year, presented with popular comments from each article.Comments submitted: 8,769After President Trump defended his remarks blaming both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, Va., readers flocked to the article to express outrage and disbelief. The president is protecting Nazis and white supremacists. He\u2019s in violation of his oath to protect and defend the Constitution.He just doesn\u2019t get it. He doesn\u2019t get the fact that being a Nazi and espousing race hate is not just another opinion. And he doesn\u2019t get the fact that the President cannot be neutral in an argument between civil rights and fascism.Washington and Jefferson owned slaves, it\u2019s true. But they also stood up for vitally important values of freedom, rights and national independence, whereas Lee and Jackson fundamentally fought for slavery. It\u2019s outrageous that our president can\u2019t tell the difference.Comments submitted: 8,816White nationalists and counterprotesters clashed over the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville. Top of readers\u2019 minds was whether or not to take down Confederate statues.As ugly as these confrontations are, there is a silver lining: racism is being exposed. I believe it is best racists demonstrate their feelings openly, so society can be aware and address this idiocy.Why is the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville? A major reason is that he served as president of the University of Virginia after the defeat of the Confederacy in the war between the states. Lee was not driven so much by slave-holding as he was by a belief in state\u2019s rights. At the top of his class at West Point, Lee was the prime candidate to lead the Union forces in the growing conflict. He decided he was a Virginian first. In those days local loyalties were perhaps much stronger than they are today. We should not apply our views of a strong and united America to people from that past.Have you ever seen that big statue of Hitler in Berlin, the one dedcated to the bravery and pride of the young German soldiers who \u2018fought courageously for their traditions and what they believed in\u2019? Oh, you haven\u2019t seen that. Because it doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s a reason for that.Taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee is not done in disrespect to the man Lee was; it\u2019s being done in respect to the freedom and dignity of every person alive, of color or white. It\u2019s a statement that we no longer countenance slavery or even the symbolic approval of slavery in our society, because it\u2019s morally offensive to do so.Comments submitted: 10,286This has got to stop. Where are his handlers? His behavior is so outrageous and inappropriate \u2014 forget about presidential! How low can he go and when will he have gone so low that his party is snapped out of their anti-Obama deregulation hypnotic state to do something about it?I am a born and raised Republican from the Midwest. I\u2019ve stuck by President Trump until now. If this is true, I will no longer support a crass man who does not think before he speaks.Mr. Trump desperately wants to be honored as President even as he thoroughly dishonors the office. The president represents the people \u2014 the people this president constantly insults and degrades. How can this be acceptable?I voted for Donald Trump, yet I am slowly getting tired of all this nonsense. President Trump, I hired you to lead the country. Like I tell my employees just 10 blocks from Trump Tower in Manhattan, concentrate on your job, do it well and don\u2019t get involved in things that are none of your business.Comments submitted: 10,473This is 100 percent unacceptable. The media protects our democracy. The president does not get to hand pick news organizations that shower him in compliments and positive stories. This is disturbing and a dark foreshadowing of what\u2019s to come. No one should be ok with this.Initial stage of fascism. We in Argentina have a long history of media expelled and even closed by fascist leaning administrations. Do not allow it, please. It is very difficult to go back to normal.As a conservative, I am deeply disappointed with President Trump\u2019s treatment of media like The New York Times and CNN. This is a catastrophe and I don\u2019t see how my fellow conservatives are just standing by and ignoring this travesty. Those of us who have some decency left should band together and speak out.Comments submitted: 10,637As a patriot and veteran I am sickened by this callous disregard for people who are critical to the safety of our men and women in combat. As an American I am sickened by the religious test. We can never have liberty and freedom when we deny it to others. This is unsustainable.As a 9/11 survivor and as someone who worked downtown at 1 Wall Street immediately after the attack over 15 years ago, it is nice to see a president taking a decisive decision about immigration specifically when it involves Islam.If you are white European, by all means, this is your nation of immigrants.

{"Headline": "New York Today: How Trains Helped Create the Holidays", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayAll aboard on this semi-sunny Wednesday.Trains seem to be inextricably linked to the holidays. Why is that?\u201cUntil they had railways, people couldn\u2019t travel very much,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong association with time off or holiday time and the railways, because the two developed in tandem.\u201dThe railways, which originated in the United Kingdom, existed for at least half a century before people could travel by car, Mr. Wolmar explained, so the association between leisure and locomotives became fixed early on. The British \u201crailway mania\u201d of the 1840s picked up speed in the United States over the few decades that followed, but trains here had their holiday travel \u201cheyday\u201d in the 1920s and 1930s, Mr. Wolmar said, \u201cbefore the luxury market was taken away by airplanes and the mass market was taken away by cars.\u201dHe added that mail-order \u2014 ordering gifts from department stores to homes, for example \u2014 was also made possible by the railways, further connecting trains to holiday traditions.But it was around that time that families celebrating Christmas also began the custom of placing holiday relics under the tree, Ms. Hausmann said \u2014 and what started as figures of nativity soon became mini-villages under the tree, and eventually those included model trains.By the beginning of the 20th century, Ms. Hausmann added, the Lionel company was creating toy train sets with tracks perfectly sized to loop around the base of a Christmas tree.Here\u2019s what else is happening:You\u2019ll see cloudy skies as you roll out of bed, and there\u2019s a slight chance of rain \u2014 but the gray will make way for sweet sunshine.Worry not; the next few days are so full of lighting events that you may need sunglasses.How does one build a tree from lobster traps?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Giant, Under Attack", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "One of America\u2019s biggest rehab companies built an empire. But after a patient named Gary Benefield died, its enemies \u2014 investors and business rivals alike \u2014 struck hard.On the last day of his life, Gary Benefield expressed hope for the future. He was finally about to \u201cget right,\u201d he said.A Harley-riding tough guy and retired utility worker, Mr. Benefield had let addiction get the better of him. He was downing a dozen Budweisers a day and smoking nonstop, despite needing an oxygen tank to breathe. But that July day in 2010, he was headed to A Better Tomorrow, a California treatment center promising 24-hour care while he got sober.Mr. Benefield was about to join the millions of Americans who have placed their fate in the hands of the nation\u2019s sprawling, haphazardly regulated addiction-treatment industry. It is a wildly profitable business, thanks in large part to addicts like Gary.He kissed his wife, Kelly, goodbye at the tiny airport in Show Low, Ariz., a town named for the lucky turn of a playing card more than a century earlier. \u201cHe told me he loved me,\u201d she said later. That evening, he checked in at the treatment center.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018The next morning, as dawn broke over A Better Tomorrow\u2019s postage-stamp lawn and stucco walls, two new voice mail messages awaited an employee there.One came from Kelly Benefield, asking: Could someone help her bring Gary a cake that day? It was his 53rd birthday.The other came from a manager: Gary Benefield was dead.America is convulsed by an addiction crisis \u2014 painkillers, heroin, alcoholism, meth \u2014 and its victims die with tragic regularity. But Mr. Benefield\u2019s case is extraordinary.His death in July 2010 kicked off a six-year battle that very nearly brought down one of the biggest addiction-treatment companies in the country, an epic clash between an addiction-treatment multimillionaire and a college kid and budding financial wizard.On one side was Michael Cartwright, a former addict pursuing his dream of building a nationwide empire of trustworthy drug-treatment clinics \u2014 a kind of Mayo Clinic for addiction. His Nashville, Tenn., company owned the clinic where Mr. Benefield had died.On the other was Chris Drose, who, uninspired by his class work at Furman University, became fascinated with short selling \u2014 a risky investment strategy of trying to make money by betting that a company\u2019s stock will fall.In Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, the college junior saw a very big \u201cshort.\u201d And he attacked.Addiction treatment is one of the most lucrative health care industries to emerge in a generation, a massive business fed by a national addiction crisis that, by most measures, is out of control. Drug overdoses kill more Americans than car accidents, but only a fraction of the country\u2019s 23 million addicts go into rehab, creating an untapped market \u2014 and an enormous business opportunity.Yet the industry focused on curing addiction has its shortcomings. One of the most significant: There is little consensus on the most effective ways to treat patients.Should patients travel far from home, as Mr. Benefield did, to isolate them from temptation? Or should they stay close to their support networks of family and friends? Should they be treated with medications that reduce the appetite for opioids? Or should they be coached to conquer their illness through willpower?The field is also covered by a patchwork of regulations that haven\u2019t kept pace with its growth. That has created room for opportunistic small operators to spring up, some with questionable track records.The industry started taking off when President George W. Bush in 2008 signed a law requiring insurers to pay for rehab. The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded coverage further. Suddenly just about anyone with insurance could get help.Today, private insurance covers treatment for millions of working and middle-class Americans. Annual spending by private insurers on opiate addiction alone rose more than 1,000 percent in the five-year period ending in 2015, to roughly $721 million, according to Fair Health, an independent nonprofit that keeps a database of private insurance claims.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, American Addiction Centers, operates treatment centers in eight states around the country. That was how Mr. Benefield ended up in a treatment facility in California: Eager to get sober, he and his wife searched online from their home in Arizona for a clinic, found A Better Tomorrow \u2014 which eventually became part of Mr. Cartwright\u2019s business \u2014 and then called up to book a spot.This account of Mr. Benefield\u2019s final days, and the battle over American Addiction Centers, draws on interviews with executives, front-line employees, addicts, police and investors, as well as thousands of court documents.On October 3, 2014 \u2014 four years after Mr. Benefield\u2019s death \u2014 Michael Cartwright and his business partner, Jerrod Menz, rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange to announce the first of day trading in their company\u2019s shares. Mr. Cartwright, standing next to his teenage daughter, clapped. Mr. Menz gave the thumbs up.At the close of trading that day, shares in American Addiction Centers held by the two men \u2014 the two largest shareholders \u2014 were worth a combined $202 million.It was a crowning achievement for both men, but particularly for Mr. Cartwright, who had started his career running a rehab center for mentally ill addicts in inner city Nashville.In 2012, Mr. Cartwright started buying up smaller providers, including one that had been started by Mr. Menz, his longtime friend, in Southern California, and assembling them into a national chain.Mr. Cartwright himself had abused drugs as a younger man, \u201canything I could get my hands on,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Cartwright also spent time in a psychiatric hospital after a breakdown, an experience that helped to shape his belief that anyone can overcome addiction as long as they have the right mind-set.He credited his grandmother\u2019s tough love with helping him turn his life around. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t about to let me wallow in my own poop,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cBelievable Hope.\u201dAddiction should be overcome by willpower and hard work in therapy, Mr. Cartwright said. Other treatment providers put more emphasis on medicines to help addicts \u2014 particularly opiate addicts \u2014 function in the long term.The treatment world is split by methodology and motivation \u2014 inpatient and outpatient, religious and secular, nonprofit and moneymaking. Such a Balkanized industry seemed ripe for consolidation by a businessman like Mr. Cartwright.With aggressive internet marketing and a central call center, Mr. Cartwright pulled in patients from around the country. Patients stay for weeks at a time in a treatment house, undergoing therapy paid for by private insurance.\u201cIf you can create a great brand, which I think Michael can,\u201d said Lucius Burch III, an early investor in American Addiction Centers and a former chairman of a Nashville company that runs private prisons, \u201cyou have an opportunity to build a huge company.\u201dBut there were people who believed they saw big vulnerabilities in that emerging brand, including a college student in South Carolina.With bushy eyebrows and a boyish face, Mr. Drose comes from a family of skeptics and crusaders. His grandfather helped plot the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, a dictator in his native Dominican Republic, in the 1960s.He remembered the day, in late 2014, that he discovered the investment idea that would launch his career. He was 19, sitting on a purple armchair in his dorm room at Furman, where he liked to spend his spare time scanning financial filings in search of stocks to \u201cshort,\u201d or bet against.\u201cIt\u2019s like a big Easter egg hunt,\u201d Mr. Drose said recently. \u201cExcept, for something bad.\u201dThat day, one company stood out to him \u2014 American Addiction Centers. In just a few months in existence as a publicly traded stock, its shares had risen a blistering 60 percent.Any time a stock rises that quickly, short sellers like Mr. Drose sense an opportunity. But there was something else that piqued his interest.A business that profited from people\u2019s desperation seemed like \u201can industry that might have something weird going on,\u201d Mr. Drose said.But weird wouldn\u2019t begin to describe the world he was about to enter.Culling through American Addiction Centers\u2019 public filings, he noticed that a health insurer had sued one of the company\u2019s subsidiaries, claiming that it had conducted unnecessary drug tests on patients\u2019 urine. Posing as a prospective patient, Mr. Drose called the company and asked how often it conducted drug tests, and came to believe that American Addiction Centers was testing much more frequently than other providers.He wrote an article about his findings on a website called Seeking Alpha, which short sellers frequent for investment tips. The company\u2019s stock promptly dropped 10 percent.That was a big win for anyone short-selling the stock. Short sellers borrow shares in a company, then sell them hoping that the price falls. Their goal is to buy back the shares later, at a cheaper price, and return them to the lender. The price decline is their profit.In Nashville, Mr. Cartwright watched his stock fall, and was stunned. \u201cWe found no substantiation for any one of his claims,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to Mr. Drose\u2019s article.Battle lines were being drawn and Mr. Drose\u2019s work was attracting attention elsewhere. Kingsford Capital, a hedge fund based outside of San Francisco, hired him as a consultant and told him to keep digging into the treatment business.And another interested party had noticed Mr. Drose\u2019s work, too: a man named Charles Hill, who ran a treatment center in Temecula, Calif., the town where Mr. Benefield had died.Mr. Hill told Mr. Drose that he knew a great deal about American Addiction Centers. He congratulated him on his article about the urine testing, and suggested he start searching for lawsuits brought by families of patients who had died in California. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking in the wrong place,\u201d he told Mr. Drose.Following Mr. Hill\u2019s advice, Mr. Drose flew to California in the spring of 2015. He may have been working for a major hedge fund, but he was so young \u2014 still only 20 \u2014 that he had to pay extra to rent a car.The two men met at Mr. Hill\u2019s rehab center in Temecula, a maze of cul-de-sacs and shopping plazas book-ended by the velvet green Santa Rosa mountains and the snowcapped peaks of the San Bernardino range.Mr. Hill thought the college kid was an investigative reporter. So he was thrilled to have someone to listen to his concerns about the treatment business.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what short selling was,\u201d Mr. Hill recalled.Standing five feet seven inches in scuffed leather boots and faded jeans, Mr. Hill is a former painkiller addict and a natural storyteller. The story that perhaps best defines his life involved a football injury back in the 1990s. It shaped his personal philosophy of drug treatment, one that puts its trust in modern medications \u2014 and is at odds with people like Mr. Cartwright, who want patients to ultimately lead a truly drug-free life.Mr. Hill was injured at the age of 42, too old to be playing tackle football. But eager to relive his high school glory days, Mr. Hill \u2014 his nickname is Rocky \u2014 had joined some friends to start a full-contact football league, The Over the Hill Pigskin Shootout. They used old pads donated by the Los Angeles Rams.One fateful tackle, though, ended the fun. He tore the rotator cuff in each of his shoulders. His doctor prescribed a powerful painkiller, Norco.And Mr. Hill \u2014 who was already in the addiction treatment business \u2014 became an opiate addict himself.When he tried to stop taking the Norco, his life unraveled. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He subsisted on Ensure, the nutrition drink, because eating made him vomit. He considered suicide.A doctor specializing in pain management told Mr. Hill that the opiates had permanently altered his brain. Therapy and group meetings couldn\u2019t fix that.The doctor prescribed Mr. Hill a different drug, buprenorphine, which satisfies the craving for opiates but does not result in a high. Minutes after the first dose dissolved under Mr. Hill\u2019s tongue, the world righted itself.\u201cBefore, it felt like someone had put a vacuum in me and sucked out all the joy,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cAnd then, it was like someone had suddenly reversed it.\u201dMr. Hill\u2019s successful treatment with buprenorphine was for him a revelation. Today, he sends the opiate addicts he treats to a local doctor for a prescription for the same drug he still takes every morning.For many addicts, that prescription is all they need to get on with their lives, Mr. Hill said. Mr. Cartwright, by contrast, believes that ultimately \u201cabstinence has to be the goal,\u201d he said in an interview.That is only the start of their differences.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company specializes in enrolling addicts in intensive inpatient programs, often far from their families \u2014 where they stay full-time in a sober living center with other recovering addicts.Mr. Hill prefers an outpatient approach that is close to the patient\u2019s support network. During the day, addicts come to Mr. Hill\u2019s two-story building, where they meet with therapists. At night, they go home.Mr. Hill believes the inpatient model is motivated more by greed than doing good. Inpatient providers can bill insurers up to $10,000 for 28 days of services; Mr. Hill charges $1,400 a month for his outpatient treatments.There is great debate about which treatment approaches work best, and even how to measure their efficacy.\u201cA lot of organizations say they have the cure, but they have no incentive to try to prove it through the data,\u201d said Robert Poznanovich, executive director of Business Development at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, one of the best-known addiction-treatment providers in the United States.Hazelden offers a mix of outpatient and inpatient treatment. Modern addiction treatment grew directly from Hazelden and its secluded farm in Minnesota. In 1949, a group of businessmen and a Catholic priest pioneered the idea of bringing alcoholics to a rural location, where the men (they were all men back then) could focus on the 12-step principles without the distractions and temptations of everyday life.The approach became known as the Minnesota Model and was copied by other nonprofits for decades. Then, the new insurance laws in 2008 and 2010 transformed what had largely been a government-funded and charitable-minded field into an enticing for-profit business. In just a few years, that gave rise to a $35 billion industry of inpatient programs such as the one offered by American Addiction Centers.Mr. Hill\u2019s concerns about American Addiction Centers were not just about the debate between inpatient vs. outpatient philosophies of treatment. He told Mr. Drose about patients who had died in rehab homes around Temecula and nearby Murrieta that Mr. Cartwright later acquired.The deaths, Mr. Hill contended, showed how the company was unequipped to deal with medically fragile addicts. Yet, Mr. Hill claimed that for years the company kept taking those patients, assuring them that they would receive adequate care.As far back as 2008, Mr. Hill had told the California agency that oversees drug-treatment programs that he believed some patients at Mr. Menz\u2019s facilities (ones that later became part of American Addiction Centers) were in danger. When some of the dead patients\u2019 families later filed lawsuits against those companies, he followed every twist and turn of the cases.He had also spent a good part of 2011 and 2012 working with Hardy Gold, a prosecutor in the state attorney general\u2019s office who was interested in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. The two began trading emails discussing aspects of the investigation \u2014 emails that would later cause headaches for the prosecutor. At one point, Mr. Gold visited Mr. Hill\u2019s office to get a tutorial on the addiction-treatment industry.During that time, American Addiction Centers sued Mr. Hill for defamation, saying he had made false statements about its patient care. A judge dismissed the suit.Mr. Hill kept up his attacks on American Addiction Centers. And in Mr. Drose, he believed that he had found a new way to take on the company.Mr. Drose spent hours talking to Mr. Hill that day in Temecula. When he returned home, his backpack was stuffed with lawsuits, depositions and autopsy reports. \u201cDamn,\u201d Mr. Drose said he thought at the time. \u201cI left there thinking I had stumbled across a gold mine.\u201dMr. Drose returned to Kingsford\u2019s offices in Atlanta, took over a glass-enclosed conference room, and made piles of documents related to each death.None of the deaths had been disclosed to investors when the stock of American Addiction Centers began trading publicly.The dead included Shaun Reyna, an alcoholic, who killed himself with a shaving razor in one of the company\u2019s treatment houses. Mr. Reyna\u2019s widow said in a 2014 lawsuit that the staff had ignored signs that her husband was suffering withdrawal symptoms that required urgent medical care. The case is expected to go to trial early in 2018.There was also Gregory Thomas, who hanged himself from a bridge one block from the company\u2019s main office in Temecula in November 2010. He had been brought to the office by a company employee, but never went through with the treatment.Mr. Thomas\u2019s body hung from a bridge for several days before anyone noticed. A judge ruled that the company wasn\u2019t liable because Mr. Thomas had not been admitted.But the circumstances of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, as detailed in a lawsuit his wife brought in 2011, stood out.The treatment house that he ended up traveling to, A Better Tomorrow, was founded by Mr. Menz, Mr. Cartwright\u2019s partner in American Addiction Centers. It would become a core part of the publicly traded company.When Mr. Benefield called A Better Tomorrow in late July 2010, he was about to help the company solve a problem: a patient shortage.There were too many empty beds, Mr. Menz had told his staff members at a monthly meeting, and they needed to fill them. The employees \u2014 who referred to signing up new patients as \u201cclosing a sale\u201d \u2014 understood the risk of failure.\u201cIf you\u2019re not closing,\u201d Jody Brueske, the former sales representative who enrolled Mr. Benefield would later testify in a separate case involving his death, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be the next one walking out the door.\u201dFrom their kitchen in Springersville, Ariz., the Benefields did not know any of that. All they knew was that A Better Tomorrow had come up in an internet search. A former snowboarder, Mr. Benefield was so excited he even packed his gym clothes, thrilled at the prospect of getting healthy again, according to court records. Ms. Benefield declined to be interviewed; her statements primarily come from court documents.From his first phone call to his death, Mr. Benefield\u2019s relationship with A Better Tomorrow lasted a mere two days. Compressed into those 48 hours is a case study in how financial pressures and business motivations can collide with the needs and expectations of the fragile patients who represent the industry\u2019s bread and butter.Just days after the staff meeting led by Mr. Menz, Ms. Brueske took the call from Mr. Benefield and his wife, Kelly. His case was pretty typical \u2014 an out-of-control drinking problem that was hurting someone\u2019s marriage. But one thing set it apart: Mr. Benefield had chronic lung disease that forced him to use an oxygen tank.Ms. Brueske had never dealt with a patient who used oxygen. But she felt that she couldn\u2019t turn anyone away, because much of her pay came from commissions, she later testified.According to a court transcript, a lawyer grilled Ms. Brueske on that point, asking her: \u201cDid you feel personally pressured to get more clients in because of that sales meeting?\u201dMs. Brueske responded, \u201cYes.\u201dUltimately, Ms. Brueske assured the Benefields that A Better Tomorrow could provide the oxygen he needed.In an interview, Mr. Cartwright disputed the sales rep\u2019s testimony. He said that her perception of the pressures to fill beds \u201cdid not match reality.\u201d He said the company would never promise to provide oxygen to a patient, because it would require a prescription. \u201cIf she promised that, she was out there on an island,\u201d he said.But from the moment Mr. Benefield stepped off the plane in California, there were signs the company wasn\u2019t equipped to handle his care.A Better Tomorrow sent a driver to pick him up at the San Diego airport. When that driver, a recovering meth addict with no medical training, got to the airport, he found that Mr. Benefield was having trouble breathing. His oxygen tank was empty.The driver\u2019s supervisor instructed him to give Mr. Benefield a sedative called Serax, even though Mr. Benefield had not been prescribed that drug. According to a transcript of court testimony, the Serax pills were leftovers from previous patients that were simply kept in the car in case the driver needed to administer a sedative on the spot.Mr. Menz, in an interview, said it had never been company policy to dispense drugs without a prescription, nor did the company keep leftover medicine.The driver and other employees also testified that staff members were discouraged from taking patients to a hospital emergency room \u2014 even when they appeared to be in distress \u2014 because A Better Tomorrow might risk losing a paying customer. The feeling was, \u201cthey are taking our clients,\u201d the driver said of the hospital.The treatment house where Mr. Benefield was taken was not a medical facility but a five-bedroom home with a two-car garage and a hot tub in the back. And the employees there did not know what to make of Mr. Benefield\u2019s behavior \u2014 they were familiar with addiction symptoms, not respiratory ailments.The afternoon of Mr. Benefield\u2019s arrival, as he grew more distressed, the house\u2019s employees called their managers at home for guidance. One supervisor they phoned \u2014 a licensed massage therapist and marriage counselor, not a doctor \u2014 told them to administer more sedatives.Mr. Benefield\u2019s oxygen tank remained unfilled.That night, the employees found that Mr. Benefield had slid out of bed and was sitting on the floor. They hoisted him back into bed. When they went to check on him again in the morning, he was dead.As part of the testimony by Ms. Brueske, the sales rep who worked with the Benefields, she described her boss\u2019s advice after she learned of the death of her client. \u201cYou need to get thicker skin,\u201d she recalled her saying. \u201cPeople die in rehab all of the time.\u201dMr. Drose said that he wasn\u2019t sure what to think after he reviewed the testimony and other documents. \u201cI\u2019ve seen companies screw over shareholders,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cThis company seemed like it was hurting people.\u201dBut despite piles of documents detailing tragic deaths, it wasn\u2019t clear to him that he had enough useful material to move the stock price down, which remained his ultimate goal. After all, addiction patients die with tragic regularity.Mr. Drose\u2019s boss at Kingsford Capital, the hedge fund where he was working, also wasn\u2019t sure what all the material added up to.\u201cThis seems like a lot of stuff,\u201d Mr. Drose said his boss had told him as he stood among his piles of documents in the summer of 2015. \u201cBut what is really in here?\u201dA spokesman for Kingsford said the \u201cfirm does not comment on its investments.\u201dBit by bit, Mr. Drose struggled to piece together the meaning of the deaths at American Addiction Centers.He determined \u2014 after filtering through the reams of legal filings and other documents he had collected \u2014 that the prosecutor, Mr. Gold, had taken an interest in Mr. Benefield\u2019s case. After speaking with a former police detective about what the possible charges against the company could be, he came up with a startling theory: The company could face a murder charge.It was a wild idea. No other public company in California history had been charged with murder.In California, second-degree murder involves someone acting with \u201cimplied\u201d malice that reflects an \u201cabandoned or malignant heart.\u201d While that might sound like a legal concept straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, the theory was that the employees who gave Mr. Benefield sedatives, instead of taking him to the hospital, may have acted with implied malice.Mr. Drose liked the sound of that. \u201cSecond-degree murder is what will destroy this company,\u201d Mr. Drose wrote in an email to Mr. Hill. \u201cI am sure of it.\u201dOn and off in the years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, a cast of characters \u2014 the empire builder Mr. Cartwright, the budding short-seller Mr. Drose, the crosstown rival Mr. Hill \u2014 had made A Better Tomorrow and American Addiction Centers a focus of their lives. Some hoped to build it up. Others dreamed of tearing it down.Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Drose, in particular, saw fortunes to be made.But in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, would a company \u2014 and by extension, an industry \u2014 be held to account? Would future patients benefit from the lessons learned from his death?On July 21, 2015, a prosecutor charged a subsidiary of American Addiction Centers and four employees with second-degree murder in the Benefield case.The company\u2019s stock price fell 53 percent, erasing more than half its value in just one day.Mr. Cartwright, vacationing in Italy, didn\u2019t know what hit him. He called his board of directors to ask for help figuring out what to do.One board member, the Nashville investor Mr. Burch, recently recalled his advice to Mr. Cartwright. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from it,\u201d Mr. Burch told him. \u201cThere is not much you can do if someone calls you a son of a bitch, other than deny it and prove you are not. You get all the bullets you can, and fire at the enemy as quickly as you can.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly what Mr. Cartwright did.First his company lawyers argued, among other things, that the official coroner\u2019s report said Mr. Benefield had died of natural causes, but the prosecutor had relied on paid testimony from a different coroner to make a case for homicide. The lawyers got the murder charge reduced to abuse.That was a big win. But Mr. Cartwright was just getting started.\u201cHow do you bring a murder charge on a five-year-old, natural-cause death?\u201d Mr. Cartwright said recently. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201dLooking for answers, two private investigators were sent to interview Mr. Drose in Atlanta. Only then did Mr. Cartwright discover how all his enemies fit together.Mr. Drose said that he had guessed that a murder charge might be coming \u2014 well before the actual charge was made public.This gave Mr. Cartwright powerful new ammunition in his court battle: He didn\u2019t believe Mr. Drose had merely guessed. He suspected someone had leaked confidential grand jury information to an investor in a position to make a financial killing.\u201cI think the charge was brought to make money,\u201d Mr. Cartwright said in the interview earlier this year. \u201cCan I prove it? No.\u201dPresented with that argument, the judge said that Mr. Gold, the prosecutor, appeared to have a conflict because of his relationship with Mr. Hill, but that it was not enough to unfairly influence the case. But by then, it was June 2016, almost six years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. Two key witnesses had died and the case was running out of steam. Ultimately, American Addiction Centers agreed to pay a $200,000 fine and allow a monitor to oversee its operations in California.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general\u2019s office emphasized that \u201cthe judge concluded that any connection between Mr. Gold and Mr. Hill did not create a likelihood of unfairness to the defendants in the case.\u201dThe unprecedented murder case against a company, which would have sent a message to American Addiction Centers \u2014 and, by extension a desperately needed but poorly understood industry \u2014 had fizzled out.Today, Mr. Cartwright is still angry that his company had to fight off what he considers an unfair attack. The stock price is hovering around a quarter of its peak value, diminishing his personal wealth.But American Addiction Centers is growing again. In September, it bought a treatment company with a 114-bed hospital in Massachusetts. As part of the deal, it also acquired several toll-free numbers to generate referrals, including 1-800-ALCOHOL.And he points out that while the care at American Addiction Centers has evolved since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, the resulting court fight did not prompt him to alter his treatment practices. \u201cWhy would I change policies and procedure because of someone dying of a heart attack at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d he said.His persistent critic, Mr. Hill, worries about what he considers the industry\u2019s sorry state and the quality of addiction treatment. \u201cIt is going to take turning the field upside down,\u201d he said. But he has also moved on, buying a place in Mexico where he enjoys swimming with dolphins. One day he hopes to retire there.Christopher Drose\u2019s work earned him a spot on Forbes magazine\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list of up-and-coming young investors. Today he works for a new hedge fund in New York doing what he loves: digging up dirt on companies, and betting against them.\u201cSome part of me likes to see people who are not telling the truth come face to face with it,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cI\u2019ve found a way to express that with stocks.\u201dAmerican Addiction Centers has estimated that short sellers walked away with $250 million because of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death and the murder charge against the company. Mr. Drose called that number overstated but declined to say how much money he made.In 2015, Kingsford Capital sent out a holiday letter detailing its investment successes, which mentioned the murder charge involving American Addiction Centers. In the letter, the firm summed up its strategy that year as finding \u201cgifts from garbage.\u201d\u201cOne man\u2019s trash,\u201d Kingsford Capital wrote, \u201cis our treasure.\u201dToday in America, overdoses claim more lives than guns. Yet as the addiction crisis deepens, patients and their families are still struggling to sort out the most effective forms of treatment offered by the sprawling industry.Mr. Benefield, a bear of a man with a big drinking problem, had pursued his hope of getting well. His wife, Kelly, was left to settle a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against the company that they had hoped would help him.On Facebook, years after he died, Ms. Benefield wrote, \u201cI miss him so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of years since Gary Benefield\u2019s death. Mr. Benefield died seven years ago, not 11.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How does the Disney deal affect Fox\u2019s efforts to buy control of Sky?\u2022 The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney.\u2022 Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together.\u2022 Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today\u2019s big transaction.President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,\u201d Sanders said.But then there\u2019s the jobs angle There\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives. The other is one of the most prolific and prominent conservative donors around.From the piece:This is a political, economic and moral imperative. The sooner that Congress resolves this situation \u2014 on a permanent basis \u2014 the sooner dreamers can seize the opportunity to plan their lives and develop their talents.This extraordinary set of circumstances has brought the two of us together as co-authors. We are business leaders who sometimes differ on the issues of the day. Yet, on a question as straightforward as this one, we are firmly aligned.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u2022 The Murdochs, who own about 17 percent of existing shares in Fox, will own less than 5 percent of Disney and won\u2019t have any board seats there.What Robert Iger of Disney has to say We\u2019re honored and grateful that Rupert Murdoch has entrusted us with the future of businesses he spent a lifetime building, and we\u2019re excited about this extraordinary opportunity to significantly increase our portfolio of well-loved franchises and branded content to greatly enhance our growing direct-to-consumer offerings.\u2022 The corporate tax rate going down to 21 percent,instead of 20 percent\u2022 The top tax rate going down to 37 percent\u2022 A $10,000 deduction that can be split between mortgage payments and state and local taxes\u2022 A repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, but not the individual A.M.T.\u2022 The repeal of the individual insurance mandate\u2022 A preservation of tax breaks for medical expenses and tuition stipends for graduate students\u2022 A tax deduction for pass-through businesses that largely mirrors the Senate bill\u2019s treatmentThe tax flyaroundWhen told that the president thinks the Republican tax plan could lead to growth of more than 4 percent, here\u2019s what Ms. Yellen said:\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out.

The incident took place several years ago and there are emails that confirm the interaction, HuffPost reported.\u201cHe has been terminated for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a statement.In a tweet Ford denied the allegations. \u201cThis simply did not happen.

Since then it has surged more that 60 percent, crossed eight millennial markers, and briefly surpassed $19,000.The cryptocurrency has retreated since crossing $19,000 and was recently trading above $16,500.Bitcoin was valued at less than $1,000 at the start of the year and has gained more than 15,000 percent so far this year.This time, the reason is that if Disney clinches a deal to buy huge chunks of 21st Century Fox, Mr. Iger would be needed to oversee integration of the operations.Andrew adds:I\u2019m hearing that Rupert Murdoch is worried that if Mr. Iger were to leave in 2019, his replacement might not be as invested in the combined company and the various people who would join Disney.Of course, staying longer also means that Mr. Iger wouldn\u2019t be able to run for president, as some expect him to. Cue gossip among media executives about whether this is a power play by Mr. Murdoch \u2026About $6.5 billion a week, according to a report from S&P Global analysts. That would shave roughly 0.2% off fourth quarter gross domestic product each week the government is closed.Congress faces a midnight deadline Friday to avert a partial government shutdown.The House is scheduled to vote Thursday on a bill that would fund the government through Dec. 22. But drama built earlier this week over whether the House would have pass legislation to avert a shutdown as conservative members voiced their oposition.\u201cThe dim shutdown scenario pales in comparison to a debt ceiling impasse. Congress suspended the limit through Dec.8, 2017. However, the debt limit will be reset on Dec. 9, and the Treasury Department will then have to begin taking its usual \u201cextraordinary measures.\u201d Unless the debt ceiling is raised, the government will run out of money next spring, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

{"Headline": "A Doctor With a Phone and a Mission", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "Startled by the hard sell addicts face, a psychologist discovered the rehab industry\u2019s customer acquisition tricks, one crank call at a time.More than 200,000 people seek addiction treatment on the phone or online every month. Few of them realize that their pleas for help are a valuable commodity \u2014 one that is quietly fought over by those angling to turn a distress signal into cash.Addicts represent big money to treatment centers, which are happy to pay a middleman $50 for a \u201clead\u201d on a patient who might generate $40,000 or more in insurance claims in a matter of months. That is why television ads offering help to addicts air constantly nationwide.But lead generators, or lead gens, aren\u2019t necessarily the ideal path to rehab clinics \u2014 as Dr. Alan Goodwin, an inquisitive psychologist in Palm Beach, Fla., accidentally discovered earlier this year. That discovery led him on a monthslong personal mission to try to understand the ethically murky business of customer acquisition in the treatment world.It started when Dr. Goodwin, who works as an education and health care consultant, phoned a local substance abuse awareness coalition with a question about the format of a presentation he was to make. Instead of the organization, he got a recording saying the number had been disconnected \u2014 but before he could hang up, the message continued.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018\u201cWe can help you find an alternative addiction specialist,\u201d the recording said, according to Dr. Goodwin. \u201cPlease stay on the line while we look.\u201dThe medical group\u2019s phone number, he quickly realized, had been hijacked by a drug-treatment referral service.A man who identified himself as Jacob came on the line, and started asking Dr. Goodwin the kind of questions you ask an addict in crisis. Dr. Goodwin instantly invented a new persona: a 67-year-old with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, an unhinged wife named Betty and a drug-addled son who had just introduced him to heroin.\u201cI can get into it,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said later, recalling his imagined identity. \u201cMy father was a retailer, but he somehow was involved with Second City, the improv comedy troupe in Chicago. So it might be genetic.\u201dWith his call, Dr. Goodwin had chanced across the underbelly of the treatment industry, where new customers are corralled, often with a hard sell. By the time his conversation with Jacob was over, he had developed a new vocation \u2014 dialing up and lecturing the sketchy rehab referral services that have become telemarketers to the addicted.He spent months struggling to map this realm, inventing a small cast of characters to help him find answers and meticulously documenting his encounters. All the while, he tried to determine who was behind the most ubiquitous TV ad on the air, one featuring a figure he called \u201cthe man in blue.\u201dThis was a project he assigned to himself. Now 76, Dr. Goodwin had spent decades in the addiction treatment field and had become the kind of trusted voice now occasionally called by clinics for advice. Because of that, he already knew that some clinics used underhanded tactics, which outraged him.\u201cI went into activist mode,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I saw was pure opportunism.\u201dLead generators, those who connect the people seeking a service to the people selling it, operate in a variety of businesses \u2014 carpet cleaners, locksmiths, personal injury lawyers and, as America confronts a persistent opioid crisis, drug treatment centers. Dr. Goodwin became a student of the business, starting with Jacob, the man he found himself speaking to during that first call.When the rep offered to send a car \u2014 that very afternoon \u2014 to pick him up at home, it was time to end the ruse. \u201cI\u2019m not an addict,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said he told the representative. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Alan Goodwin, and I have some concerns about what just happened.\u201dDr. Goodwin thought his critique would at least get an audience, and perhaps even prompt some changes. It was the first of many disappointments.\u201cWe have to constantly monitor the web for fake versions of our clients\u2019 websites,\u201d said Daniel Gemp of Dreamscape Marketing, a Maryland firm that works with addiction clinics. \u201cFake social media reviews. Fake Facebook profiles. We have worked with 28 different industries and we have never had to play more defense than we do in addiction treatment.\u201dSome lead-gen operators in this field are hard to find, let alone get on the phone. But the chief executive of a major player, TreatmentCalls.com of West Palm Beach, Fla., contended that he performs a valuable service. Jason Brian, who founded TreatmentCalls.com in 2014, said that he will not work with clinics that lie about themselves, including where they are located and what services they offer. So, he said, people who reach clinics through his call system are more likely to enroll with quality providers.And after Florida criminalized paid health care referrals, Mr. Brian said he took the word \u201creferral\u201d out of his ads to stay on the right side of the law. Further, he now says that his company isn\u2019t, strictly speaking, in the referral business, because every caller in his system is automatically routed to a rehab clinic without any input from TreatmentCalls.com. His company, in his judgment, is merely connecting \u2014 not referring.Critics counter that deception is built in to this and other business models. Callers are unlikely to be told that they are getting medical recommendations that have been shaped by financial incentives.Ben Cort, a consultant to rehab clinics, has conducted his own first-person experiments with addiction treatment lead gens. He said he has been placed on hold for a few minutes and then put up for a kind of instant auction after his personal information \u2014 age, insurance, drug of choice \u2014 were collected.\u201cPeople are making decisions in real-time because their loved ones are in immediate peril,\u201d Mr. Cort said. \u201cOne more overdose and that\u2019s the end. So nobody is researching rehab the way people research college, and that creates a huge opportunity for lead gens and clinics to take advantage.\u201dDr. Goodwin has treated hundreds of addicts in a career that has spanned three decades. He grew up in a suburb of Chicago and earned his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Alabama. He was a freshman there when he volunteered at a state psychiatric hospital \u2014 and found his life\u2019s work.Starting in 1977, he served as the executive director of the Indian Rivers Mental Health Center, in Tuscaloosa, which eventually named a building in his honor. In the 1990s, he helped a private hospital, The Manors, in Tarpon Springs, Fla., create an addiction treatment program.He later became an entrepreneur and now runs a company that designs what he calls group e-learning for colleges and other entities. He also cocreated a board game, \u201cDrugs/Alcohol: Play it Straight,\u201d the most public example of his knack for mixing the fun with the serious.Though no longer employed in the treatment field, Dr. Goodwin is still regarded by physicians and clinic owners as a resource. In April of last year, an investor in a clinic in West Palm Beach got in touch with him, he said, asking for patient referrals. Dr. Goodwin said he wanted to check out the place first. After a few days, he concluded that clients there were being grossly overcharged.\u201cThey wanted to own fancy cars,\u201d he said of the owners, \u201cnot to help anyone.\u201dMr. Goodwin took his findings to the state\u2019s attorney general. He said he was amazed that prosecutions for insurance fraud didn\u2019t follow.\u201cMy dad loves a challenge,\u201d said his son, Joey Goodwin. \u201cAnd when he found out what was happening in rehab, this was a challenge right in his neighborhood. Literally, because so many clinics are near his home in Florida.\u201dThe acting part of his phone calls came naturally, Dr. Goodwin said, because of the years he had spent role-playing in group therapy settings. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve worked for years with all the people I was pretending to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the elderly heroin addict. I\u2019ve worked with the kid smoking pot. I know them all.\u201dAfter his first call, he started typing up his conversations, in part to keep track of a handful of different personas he\u2019d created, each with their own name and biography.They included a churchgoing, 18-year-old Duke University freshman who had recently tried pot. (\u201cI kept my voice really low,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said, explaining how he tried to sound young.) There was also a multimillionaire claiming to be calling on behalf of an autistic son who was dabbling in drugs.He wanted to understand who was behind the pitches. Clinics? Phone banks? Who ran them, and how did they parcel out leads?But Dr. Goodwin said he had a second purpose in mind: to persuade clinics he reached to change their ways, if he found their procedures lacking. Which he often did.For instance, most people he spoke to lacked medical training, so in follow-up calls he would urge clinics to staff up with professionals. And nearly everyone pushed the priciest treatment, Dr. Goodwin said \u2014 even if he was playing a character who barely used drugs at all.But every time he offered advice, he said, he was rebuffed, starting with that very first call to Palm Partners.\u201cThe person on the phone just blasted me,\u201d he said, describing the conversation after he revealed his true identity. \u201cHe said something about helping thousands of people and how I was wasting their time.\u201dDr. Goodwin said he asked for a manager to call him back \u2014 not to get the phone rep in trouble, but to get the company \u201cto really look at their practices.\u201d\u201cHe hung up on me,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. \u201cI later left a message. No one ever called me back.\u201dMessages left with Palm Partners by The New York Times were not returned.Soon, she said, the internet was home to countless sites promoting Narconon clinics. Over the years, Narconon\u2019s success produced imitators who packed sites with keywords in hopes of kicking their services to the top of search results.It is a hustle carried out with a bit of internet chicanery.Typically, one of the links in the box is labeled \u201csuggest an edit.\u201d It allows users to change details of the listing. Google\u2019s goal is to offer a simple way for people to correct addresses and phone numbers. But relying on users across the world has a flaw: Bad actors can use the function to insert their own phone numbers, in effect redirecting calls from the intended company to another.Google has safeguards to reduce foul play. For example, a business can take control of its own Google My Business listing \u2014 making shenanigans tougher to pull off \u2014 via a system where Google snail-mails the business a postcard with a verification code. But the safeguards aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 the workarounds are complicated but motivated competitors can still divert calls.A Google spokeswoman declined to say whether a fix for this problem was in the works, other than noting that the company is always looking for ways to improve its system.\u201cWe use manual and automated systems to detect for spam and fraud,\u201d the spokeswoman, Liz Davidoff, wrote. \u201cBut we tend not to share details behind our processes so as not to tip off spammers or others with bad intent.\u201dThis time Dr. Goodwin pretended to be \u201cAlan Richard,\u201d a wealthy man whose wife thought he was smoking \u201ca little too much weed.\u201dJacob advised against the rehab centers in Florida, suggesting that they were little more than resorts for kids on drugs. Better to head to Michigan, where a company called Behavioral Rehabilitation Services operated a clinic.Next, that company\u2019s intake coordinator came on the line. After a brief patient assessment \u2014 What drugs are you taking? What kind of insurance do you have? \u2014 the coordinator offered two options: a $32,900 shared room, or a semiprivate room for $40,000 at a facility in Harrison, Mich.\u201cI have no idea what the difference is,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask. I just went for the most expensive choice.\u201dAfter that, a third person came on the line and told him that he would receive a free one-way plane ticket to Detroit, on Delta Air Lines. (\u201cYou will be responsible for your transportation home,\u201d she added, according to Dr. Goodwin\u2019s notes.) In a follow-up call, Mr. Richard was informed that everyone detoxing from marijuana was entitled to on-demand massages.Still pretending to be Alan Richard, Dr. Goodwin later called back to say that his personal physician was concerned about the lack of medical information that had been requested during the intake process. Could his doctor speak to the medical director?He had to ask a few times before getting connected to a nurse. Then, Dr. Goodwin unmasked himself.\u201cShe sounded a little panicked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said she\u2019d have some administrator call me, but no one ever did.\u201dThe executive director of Behavioral Rehabilitation Services, JJ Bush, told The New York Times in a brief interview that he knew nothing about the company\u2019s marketing efforts but would have someone in that department get in touch. No one did. A follow-up phone call was not returned.Even after months of calls, Dr. Goodwin\u2019s picture of the business remained fuzzy. When he asked phone reps who they worked for, they either refused to say or, Dr. Goodwin suspected, they lied.\u201cIf you\u2019ve been trying to quit your addiction to drugs or alcohol without any luck,\u201d the man in blue says, \u201cthen you need to call the number on your screen now.\u201dThe ad promoted \u201cThe Addiction Network.\u201d But each time Dr. Goodwin dialed the number he saw on the screen, a representative at a different clinic answered. None of the clinics seemed affiliated with any other. And none seemed interested in discussing it.\u201cI got pushback whenever I tried to find out anything about the ad,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was pretty evasive.\u201dIf the man in blue is a puzzle, Mr. Brian of TreatmentCalls.com can solve it.On a sunny afternoon, Mr. Brian, the company\u2019s founder and owner, sat in his office and explained how his business works.In a typical day, his company and its affiliates air hundreds of TV ads across the country, along with many online ads, he said. Combined, those ads generate roughly 2,000 calls a day. The mid-September changes made by Google, he said recently, have had no effect on the company.Through the magic of modern telephony, incoming calls are automatically routed to a rotating list of treatment centers, which prepay to receive a set number of calls per month. It costs treatment centers between $40 and $50 each time their phones ring, whether the person signs up for treatment or not.TreatmentCalls.com\u2019s ads are generic on purpose. The man-in-blue ad, for instance, long promised little more than a \u201cfree referral.\u201d But even that was been toned down lately. Concerned about Florida\u2019s new patient-brokering law, Mr. Brian snipped the word \u201creferral\u201d out of his ads. Recently, he said by email that he simply sells \u201ccalls.\u201dThe company\u2019s model is good for consumers, Mr. Brian said. His employees monitor calls, he said, and the company will not renew its deals with clinics that mislead people.\u201cOur clients aren\u2019t lying about the quality of care or their qualifications,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who call a center directly could get a snake oil salesman.\u201dThe TreatmentCalls.com model has its critics. One of them is Mr. Cort, the consultant. He noted that people in Mr. Brian\u2019s system may have no idea that their call has been sold to a clinic. Further, because the clinic is randomly selected, it may be the wrong one for the client.\u201cCallers who are patients are not simple commodities,\u201d Mr. Cort said. \u201cWhen no thought is given to appropriate referrals based on a patient\u2019s specific needs it demonstrates either a lack of understanding or a callousness.\u201dAs Dr. Goodwin made more calls over the months, he wondered if he could say anything that would cause a clinic to advise against immediate enrollment. Sometimes this meant presenting himself as the most casual of drug users. Other times, he added berserk details to his story.That reached an extreme when he told a clinic in New Jersey that, in a drug-fueled depression, he had just slit his wrists. To his amazement, the phone rep did not suggest that he head straight to a hospital. Instead, Dr. Goodwin said, he was counseled to immediately board a plane and fly to the clinic.Someone else, however, \u201cdid the right thing,\u201d Dr. Goodwin said. When the owners of the clinic\u2019s affiliated detox center heard about his call, they phoned the authorities. Soon, three police cars pulled up to Dr. Goodwin\u2019s house.\u201cThe officers were furious when I explained what I was doing,\u201d he recalled, sounding chastened. \u201cAt that point, my wife said, \u2018You don\u2019t need to be doing this any more.\u2019\u201dFeb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Advertisement"}

Let us know in the comments.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Whether or not you\u2019re thirsty, you might want to pick up a hot drink on your way to work. It\u2019s one way to keep your hands warm on this frigid morning.Snow is forecast to fall until about 9 a.m. After that, the skies will gradually clear and you may catch a glimpse of the sun before dusk.Here\u2019s how a few of you responded:\u201cI think it\u2019s difficult for New Yorkers to be scared of the terror in our city, because we conquer our environment so well. We stand on the edge of the platform, we jaywalk crossing streets with an ambulance blaring at us. Being a New Yorker is being in control of your environment, and that illusion of safety makes us incapable of fearing something like a terrorist attack.\u201d\u2014 Henry Haimo, 15, Greenwich Village\u201cI am now definitely uneasy in crowds. For example, leaving the Upper West Side after the marathon, all the garbage trucks put there for our safety made it very clear it was potentially a target. I definitely hustled to get out of the area.\u201d\u201cGrowing up in New York City, I remember 9/11. When my mom was dropping me off at school that morning, I saw a huge clouds of smoke all the way from Downtown Brooklyn. That day changed my perception of real danger in New York City. Here, most things are out of one\u2019s control, unlike other parts of the country. I might be jaded because I\u2019ve maybe accepted terrorism as a part of my generation\u2019s life.\u201d\u2014 Nile \u201cMaui\u201d Adams, 22, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn\u201cI don\u2019t believe that New Yorkers have become jaded to terrorist attacks in our city; rather, we have lives to lead and agendas to follow. We recognize that these attacks use destruction as a means of instilling fear, with the fear meant to cause us to capitulate to demands. As protest marches and strikes indicate, we don\u2019t like to capitulate, nor to be manipulated by outside sources, and changing our routines and our way of life is capitulation. New Yorkers are proud and refuse to let our lives be dictated by others who mean to bring us down.\u201d\u2014 Michele Harber, 56, Forest Hills, Queens\u201cThe only fear I have of terrorist attacks is of ever-increasing restrictions on civil liberties.

{"Headline": "The Cost of Devaluing Women", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMy first job out of college in the late 1980s was at Salomon Brothers, a trading house of cigar-smoking, expletive-spewing strivers. One day, I leaned over a colleague\u2019s desk to work on a spreadsheet, and heard loud laughter from behind me; one of the guys was pretending to perform a sex act on me. Almost every day, I found a Xerox copy of male genitalia on my desk.In the 1990s, I changed firms and was now a midlevel professional. The harassment shifted: Instead I had to rebuff a client, a chief executive, who asked me to join him \u2014 \u201cJust you, no need to bring the rest of the team\u201d \u2014 in his hotel room at 11 p.m. to go over some numbers. One company rescinded a job offer upon learning I had a baby at home.I changed firms again and moved another rung up the corporate ladder, and it felt a little less fraught to deal with the inevitable. I was able to say no to the senior government official who said, \u201cHow about we go up to my hotel room?\u201d before obscenely wagging his tongue at me in front of my colleagues. I could knock the portfolio manager\u2019s hands off my leg without too much fear of retribution.These are stories I have not often revisited. Maybe I\u2019ve shared them over drinks with female friends or with younger women in the industry, to let them know what it used to be like. But in the dizzying past few weeks, as this crucial moment of reckoning on sexual harassment continues, it\u2019s clear that the harassment I was subjected to is not in the past. Worse, I know that being a white woman afforded me a privilege in dealing with these issues that unfortunately not everyone has.What we are only beginning to recognize is that demeaning and devaluing women is an insidious, expensive problem. It\u2019s not just the eye-popping settlements in some cases, like the $32 million paid by Bill O\u2019Reilly to settle a harassment claim. Nor is it just the high salaries network stars have been making while allegedly assaulting subordinates, like the $20 million, or more, for Matt Lauer. It only starts there.The bigger cost derives from how women\u2019s ideas are discounted and their talent ignored. I have seen it up close in the two worlds I know best: Wall Street, where I was chief executive of Smith Barney and of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and in Silicon Valley, where I\u2019ve raised money to run my start-up, Ellevest. These places are perhaps the purest microcosms of capitalism, and their lessons are instructive for all of us.Both Wall Street and venture capital are industries whose product is money: Wall Street directs trillions of dollars to the sectors or businesses that it believes will deliver the highest returns. Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns. Both pick economic winners and losers.Homogeneity has led Wall Street firms to travel in packs, going after the same opportunities at the same time: junk bonds in the 1980s, tech stocks in the late 1990s and subprime lending in the run-up to the crash 10 years ago. In particular, when the subprime bet proved wrong, the big banks went essentially bankrupt and were bailed out by the United States government because officials worried that the economic cost of their failure would have been catastrophic.Thus one can draw a line from the gender discrimination on Wall Street through to the lack of women \u2014 and lack of diversity of thought \u2014 in the industry to increased risk and to the financial crisis.One might argue that start-ups run by men just happen to deliver the highest possible returns. The mythology around the industry bolsters this, with venture capitalists boasting of investing in Facebook practically out of the dorm room.Venture capital and Wall Street are both funded by \u201cother people\u2019s money.\u201d Pension funds, endowments, mutual funds and individual investors provide the fuel that enables this sexist, exclusionary behavior. The irony is that so many of these endowments and foundations exist to make the world a fairer place, not to exclude vast segments of the population. Yet because their money is tied up in industries where women\u2019s perspectives, and diversity of viewpoints, aren\u2019t valued on the whole, their causes \u2014 and their bottom lines \u2014 lose out.This moment of ferreting out sexual harassers is a step forward. It also reveals how much work we have to do on the biases that allowed such behavior to flourish.This summer, I was in Silicon Valley, pitching for a round of funding for my company. I was the only woman in a room of 18 venture capitalists. A few of the men were engaged, a few were typing on their iPhones, and the lead investor was alternating between peppering me with questions and leaning back in his chair with his arms folded. He challenged my knowledge on digital acquisition, on acquisition costs.Fair enough, even if he was being a little prickly. Finally, I noted that our business was planning to hire a few financial advisers. He proceeded to give me chapter and verse on how financial advisers are hard to manage and instructed me on the economics of the financial advisory business.I was astonished, because I have managed more financial advisers in my career than probably anyone in the country. And though it\u2019s been years since I have been sexually harassed the way I was at Salomon, I realized in that moment how deep our gender views run, how men are still seen as leaders and women as more junior.This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women \u2014 a view that\u2019s costing all of us.Advertisement"}

Instagram and Facebook monitor our activity and send us targeted, shoppable ads that allow us to buy items with a click. Influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers are paid by brands to wear and write about clothing and accessories in ways that encourage viewers to make purchases. Amazon now sells nearly everything: wedding gowns, car tires, diapers.Many designers are forgoing traditional seasonality and taking a \u201csee now, buy now\u201d approach to sales, allowing customers to buy items as soon as they appear on the runway. All these changes can feel unsettling.What do you feel is the most important first connection to make with a potential customer?The first thing someone who comes to buy something asks is \u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d because fashion is all about newness. It\u2019s about having something very special that is very specific for you \u2014 to make your own. I design for the woman who desires something feminine, luxurious and special, but that also fits her modern lifestyle.What are some of the biggest evolutions happening in fashion right now?The digital world has changed the way people view fashion. Social media, Instagram, Facebook have never been more relevant in telling the brand story. Years ago, fashion was something very few people were involved in; now it\u2019s everywhere. With the internet, anyone can see the shows while they\u2019re happening. For example, I have an Instagram for the Carolina Herrera house that gives people exclusive access into the atelier and design process. It allows people to be more informed about the clothes.Fashion is a dream that suddenly has to become reality. You have to wear it, which is why I always say that fashion is art in movement. It changes all the time and it changes very quickly now with each collection, but that doesn\u2019t change its allure and mystery.What remains consistent?I\u2019ve always made clothes that make women look beautiful and feel feminine. Elegance never goes out of style. I always say that I\u2019m not working in the fashion business; I\u2019m working in the beauty business. I want women who wear Herrera to really feel confident in what they are wearing. Style isn\u2019t just what you wear, but how you wear it. It\u2019s a personal thing that is reflected in the way you live and arrange your house, your taste in books and art, and the personal stamp you give to everything you touch.Why is New York so important to you?New York is a very important place for fashion. I am Venezuelan, but I am an American designer because I started designing in New York over 35 years ago. It\u2019s always been important for me to have an in-house atelier and to support the city and the garment district that has supported the brand.New York is a constant source of inspiration. There is always something happening \u2014 its energy is contagious. There is inspiration everywhere if you are open to it.You\u2019ve spoken about the importance of design integrity and style. Are you concerned about maintaining pace with current trends?I don\u2019t believe in trends. If everyone follows trends, then we will all look the same, and what fun is that? Fashion should be an expression of yourself. I\u2019ve always stayed true to the style codes of the house and have kept my eyes open \u2014 beauty has a way of finding you that way.And yet you\u2019ve managed to stay so current. How?This is a 36-year-old house. A designer has to stay true to who they are and what their house is while creating clothes for today. We are in another era. I cannot sit still and do the same things that I did in the \u201980s or in the \u201990s.The landscape has totally changed. The world is completely different because of technology and global access to information. Fashion is everywhere now \u2014 it\u2019s on the phone or computer, it\u2019s in television, it\u2019s in films. What is produced has to be something new in the consumer\u2019s eyes.It\u2019s a huge challenge, but it\u2019s also very exciting because nobody knows whether it\u2019s magical, it\u2019s madness or it\u2019s beautiful.

{"Headline": "A Reckoning on Sexual Misconduct? Absolutely. But How Harsh, Women Ask.", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In Boston, the leader of a businesswomen\u2019s group said that some women were so angry about the wave of sexual harassment revelations that they no longer wanted to hire more men. In Kansas City, Mo., a women\u2019s career center is urging women not to throw caution to the wind when making public allegations involving harassment. And in Silicon Valley, one of the best-known female executives in the technology industry is celebrating the moment while advising that accusations must be followed by a fair process of punishment.The diversity of perspectives reflects an evolving debate over harassment among women across the country. In interviews with The New York Times, most women agreed that a reckoning for the sexual misdeeds of men in the workplace was a long time coming. But ask the question \u201cWhat do we do about it?\u201d and the answer has become as wide ranging, nuanced and intensely personal as the offenses themselves.\u201cWe need to make sure the people accused believe there\u2019s due process,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer and one of the most prominent female executives in Silicon Valley, said in an interview. \u201cThere will be claims that aren\u2019t true, and if people feel there\u2019s going to be no process for vetting, that\u2019s where the backlash against women comes.\u201dBut, Ms. Sandberg added, the opportunity to address what women commonly face cannot be allowed to slip away. Sexual harassment \u201chas always been about power,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot have a rash of people coming out and people getting fired and then back to business as usual.\u201dSome women caution that men need to be encouraged to join the conversation; others argue that men will change only if women collectively demand it. Some argue that making accusations on social media could become more dangerous for accusers, potentially exposing them to lawsuits; others see airing such accusations online as the only option. Older women said they were stunned at how little tolerance those just graduating from college had for toxic gender dynamics that had long been considered pretty normal; college students asked why women had tolerated sexual harassment for so long.Most of all, many women are wrestling with how this reckoning will work in practice: Who is the judge, who is the jury and what evidence is admissible.Sherry Turner, a women\u2019s career counselor in Kansas City, said that she was thrilled by the movement but that there needed to be different punishments for different kinds of misconduct \u2014 from \u201csomebody makes a bad joke versus someone being physical.\u201d She said that nuance needed to be brought into the conversation.Ms. Turner said she also worried about her clients being swept up in the national rage \u2014 confronting bosses and co-workers \u2014 without a safety net. \u201cI have to counsel them the right way to ensure they\u2019re not flying off the handle,\u201d she said. \u201cFor many of the clients we work with, there\u2019s also a reality of needing income.\u201dThe debate over what to do after outing a harasser on social media is just beginning, said Gloria Allred, the longtime women\u2019s rights lawyer, who has clients dealing with the ramifications of social media justice.\u201cIn the court of public opinion, people can say whatever they want, and sometimes they don\u2019t think and just hit the send button. And then they contact me and say, \u2018What do I do?\u2019\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cIt\u2019s all bets are off right now.\u201dSome women now worry that if men get too scared by the fallout from harassment revelations, they will be less likely to change. Rania Anderson, 56, an executive coach in Kansas City who will be the speaker at the OneKC for Women event, said it was important to add a positive spin and bring men into the conversation about what comes next for them.\u201cWe also have to speak out about the good things men do,\u201d she said.Others argue that men will not join the movement willingly, so that shouldn\u2019t be the focus.\u201cMen always think it\u2019s too radical when women say, \u2018You\u2019re not in charge of me,\u2019\u201d said Sara Miles, 65, a faith-based community organizer in San Francisco. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t end because men decide, \u2018We\u2019re going to behave better.\u2019 It ends because women stop being afraid.\u201dTiffany O\u2019Donnell, 48, the chief executive of a professional women\u2019s network in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said the wave of scandals might be causing some men to be too careful around women and overly focused on little issues. One man, she said, recently apologized after calling her and a group of her friends \u201cguys.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s how this is going to go, if that\u2019s the new line, we\u2019re going to have a problem,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Donnell said.And Kristina Tsipouras, 32, an entrepreneur who leads a 12,500-member Boston businesswomen\u2019s group, said she had heard that some women said they might no longer hire men, which was \u201cprobably not the right approach.\u201dMs. Huffington said she celebrated the movement of speaking out, but also called for nuance in the judgments. \u201cFailing to make distinctions between real instances of harassment and satirical playacting trivializes the pain and anguish of so many women who are actually being harassed,\u201d she said.Generational differences have also emerged in women\u2019s discussions about harassment. Karen Hodson, 38, a vice president at an email marketing firm in Nashville, said she had noticed how women who had just graduated from college were appalled by the harassment that older women considered normal.\u201cThat generation is coddled, and everything\u2019s been handed to them, so they go into the real world and they\u2019re surprised this is what we\u2019ve all been dealing with,\u201d Ms. Hodson said. \u201cWelcome. It\u2019s a battle.\u201dPallavi Chadha, a 21-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, said that she had grown up \u201cin a bubble\u201d and that many young women she knew, convinced that the gender wars had ended years ago, did not identify as feminists.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until recently that I realized how much sexism there was still and that I had already experienced it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to turn a blind eye to.\u201dEven amid all these debates, many women said the revelations about sexual harassment had not gone far enough. Ijeoma Opara, 51, a lawyer in Houston, said the top concern of a women\u2019s group at her Catholic church was whether the movement would run out of steam before all the guilty men had been identified.\u201cMy only worry is that some may get away with it, just because it\u2019s coming out too late in the game,\u201d she said.\u201cHaving a man like Trump be so disrespectful of women, it pulled a scab off some ugliness in this country,\u201d said Ms. Ray, who founded the local Center for Economic Empowerment and Development. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had enough.

I didn\u2019t follow up or harass him about Jake\u2019s situation, yet he still remembered.\u201dThat same night, Ms. Blackman, now a senior account executive in Manhattan at LiveRamp, a San Francisco-based advertising technology company, sent Mr. Musiker a Facebook message that read: \u201cHey there, what\u2019s good? Ben said some good stuff about ya, and from what I remember, you\u2019re the blond with decent banter and humor from the Hamptons. Perhaps we can grab a drink sometime?\u201dBut Mr. Musiker did not reply, nor did he reply the next day, or the next.\u201cTara wasn\u2019t thrilled about Jake not calling, but she\u2019s always been a very confident girl and basically said, \u2018Well, if it didn\u2019t work out, it didn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s time to move on,\u2019\u201d Mr. Weindorf said.As it turned out, Mr. Musiker never bothered to check Facebook messages, as was his policy. \u201cMy issue with Facebook messages in those days was that most of them consisted of washed-up acquaintances from high school inviting me to some kind of nightclub,\u201d said Mr. Musiker, also 29, who graduated from Colgate and is a media planning professional at Fearless Media, an advertising agency in Manhattan.By the time he got around to checking his messages, it was June 2014. Another year and a half had slipped away \u2014 and so, it seemed, had his chances with Ms. Blackman.\u201cI had tons of unread junk mail, but when I came across Tara\u2019s message,\u201d he said, laughing as he spoke, \u201cit was like finding a virtual note in a bottle that had traveled across the cyberseas and washed up on the shores of my inbox.\u201dHe quickly responded, but to Mr. Weindorf, not Ms. Blackman. \u201cBen, the next time you see Tara, tell her I\u2019m really sorry, I swear I didn\u2019t see her message,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cGive her my number and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dThough Ms. Blackman was more than a bit wary, she was still interested. \u201cI spent the next week or two writing messages to him and then deleting them,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally I was like, \u2018Whatever, I\u2019m just going to do this.\u2019\u201dShe reached out again, this time with better results, arranging a first date with him at a bar in Manhattan, where they were both living at the time.\u201cHe was the same hilarious guy from the beach that I had remembered,\u201d Ms. Blackman said. \u201cHe was also very kind and very smart, and he was still extremely handsome.\u201d\u201cI just had a really good feeling about him,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore going on that first date, I told a friend, \u2018I\u2019m going out with my future husband tonight.\u2019\u201dThat friend was Rachel Klein, who knew Ms. Blackman from their days growing up in Wayne, N.J., where they attended youth groups together.\u201cSomehow, from the very beginning, Tara just knew that Jake was the one,\u201d Ms. Klein said. \u201cShe was always a very happy person, but when she met Jake, who is fun-loving and sweet, her happiness rose to a new level, and so did his.\u201dBut there were hurdles to clear, especially in the early minutes of their first date, when their conversation nearly drowned in a pool of awkwardness.While chatting, Ms. Blackman noticed that a bottle of water in the bag she was carrying \u201chad accidentally exploded,\u201d as she put it. In a moment of sheer panic, she poured the bag\u2019s entire contents onto the table, including her laptop, \u201cwhich I thought was fried,\u201d she said. (It was not.)Mr. Musiker, a bit startled, took it all in stride, using the same sense of humor that hooked Ms. Blackman three years earlier to ease the situation. \u201c\u2018I noticed a hit list fell out of your bag,\u2019\u201d he told her. \u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t think you were that kind of girl.\u2019\u201dHe made a few more silly jokes, including one about her water breaking on their first date, and she was soon laughing, the awkwardness gone in a single guffaw.Their conversation took a more serious turn when Ms. Blackman mentioned her mother, Claire Blackman, who died in September 2013, around the same time that Mr. Musiker\u2019s parents \u2014 Elizabeth Hartman and Robert Musiker, both of Manhattan \u2014 got divorced.\u201cI remember talking to him about my mom and getting choked up,\u201d Ms. Blackman said. \u201cIt was a pretty vulnerable time for both of us, and even though it was just our first date, neither of us were afraid to show the other our true feelings. We were very comfortable around each other.\u201dThey made plans to go out a week later, on a Sunday at 6 p.m., but two hours before their date was to begin, she had not yet heard from him.Refusing to accept his silence, Ms. Blackman reached out to him, and he told her that there had been a death in his family, and that he had spent his entire day at the funeral. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d he said to her, \u201c\u2018but it\u2019s not going to work out tonight.\u2019\u201dMs. Blackman, who didn\u2019t believe him, immediately called an aunt to vent her frustration. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Oh my God, I just got stood up and lied to,\u2019\u201d she said.This time around, however, Ms. Blackman did not have to wait a year and a half to hear back from Mr. Musiker. He called an hour and a half later to apologize again, and to invite her out on a next date, which became dinner at a Jamaican restaurant in Manhattan.\u201cI felt much better after that phone call,\u201d Ms. Blackman said.Another hurdle cleared, they began dating steadily, each learning to cope with and appreciate the other\u2019s personality traits, habits and quirks \u2014 \u201cWe want to inspire each other to be better people,\u201d Ms. Blackman said \u2014 while bonding over shared family values, ambitions, as well as a love of travel, theater, comedy clubs and long walks around New York City.\u201cTara is incredibly confident and organized, and let\u2019s just say that Jake isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a little on the laid back, sloppy side,\u201d said Mr. Musiker\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Hartman. \u201cBut Tara motivates him to take things to the next level. She believes in him and likes his kind of mushpie teddy-bear-ness.\u201dMr. Musiker put it a bit more succinctly: \u201cTara is more Anna Wintour. I\u2019m more Cheech and Chong.\u201dIn December 2014, they reached a significant milestone, each telling the other, \u201cI love you,\u201d for the first time. A year later, another milestone, as they moved into an apartment they bought together in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn.\u201cOur road together has just been a real nice, steady, natural progression, and along the way, she\u2019s laughed at about 51 percent of my jokes,\u201d Mr. Musiker said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to find out that Tara is the most confident, goal-oriented person I have ever met in my entire life, and that she has a heart the size of the entire universe.\u201cAll of this, combined with the fact that she\u2019s pretty hot,\u201d he added, \u201cgives her a radiance I have never seen in any other woman I have dated.\u201dThat steady road led them to the Palm House, an event space on the leafy grounds of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where Ms. Blackman and Mr. Musiker were married on Dec. 2.\u201cThe fact that we are celebrating Tara and Jake\u2019s wedding is a mini and modern miracle,\u201d said Rabbi David Levy, who went on to tell the couple\u2019s story. \u201cThis could have been a missed connection for the two of you, but you are meant to be. The universe has plans far too big for you to let a few years and a missed Facebook message get in the way.\u201dDuring the ceremony, the bride, her outstretched hands interlocked with the groom\u2019s, turned to her father, Clifford Blackman, and said, through a flood of tears: \u201cI can feel Mom, she\u2019s here with me right now.\u201dA few moments later, the groom took his left hand and held it out momentarily for both of his parents to clasp, a way of getting them back together, if only for a symbolic moment.\u201cTara and Jake are the most loving and good and innately kind people you will ever meet,\u201d said the elder Mr. Musiker. \u201cThey are really kindred spirits, a perfect match who are truly meant for each other.\u201dLater at the cocktail hour, Ms. Blackman\u2019s father, standing beside her stepmother, Beth Blackman, smiled as his eyes followed his daughter and her husband through a maze of tuxedoed servers carrying Champagne and hors d\u2019oeuvres.\u201cThough I\u2019m sad that Tara\u2019s mother is not here to see this, it is still the happiest day of my life,\u201d said Mr. Blackman, as the newlyweds pranced around the room, hugging and kissing many of their 230 guests.\u201cWhen Tara sees Jake, she just lights up, the same way she did when she first saw him that day on the beach,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what Tara always wanted, and Tara is the kind of girl who gets what she wants. Just ask Jake.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Governor Cuomo Proposes More Disclosure for Online Political Ads in New York", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Following a federal push for more disclosure, and amid investigations into Russian meddling into American elections, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is proposing legislation to close legal loopholes in New York regarding political ads on the internet, with the goal of pressuring companies like Facebook to root out foreign-based interlopers in online campaigns.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposal, which would require approval from a divided New York legislature, would also require that digital companies that receive money for ads maintain a publicly accessible file showing which person or group is responsible for their content. That, too, is part of the federal bill, though the proposed federal benchmarks for such disclosure seemingly target larger companies with at least 50 million unique monthly viewers. The proposed New York law would likely have lower thresholds for disclosure, likely set by state regulators, according to Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel.All told, the New York bills would \u201ccombat unscrupulous and shadowy threats to our electoral process,\u201d according to a statement from Mr. Cuomo, after \u201ca systematic effort to undermine and manipulate our very democracy\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign.In a statement issued on Thursday, Will Castleberry, Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local public policy, said that the company was also \u201cfirmly committed to transparency in political advertising,\u201d and as well as to \u201cprotecting our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors trying to undermine our democracy.\u201dHe added that Facebook looked forward \u201cto working with Governor Cuomo and other lawmakers on those issues over the coming year.\u201dOn the issue of online ads, Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who is a purported presidential contender, lined up statements of support from Mr. Warner and Ms. Klobuchar. And initial reaction from election law experts suggested that such ideas would be an improvement on current disclosure requirements.\u201cThe more transparency we have as far as who is putting out ads and messages, the better informed the voter is,\u201d said Jerry H. Goldfeder, a veteran New York elections lawyer.Paul Seamus Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation for Common Cause, a nonprofit that pushes for government accountability and supports the federal bill, says that expanding disclosure rules to online advertisements is an idea that states like New York should embrace. \u201cIt makes good sense at federal level and makes good sense at a state level, too,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.The public-filing requirement, however, might be trickier to implement, said Mr. Ryan, who wondered how strong enforcement of the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d clause would be at a state level, which he called \u201cpretty weak tea.\u201d\u201cThere are stronger ways to address foreign meddling in U.S. elections,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an improvement on the status quo.\u201dMr. David added that the proposals were meant to address \u201ca huge gaping hole\u201d in state election law and require billion-dollar internet companies to exercise \u201cdue diligence in posting political advertising.\u201d\u201cWhy is it that individuals have to register to place a political ad in the newspaper,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not if they are posting it online?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Six Ways We Can Adapt to Climate Change", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsAs our climate changes, human creativity has been turning to solutions to problems ranging from restoring water supplies to rebuilding failing ecosystems. In interviews, six scientists discussed their efforts to slow or even reverse changes brought by warming. Their comments have been edited and condensed.TURNING BACK TIME ON THE SIBERIAN STEPPENikita Zimov, director of Pleistocene Park, shared his ambitious plans:During the Pleistocene geological era, the Siberian Arctic was an extremely productive ecosystem, with high animal density. Human intervention has affected that mostly badly.Reviving the steppe ecosystem could help reduce global temperatures by preventing its permafrost from melting; if it thaws, the microbes in the soil will start producing high levels of greenhouse gases. Our ecosystem could help slow this process, since large numbers of animals can trample down the snow, making the cold travel downward and keeping the deep layers of permafrost cool. The revived environment would also increase the albedo effect, lower methane output and increase the soil\u2019s potential for carbon sequestration.Increasing the density of animal populations in the park is our main focus right now. We are hoping to bring in more bison and musk ox soon; next, we would like to introduce predators. It will prove very challenging. The park is very remote, and we have no government support and only limited financial resources.Pleistocene Park is a starting point. If you want to create an ecosystem big enough to have an impact on the climate, you need people to understand that they have a role to play.LADAKH\u2019S NEW ICE CONESSuryanarayanan Balasubramanian, project manager and researcher for Ice Stupa, talked about how the project was inspired by a centuries-old practice of growing glaciers:The people of Ladakh have long stored their water in the form of ice high in the mountains. With this method, ice formed horizontally and required shade from the sun that the mountain valleys provided. We set out to improve this design so that the artificial glaciers would last into the summer months and be built at lower altitudes, where the farmers could better access the stored water.Our aim was to build a structure that would not melt in the sun, and give people a model for building their own artificial glaciers. Creating an artificial glacier that would last until May seemed like a crazy idea.Sonam began by designing an artificial glacier based around vertical ice formation. We then experimented, creating a pipe system that sends the glacial lake water down to the structure site. At the site, the pipe points upward, and the water spurts out of it, into the freezing air. The ice builds upward, forming a conical ice structure.We have ice stupa experiments in the Himalayas, and now also in the Alps and Andes Mountains. People see glacial lakes as a hazard; we see them as opportunities. Artificial glaciers are not a permanent solution, but an adaptation strategy for climate change. Ice stupas can make life a bit easier.HELPING THE GREAT BARRIER REEF TO SAVE ITSELFKen Anthony, a scientist at the institute, discussed the new interventions that he is most hopeful about:There is no doubt in my mind that climate change has driven the devastation we\u2019ve seen in recent years on the Great Barrier Reef. At the Australian Institute of Marine Science, we\u2019re working on ways to help the reef\u2019s ecosystem to become more resilient to global warming. I\u2019m particularly excited about assisted gene flow, which would move corals that have adapted to Australia\u2019s warmer northern climate to cooler southern waters, helping the reefs there to be at a lower risk of bleaching.Another intervention we\u2019re testing is assisted evolution, where we speed up the evolutionary process by interbreeding the most resilient corals that have survived past bleaching events. This involves artificial selection, which has been done for centuries in agriculture, and poses fewer risks than genetic modification.Coral reefs are the rain forests of the sea, a huge concentration of diversity. We have a responsibility to do the best we can to save them.THE OCEAN DEPTHS GROW DARKERTakamitsu Ito, an associate professor at Georgia Tech, spoke for the team:The ocean is where biology, chemistry and physics meet. Oceans absorb the oxygen essential for marine life from the atmosphere; water currents then transport it deeper into the ocean. As global temperatures rise, the ocean warms, and warmer waters hold less oxygen. Warmer surface waters are also less dense, hindering the downward circulation of oxygen.There have been naturally occurring hypoxic events along the Oregon coast, for example; this area is very susceptible to deoxygenation. It displaces species, kills them if they can\u2019t move away. The situation can be exacerbated by the use of chemical fertilizers on land, which eventually end up in the water, causing oxygen loss.According to our model, we will witness widespread deoxygenation by 2030 or 2040.The conditions in the ocean will be harsh, making it difficult for fish, shellfish, sea snails and so on to function. This is already evident in the Southern Indian Ocean and in some parts of the East and Tropical Pacific Ocean, but we expect it particularly in the North Pacific.Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for global warming or nutrient pollution. Reduce your carbon footprint and eat organic if you can.THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES EMBRACES RAINMAKINGAs water security becomes a national priority amid climate change, the United Arab Emirates has turned to rain enhancement solutions in hopes of replenishing depleting groundwater reserves. In 2016, the government-initiated U.A.E. Research Program for Rain Enhancement Science began awarding grants to scientists whose work explores weather modification in the area. Prof. Linda Zou was among the first winners, for her interest in cloud seeding, the dispersing of artificial nuclei into clouds to coax precipitation.Zou, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Masdar Institute, part of Khalifa University of Science and Technology, discussed how her experiments mimic and enhance what naturally occurs in rain clouds:Clouds need naturally-occurring nuclei such as dust or pollen to condense the water vapor into droplets, which eventually grow large enough to fall as rain. In a country with a dry climate like the United Arab Emirates, cloud-seeding materials, which act like nuclei, can help.I create cloud-seeding materials by coating salt crystals \u2014 a conventional cloud-seeding material \u2014 with a nanometer-thick titanium dioxide shell. The shell makes the surface of the crystals hydrophilic, allowing the cloud seed to better absorb water vapor, and condense to form rain.Climate change is like a train you can\u2019t stop, but we have to do what we can to live well. In the U.A.E., cloud seeding is just one measure, but it can grow into a solution. Meanwhile, even a single drop of rain is welcome.THE NEW AGE OF MEAT: NO ANIMAL REQUIREDThe warming influence of greenhouse gases surged 40 percent between 1990 and 2016, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists have long warned that livestock, particularly cows, are a major source of these emissions \u2014 and around the world, people are eating more and more meat. To help reduce our growing environmental footprint, some entrepreneurs are experimenting with new plant-based alternatives that look and taste like meat.I started this business with the goal of perfectly creating a piece of meat, in both taste and appearance, using only plants. This is possible because all of the elements of meat \u2014 amino acids, lipids, minerals and water \u2014 can be sourced outside an animal. We know the makeup of meat, so we optimized a method that heats, cools and applies pressure to plant protein, creating the fibrous texture of muscle.To match the flavor and smell of meat, we\u2019ve isolated molecules that contribute to these attributes. We then try to identify the same ones in plants. Every year, we make progress toward an exact match. The Beyond Burger, which we released in 2016, is the closest we\u2019ve come so far. It looks, sizzles and even \u201cbleeds\u201d like ground beef.What you put at the center of your plate has the power to mitigate climate change. I want to give people more choices, to make that decision easier.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we are looking at:\u2022 Disney may extend chief executive Robert Iger\u2019s tenure\u2022 A Disney deal could split the Murdochs as an operating team.\u2022 An investigation of the people who abetted and protected Harvey Weinstein\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely Disney\u2019s board would prioritize searching for a new CEO over the following year as they focus on closing what would be a transformative deal for their company.\u201dThis would be the fifth time Disney has extended Mr. Iger\u2019s contract.Meanwhile, James Murdoch spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference Tuesday night and faced questions about the deal. His response:What would happen to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sonsThis is where it gets interesting. If there\u2019s a deal, James Murdoch, who\u2019s currently Fox\u2019s C.E.O., could become a senior executive at Disney, with a portfolio that would likely include oversight of Sky and Star. Several news reports have said that James Murdoch could eventually succeed Bob Iger as Disney\u2019s C.E.O., though they cautioned that there\u2019s no formal agreement.His brother, Lachlan, would stay to oversee what remains of Fox, which would include Fox News Channel, the FS1 sports channel and the company\u2019s broadcast network.At times, James has felt like a C.E.O. in title only, according to some people who know him. These people say James was never keen about the setup, is ready for a new chapter in his career and has sometimes been on a different page from his father and brother.Critics\u2019 corner____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Shanghai, and Michael J. de la Merced and Amie Tsang in London.____________________________Among those discussed in the articleMaking cameo appearancesThe latest in other misconduct newsDoug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post on the company\u2019s website said:\u201cWhy the change? Because of our growing presence as a retailer who serves customers no matter how they choose to shop.\u201cChanging our corporate name from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to Walmart Inc. is just a symbol of how customers are shopping us today and how they\u2019ll increasingly shop us in the future. Whether it\u2019s in our stores, on our sites, with our apps, by using their voice or whatever comes next, there is just one Walmart as far as our customers are concerned.\u201d\u201cChanging our corporate name to Walmart is a way of better reflecting our company\u2019s path to win the future of retail.\u201dThere are two ways to answer that question.About the corporate alternative minimum tax \u2026From Alan Rappeport and Tom Kaplan of the NYT:Mr. Kennedy said that \u201cin a perfect world,\u201d the corporate alternative minimum tax would be repealed, but he said that deficit concerns might not allow that to happen. \u201cThat\u2019s only one half of the equation \u2014 the other half is can we afford it?\u201d he said.The tax flyaroundThe issue of North Korea, however, was too complicated for him. \u201cLeave the job for President Xi and Donald Trump, because I\u2019m focusing on my business,\u201d Mr. Ma said.The World Internet Conference in Wuzhen wasn\u2019t just a gathering to show off the latest in Chinese gizmos, like a version of the Consumer Electronics Show. It also offered a glimpse of how new advances in artificial intelligence and facial recognition can be used to track citizens, and how they have become widely accepted.Investors and analysts say China\u2019s unabashed fervor for collecting such data, combined with its huge population, could eventually give its artificial intelligence companies an edge over American ones. If Silicon Valley is marked by a libertarian streak, China\u2019s vision offers something of an antithesis, one where tech is meant to reinforce and be guided by the steady hand of the state.More in Chinese techSome employees, including a few of the bureau\u2019s top officials, have welcomed their new leader.

{"Headline": "Beware, Italy. Santa the Invader Is Coming.", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 Don Emilio is the parish priest at the cathedral of my hometown, Crema, 30 miles from Milan. He just hates Father Christmas (Babbo Natale if you\u2019re Italian). The priest doesn\u2019t simply ignore Father Christmas or disapprove of him: He hates him with a vengeance. A while ago he came over and rang my doorbell, and he was not a happy trouper: He\u2019d noticed a brightly lit Santa Claus clinging to my balcony, clambering toward the window of the floor above.My family thought it was cute, but Don Emilio didn\u2019t. He thinks Babbo Natale is an interloper and says as much in church, thundering from the pulpit now that Christmas is nigh, accusing him of elbowing out the infant Jesus \u2014 not from a manger in a Nativity scene, but from the minds of Italian children. Who brings gifts? Good old Santa, not a newborn, no matter how sweet he is. And we know how pragmatic children are.Let me say that Don Emilio has a point. We Italians tend to be xenophiles all year round, not just at Christmas. But during the festive season, our fascination with other cultures \u2014 above all with American culture \u2014 just rockets sky high.You may well say, \u201cBut Santa Claus isn\u2019t American!\u201d Indeed. He\u2019s inspired by St. Nicholas of Myra, in Anatolia, a fourth-century Christian bishop. The character then got a Dutch name, entered Germanic folklore, helped the cause of the Reformation in England (the infant Jesus was considered papist), became patron saint of Russia.Later on, as we all know, he moved to Lapland, hired Scandinavian reindeers and bought a flying sledge. Not even Elon Musk owns such a cool vehicle. And Jeff Bezos, who\u2019s testing drones to deliver packages right to his customers\u2019 doorsteps, ought to pay royalties to Santa Claus. True, with Amazon, it\u2019s one click; with Santa, you need snail mail (no credit card, though, since most 5-year-olds don\u2019t carry one).Santa is an international character, you may conclude. His big white beard and big red suit, however, were products of 20th-century American advertising, given a global lift by Coca-Cola. Nothing wrong with that, of course. But there\u2019s no doubt that this elderly foreign gentleman, who stubbornly refuses to retire and seems immune to arthritis or rheumatism, has ousted the baby Jesus. In Italy, at least.Let\u2019s face it. Santa Claus is a quaint but powerful invader. You may think he has an exhausting seasonal job \u2014 Italians love an open-ended contract, which has no set date of expiration \u2014 but the man in red moves a lot of money. Italy is the third-largest Christmas spender in the European Union, after Spain and Britain. Italians are expected to spend 528 euros ($628) on average for Christmas, according to the farmers association Coldiretti. About a quarter of that sum will go for food (capitone in Rome, panettone in Milan, spumante wine everywhere). As much will be spent on travel and a tenth on movies and concerts.But the largest slice \u2014 about 40 percent \u2014 will go for presents. And most of those will end up in Santa\u2019s spacious sack. That makes Babbo Natale a sort of tycoon, and you never know with those people. They may decide to run for office. Come to think of it, if we shaved off Santa\u2019s beard, dyed his hair and opened a Twitter account for him, we might pop him into the White House and no one would notice the difference. Well, maybe not: Santa is a smart businessman, a communications pro, and he knows his job.He\u2019s also a social and cultural climber. Not only did he get as far as my balcony, but he also scaled the heights of Italian preferences and changed our Christmas customs. Every year, more and more children write letters to Babbo Natale/Santa Claus. When I was a child, in the 1960s, I remember we wrote to Ges\u00f9 Bambino/Infant Jesus, and we ignored those who pointed out that he was too young to read.Almost all advertising and many shop windows today feature bright, red, bold Santas; Nativity scenes, with their soft pastel colors, have all but disappeared from the shopping streets. Where do the ox and the donkey hang out? In more traditional parts of Italy, like the Alps and the Apennines. And in Naples, where the Nativity scenes we call presepi have been a form of art since the 18th century and artisans every year come up with new figurines, taking inspiration from current affairs. (This year\u2019s debutantes are Donald Trump and Obi-Wan Kenobi from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d)Italians don\u2019t have a board game to decide who rules Christmas. But the British do: \u201cPlayers get into two teams \u2014 Team Santa and Team Jesus \u2014 and fight it out through a variety of festively themed puzzles, riddles, jigsaws, building challenges (not easy after a few Christmas sherries) and brain games to win believers,\u201d proclaims the website for a game called Santa vs. Jesus. The Italian Catholic media, including the newspaper Avvenire, owned by the congregation of bishops, have made it clear that such a game is not a good idea.Italy, as usual, is subtler, but no less ferocious. Santa is feared because he is an American icon and has powerful friends. Halloween witches and monsters have obliterated the traditional Giorno dei Defunti (All Souls, Nov. 2) and are bothering St. Lucia, a third-century martyr from Sicily who travels with her little donkey on Dec. 13 to take presents to children who, in northeastern Italy, leave a hay bouquet outside their windows. Santa is also undermining Italy\u2019s Epiphany (Jan. 6) broomstick lady, the Befana, who is about his age, but not as charming.But none of those other peaceful American invaders \u2014 who also benefit from powerful allies like Facebook (narrative), Instagram (images) and Amazon (delivery) \u2014 is as loved and feared as Santa Claus. True, his immense power over media and sales has put the infant Jesus back into his role as the ultimate spiritual model. But the risk of being conquered by the big man in red, for Italy, is still great.There is only one defense left: words. The most famous festive proverb is \u201cNatale con i tuoi, Pasqua con chi vuoi\u201d \u2014 \u201cChristmas with your own; Easter with whom you please.\u201d And the infant Jesus is definitely one of us. Nativity images have been found in fourth-century catacombs in Rome. So, let\u2019s stick to him this Christmas. If Santa wants to come back next spring, he\u2019s welcome. He ought to wear a lighter coat, though. April in Italy is balmy.Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Somewhere Between a Food Truck and a Food Tent, You\u2019ll Find a Cubert", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElizabeth Miranda\u2019s food dream centers on churros, and her goal someday is to have a brick-and-mortar bakery where she can sell them along with her \u201creimagined\u201d versions of other traditional Mexican pastries. For now, she settles for a stall at one of San Francisco\u2019s outdoor markets.The base purchase price of the Cold Prep is $65,000 each for a minimum order of three \u2014 about the price of a new food truck, but with three locations (instead of just one) and none of the maintenance required by a kitchen on wheels. Vendors outside the Bay Area will be able only to buy, not rent, unless there\u2019s enough demand for Mr. Cohen to create an additional transportation hub. He has 20 Cuberts ready to go and plans to build the rest to order, with a six-week lead time; he hopes to have so many orders that six weeks quickly becomes a struggle.For the fall test drive, an Off the Grid employee drove the Cubert to Fort Mason on a flatbed truck, unfolded it, extended the flap that shields customers from inclement weather and made sure that the self-contained sinks and refrigeration unit were working. Ms. Miranda, a 26-year-old baker, arrived later that morning with her ingredients and a deep fryer that she connected to the unit\u2019s generator.When she was done for the day, she went home. The Off the Grid driver cleaned, folded and loaded the cube back onto the truck, and drove it to a storage space.The temporary-stall model has grown as well: For the last two years, Mr. Cohen \u2014 who started with three markets and now runs 15 (with as many as 60 weekly events in the March-through-October season) \u2014 has fielded about 350 applications for eight or nine open slots at Fort Mason alone.Jon Feldman, Stumptown\u2019s vice president in charge of wholesale accounts, sees potential for growth at sites where specialty coffee couldn\u2019t go before. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do what we do from any old place: power and water requirements, space constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Cubert you can open a small coffee outlet in the middle of a field,\u201d for, say, a music festival.Brian Lewis, senior vice president for retail development and curation at Kilroy Realty Corporation in San Diego, plans to install a Cubert in a San Francisco office building early in 2018, to see if it can revive a moribund corner of a ground-floor plaza. He wants to replace a cafe in a Santa Monica, Calif., property with one as well, betting that the Cubert can give older properties an edge in what he calls \u201can all-out amenities war with our competition.\u201dIf big companies bite, Mr. Cohen will be able to expand his transportation and support network beyond the Bay Area, though he is quick to reassure potential customers outside the region that hiring \u201ca flatbed truck isn\u2019t a big thing,\u201d and that Off the Grid is ready to help purchasers find a local transport company. He is already thinking about ways to improve the basic Cubert, including climate control to make them cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.For now, Ms. Miranda is grateful simply to have been awarded a Cubert at Fort Mason in the spring, as a way of thanking her for trying it last fall. The cube made her life \u201cso much easier,\u201d she said, and made her dream of a bakery seem within reach.\u201cIt would be a huge next step,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite a food truck or brick and mortar, but it\u2019s not a tent outside. It has a little more of that brick-and-mortar feel.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgium\u2019s Lavish Energy Use Sheds Light on More Than Just Its Roads", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe phenomenon has been a source of ridicule and humor in Belgium for decades. But since the images were published in May, some have also begun to ask a simple but tough question: Why?The official explanation is that it helps road safety and provides security. But critics doubt this and say the phenomenon sheds light not only on Belgium\u2019s roads but also on a mutually profitable relationship among its politicians, electricity distributors and main energy supplier, Electrabel.Belgium\u2019s system rewards local politicians for keeping the bulbs blazing, said Peter Reekmans, speaking from his experience as the mayor of the town of Glabbeek.Streetlight consumption translates into profits for electricity producers, distributors and the state, he said. The profits of electricity distribution companies are paid out \u201cin dividends to the local municipalities that own shares in them, and in salaries and stipends to the local politicians who sit on their oversight boards,\u201d he explained.The system has \u201cbuilt-in conflicts of interest\u201d for local politicians deciding on energy policy, including about streetlights, he said. \u201cIt also makes politics in Belgium quite a profitable profession.\u201dHe estimates that about 10,000 remunerated seats on the governing boards of public utility companies \u2014 not only in the energy sector \u2014 are occupied by local politicians.\u201cWith seven governments, six parliaments, 10 provincial governments, 589 municipalities and hundreds of public utility companies, the state has grown so complex that many shady government structures have remained hidden for a very long time,\u201d he said.\u201cMany people who work for distributor companies, and even for the government energy regulator, used to work for Electrabel before, and vice versa,\u201d he said.In fact, he said, \u201cElectrabel engineered the high profitability of the distributor companies.\u201d Electrabel owned shares in those companies, and appointed senior management positions in them, until last year, when the state bought them out \u201cat inflated prices,\u201d he said.Today, a big part of the profits from distributor companies \u201care used to repay bank loans they took to buy out Electrabel\u2019s shares,\u201d he said.Anne-Sophie Hug\u00e9, a spokeswoman for Electrabel, denied in an interview that the company still maintained ties to state-owned distributor companies, since it sold its shares in those companies last year.She also said that the prices for its electricity and the shares it sold to the state simply reflected \u201cBelgium\u2019s free and very competitive market forces.\u201dShe added that the utility was working hard to increase the share of Belgium\u2019s energy supply that comes from renewable sources, which requires costly infrastructure upgrades.Electrabel remains Belgium\u2019s sole nuclear producer and its main energy supplier, a virtual monopoly that critics say has left Belgians paying dearly for their electricity.\u201cThe nuclear power lobby in Belgium not only dominates the energy market,\u201d said Mr. De Keuleneer, the economist, \u201cit also dominates Belgium\u2019s complex political system, exploiting conflict-of-interest situations on all government levels.\u201dElectrabel is not the only party to profit, however.Electricity-distribution companies and politicians have done well, too, according to Michel Vercaempst, 63, who has worked for both the Belgian government\u2019s Energy Department and for Electrabel over four decades.The state-owned companies that distribute electricity to consumers each have a de facto monopoly in certain municipalities, charging far more for the service than it costs, Mr. Vercaempst said.About one-third of the price of household electricity in Belgium goes to distribution companies, a third to energy producers and a third to the state, he said.The distribution companies make a profit of about 12 percent, on average, he added, compared with about 6 percent in France, where a similar system exists.\u201cThat\u2019s enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even Goldman Sachs can ensure such profits.\u201dThe conflicts and contradictions of such a system come together at the local level, where politicians like Koen Kennis make their living, as well as decisions about when and whether to leave streetlights on in their districts.Antwerp keeps 95 percent of its lights on overnight and buys the electricity for them from Electrabel. Eandis then distributes that electricity. For overseeing this transaction as a board member, among other things, Eandis pays Mr. Kennis \u20ac10,000 a year.Asked if he saw any conflict in the arrangement of his mandates, he said that the system preceded his entry into politics and that his remunerations were fixed by law.\u201cI\u2019m working hard from the inside to reform the cluster of conflicting agencies and reduce the number of mandates,\u201d he said.The debate about all-night lighting was still continuing, he said, because people have gotten used to it.Otherwise, \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cOne phone call to Eandis today, and they turn off those lights with one switch tonight.\u201dBut for now, most lights remain on, especially along local roads and Belgium remains visible from 250 miles above Earth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany Accuses China of Using LinkedIn to Recruit Informants", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 German\u2019s domestic intelligence agency has accused China of using LinkedIn and other social media sites to infiltrate the German government, a charge that the Chinese government promptly denied.In a scathing investigation released on Sunday, the intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, accused Beijing of using social media to target more than 10,000 citizens, including lawmakers and other government employees. To win their trust, the agency said, Chinese agents posed as leaders of think tanks and headhunters, and offered all-expenses-paid trips to China and meetings with influential clients.In Beijing on Monday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called the investigation \u201ccomplete hearsay and groundless.\u201d He urged German officials to \u201cspeak and act more responsibly.\u201dGerman officials said that Chinese agents had created fake profiles in hopes of \u201cgleaning information and recruiting sources\u201d in Germany. Chinese agents approached targets by saying they were interested in exchanging information or offering to establish contact for them with an expert on China, German officials said.Hans-Georg Maassen, the president of the German intelligence agency, called the efforts \u201ca broad attempt to infiltrate Parliaments, ministries and administrations.\u201dAdam M. Segal, an expert on cybersecurity and China at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the German investigation was likely to add \u201cmore fuel to the fire of skepticism and suspicion about Chinese actions\u201d in the West.He said that China would probably continue to expand its digital espionage efforts despite criticism. \u201cGiven how sensitive the regime and Xi Jinping seems to be to any challenge domestically, they also want to try to control as much as they can internationally,\u201d Mr. Segal said.LinkedIn said on Monday that it would deactivate the accounts of users that German officials had identified as spies, though it would not say how many. The company said it was conducting its own investigation.\u201cThe safety and security of our platform is always a top priority,\u201d Billy Huang, a spokesman, said in a statement.Under the scheme described by German intelligence, Chinese agents used aliases like Eva Han on LinkedIn, Facebook and other social media platforms. Some used photographs from fashion magazines as their profile pictures. Several listed fake company names.Once they established contact with German citizens, the Chinese agents intensified the attempted exchange, asking for a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and offering compensation for work on a project, according to the German inquiry. They invited Germans to China for conferences or meetings with \u201cimportant clients\u201d who never materialized. They pressed the targets for sensitive information in exchange for money, the investigation found.The German government has repeatedly warned in recent months that China is increasing its efforts to steal trade secrets and other sensitive information from European targets.In July, the government said that Chinese agents were seeking information about foreign and economic policy. It said China had targeted lawmakers and employees of the European and German Parliaments, lobbyists, members of the military and representatives of foundations and think tanks.Javier C.

{"Headline": "The Rhythm of Colombia\u2019s Salsa Capital", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe lookIn Cali, dancing can start as early as the afternoon, and the energy never lets up. Two kinds of dancers pack the salsa clubs of Cali, Colombia. There are the purists, who like to keep their footwork on the ground, the way salsa was first danced in the 1970s. Then there are the more daring \u2014 typically younger \u2014 provocateurs, who incorporate demanding tricks and lifts frowned upon by traditionalists. If you\u2019re keen on finding a partner, you may want to stick to the original formula. Though it can be found in clubs all over the world now, salsa is still a relatively new dance form. Born in New York City from a mix of music and steps from Cuba, Puerto Rico and Harlem, it came of age in the early 1970s. Alfredo Caicedo Viveros, a salsa historian in Cali, said it wasn\u2019t long before Colombian sailors brought the new trend back with them. \u201cPeople would say, \u2018Do you want to listen to some music from New York?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was so rhythmic! It made you move!\u201dOver time, the Cali style continued to evolve. \u201cWe have here a well-known school by Luis Eduardo Hern\u00e1ndez (also known as El Mulato), who founded the Swing Latino school,\u201d Mr. Caicedo said. Mr. Eduardo introduced a new element to salsa, Mr. Caicedo said, \u201cwhich was acrobatics. You know, what they do in the circus \u2014 the somersaults.\u201dThe photographer Rose Marie Cromwell came across Cali\u2019s vibrant salsa scene almost by accident. \u201cI heard people tell me that Cali was the capital of the salsa,\u201d she said. It was enough to pique her interest. That first salsateca also gave Ms. Cromwell some of her favorite memories of the assignment. \u201cNellyTeca was so friendly, so close,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of got rowdy, and I like that energy. I liked the small ones, that was an experience. It\u2019s where two older ladies were having a beer in the corner, and older couples were dancing together on a small floor. It was bittersweet and romantic. It felt like I traveled back in time.\u201dMr. Caicedo\u2019s generation was the first to dance in salsatecas. He met his wife at a dance more than four decades ago. As one of the elder statesmen of the form, Mr. Caicedo still prefers the old-fashioned style, free of showmanship. \u201cWe dance on the floor \u2014 that\u2019s the Cali style, which is the nice one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe show our respect to the ladies. She doesn\u2019t have to be dropped on the floor, and you don\u2019t have to take her by her foot to put her in the air.\u201d You\u2019ll have an easier time finding the traditional Cali style in a viejoteca, a salsateca that specializes in playing salsa music for a typically older group of dancers. \u201cThere\u2019s a loyalty in Cali to the way it was danced, the way people dressed,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. \u201cMaybe because Colombia was isolated for so long, it stayed the same.\u201d Once an exercise class for the elderly in the early 1990s, the viejoteca became a refuge for Cali-style purists, according to Mr. Caicedo. Now, viejotecas are weekend parties that start in the afternoon and wind down around 10 p.m. It\u2019s a very different scene from New York, where salsa dancing normally begins in the late evening. Cali\u2019s earlier start time also cuts down the drinking hours. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s drinking. It\u2019s more of a social event, not a drinking event,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. Depending on the style you\u2019re dancing in the United States, the motion can vary from big showy gestures and spins to tightly controlled movements confined to the couple\u2019s personal space. Yet other characteristics remain the same between salseros. The steps are always fast, and the hips are meant to move. The couple should hold onto each other, with the follower reading every change in the leader\u2019s position as a signal for the next move. \u201cNow, rich people, poor people, everybody dances it. No matter your creed, ideology, gender or partisanship,\u201d Mr. Caicedo said. \u201cYou can choose how you want to dress. If you want to dress to honor the old times, you can dress like a dancer. Otherwise, you can enjoy it, but you use your regular clothes.\u201dThroughout salsatecas large and small, there\u2019s an unmistakable look of focus and energy on the faces of professional and recreational dancers. Some are smiling while holding onto their partners. Others are concentrating on remembering their rehearsed choreography. The dancers on the sidelines watch on or catch their breath. Women wave fans for a cool breeze, and men dry themselves off with handkerchiefs. Ms. Cromwell said the experience was entertaining to watch and to document. \u201cIt was a really fun scene, the dancers were so animated,\u201d she said. \u201cColombians are an open culture. Everyone wanted to share about Cali, it\u2019s not a touristy scene there.\u201dRoman Yavich contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Prisons Ban 10,000 Books. No \u2018Charlie Brown Christmas\u2019 for Inmates.", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nearly 150,000 inmates in Texas prisons are barred from using Facebook, possessing cellphones and receiving snacks in the mail. They are also prohibited from reading the pop-up edition of \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas,\u201d \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and the 1908 Sears, Roebuck catalog.The publications are among the 10,000 titles banned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, a list that includes best sellers like \u201cMemoirs of a Geisha\u201d and \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d and even obscure works, such as the \u201cMapQuest Road Atlas.\u201d Not banned: \u201cMein Kampf\u201d by Adolf Hitler and books by white nationalists, including David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard.Security at the roughly 50 state prisons across Texas extends beyond barbed-wire fences and cell-by-cell searches to include the careful reading of every book and magazine sent to inmates. The reviews are conducted not by guards but rather by mailroom staff members who skim the pages looking for graphic sexual content and material that could help inmates make a weapon, plot an escape or stir disorder.\u201cIf the book does not violate the uniform offender correspondence policy, then offenders are allowed to have it,\u201d Jason Clark, a spokesman at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said. \u201cOffenders have access to thousands of publications.\u201dIt also includes 20 books by the humor writer Dave Barry. But one of his books, \u201cAll the Dave Barry You Could Ever Want,\u201d a compilation of four books, was banned. It includes \u201ccriminal schemes,\u201d another no-no, the corrections department said.Mr. Barry, a longtime columnist at The Miami Herald, was baffled by the decision.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why the Texas Department of Criminal Justice would ban them, unless they\u2019re worried that the inmates would overpower the guards using fart jokes,\u201d Mr. Barry said in an email.Another South Florida writer, Carl Hiaasen, has several books on the approved list, but one of his novels \u2014 \u201dDouble Whammy\u201d \u2014 was outlawed. A thriller with dark humor, \u201cDouble Whammy\u201d is about a private detective who investigates a suspected cheater in bass fishing tournaments.Inmates are prohibited from reading it, the department said, because it contains information about manufacturing explosives.\u201cMaybe the folks in the Department of Corrections mailroom are devout bass fishermen, and they feel insulted by the satiric tone of the novel,\u201d Mr. Hiaasen said in an email. \u201cIn any case, I get enough letters from inmates to know they enjoy humorous books.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how \u2018Double Whammy\u2019 would spark an uprising. I confess to feeling flattered that I made the Texas list.\u201d\u201cTo block access to \u2018Where\u2019s Waldo\u2019 on the one hand, and Shakespeare on the other, doesn\u2019t preserve order,\u201d said James LaRue, the director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. \u201cIt preserves ignorance and imprisonment. All too often, prison censorship, in addition to being an arbitrary abuse of authority, denies the incarcerated the chance to get out of jail and stay out.\u201dFederal courts have upheld the right of prisons to censor books. Still, the lists of approved and banned books in Texas prison have surprises. Many controversial books are allowed. They include \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d by Bret Easton Ellis, about a serial-killing Manhattan businessman, and \u201cLolita\u201d by Vladimir Nabokov.But the pop-up edition of \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d is prohibited (could hide contraband inside it), as is \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d the 1983 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award (incest). As for that 1908 Sears, Roebuck catalog, it includes information on weapons.Also banned is the 2005 best seller \u201cFreakonomics,\u201d which challenges conventional wisdom and argues eyebrow-raising theories, including the theory that the drop in violent crime in the 1990s can be attributed to the legalization of abortion in 1973.The sections of \u201cFreakonomics\u201d that discuss race, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said, led it to be banned.\u201cI give the prison officials credit for reading \u2018Freakonomics\u2019 carefully enough to make specific arguments for banning the book,\u201d Steven D. Levitt, a co-author of the book, said. \u201cSomehow, though, I can\u2019t imagine that the type of prisoner who would read \u2018Freakonomics\u2019 would be particularly disruptive to law and order in the prison.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Goes Deep With Mobile and Verizon", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith television audiences for the N.F.L. getting smaller, the league\u2019s new digital rights deal with Verizon Communications represents the latest challenge to the traditional media partnerships that for decades have served as the lifeblood for North America\u2019s richest sports league.The deal, which will cost Verizon more than $2 billion during the next five years, gives the telecommunications giant the rights to stream games across its variety of digital media brands, including Yahoo Sports, Complex and go90. In addition, fans no longer have to be Verizon customers to gain access to the games, which they can watch regardless of which company is their mobile provider.CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox currently pay the NFL some $5 billion a year for the rights to televise those games. Those rights help those networks garner top fees from pay television distributors and help those distributors convince subscribers not to cut off their cable subscriptions.Rick Cordella, executive vice president and general manager for digital media at NBC Sports, a unit of the pay television distributor Comcast, said the Verizon deal could help expand the reach for NBC\u2019s advertisers, since fans watching the Verizon stream will see NBC\u2019s inventory of ads.\u201cWe are selling one audience, no matter where they watch our content,\u201d Cordella said.Like previous agreements with Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo, the new Verizon agreement illustrates the N.F.L.\u2019s proclivity to push the envelope to broaden its reach, especially among younger viewers, who may not have a pay television subscription, even if it means potentially angering its television partners as they approach the start of negotiations for new deals.In a statement announcing the deal, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was thrilled to get more deeply involved with digital distribution.\u201cLive N.F.L. action directly on your mobile device \u2014 regardless of carrier \u2014 will give millions of fans additional ways to follow their favorite sport,\u201d Goodell said.Hans Schroeder, an N.F.L. executive in charge of media, believes fans won\u2019t choose to watch on their phones instead of their televisions, but instead will add to the television audience. \u201cWe think this is a very complementary way of growing, engaging and reaching younger fans that will ultimately become longer term viewers,\u201d he said.Since 2010, Verizon mobile customers have been able to stream N.F.L. games for free through the N.F.L. Mobile app.The deal potentially allows Verizon, and the N.F.L., to reach more people, but also does away with what made the previous agreements so lucrative for Verizon: Exclusivity. When signing an extension of the mobile agreement in 2013, Verizon executives said that the number of subscribers the N.F.L. Mobile app helped retain, or add, contributed to the company\u2019s decision to re-sign.Now Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile customers will also be allowed to stream N.F.L. games, as long as they go to Verizon-owned apps or websites with their mobile phones.Over the past few years, Verizon has acquired a spate of digital media companies, including paying more than $9 billion combined to buy AOL and Yahoo, a sign of the company\u2019s growing ambitions at becoming a digital media powerhouse able to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook for advertising dollars.There are some protections for traditional broadcast partners built into the agreement, which does not extend to streaming on tablets or through smart televisions.For the N.F.L., the deal is surely a short-term win. Verizon is paying nearly double the amount of money each year and doesn\u2019t retain exclusivity over the games, though they are adding a number of sponsorship benefits. But long term it seems certain to allow for further erosion of pay television subscriptions, and it will challenge the N.F.L.\u2019s partners in legacy media, who are already facing two straight years of declining ratings.The N.F.L.\u2019s broadcast agreements all expire after the 2022 season. With ratings trending downward and digital rights giants, such as Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, so far balking at paying hundreds of millions, or billions, for sports rights, the N.F.L. could soon be in for a round of tense negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Return to Haiti, and Broadway via Edmonton: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of you may know that Catherine Porter, our Toronto bureau chief, was in Haiti immediately after the 2010 earthquake and returned there several times afterward.Ms. Porter shared some thoughts about her latest visit to Haiti:A few weeks before I started this job as The New York Times\u2019s Toronto bureau chief in February, I went to my second home \u2014 Haiti.I was finishing research for a memoir I\u2019m writing about my relationship with a Haitian girl named Lovely and her family, and I was saying goodbye.I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be back for a while. I was heavy-hearted.My first trip to Haiti was on an aid flight, 11 days after the devastating 2010 earthquake. The first story I wrote was about a 2-year-old miracle girl who survived six days beneath the rubble. That was Lovely.I returned to Haiti a second time, three months later, to find that Lovely wasn\u2019t orphaned, as all the medical workers had assumed. Her parents and younger brother had survived. But they were living in a tin shed that leaked every time it rained. Her story captured readers and drew me back to Haiti repeatedly.Clearly, Haiti was no longer just a story for me.In some ways, I feel very comfortable there. I speak enough Krey\u00f2l to hold a conversation on the street, know my way around the capital despite few street signs, and have a fat stack of contacts and some very close friends.In other ways, Haiti is a very uncomfortable place for me. The thing that upsets me the most is the poverty \u2014 kids who are so malnourished their hair has turned orange, people dying from simple illnesses because they can\u2019t afford treatment, the lack of basic education because parents can\u2019t afford the school fees.So when my editors asked me to find a story on death from Haiti, I was thrilled for two reasons. I\u2019d get to see Lovely and Lyla again this year \u2014 not just once, but three more times.And I could shine a huge spotlight onto the gruesome face of Haiti\u2019s poverty \u2014 which, ironically, makes the dead faceless \u2014 and share my heartache with Times readers.Ms. Porter\u2019s book about Haiti, \u201cA Girl Named Lovely,\u201d will be published in early 2019 by Simon & Schuster.So far everyone seems happy. Actors at the Citadel get to work with Broadway talent and the audience gets to see a production it otherwise couldn\u2019t. For the producers, the value of the Canadian dollar and Edmonton\u2019s comparative isolation from New York have both been attractions.Montreal and Toronto have emerged as centers for artificial intelligence, the field that Cade Metz covers as The Times\u2019s emerging technologies reporter.In a Q. and A., Mr. Metz offered some caution about the hype surrounding A.I. and acknowledged that he\u2019s a \u201ctechno-skeptic.\u201d Like me, he\u2019s also pining for voice recognition software that can transcribe recordings of interviews.Through email, comments and social media, readers of The Times constantly tell us things we didn\u2019t know. We\u2019ve compiled a brief list of some of this year\u2019s highlights. One of the most touching comes from Neil Mavin, a truck driver from Kitchener, Ontario:Life on the road gets lonely. A wave or a child pulling the imaginary air horn warms our tough hearts. Not a man or woman driver can resist the horn at that request.After a roaring start, the effort to get more new subscribers for the Canada Letter than the Australia Letter by the end of the year stalled over the past week.So I\u2019m pleading with you again to foist the idea of subscribing (it\u2019s free) on friends, family, neighbors and passing acquaintances. Our national reputation, at least among the editors, depends on it.Alternately, here\u2019 some text you can cut and paste into Facebook:Canadians: Canada Letter, The New York Times\u2019s weekly newsletter about Canada and for Canadians, has been challenged by the editors to sign up more new subscribers by the end of the year than the Australia Letter.

{"Headline": "How Tough Is It to Change a Culture of Harassment? Ask Women at Ford", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "Decades after the company tried to tackle sexual misconduct at two Chicago plants, continued abuse raises questions about the possibility of change.CHICAGO \u2014 The jobs were the best they would ever have: collecting union wages while working at Ford, one of America\u2019s most storied companies. But inside two Chicago plants, the women found menace.Bosses and fellow laborers treated them as property or prey. Men crudely commented on their breasts and buttocks; graffiti of penises was carved into tables, spray-painted onto floors and scribbled onto walls. They groped women, pressed against them, simulated sex acts or masturbated in front of them. Supervisors traded better assignments for sex and punished those who refused.That was a quarter-century ago. Today, women at those plants say they have been subjected to many of the same abuses. And like those who complained before them, they say they were mocked, dismissed, threatened and ostracized. One described being called \u201csnitch bitch,\u201d while another was accused of \u201craping the company.\u201d Many of the men who they say hounded them kept their jobs.For Sharon Dunn, who sued Ford back then, the new lawsuit was a fresh blow. \u201cFor all the good that was supposed to come out of what happened to us, it seems like Ford did nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had that choice today, I wouldn\u2019t say a damn word.\u201dIn recent months, as women have spoken out about harassment \u2014 at media companies and technology start-ups, in the entertainment industry and on Capitol Hill \u2014 they have spurred quick action, with accused men toppling from lofty positions, corporations pledging change and lawmakers promising new protections.But much less attention has been focused on the plight of blue-collar workers, like those on Ford\u2019s factory floors. After the #MeToo movement opened a global floodgate of accounts of mistreatment, a former Chicago worker proposed a new campaign: \u201c#WhatAboutUs.\u201dTheir story reveals the stubborn persistence of harassment in an industry once the exclusive preserve of men, where abuses can be especially brazen. For the Ford women, the harassment has endured even though they work for a multinational corporation with a professional human resources operation, even though they are members of one of the country\u2019s most powerful unions, even though a federal agency and then a federal judge sided with them, and even after independent monitors policed the factory floors for several years.At a moment when so many people are demanding that sexual harassment no longer be tolerated, the story of the Ford plants shows the challenges of transforming a culture.Workers describe a mix of sex, swagger, suspicion and racial resentment that makes the factories \u2014 the Chicago Assembly Plant and the Chicago Stamping Plant \u2014 particularly volatile.The plants are self-enclosed worlds where employees pass on job referrals so relatives, classmates and longtime friends can work together. They share gossip and rumors, but also keep secrets that entrench bad behavior. Many feel deep loyalty to Ford and their union, and resent the female accusers, fearing they may damage the company and jeopardize good paychecks and generous benefits. Some women are suspected of gaming a system where sex is a powerful lever.Ford has worked to combat harassment at the plants, including recently stepping up disciplinary efforts and installing new leadership. But over the years the company did not act aggressively or consistently enough to root out the problem, according to interviews with more than 100 current and former employees and industry experts, and a review of legal documents.Ford delayed firing those accused of harassment, leaving workers to conclude that offenders would go unpunished. It let sexual harassment training wane and, women charge, failed to stamp out retaliation.The local union, obliged to protect both accusers and the accused, was divided, with a leadership that included alleged predators. And even the outsiders whom women turned to for help, including lawyers and the E.E.O.C., left some of them feeling betrayed.Ford officials say they view the harassment as episodic, not systemic, with an outbreak in the \u201990s and another beginning in 2010 as new workers flooded in. They say they take all claims seriously and investigate them thoroughly. Responding to the national outcry over sexual harassment, Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, released a video to employees last week about appropriate behavior. \u201cThe test would be if you go to work, have experiences, and go home and tell your family about it and be proud of what went on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not expect or accept any harassment in the workplaces here at Ford.\u201dShirley Cain, who arrived at the stamping plant five years ago and had to fend off advances from supervisors and co-workers alike, was skeptical. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reality,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even go on the floor, so they don\u2019t know what goes on.\u201dFrom the beginning, the women were targets. The first warning often came during orientation as new hires were paraded through the Chicago Assembly Plant. Shirley Thomas-Moore, a teacher who came to Ford to make better money, recalled the scene in the mid-80s: A man would hit his hammer on a railing, summoning the attention of the factory floor. \u201cFresh meat!\u201d the male workers hollered.\u201cWhen they come in, everybody\u2019s: \u2018Oh man, look at her. Nah, this is going to be mine,\u2019\u201d recalled her husband, Terrance Moore, who also worked at the plant.Men still stake their claims today, according to workers. Some women say they know how to shut down unwanted advances \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t play,\u201d they snap \u2014 while others say they have never encountered harassment. But James Jones, a union representative, said the problem should not be minimized, describing the attitude of many men at the factories: \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to eat that porterhouse steak.\u201dThe giant Chicago Assembly Plant sprawls like a low-slung fortress over an isolated stretch of Chicago\u2019s South Side near the Indiana border. The oldest continuously operating plant at a company that once revolutionized manufacturing with the Model T, it now churns out Ford Explorers and Tauruses.Women joined the work force during World War II, when the factory made M8 armored cars. But it was not until the 1970s that they routinely held permanent jobs on the line. By then, Ford had built a second factory, the Chicago Stamping Plant, to supply parts. Today, the two plants employ about 5,700; just under a third are women.As women were finding their way into Ford, the nation\u2019s manufacturing base was eroding, and overseas competition threatened the auto industry.Darnise Hardy, one of the first women to arrive, was told by male workers that she belonged at home in the kitchen. Ms. Thomas-Moore, who arrived a few years later, said some men felt that the newcomers were taking their jobs. Two decades later, a foreman told Suzette Wright that women should never have been hired.A job at Ford was considered a golden ticket. When Ms. Wright, a 23-year-old single mother, was offered a spot at Chicago Assembly in 1993, she was \u201ccrazy insane elated.\u201d She had been working part-time jobs as a hair salon receptionist and a data entry clerk. In an instant, her hourly wage tripled, to about $15. With overtime, workers could earn $70,000 or more a year, good money for those without a college degree \u2014 and an incentive to put up with a lot.Ms. Wright and others discovered a robust underground economy at the assembly plant: Everything from toys and televisions to drugs and guns were for sale inside, and sex outside. On the line, she would hear men regaling one another with stories about late-night parties with strippers in the parking lot. Ms. Thomas-Moore\u2019s father, who worked at the stamping factory, saw prostitutes and makeshift liquor trucks as he waited to pick her up from Chicago Assembly. \u201cBaby girl,\u201d she remembers him saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is part of Ford.\u201dAs Ms. Wright settled in, she asked a co-worker to explain something: Why were men calling out \u201cpeanut butter legs\u201d when she arrived in the morning? He demurred, but she insisted. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, peanut butter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wright recalled. \u201c\u2018Not only is it the color of your legs, but it\u2019s the kind of legs you like to spread.\u2019\u201dLike many of the female employees who eventually sued Ford, Ms. Wright is African-American; those accused of harassment include black, white and Latino men. Some of the women felt doubly victimized \u2014 propositioned and denounced as sluts while also being called \u201cblack bitches\u201d and other racial slurs. (The assembly plant\u2019s work force is predominantly African-American, while the stamping plant\u2019s is majority white.)As the affronts continued \u2014 lewd comments, repeated come-ons, men grabbing their crotches and moaning every time she bent over \u2014 Ms. Wright tried to ignore them. Veteran female employees warned that reporting the behavior brought only more trouble. The smallest infraction, routinely overlooked, suddenly merited a write-up. The very nature of factory work \u2014 the pressure to keep the production line going \u2014 gave bosses power to inflict petty humiliations, such as denying bathroom breaks.But after a man Ms. Wright had trusted as a mentor made a crack about paying her $5 for oral sex, she asked her union representative for help. He began what she calls a \u201cdon\u2019t-file-a-claim-against-Bill\u201d campaign: Her co-worker would lose his job, his benefits, his pension, she was told. Rumors spread, questioning their relationship. Then a union official delivered the final insult: \u201cSuzette, you\u2019re a pretty woman \u2014 take it as a compliment.\u201dThe same thing happened to Gwajuana Gray, who had followed her father into the assembly plant in 1991 and still works there. When she told her union steward that a manager had pressed his groin against her, he said she should be flattered. \u201cI was like, well, where do you go?\u201d she said.The accumulating misconduct took a toll. Some women quit. Others were emotionally spent.\u201cIt just was way, way, way, way too much,\u201d Ms. Wright said of the abuses. \u201cEach time that I was taking it, again and again, it just felt like more of me diminishing,\u201d she said, \u201cjust getting smaller until it was just like a shell of a person.\u201dShe and Ms. Gray both said they were overcome by anxiety and depression and took extended medical leaves. \u201cI was at rock bottom,\u201d Ms. Gray recalled.When their lawsuit was settled in 2000, Ms. Wright had to leave Ford. Ms. Gray was able to return. The harassment subsided for a while, she and others said, but soon came back. Louis Smith, a 23-year Ford veteran, could see some of the damage. \u201cI would never want my daughter to work in that environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as men have got to do better.\u201dThe latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.In the last five years, one woman said a male co-worker bit her on the buttocks. A supervisor told a female subordinate, \u201cI want to screw you so bad,\u201d she recalled. A laborer described in pornographic detail what he wanted to do to another woman, then exposed himself to her, she said; later, he pushed her into an empty room and turned off the lights before she fled.Those who complained said they faced retaliation from co-workers and bosses. Some women were frightened after harassers warned them to watch their backs. An Army veteran who accused a man of groping her was physically blocked by his friends from doing her work, she said. Later she found her car tires slashed in the parking lot.Ford officials say that they have a strict policy against retaliation, and that supervisors who exact retribution will be disciplined. But \u201cwhen you speak up,\u201d Ms. Gray said, \u201cyou\u2019re like mud in the plant.\u201dIn explaining why harassment became so ingrained, she and others described sex as a preoccupation at the plants \u2014 variously a diversion, a currency and a weapon. There were plenty of consensual affairs and flirtations, employees agree. Some women used sex to win favors from the overwhelmingly male hierarchy. Bosses rewarded those who acquiesced to their advances by doling out cushier jobs or punished those who spurned them, requiring them to do more taxing, even dangerous work.Miyoshi Morris gave in to a supervisor\u2019s leverage, and was filled with shame. She had been struggling to find day care centers for her children that were open early enough for her to make her 6 a.m. shift. By her account, a manager in the paint department told her she was in trouble because of tardiness. He could help her, she recalled him saying, if she came to his house on a day off he arranged.She agreed, and had sex with him.\u201cI was so lost, afraid, and realizing I had children to care for,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, her attendance record was no longer a problem, and she received better assignments. She remembers thinking, \u201cWhere else are you going to go and make this kind of money?\u201dThe manager, Myron Alexander, who was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and fired in 2014, did not return calls and Facebook messages seeking comment.Today, Ms. Morris works as an aesthetician for a fraction of what she earned at Ford. \u201cNo person should have to endure that,\u201d she said of the inappropriate behavior at the plant. \u201cYou have to force yourself into a place of not feeling anything, of not having any emotion, to exist.\u201dThe first place workers in trouble are supposed to turn for help is their union \u2014 a family, some call it. But when one member formally accuses another of sexual harassment, solidarity splinters.Mr. Jones, the United Automobile Workers representative, recalled a recent meeting when he was advocating for both sides \u2014 a woman and the man she accused. Ford issued its decision: termination. The man shot a despairing look at Mr. Jones.\u201cHow do you know the woman is telling the truth and she didn\u2019t get her buddies together to come up here and say this?\u201d Mr. Jones remembers thinking.Union representatives are caught between women\u2019s pleas to stand with them and men\u2019s pleas to save their jobs. And the Chicago union itself is now divided between those who champion women and those accused of preying on them.\u201cThe union has got an impossible job,\u201d said George Galland, who acted as an independent monitor at the two Chicago plants for three years. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to protect their members. Unions are ill at ease helping management control sexual harassment. They tend to throw monkey wrenches where they can.\u201dSome women at the plants say the union, whose leadership is mostly male, often met their calls for help with hostility, resistance or inaction. One woman said a representative downplayed a co-worker\u2019s vulgar commentary about her body, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s just him \u2014 the man has no filter.\u201d Another was told not to bother filing a report against a union representative who forcibly kissed her, saying it was her word against his.Tonya Exum, the Army veteran who reported being groped, recalled a union representative saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not sexual harassment. He only did it one time.\u201d When she asked him how he would feel if that happened to his mother or sister, he just walked away.The current lawsuit against Ford, which involves about 30 plaintiffs, accuses multiple local union representatives of harassing women or obstructing their complaints.But women also single out some union representatives for praise, including one man who said he spent hours helping women fill out claims. \u201cAs a union, we\u2019re supposed to be all one,\u201d said the man, who insisted on anonymity because he feared losing his job. \u201cIt frustrates me to see that others do not conduct themselves like gentlemen.\u201dIn 1979, even as sexual harassment was not yet settled law or a familiar concept to many Americans, the autoworkers\u2019 union was one of the earliest to include a clause in its contracts with Ford and Chrysler allowing members to file a grievance if harassment occurred. Its constitution condemns sexual harassment. And the union cooperates with Ford in training; Chris Pena, president of Local 551 in Chicago, said he emphasized the anti-harassment policy with every new employee during orientation.The Times would like to hear more about the experiences of women facing sexual harassment, especially those who are hesitant to speak up for fear of losing their jobs.Share your storyBut as the Great Recession ravaged the auto industry, economic survival eclipsed everything. Chicago Assembly was \u201con life support,\u201d said Bill Dirksen, Ford\u2019s vice president of labor affairs. The plant laid off 700 employees in 2008 and slashed production. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have sexual harassment if you don\u2019t have a company to work for,\u201d Mr. Pena said.That near-death experience haunts workers to this day. Fear that their well-paying jobs could evaporate if the plants become a headache for Ford drives some of the hostility toward women who complain of harassment. Terri Lewis-Bledsoe remembers a union representative warning her to stop filing complaints: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be called a troublemaker,\u201d she recalled him saying. She shot back, \u201cThen a troublemaker I shall be.\u201dThe top union official at Chicago Assembly, Alan Millender, who is known as Coby, is a polarizing figure. Some women praise him for helping them, and he has won two terms. Others have accused him of harassment, including Ms. Morris. She lost her job in January 2014 and turned to him for assistance. But Mr. Millender told her that she would have to get on her knees if she wanted her job back, she said. She should act like another woman who, moments before their conversation, had been pressed close to him, standing between his legs, Ms. Morris recounted.\u201cI could not compromise myself anymore,\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cMy job was lost.\u201dMr. Millender declined to comment on the allegations. In a brief telephone conversation, he said: \u201cMy record at Ford Motor Company has always been impeccable. The truth is always going to be the truth.\u201dNational U.A.W. leaders declined interview requests, and Ford officials do not comment on specific cases. But, Mr. Dirksen said, the company does not hesitate to punish anyone who violates its sexual harassment policy, whatever the union rank, and punishments of union members in the past have not provoked plant protests.When Howard Stamps, a longtime Ford veteran, transferred to Chicago Assembly several years ago from a plant near Detroit, he was jolted by the anything-goes culture he encountered. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like Chicago all the days of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think the rules apply to them.\u201dBy 2015, half of all sexual harassment and gender discrimination complaints lodged with the E.E.O.C. about Ford\u2019s domestic operations originated in Chicago.The company is unique among the Big Three automakers, controlled by one family since the days of Henry Ford. Blue-collar employees used to say they \u201cwork at Ford\u2019s,\u201d and family members still talk of their close ties to workers. But from the factory floor, many workers viewed the company as defensive and tentative about a long-simmering problem, enacting its strongest measures against sexual harassment only after pressure from female employees and outside forces like the E.E.O.C. and lawsuits.After long negotiations, the lawsuit was dismissed in exchange for a toughened settlement with the federal agency in 2000; Ford would pay $22 million, with $9 million in damages to women. Mr. Galland recalled that at least 100 women received payments. As is typical in such agreements, Ford denied liability. The company also pledged to make changes, which would be overseen by outside monitors.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t like the way H.R. was investigating these complaints, we told them and made them start over,\u201d said Mr. Galland, the chairman of the three-member monitor panel. \u201cWe told them it\u2019s not the paper procedures that count. A firing is worth a thousand words.\u201dFiring workers demonstrated that harassment came with steep penalties. But many men did not view their behavior as improper. Ms. Thomas-Moore, the former teacher, was among those asked to conduct the classes. \u201cOnce you crossed into what we call Ford World,\u201d she said, \u201ceverybody was supposed to be treated as co-workers.\u201d There should be no hugging. When employees found themselves in uncomfortable situations, she taught them to say, \u201cYou\u2019re in the yellow,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re in the red.\u201dSome men scoffed or cracked jokes. Still, she felt the training was having an effect. One day, a man spoke up, saying he had wronged a co-worker by lying about having sex with her, Ms. Thomas-Moore recalled. He asked that the woman come upstairs, then apologized to her in front of his classmates.For a time, many women said, the plants seemed \u201cquieter.\u201d When the monitors ended their stint in 2003, they gave Ford high marks. But their final report warned of \u201csignificant risks that need attention,\u201d including staffers inexperienced in investigating complaints, the lack of a policy against fraternization and the practice of promoting people widely perceived to be harassers. The report was prescient: Ford would struggle in those areas in the coming years.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to backslide,\u201d Mr. Galland said in an interview.Back from the brink of economic catastrophe in 2010, Chicago Assembly doubled its work force in a couple of years. A mix of young, inexperienced hires and transfers who resented leaving their hometowns flooded in.In the rush to ramp up production, the training lagged \u2014 several workers recalled receiving only a piece of paper outlining the harassment policy, and managers often refused to excuse workers for class, according to Ms. Thomas-Moore. Ford said the training never stopped, but acknowledged it peaked in the early 2000s.Complaints of harassment at the plants started spiking in 2011. Ford officials in the Dearborn, Mich., headquarters said that they dispatched a team to Chicago to insist on prompt but thorough investigations, and that they added staffers to tackle the growing pile of complaints. Training took on new urgency.Still, there appeared to be a gap of expectations. Like most companies, Ford was bound by privacy protections and unwilling to communicate specific findings. But some women felt grilled as if they were lying and frustrated that they were not told if the company was meting out discipline. \u201cWe were told it\u2019s been handled,\u201d said LaWanda Jordan, referring to her complaint about a supervisor who was fired two years later. \u201cThe case has been closed; we can\u2019t discuss it.\u201dIn assessing complaints, Ford struggled with verifying what often boiled down to he-said, she-said accusations. Mr. Galland, the monitor, acknowledged that false accusations were a real problem in factories. But because there often are no witnesses \u2014 or none willing to cooperate \u2014 and no evidence, he added that investigators must assess credibility on both sides.An employee who investigated complaints said Ford was insistent on proof. \u201cOur policy at Ford, told to us by our bosses \u2014 that I didn\u2019t agree with \u2014 was if there are no witnesses, there is nothing you can do,\u201d said Grant Crowley, a former labor relations representative at the stamping plant. (Mr. Crowley said he was asked to leave Ford this year after he posted on Snapchat an emoji expletive about a departed co-worker who left him with extra work.) Ford said investigators also took credibility into account.Even if investigators could not verify some individual accusations, company officials often failed to consider patterns of behavior, workers and lawyers say. Keith Hunt, the lawyer who represented women in the 1990s and today, described cases of four men who were the subject of numerous complaints by women dating back years \u2014 in one instance three decades ago \u2014 but were fired only in the last few years. Julie Lavender, director of personnel relations and employee policies, said that Ford now gave more weight to multiple complaints.Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.And even when there were witnesses, assessing credibility was often hard.Christie Van arrived at Chicago Assembly with the influx of transfers in 2012. She said a supervisor who had been giving her easy jobs like placing radiator caps began asking her to \u201cplay hooky\u201d from work with him. She claimed that the man, Mike Riese, told her his preferred nickname: \u201cHe called himself White Chocolate. He said that he had a black man\u2019s dick.\u201dAfter another supervisor, Willie Fonseca, showed her a picture of his penis on his cellphone, she said, Mr. Riese laughed and asked if she wanted to see his too. \u201cThat was it for me,\u201d she said.Both men denied that happened. Ms. Van filed a complaint in 2012. She showed investigators text messages from Mr. Riese, she said. According to company records obtained by The Times, several co-workers denied her account and described her as disgruntled to Ford investigators.But two other employees, Mr. Stamps and a man who insisted on anonymity because he feared retaliation, said they witnessed Mr. Riese\u2019s advances toward Ms. Van and heard him boast of his nickname. Neither was questioned in Ford\u2019s inquiry, they said.The documents indicate that the company did not substantiate Ms. Van\u2019s complaint. But later, without specifying any episodes, the E.E.O.C. determined she had been subjected to sexual harassment, retaliation and gender discrimination. Several other women accused Mr. Riese of harassment, which he denied. Mr. Riese said he was fired in 2015. \u201cMy life was shattered,\u201d he said.Although they do not comment on individual cases, Ford officials said discipline could be invisible when pay or bonuses were docked. They also said they believed in giving employees a chance to remedy behavior, although the company has fired workers if a first offense is egregious. But many people drew the same conclusion as Ms. Gray: \u201cThey get a slap on the hand and come right back to work.\u201dStarting about six years ago, multiple women once again turned to the E.E.O.C. and lawyers. The agency opened an investigation in 2014, and that same year Mr. Hunt filed a lawsuit. Ford accelerated changes as both were unfolding. Company executives said they acted independently of the inquiry and legal action.Still, Grant Morton, a former top union official at the plant, filed a suit charging that Ford managers discouraged him from helping women submit complaints and retaliated against him when he did. His suit claimed that a senior executive told him, \u201cYour people better stop complaining.\u201d The manager denied his account.Mr. Morton reached a confidential settlement with Ford that bars him from commenting. But Mr. Crowley, who investigated complaints at the stamping plant, said his managers \u201cdidn\u2019t want to admit any wrongdoing or punish the supervisors because they didn\u2019t want to add on to the case.\u201dIn August, Ford and the E.E.O.C. announced the $10 million settlement. Because the law imposes strict confidentiality on the agency when it reaches an agreement with an employer, it does not reveal details of what it found, who those accused of harassment were and which workers were involved \u2014 something some Ford women want to know.The agreement requires more improvements at Ford, including holding managers more accountable. \u201cHow do we ensure sustainability?\u201d Ford\u2019s Mr. Dirksen said. \u201cWe have to keep asking ourselves that question.\u201dOnce again, monitors will be watching closely, this time for five years. \u201cIt\u2019s something we push for,\u201d said Julianne Bowman, the agency\u2019s Chicago district director, when \u201cwe\u2019re really trying to come up with a culture change in the company.\u201dMs. Gray does not regret taking on her employer by joining the lawsuit decades ago. \u201cIf one person doesn\u2019t stand for everybody,\u201d she said, \u201cthen it\u2019s just a continual cycle.\u201dBut this time, she said, things must be different.Many of the women back then felt betrayed by both Ford and their lawyers, and said they were pressured into giving up their jobs. Their lawyers told them Ford insisted they resign as a condition of the E.E.O.C. settlement, for an additional payment. Ford lawyers later told a judge that was optional. Ms. Gray resisted but many of the others gave up the largest paychecks they would ever earn.Ms. Dunn received $225,000 in the settlement, legal records show, but as a divorced mother raising two children, she said that was no substitute for a Ford job. In 2000, her last year there, she earned $23 an hour; at Bed Bath & Beyond, she got only one-third that pay. She worked as a home health aide at night and mowed lawns during the day, inching her way back to $17 an hour. \u201cI\u2019m 61 years old, and I cut grass for a living,\u201d she said.Ms. Dunn and the other plaintiffs were outraged to find that their lawyers had claimed one-third of their awards in addition to the $2.75 million in fees the judge had approved, so they protested. The judge accused the lawyers of deception and ordered them to return the money to the women. Several lawyers on the case, including Mr. Hunt, were disciplined. He said the fees were legal and there was no intent to mislead the judge.Workers have their own ideas about how to make lasting change in the culture \u2014 having the equivalent of undercover cops walking the factory floors, plastering signs all over the plants warning about sexual harassment, punishing Ford with a far more painful settlement than $10 million, one on the scale of a recall.Ford said it had absorbed some lessons. The company appears more willing to fire people; Ford has disciplined 27 Chicago employees for sexual harassment and terminated five managers since January 2015, Ms. Lavender said. Others have received lengthy suspensions.So far, there are some signs of progress: The proportion of complaints about harassment or gender discrimination from Chicago is now about a quarter of those reported in its domestic operations, down from half in 2015.But the company is still struggling to win workers\u2019 trust. Some women still dread coming to the plants, and cite misbehavior that continues to this day. Recently, Ford officials said they noticed a small uptick in complaints and sent reinforcements to Chicago.Women said that those accused of harassment who remain at the plants angered and worried them most; they reel off lists of men who seem untouchable.Like Chicago Assembly itself, Ms. Gray has struggled and survived. Once again, a supervisor she says has a record of mistreating workers has been berating her, even showing up at her house. She logged repeated calls to a company anti-harassment hotline, to no avail. Her anxiety mounted; her friends worried about her.But just the other week, she was stunned when the plant\u2019s new human resources director welcomed her to his office and vowed to help. For the first time in years, Ms. Gray felt that a manager was taking her complaints seriously.Dec. 13, 2017Dec. 5, 2017Oct. 5, 2017Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Net Neutrality Is Gone", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsPai\u2019s stance is to say it\u2019s pro-competition to unravel regulations. Pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley says that that\u2019s bogus and that consumers will lose, while big corporations like Comcast will have free rein to jack up prices for different types of internet services. I fall in the latter camp.So, what say you here? I assume you\u2019re with me, though since you like to be contrarian on occasion perhaps you\u2019re going to go for the pro-Pai argument?Moving on, I wanted to get into a slightly wonky, somewhat overlooked section of the internet: Patreon and the uproar among its creative community.If you aren\u2019t familiar, Patreon is basically a payments platform used by artists and creative types, where they can charge or offer subscriptions to people for the types of things they produce. It ranges from writers and humorists to artists, journalists, crafty people, gamers \u2014 really whatever service you think people will pay to receive. It\u2019s been growing, and has an indie flair to an ancient practice. (\u201cPatrons\u201d were quite common among artists hundreds of years ago.)But Patreon is also a business that has promised huge gains to its investors, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it manages these two audiences. This time it seemed to go too far in the direction of its investors; perhaps now that it\u2019s been burned, it\u2019ll keep a closer eye on its indie artists.Yes, this is an extended way of saying, \u201cLook how smart I am.\u201d But also, it\u2019s more: Do you think we\u2019re basically creating artificial, overinflated value in these alternative currencies that really has no long-term staying power? And do we think a plethora of other, potentially scam alternative currencies may draft on the surging power of Bitcoin? (Hint: The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d)No, seriously, I think for once you have a point. There\u2019s no earthly way that Litecoin becomes something people will use and consider valuable in the future. It\u2019s obviously being run up by bubbly speculation. But Bitcoin?

{"Headline": "How Big Tech Is Going After Your Health Care", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Daniel Poston, a second-year medical student in Manhattan, opened the App Store on his iPhone a couple of weeks ago, he was astonished to see an app for a new heart study prominently featured.People often learn about new research studies through in-person conversations with their doctors. But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Literally.\u201cRunning essentially saved me from the streets of Brooklyn,\u201d said Mr. Ruiz, who grew up in the projects of East New York and Brighton Beach.\u201cI was raised in neighborhoods that were pretty tough at the time \u2014 there were a lot of gangs \u2014 and one of the big things growing up for me was, if you don\u2019t join these gangs or you\u2019re not involved in certain things, people don\u2019t like you,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to be in with certain groups.\u201dDuring his coaching career, Mr. Ruiz, 56, has trained elementary school students and septuagenarians, first-time joggers and professionals, friends and strangers.His passion for the sport, which has empowered him to help so many others, dates to eighth grade, when Mr. Ruiz joined the team at Mark Twain Intermediate School 239 on Coney Island.\u201cRunning not only gave me something to do and kept me busy, but the community also got behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave me the ability to still fit in with my community and not feel like an outcast.\u201d\u201cI never volunteered for coaching; people would always ask me to do these things,\u201d said Mr. Ruiz, who was given his first solo coaching gig at 26. It was for the Zephyrs, a girls\u2019 team in his old neighborhood in Brooklyn. \u201cI did it to help the community, maybe give back a little bit, maybe set some people on the right path. I just thought it was a good thing to do, a noble thing to do.\u201dThese days, his studio in Queens resembles the coach\u2019s corner of a varsity locker room: The hat hooks are draped with medals; the shelves are spilling over with world championship trophies; the walls are decorated with framed photographs of finish lines and awards ceremonies.In the weeks after Hurricane Maria, Mr. Ruiz spent time away from his usual running paths, packaging boxes of canned food and water at a local firehouse.\u201cIt was devastating to know that so many in my family were being affected and continue to be affected,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said. \u201cI\u2019ve had three cousins that actually relocated, and these are people that have never left the island; they don\u2019t know what an airplane is. I have a cousin who literally started building his house with his own two hands \u2014 I go on Facebook every day, and you can see it coming together.\u201dHis sister, whose house was swallowed by the storm, has since moved in with their mother, Mr. Ruiz added.\u201cMy mileage spiked up dramatically over these past two or three months because when I go out and run, pushing past the limit makes me feel like I\u2019m suffering a little bit with them,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said. \u201cAnd because of that, I came up with the idea that I\u2019d do this race.\u201dWith the help of his siblings in New York and Florida, Mr. Ruiz hopes to reach $15,000 through his campaign and deliver the last supplies to Puerto Rico before Three Kings Day celebrations on Jan. 6.\u201cI guess if you do enough nice things in this world,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said, wiggling his sneakers on before a morning run through Jamaica Estates, \u201cpeople will take notice.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The bitter cold is here to stay into 2018.Don\u2019t let the sunny skies fool you \u2014 today\u2019s high of 20 degrees will feel more like minus 5 with the wind chill.Commence hibernation mode.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The When and Why of Amontillado", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolAmontillado is one of those wines that pose an immediate and difficult question: When do I drink this bottle?The more different wines you drink, the better your instinct becomes for which bottle to open, which ingredient to add to the meal to create a wonderful harmony. But when does that instinct signal amontillado?Certain wines, amontillado for one, are riddles nowadays: When to drink, what to serve; what\u2019s their role, their use?These historic wines, revered through the ages, seem to be anomalies in the 21st century, searching for footholds to hang on. Here at Wine School, we reserve special respect for wines that have stood the test of time, even if they are puzzling to the modern palate.This month we have been drinking amontillado, and it is telling that fewer readers than usual took up the challenge of commenting on these bottles.It\u2019s likely that you have read somewhere that a wine\u2019s alcohol content is a meaningless number, that the meaningful thing is whether the wine is balanced. Nonsense. That sentiment is fine if you are in a professional tasting situation swishing some wine around in your mouth and spitting it out. But if you are actually drinking that wine, alcohol content can be of the utmost importance.The Castilla, for example, the best and most complex of these amontillados, is 19 percent alcohol, roughly 27 percent more than a fino, which would typically be about 15 percent, and about 46 percent more than a 13 percent still wine. That\u2019s a lot of extra alcohol.As I was drinking these amontillados with various dinners, I realized that I liked them best by the glass, with some nuts or ham, as an aperitif. I really enjoyed drinking a glass as I was cooking, paying attention to their nuances and complexities in small sips before drinking some other wine with the actual meal.Perhaps this seems something of a bait and switch. Why invite readers to drink amontillado with a meal if that\u2019s not the best way to enjoy it? I can only say that Wine School is an education for me, too. This time, I learned how I enjoy amontillado best.The thing is, amontillado is fascinating and delicious. It deserves contemplation. And pondering several of them together is revealing and educational. Why fascinating? It stems from the process of making sherry.When the still palomino wine is ready to embark on its voyage toward sherryhood, it is put into barrels. These barrels are not completely filled (as they would be with almost all other wines), which allows air to occupy the empty space.Barrels in which the flor does not form in sufficient quantity on the wine become oloroso, the other type of sherry. These olorosos will be characterized by the interaction of oxygen and wine over time, rather than of flor and wine. They are fortified beyond the level at which flor can survive and set aside for their very different journey.Eventually, the cellar master will decide that a wine is ready for bottling. If the flor is still vigorous, it will be bottled as fino. But if the flor has begun to die off (a process that may be hastened by fortifying the wine to 17 percent), it is a candidate to become amontillado. As the wines continue to age, they are no longer protected by flor, so oxygen begins to affect the sherry.Amontillados, then, are simply finos (or manzanillas, as finos are known if they come from the port town of Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda) that have outlived the flor and gained additional oxidative character like olorosos, but still retain the influence of the flor.Therein lies part of the fascination. Amontillados travel an arc of evolution in which their origin and destination coexist in a tense balance that can be tasted.The Hidalgo La Gitana Napoleon, for example, seemed not so far evolved from its younger days, when it set out as a manzanilla. It was tangy and saline like a manzanilla, refreshing, bracing and delicious, with an aroma of chamomile. Yet the Napoleon had another component as well, a nutlike, caramel quality that marked it as amontillado. Though several readers suggested it was sweet, I have to disagree. It was absolutely dry.The T\u00edo Diego also seemed like a young amontillado, hewing close to its fino days. It was more delicate in texture than the Napoleon, and just as saline. The piquant influence of the flor was still apparent, perhaps more so than the nutty, butter toffee flavors indicating its amontillado evolution.It\u2019s important to remember that these are introductory amontillados. Both Hidalgo La Gitana and Valdespino also sell older, more expensive amontillados that are thrilling in their complexity.The Castilla Antique is in the middle, older than the other two but still reasonably priced at $40. It shows the years, with the flor character in the rearview mirror rather than upfront. It was darker and more concentrated, precise and detailed, with aromas and flavors of toffee, nuts, lanolin and cinnamon arriving in layers.Sure, this wine can be delicious with mushroom risotto. But I\u2019d prefer it in the library, if I had a library, with a cigar, if I smoked cigars, which I suppose is part of what makes these wines seem to be of a bygone era.Nonetheless, this was a gripping wine that stimulated my imagination and filled me with wonder. A wine this good will always have a role to play.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Hotel Concierges Endangered by Apps? Don\u2019t Bet on It", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an age when so many travel tasks can be done with an app, is the hotel concierge \u2014 that font of local wisdom with the connections to land a hot last-minute reservation \u2014 about to be superseded?Not according to Joanna Husk, who has been a concierge at the Grand Hyatt San Francisco for almost 28 years and is a member of Les Clefs d\u2019Or USA, the American chapter of the global trade association for hotel concierges.\u201cThere is no app that can get to know you quite like the human app,\u201d she said.Ms. Husk does use GoConcierge \u2014 software that helps hotel concierges manage their work, handling tasks like sending confirmation letters and itineraries to guests, and maintaining a record of all activities they have booked for guests. But it is a supplement to her work, not a replacement.She said, for instance, that she was recently asked by an East Coast executive to plan a day\u2019s visit in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley for nine people from China who were setting up a business on the West Coast. She had to arrange a luncheon and tour of the wine country for them after a morning meeting. With her knowledge of the wine country and Bay Area traffic patterns, she suggested that the group visit a vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains instead. The vineyard was a 20-minute drive from Silicon Valley and close enough to San Francisco for everyone to return by 7 p.m., change and relax before dinner.A Google search would not have been sufficient, she said. Nor can the internet always be a trustworthy source of information, because, as James Little, chef concierge of the Peninsula Beverly Hills, said, \u201cit contains a lot of information that\u2019s not verified and is from people who are not experts.\u201dThe services offered by a hotel concierge may seem a luxury. But that\u2019s the point. If they do their job well, concierges can help strengthen their hotels\u2019 bottom line, since skilled ones can \u201coften inspire the guest to come back to a hotel,\u201d said Noah Lemaich, director of brand standards for Sixty Hotels and former head concierge for Thompson Hotels.The question is whether web-based concierges offer the same advantages.Fran\u00e7ois Delahaye, general manager of the Paris hotel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e and chief operating officer of the Dorchester Collection of luxury hotels, sang the praises of human concierges in a recent interview. \u201cIf the concierge can get tables at Le Jules Verne, L\u2019Ami Louis and other restaurants in Paris, it\u2019s not because of the tools they use, but because of the amount of business they bring, having contacts for a long time with the restaurant\u2019s headwaiter, ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and manager.\u201dStay Delightful offers what it calls a \u201cmessaging-based guest service solution\u201d that allows hotel employees to communicate and collaborate across departments and interact with guests, via text.The Ivy platform, from the travel technology company Go Moment, uses artificial intelligence to answer guests\u2019 questions, also by text. Ivy, for example, can send guests a hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi password, order drinks or towels to be sent to their room or help them check out electronically. It is used by hotels providing different levels of service, including those that do not have human concierges.Stay Delightful and Ivy also can notify guests of their ability to check in early or check out late, which they may have to pay an additional fee for, thus generating revenue for their hotel.In September, Cambria, an upscale Choice Hotels brand, began a pilot program at its two Chicago hotels that allows guests to contact local food and lifestyle bloggers via Twitter and Instagram for suggestions. Should the pilot go well, Choice will make the program available next year to guests at all Cambria hotels. Cambria hotels do not provide in-house concierge services.And a small niche player, What Should We Do?, offers suggestions for a wide range of activities in New York City, on a website and app, and charges travelers fees for some of its services.Hotel executives, concierges and executives of concierge tool companies all agreed the rise of texting and of social media and apps like Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and WeChat have greatly increased demands on concierges.Rainy Chan, who until recently was the general manager of the Peninsula Hong Kong, said the workload of the seven concierges employed there has tripled from 2007 to 2017. \u201cAlthough technology helps them find information a lot faster, it also changes the expectations of guests. They expect a faster response. And the concierges get very last-minute requests for recommendations.\u201d\u201cTen or 15 years ago, they only serviced guests in the hotel,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, because of technology, they get a lot of emails from people who are not staying, but who are coming soon and have questions about Hong Kong.\u201dMs. Chan said the concierges at her hotel take turns focusing exclusively on replying to email messages. Mr. Delahaye said the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e\u2019s 18-person concierge staff has a dedicated secretary to respond to guests\u2019 messages and help plan their itineraries. Both hotels use GoConcierge.Robert Marks is chef concierge at the Omni Hotel San Diego, which is connected to Petco Park, the Padres\u2019 baseball stadium, and president of Les Clefs d\u2019Or USA. Mr. Marks said he contacts certain guests, including members of Omni\u2019s frequent stay program and individuals chosen at random, a week before their arrival to see if they have any special needs. He also lets them know about arts and sports events, in case they want tickets. He and his staff also call guests, like those celebrating a birthday or anniversary or frequent visitors, upon their arrival and every night of their stay. His hotel is also a GoConcierge customer.Holly Stiel, a veteran San Francisco concierge who now teaches companies in and out of the travel field how to provide concierge services, said she believed that human concierges were here to stay. \u201cAs long as people place value and are willing to pay for personalization\u201d and other attentions, there will be a demand, she said. Mediocrity, she added, \u201cwill certainly be replaced by technology, but the true concierge artist can never be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a veteran of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d President Trump\u2019s former boardroom-high jinks reality show competition, has delivered both production-perfect elements to the Trump White House.Still, the woman who cultivated a reputation as the ultimate TV villain is urging viewers to stay tuned to find out why she really left.As the spectacle surrounding Ms. Newman\u2019s departure promises to carry over into the Trump administration\u2019s second year, her telegenic antics have not been entertaining to several West Wing aides. In a workplace where drama and chaos have been features, not bugs, Ms. Newman was known for contributing to both.\u201cAs the only African-American woman in this White House,\u201d Ms. Newman said in the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview, \u201cI have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people. It is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.\u201dThe world will have to wait. Ms. Newman has not elaborated, other than to say that she had been trying to raise \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about an issue that would \u201caffect the president in a big way.\u201d Former and current White House officials said they were uncertain what she was referring to. But she has rejected one suggestion: that Mr. Trump holds racist views.\u201cYes, I will acknowledge many of the exchanges \u2014 particularly in the last six months \u2014 have been racially charged,\u201d she added. \u201cDo we then just stop and label him as a racist? No.\u201dOn Facebook, Armstrong Williams, a conservative media personality and a friend of Ms. Newman\u2019s, noted that her departure had closely followed the loss by Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred candidate in the Alabama Senate race, \u201cFunny how her story is knocking Roy Moore off front pages.\u201d On Friday, Ms. Newman declined to comment.Ms. Newman\u2019s time came to an end in the Situation Room during a meeting with Mr. Kelly. It is an unusual place to hold a discussion about employment, but one where the backdrop is both intimidating and quiet, perhaps to calm an exchange that had the potential to spiral out of control.Ms. Newman said that the two \u201chad a very candid conversation,\u201d and that Mr. Trump learned that she had departed while watching television news.When Mr. Trump took office, Ms. Newman was a familiar face for the president in a sea of newness, and she enjoyed relatively easy access to the Oval Office.Ms. Newman\u2019s bond with the president was not one that extended to the president\u2019s other aides. Tension had been building from the start, according to a senior West Wing official. She could be biting, several staff members said.Others close to the president think Ms. Newman may choose to remain in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces instead of speaking out against his administration, despite the end of her White House plotline.\u201cOmarosa has known, admired and respected President Trump for over a decade,\u201d Michael D. Cohen, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump, said on Friday. \u201cDespite the rumors, I doubt she would ever do anything that would jeopardize their relationship.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality\u2019s Holes in Europe May Offer Peek at Future in U.S.", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast spring, Swedes got a tantalizing offer: If they subscribed to Sweden\u2019s biggest telecom provider, Telia Company AB, they could have unlimited access on their mobile phones to Facebook, Spotify, Instagram and other blockbuster apps.The issue is now working its way through the courts. As it does, the offer is still available.Such deals may be gaining momentum in the United States.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on Thursday to roll back the net neutrality rules in the United States. While the European Union has such rules in place, telecom providers have pushed the boundaries at times in Sweden, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, offering a glimpse at the future American companies and consumers may face if protections are watered down.For the European Union\u2019s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.That\u2019s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren\u2019t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.That doesn\u2019t necessarily bother consumers.\u201cFrom a user perspective, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem and I think most consumers don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. \u201cThere are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify. But then they get free surfing on Spotify.\u201dWasn\u2019t net neutrality being compromised? \u201cIt\u2019s not Cuba,\u201d Mr. Haglunds replied. \u201cCuba has a problem,\u201d he said, citing the country\u2019s severe restrictions on the internet.A Swedish court ultimately overturned the decision on technical grounds after Telia appealed. Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries. But Sweden\u2019s administrative court is expected to issue a broader decision on zero rating rules this year.Critics of the rollback in the United States have cited zero ratings schemes in Europe, or versions of it, as an omen of how the web may be split.\u201cProviders are starting to split the net into packages,\u201d Mr. Khanna wrote.In Germany, a similar case involved a Deutsche Telekom offer called StreamOn, which allows users to access unlimited videos and music from specific partners like Netflix. The country\u2019s telecom regulator approved the deal, drawing criticism from consumer activists.

{"Headline": "Making It Relevant: Helping Students Connect Their Studies to the World Today", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by_________Every day on The Learning Network we ask ourselves two questions.First, what is happening in the world that students need to know about and grapple with?Second, how does what\u2019s happening in the world connect with the literature, history, civics, science, math and art we know teachers are teaching?It\u2019s our job to help make those connections to save teachers time, but, of course, our real aim is to help students make them for themselves.As we write in our introduction to the challenge:So you\u2019re studying the Civil War \u2014 or Shakespeare, or evolution, or \u201cThe Bluest Eye.\u201dWhy? What does it have to do with your life and the lives of those around you? Why should you remember it once you\u2019ve turned in that paper or taken that test?What relevance does it have today? What lessons can you learn from it that can be applied to the world outside of school? What parallels do you see between it and something happening in our culture or the news?Although your teachers probably pose questions like these already, this challenge invites you to answer them a little more formally.Essentially, we\u2019re asking you to do what we do every day: connect what\u2019s in The New York Times with what you\u2019re learning in school.You can use the activities below whether or not your students are participating in the challenge. On their own, they can be an interesting way to end a unit or a semester.Questions? Comments? Ideas? As always, let us know in the comments.In the first, students match quotations from famous literary works to the world today. In the second, they look at how the same trends, patterns and concepts they study in global history manifest in the news around them.Students can work alone, in pairs or in small groups to fill in each blank with at least one real-life event or person to which each of the quotations or standards might apply. Coming up with three in a row horizontally or vertically earns them a bingo \u2014 though make sure to have students explain the connections they made before naming a winner.For extra credit, students might try to find something in a recent issue of The New York Times that relates to the quote or standard in each box.You can also make your own bingo game with quotations or concepts from the specific texts or textbooks you are teaching \u2014 or, better yet, invite your students to create their own.What we suggest students do in this section is almost exactly what we do on our site every day. There are two ways to go about it.You can either start with a news source, like The Times, and work backward to curriculum, or you can start with curriculum and connect it to what\u2019s in the news. (You can also try both.)The two exercises below can help students get started. You can do either, or both. Here\u2019s how.1. Start with the world and connect it to your curriculum.Any teacher can do this any day with The New York Times, simply by inviting students to flip or click through recent issues looking for articles or images that remind them of something they have studied in school this semester.You can limit students to one particular text or topic, or open it up so they are searching for connections to anything they\u2019ve studied that semester. And you can use a collection of old print newspapers from several recent dates, or invite students to browse NYTimes.com for anything from this year.The fun \u2014 for them and for you \u2014 will be in the explanations. After students have chosen one strong match, invite them to meet in pairs or small groups to describe why they chose what they did, then ask them to write those explanations up for homework.The next day, students can post their picks and written explanations, gallery-style, around the room, and the whole class can rotate around this exhibit to see the ideas others had.As a class you might discuss: How many connections were similar? Which were the most surprising or interesting? What new connections can we make as a class after seeing all this work?Here are examples from our own Text to Text series in which something in The Times reminded us of an often-taught text or historical event:\u2018The Catcher in the Rye\u2019 and \u2018The Case for Delayed Adulthood\u2019Colin Kaepernick\u2019s National Anthem Protest and Frederick Douglass\u2019s \u2018What to the Slave Is the 4th of July?\u2019\u2018Speak\u2019 and \u2018Waking Up to the Enduring Memory of Rape\u2019\u2018The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u2019 and \u2018The Sequel\u2019\u2018When I Consider How My Light Is Spent\u2019 and \u2018Today\u2019s Exhausted Superkids\u2019Bangladesh Factory Safety and the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire\u2018The Outsiders\u2019 and \u2018Bored, Broke and Armed\u20192. Start with your curriculum and connect it to the world. You can also go the other way, by starting with the texts or topics you\u2019re studying in class and reaching for connections to students\u2019 own lives and to our society and culture.But before you set your students to the task, decide the scope of the material they will be working with. Would you like them to take on a single novel, historical event or scientific discovery, or will they be reflecting on content from an entire unit or semester?If you choose to take on something with a larger scope, like a semester\u2019s worth of content, you might first brainstorm as a class everything they have read or studied. What texts were covered? What eras, events or people did they learn about? What big questions did they investigate? What concepts did they learn? What themes did they explore?You might then invite each student to choose one text or topic he or she would like to focus on, and form small groups with others who make the same choice.Next, have students look over the prompts below, responding to them on their own at first before meeting with others who have chosen the same text or topic to expand their lists together. Brainstorm all the ways that the text or topic you have chosen relates to the world today. To help, consider the following questions. Keep in mind that the three categories may blur as you go, since the goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible.)For example, if you are studying a historical event or era, what other texts and genres take on the same event, or echo the same questions or issues? If you are studying a novel, what parallels between the plot, characters, themes or settings do you see in other works? If you are working with a concept rather than an individual text, in what ways does that idea show up in books, movies, or the visual arts?Next, ask students to choose one of the connections they listed \u2014 perhaps the one they feel is the strongest or most interesting \u2014 and explore it further by finding information out in the world somewhere, whether in a news source, their communities or their own homes, that illustrates that connection.Finally, as with the first exercise, this work might culminate in a gallery walk. Students can write up their connections and post them around the room, then the whole class can circulate to see the work. End by discussing the same questions as a class: How many of the connections were similar? Which were most surprising or interesting? What new connections can we make together?Here are some examples from our own Text to Text collection in which we started with a frequently taught text and looked for Times articles that show its continued relevance to the world today:The Gettysburg Address and \u2018Why the Civil War Still Matters\u2019\u2018The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\u2019 and \u2018On the Reservation and Off, Schools See a Changing Tide\u2019\u2018The Glass Castle\u2019 and \u2018Life on the Streets\u2019The Bill of Rights and \u2018The Bill of Rights We Deserve\u2019\u2018Huckleberry Finn\u2019 and \u2018In Defense of a Loaded Word\u2019\u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 and \u2018Montague and Capulet as Shiite and Sunni\u2019Another way to help make interesting and unexpected connections is to simply search and see what comes up.Students can do this step after brainstorming or on its own \u2014 and they should know that this is something we do daily on The Learning Network ourselves.\u201cWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \u2014 and that is on us,\u201d Ms. Sandberg wrote.It was a candid admission that reminded me of a moment in Mary Shelley\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d after the scientist Victor Frankenstein realizes that his cobbled-together creature has gone rogue.\u201cI had been the author of unalterable evils,\u201d he says, \u201cand I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.\u201dIf I were a Facebook executive, I might feel a Frankensteinian sense of unease these days.For example, students might:We hope you\u2019ll be surprised and delighted by what you find. ._________How do you make connections between your classroom content and the world?

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Weddings, 4 Dozen Rabbis and 1,400 Cupcakes", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was no cocktail hour, no chicken dinner, no teary-eyed mothers and fathers, and no beaming grandparents. But this was a grand Jewish wedding celebration, which took nine months to plan, in one of the largest synagogues in the United States.Three couples, each denied Jewish wedding ceremonies in Israel for various reasons, were married on Dec. 3 in a ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.Gady Levy, the executive director of the Temple Emanu-El Streicker Center, and Rabbi Joshua Davidson, the senior rabbi at the temple, began planning the event last March. \u201cWe met with people from the Israel Religious Action Center in Israel to find a way to make a change in the marriage laws there, and we decided that having a real wedding in New York was the way,\u201d Mr. Levy said.In order to produce the wedding, Mr. Levy said with a smile, \u201cI became a part-time wedding planner.\u201d The event he arranged was a stunner: Three couples were married in a traditional ceremony with klezmer music, violins, flowers, white wedding dresses and cupcakes. It was an event he called \u201cThree Weddings and a Statement.\u201dThe festivities started at the Friday evening service at Temple Emanu-El, where Rabbi Davidson spoke, beginning the pre-wedding ceremony for the couples with a traditional blessing.\u201cWe love Israel and wish it to be the spiritual homeland for all Jews,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wish for all Jews and non-Jews alike to be treated equally there. The events this weekend are about religious and civil liberties in Israel.\u201dThe three couples had no bridesmaids, no groomsmen, no parents attending.But there were more than 1,300 guests, six rabbis leading the ceremony and about 40 more who stood with them to bless the newlyweds at the closing of the Sunday wedding ceremony.It was produced flawlessly, like good theater, set in the sanctuary of the Romanesque Revival building with its 60 stained-glass windows and an altar built of marble flanked by sturdy columns of golden mosaics that soar. It might have seemed like theater (tickets, which were free, were needed for admission), but the message and the messengers were very serious.Since there is no separation of church and state in Israel, there is no going to city hall to be married. And for a Jewish wedding in Israel, a couple must fulfill the Orthodox rules of marriage. Those rules include the fact that same-sex unions are not permitted; the acquisition whereby the groom pays a bride price as is reflected in the wording of the traditional marriage contract (ketubah); and if the marriage does not work out, only the man is allowed to initiate a divorce.However, in New York City any couple, gay or straight, may obtain a marriage license; have a legal, civil ceremony; or ask a rabbi or other person who is certified to sign the license.And so, there in the huge, majestic Emanu-El sanctuary, under a wedding canopy, and dressed in a strapless wedding gown designed by Danielle Caprese, stood Ori Berwald Shaer, 30, ready to marry her best friend and the love of her life, Alona Livneh, 26, who wore a blue pantsuit and a pink bow tie. Both women, who live in Tel Aviv, are activists in the gay and lesbian community in Israel.The couple arrived in Manhattan on Friday morning, went to City Hall \u2014 where they obtained a marriage license in 30 minutes \u2014 and were off to find a wedding dress for Ms. Shaer to wear. (Kleinfeld Bridal donated the three wedding dresses.)\u201cThe ease of getting a marriage license here was very exciting,\u201d Ms. Shaer said.Ms. Livneh said: \u201cThe dream is to get married in Israel, in our language, in our culture, with our family and friends. But with that not being possible we\u2019re going with the next best option.\u201dDani Dayan, the consul general of Israel in New York, said in a text message that it is \u201cno secret many members of the American Jewish community disagree with existing Israeli legislation on civil status issues. Israelis pay serious attention to the positions of our brethren across the Atlantic, and ultimately the Israeli Knesset \u2014 elected democratically by the Israeli citizens \u2014 legislates. I wish a heartfelt Mazel Tov to the couples married today in New York.\u201d(The Israeli Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbinate in Israel did not respond to a request to comment about the event.)But legally recognized weddings abroad \u2014 whether civil, or any other form \u2014 are recognized by the Interior Ministry for the purposes of being registered as a married couple in Israel.Gali Geberovich, 29, and Alon Sela, 30, met seven years ago on a kibbutz. Both finished their military service and were working, without pay, he in a cowshed, she in a factory.\u201cWe smelled really bad after a day of work, but it was very romantic,\u201d Ms. Geberovich said. They now live in Tel Aviv, where she works for the reform movement while studying for a master\u2019s degree in Jewish education at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and Mr. Sela is an analyst in an investment banking consulting firm with an interest in high technology and renewable energy.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want any ceremony that doesn\u2019t reflect our beliefs and values as a couple,\u201d Ms. Geberovich said. \u201cWe have a really respectful and equal relationship, and the ceremony of the Orthodox does not reflect it.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to use our privilege and be part of an institution that doesn\u2019t recognize other couples. We have in our family, we have our friends, same-gender couples and they don\u2019t have the right to get married and it\u2019s unbelievable. And also, I didn\u2019t want to be part of that institution.\u201dFor Valentine Boldovsky, 29, and Elizabetha Komkov, 27, students at the Technion in Haifa, a wedding in the United States was also a solution to a spiritual problem they have in Israel, a country they both emigrated to with their families for reasons of oppression where they were born.Ms. Komkov and Mr. Boldovsky, both born in St. Petersburg, Russia, met as young teenagers at a Jewish Sunday school run by the Jewish Agency in St. Petersburg. Both families immigrated to Israel; hers in 2004, his in 2005. The two had lost track of each other but became reacquainted five years ago on Facebook.Even though Ms. Komkov was raised in a Jewish family, she decided to convert in Israel with a reform rabbi in order to have proof of her Jewishness. She did not have proof, she said, because her maternal grandmother was given to a Christian family during Stalin\u2019s time in Russia, when many Jewish families were persecuted. Therefore, Ms. Komkov had no documents to prove maternal religious heritage. A reform conversion is not recognized by the strictly Orthodox religious authorities in Israel.Mr. Boldovsky said, \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Liza to bring this heritage and the memory of her grandmother.\u201dHe said that because Ms. Komkov is not considered Jewish enough for the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel they wanted to make a statement. \u201cSo someone will hear it, so people will pay attention, so they will know that there is a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that this problem will not go on for our children and so on and so on. I\u2019m not separating the marriage from the political aspect, I am separating my vows to my wife from the political aspect, because it\u2019s about love, not about any of this mess.\u201dOn Sunday, before the ceremony, while guests were taking their seats in the sanctuary, a klezmer band led by Michael Winograd entertained the audience and set a joyful, foot-stomping mood.When the music ended, each couple entered from side aisles, one partner from each side, joining in the center to walk up the steps to the altar, taking their places under three wedding canopies that were on the stage. Each canopy had one of three words printed on the front: \u201cEquality,\u201d \u201cJustice,\u201d \u201cLove.\u201d Under each canopy were a couple and two rabbis, one female, one male.The traditional ceremony included drinking wine from silver goblets, the chanting of the seven blessings by Cantor Mo Glazman of the temple and the breaking of glasses (both brides and grooms stepped on glasses, which is not traditional but served as a nod to feminism and equality; historically only the groom breaks a glass). Afterward, about 40 rabbis from all denominations, including Modern Orthodoxy, joined the couples on the stage for concluding prayers, songs and spirited circle dancing.The klezmer band started up again as the now married couples happily pranced back up the center aisle to a loud, collective yell of \u201cmazel tov\u201d from the crowd.And just outside the temple doors on Fifth Avenue, there were 1,400 white wedding cupcakes waiting, each with a tiny plastic solitaire ring atop the shiny frosting.Arielle Dollinger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Sexual Misconduct, Gillibrand Keeps Herself at the Fore", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the floodgates opened on Wednesday to cast Senator Al Franken aside, following a half-dozen accusations of sexual misconduct, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand had positioned herself at the crest of the wave.It was the second time in a month that Ms. Gillibrand, of New York, widely considered a possible presidential candidate in 2020, stepped to the forefront of the national debate about sexual harassment and powerful men.That remark set off an unwelcome round of backward-looking questions for a Democratic Party that has tried to focus on the multiple women who have publicly accused President Trump of sexual misconduct, and the current Republican Senate candidate in Alabama, Roy Moore, who is accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls as young as 14.\u201cI think when we start having to talk about the differences between sexual assault and sexual harassment and unwanted groping you are having the wrong conversation,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference when asked about calling on Mr. Franken to resign. \u201cYou need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is O.K. None of it is acceptable.\u201cAnd we, as elected leaders, should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women, and that is where this debate has to go,\u201d she added.Politically, she has created a political action committee to raise money and encourage women to run for office. She calls the PAC Off the Sidelines, the same name she gave her book. (Mrs. Clinton wrote the foreword.)\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all that she wants to be on the leading edge of these discussions,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and former chief of staff to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cIt certainly follows what her interests have been in the Senate.\u201dWhile some people have embraced her stances on Mr. Franken and Mr. Clinton, others have questioned the timing, especially on Mr. Clinton, after he and his wife have exited the political stage.Matt Canter, a former aide to Ms. Gillibrand who remains in touch with the senator, said, \u201cMany people are proud that, at a time like this, she is providing moral clarity both among people in public office and within the Democratic Party.But Mr. Holmes noted: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be critical to Bill Clinton. It\u2019s another thing to be critical after his relevance is done.\u201dFor years, Ms. Gillibrand has been politically allied with the Clinton family. Mrs. Clinton was one of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s early and most important calls when she first considered running for Congress. When Mr. Clinton campaigned for her ahead of her 2006 congressional election, she wrote in her book, \u201cThat day still seems like a dream.\u201dMs. Gillibrand\u2019s allies have tried to smooth matters over with the Clinton world since her resignation comment. They have noted that her statement about Mr. Clinton\u2019s resignation came after she was asked the question more than once, that she paused before answering and that she noted Mr. Clinton had served in a different era.In the following weeks, Ms. Gillibrand and other Democratic female senators have engaged in a sustained conversation about what to do about Mr. Franken \u2014 on the phone, in person and, at least once, in a women\u2019s restroom on Capitol Hill.Ms. Gillibrand has visibly struggled with how to treat Mr. Franken, a close political ally in the Senate whom she described in Wednesday\u2019s Facebook posting as a \u201cfriend\u201d and as \u201ca colleague I am fond of personally.\u201dJust the day before, at a women\u2019s conference sponsored by Politico in Washington, she had refused to say whether she thought Mr. Franken should step down, even as she said she was \u201cangry,\u201d called for \u201caccountability now\u201d and said his behavior was \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t be tolerated anywhere.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to say that today,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said on Tuesday of Mr. Franken\u2019s possible resignation.\u201cAt this moment,\u201d she concluded, \u201cwe need to speak hard truths or lose our chance to make lasting change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Son in a Shadow, Finding His Way, Meets a Grim End", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCarmine Carini was a convicted robber whose weapon of choice in one spree was a machete.He was the son of a locked-up mobster, an absent father who had given him little more than a name.He was also a father himself, starting over in the straight life, a proud and meticulous florist who posted pictures of his Mother\u2019s Day arrangements on Facebook.But it was how Mr. Carini\u2019s life ended that brought broader attention to his colorful, complicated story, when, on Sept. 2, he was found wrapped in a blue tarp and floating in the Mill Basin inlet of Jamaica Bay, tied to a cinder block intended to weigh his body down. It did not.There may have been any number of possible motives for killing Mr. Carini, 35, tucked in the folds of his \u2014 or his father\u2019s \u2014 criminal history, but the truth remained hidden.Then on Nov. 29, three months after the killing, two suspects were charged: twin brothers whom Mr. Carini had known for many years. They had been caught halfway across the country after a high-speed chase that ended inside a Walmart.With the charges came the realization that nothing in the history of the victim or his father could have predicted what the police said was his bizarre end at the hand of old friends.Mr. Carini was born in 1982 under a cloud of crime. His father, also Carmine Carini, an associate of the Gambino family, went to prison when his son was 3 years old, convicted of murdering a record store owner. A second son, Vincent, had been born just days before his arrest.By then, the younger Carmine was finding his way, for good and bad.\u201cLike anyone who grew up without a father, he had to learn his own way to become a man,\u201d said Christina Frisone, a girlfriend and the mother of their son. \u201cYou make mistakes in life, not thinking of the consequences afterward because you\u2019re so young.\u201dThere would not be a reunion with his father.The year before, unable to hold down a job, the elder Carmine Carini, with others, had committed a series of robberies on Staten Island. They were dressed like police officers and targeted specific types of victims: drug dealers and gambling establishments.\u201cI tried my best to be a good citizen for myself and my sons,\u201d he told a judge at his sentencing in 2010, according to a court transcript. He had been living with Vincent. \u201cMe and my son had a nice apartment and did long-awaited things together. Then I lost my job. Things got worse by the week.\u201dHe said he had \u201cstupidly agreed\u201d to commit the robberies, and he wanted to apologize, \u201cespecially to my sons.\u201d He was sent back to prison for six more years.On the outside, young Carmine seemed to be making good use of his freedom. He opened a flower shop called Fountain Blue off Avenue N near Mill Basin, happily busy.\u201cChitchat, chitchat, people coming,\u201d recalled a barber nearby who gave only the name Tony. The owner of a neighboring nail salon who tended to Mr. Carini\u2019s eyebrows said he was a good neighbor: \u201cI never heard anything bad about him.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t hearing everything. Mr. Carini was in and out of prison three times for violating his parole. His absence took a toll: The flower shop closed.In 2015, tragedy struck the Carini family. With his brother and father in prison, Vincent Carini, the younger son, died in his bathroom of a drug overdose. He had injured his back playing football in high school, and an operation did not help. In a story line that has become grimly familiar in New York and around the country, he was prescribed painkillers and became addicted.The younger Carmine was allowed to attend the funeral, wearing shackles.He was released several months later and seemed ready to go straight. He had a son with Ms. Frisone, and he posted proud-father pictures. He returned to selling flowers at a pop-up stand he set up before Mother\u2019s Day, under a tarp on Strickland Avenue outside a barbershop. That latest stint in prison would be his last.When two lifelong friends \u2014 twin brothers, Vincent and Louie Iacono \u2014 asked him to move in with them to help with the rent, Mr. Carini agreed. It was a step up from a dark studio where he was living.\u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m going to move into a really nice house. The baby\u2019s going to have his own bedroom,\u2019\u201d Ms. Frisone, their son\u2019s mother, recalled. \u201cHe trusted them. They just took complete advantage of this kid.\u201dThe brothers worked in construction, their van labeled Julu Contracting. They lived on East 64th Street in Mill Basin, on the working-class edge of a neighborhood known for its mansions.They seemed to do everything in unison, selling furniture on Sundays at a flea market, getting joint haircuts at the barber shop on Strickland. The first time they were arrested, in 2001, they were together, bashing a car with a baseball bat.Vincent Iacono grew to have a long history of drug-related arrests, the police said. Louie Iacono\u2019s arrest record is shorter, with most of the cases sealed.Mr. Carini moved into their house on East 64th Street in July. He would be dead in a month.On Aug. 30 or Aug. 31, Louie Iacono struck Mr. Carini in the head with a hammer inside the house, the police said. The blow was fatal. Investigators believe the attack was over money, the police said.The brothers wrapped Mr. Carini in blue tarp \u2014 it appeared to be the one he kept for his pop-up flower stand \u2014 and weighed it down with the cinder block and construction materials, the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office said. Surveillance video shows the brothers dumping the body in the water, that office said.Theresa Marchiano, Mr. Carini\u2019s mother, said that when she could not reach him, she called Louie Iacono.\u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, Theresa, he\u2019s on his way to rehab,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Don\u2019t lie to me.\u2019\u201dFour days later, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Henry County, Ind., pulled over a Chevrolet Avalanche for following too closely. The officer approached the truck and observed two men and \u201cmultiple indicators of criminal activity,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. He asked the driver, Louie Iacono, to step out, but instead the truck sped away.A 12-mile chase along wide-open fields followed, until Louie Iacono pulled into a Walmart parking lot and dashed inside, shedding clothing along the way. He was arrested, as was his brother, and officers found drugs and bloody hammers in the vehicle, the police said.Their mother works at a hardware store on Avenue L. She declined to comment last week. The brothers pleaded not guilty in court on Thursday. A lawyer representing Vincent Iacono declined to comment.Mr. Carini had told friends and family that he was saving up for a new flower shop. His son is 5. Mr. Carini had hoped the boy would join him when he got older, making it a father-and-son operation.Advertisement"}

For many showing up to buy her recently published memoir, \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine,\u201d the area around her served as a sort of pop-up safe space to express their pain.Some of her readers, she said, have experienced the most horrific abuses imaginable. The kind of abuses, she said, if someone were to put it in a movie, it wouldn\u2019t seem realistic.Some would wait at the end of the line to meet her so they could get more time. End-of-the-line people were especially raw, Ms. Union said, as if their traumatic event just happened. Their story would tumble out in the seconds it would take for her to sign their book. And then came the tears.Ms. Union would weep too, in her hotel room every night on the tour, thinking of what some of these women had suffered. \u201cCrying like I\u2019m at a funeral,\u201d she said.The actress has been in the public eye for over 20 of her 45 years, so it\u2019s fair to say that these people sharing sensitive material with her don\u2019t feel as if they\u2019re meeting her for the first time.And the likes poured in.Since 2013, after big roles in \u201cBring It On,\u201d \u201c10 Things I Hate About You\u201d and \u201cUgly Betty,\u201d Ms. Union has been playing the lead character in the award-winning BET drama series \u201cBeing Mary Jane.\u201d ABC is developing \u201cWhite Dave,\u201d a comedy that she will executive-produce along with LeBron James. And she is in early discussions, she said, about turning her book into a television series.If this materializes, it promises to be harrowing. \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine\u201d contains Ms. Union\u2019s own heart-wrenching, deeply personal stories: about her infertility struggles, her childhood during which she lived in the all-white Pleasanton, Calif., for the school year and spent summers with her grandmother and cousins in a predominantly black neighborhood in North Omaha. About her first marriage, to the N.F.L. player Chris Howard, and subsequent divorce; her relationship with her father; and about the time she was raped at gunpoint when she was 19. Her assailant was caught, and he took a plea deal of 33 years in jail. She doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s still there. She doesn\u2019t want to know.The book was the natural outgrowth, Ms. Union said, of years of therapy.\u201cThere\u2019s a valve at the bottom of my canister where I can let things out in a healthy productive way,\u201d Ms. Union said over lunch at Maialino, an Italian restaurant. \u201cLike Skype sessions with my therapist, with friends, silence, sitting out in nature, time with the kids, with my dogs. Watching \u2018This Is Us\u2019 \u2014 that has been quite therapeutic.\u201dHer house in Cleveland is so quiet that a buck often hops into her backyard. She likes having a cup of coffee when no one is around, and stares at that deer.But such solitude isn\u2019t always easy to find. Mr. Wade has sole custody of two sons (Zaire, 15, and Zion, 10) from his first marriage, to Siohvaughn Funches, as well as custody of his nephew (Dahveon, 16). Ms. Union said she will sometimes claim \u201cgastrointestinal issues\u201d in the bathroom just to get a few minutes alone.\u201cI fake diarrhea a lot,\u201d she said, laughing.When she first saw #MeToo trending, her arm went numb, she told Ms. Roberts. \u201cPost-traumatic stress syndrome from the rape,\u201d Ms. Union said on the air, visibly shaken, her mouth quivering.All of the hugging and the touching on the book tour, as rewarding as it\u2019s been, can be difficult for her as a trauma survivor, she said at lunch. In \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine,\u201d she writes, \u201cNo one understands how much female celebrities are physically touched and grabbed and shoved and fondled.\u201d She needs to sit facing out in restaurants such as this one, for instance, because she cannot enjoy her meal with her back to the door.Robinne Lee, an actress and the author of \u201cThe Idea of You,\u201d who has been a friend since the early 2000s, said she understood Ms. Union\u2019s motivation for writing and that her candor is not new. \u201cBlack women are not a monolith, and we all have very different experiences,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cSo I think it was important for her to show that she had all of these different facets of her life.\u201dMs. Union said that in her tour, only certain airports displayed the book, and that she had heard from readers that they had asked for it in certain cities, only to find it was still in stacks on the floor or in carts in the back. \u201cSo I started asking people to tell me what stores this was happening in. You don\u2019t want to alienate booksellers,\u201d Ms. Union said, \u201cbut where\u2019s my book?\u201dOne store, she said, began promoting her book only after the store was deluged by a Facebook campaign.Kima Jones, the founder of Jack Jones Literary Arts, a publicity company, and who mostly represents black authors \u2014 including the Pulitzer Prize winner Tyehimba Jess and the PEN America prize winner Rion Amilcar Scott \u2014 was not surprised that Ms. Union, who is not her client, felt \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine\u201d received inadequate support.Ms. Jones wondered if the glamorous aspects of Ms. Union\u2019s life might lead sellers to underestimate the gravitas of \u201cWe\u2019re Going to Need More Wine.\u201d\u201cThat in and of itself is a tragedy considering that her book \u2014 I hate to use the word \u2018timely,\u2019 because this is something that should have been part of the cultural conversation for a long time \u2014 but it is very ripe and very timely,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no reason we shouldn\u2019t be talking about Gabrielle Union\u2019s book beside Roxane Gay\u2019s work or Leslie Jamison or Maggie Nelson\u2019s work or any of the other women who are talking as critics of popular culture.\u201dMs. Union thinks she didn\u2019t visit enough cities or enough stores. She\u2019d like to do a second leg of the book tour. And maybe there will be one, especially given how invested she is in the public discussion around sexual assault. A lot of times her tour stops felt like a revival, she said.\u201cIf those people hadn\u2019t been Hollywood royalty,\u201d she asked, referring to some of the women who first spoke out about Harvey Weinstein. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t been approachable. If they hadn\u2019t been people who have had access to parts and roles and true inclusion in Hollywood, would we have believed?\u201d\u201cWhen we have the microphone, how often do we pass it back to the people who are experiencing a different challenge, but who are equally worthy as having the microphone?\u201d Ms. Union asked.And then she stopped herself. \u201cI just did this,\u201d she said, and stretched her hand backward, over her head, as if she was symbolizing a passing of the microphone to someone behind her.But the microphone shouldn\u2019t be passed behind, she said, acknowledging that many people still feel ignored.\u201cIt should be passed to the side.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified an actor. He is Michael Urie, not Jayma Mays.Advertisement"}

This week\u2019s entry is by an American who was touched by the kindness of Australian strangers after her friend died unexpectedly.SydneyBy Ana RamanaThree years ago, a man in Sydney responded to some poems of mine he found online. We wrote back and forth and soon became fast friends.After many Skype sessions and heart-to-heart conversations, Andrew invited me to visit him. I had airline miles to use that would get me there from California. And Andrew offered to pay for me to stay at an Airbnb nearby, an expense he could barely afford.We made plans to go to the Great Barrier Reef. In the meantime he wandered the neighborhoods of his city, sending me photos of leafy avenues and stunning architecture.And then. He died. Just like that. A heart attack.I actually found out on Facebook when I saw a photo of him someone had posted. I was heartbroken, in shock.I postponed my trip until I felt I could face landing in Sydney without Andrew there. Two of his friends, with whom I had connected online, agreed to meet me. One, Mary, offered to come from Canberra. The other, Yantra, invited us to the Central Coast where we could have a small ceremony to honor Andrew.I was all packed to come last year when fate intervened. Two acute physical injuries had me immobilized. On the day of my planned departure, I woke in excruciating pain. I emailed the Airbnb host, telling her to please keep the down payment as it would only go back to Andrew\u2019s card.To my surprise, the host wrote back saying she would save the apartment for me for the following year.Honestly, I\u2019d been thinking maybe Australia wasn\u2019t meant to be.

The vast majority are \u201cunsheltered\u201d \u2014 a more bureaucratic term to describe the thousands living on the streets, under freeways and tucked into grassy fields and parks in cities all around the state.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a bigger increase than we would have expected,\u201d said Ben Metcalf, the director of the state\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development. \u201cThere\u2019s a tale of different countries here: We\u2019re seeing a real significant increase and much of the rest of the country is not. We\u2019re all doing the same things, but here the rent is too damn high. We\u2019ve seen an incredible increase in the cost of housing.\u201dAbout 1.6 million households are considered to be living in \u201cworse scenarios,\u201d Mr. Metcalf said, living with low-wages and spending more than half of their income on housing. That number has ballooned continuously through much of the last decade, while wages have remained flat.Dozens of city and county governments have declared homelessness an emergency in the last two years, something Gov. Jerry Brown has refused to do on a statewide level.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what it would do for us that we can\u2019t do already,\u201d Mr. Metcalf said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Peter Burnett was the first governor of the State of California, ascending to the post on December 20, 1849. But his ignominious legacy is hardly known today.Mr. Burnett came from Missouri via Oregon, settling near Sacramento amid the Gold Rush. Just as he had done in Oregon, Mr. Burnett pushed to exclude blacks from the state. While he seemed to couch his argument in antislavery terms, he was merely \u201cdisguising\u201d his \u201cequal opportunity racism,\u201d said William Deverell, a historian and the director of the Huntington-U.S.C. Institute on California and the West.\u201cHe was not particularly unusual at all at the time,\u201d Mr. Deverell said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the really vicious attacks on Native Americans started coming and gave way to genocidal violence. He was early opponent of the Chinese, which leads to the exclusion act. He really shows you can be antislavery and a racist to the core without any difficulty whatsoever.\u201dThough he is included in fourth grade state history, Mr. Burnett\u2019s name has largely been erased from the public sphere. His name was on a San Francisco preschool as well as an elementary school in Long Beach, but was recently taken down and replaced at both schools after reports of his views and statements resurfaced.\u201cHe talked in this undeniably ugly way about people, so we should talk about how we\u2019ve honored him,\u201d Mr. Deverell said. \u201cThese are not issues that are reserved for other parts of the United States without resonance in California.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Jakarta Is Sinking So Fast, It Could End Up Underwater", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "JAKARTA \u2014 Rasdiono remembers when the sea was a good distance from his doorstep, down a hill. Back then he opened the cramped, gaily painted bayside shack he named the Blessed Bodega, where he and his family sell catfish heads, spiced eggs and fried chicken.It was strange, Rasdiono said. Year by year, the water crept closer. The hill gradually disappeared. Now the sea loomed high over the shop, just steps away, held back only by a leaky wall.With climate change, the Java Sea is rising and weather here is becoming more extreme. Earlier this month another freakish storm briefly turned Jakarta\u2019s streets into rivers and brought this vast area of nearly 30 million residents to a virtual halt.Jakarta Is Sinking10 milesMore than 2 inches per year Less than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEA1984-19912010-2015Approximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTAJakarta Is Sinking10 milesMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEA1984-19912010-2015Approximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA10 milesJakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearApproximate extent of built-up areaJAVA SEAJAKARTA1984-19912010-2015Jakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per year Less than 2 inches per year1984-1991JAVA SEAApproximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA10 miles2010-2015Jakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEAApproximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA1984-199110 miles2010-2015Subsidence data courtesy of Irwan Gumilar of Geodesy Research Group of ITB | Satellite images via Landsat 5 and Landsat 8By Jugal K. PatelOne local climate researcher, Irvan Pulungan, an adviser to the city\u2019s governor, fears that temperatures may rise several degrees Fahrenheit, and the sea level as much as three feet in the region, over the coming century.That, alone, spells potential disaster for this teeming metropolis.But global warming turned out not to be the only culprit behind the historic floods that overran Rasdiono\u2019s bodega and much of the rest of Jakarta in 2007. The problem, it turned out, was that the city itself is sinking.In fact, Jakarta is sinking faster than any other big city on the planet, faster, even, than climate change is causing the sea to rise \u2014 so surreally fast that rivers sometimes flow upstream, ordinary rains regularly swamp neighborhoods and buildings slowly disappear underground, swallowed by the earth. The main cause: Jakartans are digging illegal wells, drip by drip draining the underground aquifers on which the city rests \u2014 like deflating a giant cushion underneath it. About 40 percent of Jakarta now lies below sea level.Coastal districts, like Muara Baru, near the Blessed Bodega, have sunk as much as 14 feet in recent years. Not long ago I drove around northern Jakarta and saw teenagers fishing in the abandoned shell of a half-submerged factory. The banks of a murky canal lapped at the trestle of a railway bridge, which, until recently, had arched high over it.Climate change acts here as it does elsewhere, exacerbating scores of other ills. And in Jakarta\u2019s case, a tsunami of human-made troubles \u2014 runaway development, a near-total lack of planning, next to no sewers and only a limited network of reliable, piped-in drinking water \u2014 poses an imminent threat to the city\u2019s survival.Sinking buildings, sprawl, polluted air and some of the worst traffic jams in the world are symptoms of other deeply rooted troubles. Distrust of government is a national condition. Conflicts between Islamic extremists and secular Indonesians, Muslims and ethnic Chinese have blocked progress, helped bring down reform-minded leaders and complicated everything that happens here, or doesn\u2019t happen, to stop the city from sinking.\u201cNobody here believes in the greater good, because there is so much corruption, so much posturing about serving the public when what gets done only serves private interests,\u201d as Sidney Jones, the director of the local Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, put it. \u201cThere is no trust.\u201dHydrologists say the city has only a decade to halt its sinking. If it can\u2019t, northern Jakarta, with its millions of residents, will end up underwater, along with much of the nation\u2019s economy. Eventually, barring wholesale change and an infrastructural revolution, Jakarta won\u2019t be able to build walls high enough to hold back the rivers, canals and the rising Java Sea.And even then, of course, if it does manage to heal its self-inflicted wounds, it still has to cope with all the mounting threats from climate change.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.As far the eye can see, 21st-century Jakarta is a smoggy tangle of freeways and skyscrapers. Spread along the northwestern coast of Java, this capital of the nation with the world\u2019s largest Muslim population used to be a soggy, bug-infested trading port for the Hindu kingdom of Sunda before local sultans took it over in 1527.They named it Jayakarta, Javanese for victorious city.Dutch colonists arrived a century later, establishing a base for the East India territories. Imagining a tropical Amsterdam, they laid out streets and canals to try to cope with water pouring in from the south, out of the forests and mountains, where rain falls nearly 300 days out of the year. Thirteen rivers feed into the city.\u201cLiving here, we don\u2019t have other places to go,\u201d said Yudi and Titi, a young professional couple who one recent Sunday had made the roughly hour\u2019s round trip from western Jakarta to the center of the city just to spend a few minutes walking up and down a chaotic, multilane freeway briefly closed to traffic. \u201cWithout cars, at least you can breathe for a few minutes,\u201d Titi said.The most urgent problems are in North Jakarta, a coastal mash-up of ports, nautically themed high-rises, aged fish markets, abject slums, power plants, giant air-conditioned malls and the congested remnants of the colonial Dutch settlement, with its decrepit squares and streets of crumbling warehouses and dusty museums.Some of the world\u2019s most polluted canals and rivers weave a spider\u2019s web through the area.It is where the city is sinking fastest.The aquifers aren\u2019t being replenished, despite heavy rains and the abundance of rivers, because more than 97 percent of Jakarta is now smothered by concrete and asphalt. Open fields that once absorbed rain have been paved over. Shores of mangroves that used to help relieve swollen rivers and canals during monsoons have been overtaken by shantytowns and apartment towers.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.And many of the rural poor have settled in Jakarta in informal developments, or kampungs, that cluster along canals, their houses teetering above the water on stilts, the waterways underneath becoming default sewers.All of these homes, all of this sewage and garbage now jam pumping stations that the city has had to build because gravity no longer drains the rivers and canals naturally.To halt the sinking, the city needs to stop the digging of wells, which means Jakarta must provide residents with reliable, clean, piped-in water and, to clear the waterways, somehow \u2014 at a cost of untold billions \u2014 retrofit one of the world\u2019s biggest cities with a sewer system, or something approaching it.Cleaning the canals and rivers will also require policing the factories that dump chemicals, which means grappling with corruption \u2014 and resettling many of the informal communities. But resettlement depends on finding land and then building thousands of new homes for displaced residents, most of whom don\u2019t want to move in the first place.That was before the bulldozers arrived. The Akuarium I found had been reduced to mounds of broken masonry and concrete.\u201cThe government said the eviction was about cleaning the river, but I believe it was about politics and development,\u201d Topaz told me, reflecting a belief widely held among residents. He showed me around the tattered, windswept tent he shares with a dozen other squatters not far from where his family home used to be. Over his shoulder, several luxury waterfront apartment towers were under construction. \u201cI saw promotions for those towers that showed Akuarium turned into a park,\u201d Topaz said.And he cleared out some of the kampungs that obstructed waterways. The efforts began to make a difference. Rains that once caused days of floods drained within hours.But many people forced out, like Topaz, resisted the moves, convinced that the evictions were really intended to enrich developers, not improve drainage. Akuarium became a hotbed of protest against the governor.At another evicted settlement called Bukit Duri, I met Agus Fadilah, 34, a motorbike-taxi driver, gazing at the rubble of what used to be his house on the banks of the Ciliwung, one of the city\u2019s main rivers. Bulldozers were still moving piles of debris, and a few women were scavenging for family belongings.Upstream, several other kampungs had already been cleared, the river widened, its banks lined with concrete and surrounded by high concrete walls, now tagged with graffiti. The river there looks imprisoned, but water flows more easily.\u201cI was raised here, my job was here,\u201d Mr. Agus said, noting that he, his wife and two young children had been relocated to a new apartment building hours away. They make long daily commutes because they want to keep the children in their old schools.\u201cI know why they did this,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt had to do with the river. I know this was not legally our land. But it was my home.\u201dResidents of Bukit Duri filed a class-action lawsuit against the government to protest the evictions. Recently, a district court judge ruled in their favor.\u201cIt\u2019s not that nobody should move,\u201d argues Elisa Sutanudjaja, a kampung advocate and the executive director at the Rujak Center for Urban Studies. \u201cThese poor communities don\u2019t all want to stay in place, but they do want to stay together and near their jobs, and they want legal status.\u201cMostly, they want to be consulted,\u201d she said.They also want to show, where possible, that moving isn\u2019t the only solution. In a leafy kampung called Tongkol, residents during the last couple of years have installed their own septic tanks and kept their stretch of the Ciliwung clean. A young architect named Kamil Muhammad, from Architecture Sans Frontieres-Indonesia, designed a low-cost home made of concrete, bamboo and reused brick. It stacks seven tiny apartments under a covered communal roof deck.The project is a template for cheap, do-it-yourself housing that can free up space along Jakarta\u2019s waterways critical for flood control.\u201cWe want to demonstrate to the government that kampungs can actually be beneficial to the river,\u201d Kamil told me as we looked over the river from the roof deck. Below, banana and star fruit trees shaded a riverside promenade of colorful facades and vegetable gardens.\u201cWe need big steps now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all the discussions get tied up with fishermen and development, there will eventually be a massive calamity and deaths and no choice but to give up on whole parts of Jakarta.\u201dThere is occasional talk here about the Indonesian government moving its capital elsewhere, to shrink the city. Politicians issue decrees prohibiting developers from digging wells and imploring residents to store rainwater. Enforcement is negligible.Mr. Brinkman drove me one morning to the city\u2019s new 16-mile Eastern Flood Channel, its banks lined with parkland. The channel has helped relieve flooding. From there we toured a century-old water gate, also recently repaired. \u201cA few years ago this was solid waste,\u201d Mr. Brinkman said, gesturing across the wide, murky water. On the opposite bank, sanitation crews in bright orange outfits gathered around garbage trucks. They belonged to Ahok\u2019s Orange Army.\u201cThis gate is nothing like it used to be,\u201d Mr. Brinkman said. \u201cYou used to be able to walk across the water, it was so clogged with garbage and sediment.\u201dAs he spoke, one of the orange-clad sanitation workers leaned his head back, polished off a bottle of water and tossed the empty plastic container over one shoulder into the river.Real progress is often thwarted here. The most ambitious move by the city is the construction of what\u2019s called the Coastal Wall, now rising like a black cliff from Jakarta Bay. It\u2019s a quasi-temporary barrier to hold back the rising sea and compensate for subsidence \u2014 built extra high because, like the rest of North Jakarta, it is expected to sink, too. With subsidence at the current rate, the Coastal Wall itself may be underwater by 2030.Even more alarming, Mr. Brinkman showed me one spot along the waterfront where the wall ends and all that holds back the sea is a low, crumbling concrete rampart. The water was only a couple of feet below the top when we peered over the embankment.\u201cIf this wall breaks, there\u2019s simply no holding back the Java Sea,\u201d said Mr. Brinkman, gesturing from the rampart toward the city. \u201cJakarta will flood all the way to the center of town, six kilometers from here. I could take you to 20 other places just like this.\u201dThe dike would not just block rising waters. According to the original plan, it would also become the spine for an immense new megadistrict and ring road, a $40 billion development \u2014 and a windfall for real estate moguls and Dutch consultants \u2014 designed in the shape of a garuda, the national bird.The Great Garuda, as it came to be called, was Jakarta\u2019s Big Idea.The government has now backtracked on the megadistrict idea, while still envisioning the dike itself \u2014 the very notion of which has provoked understandable skepticism. As environmentalists have pointed out, if the city doesn\u2019t first clean up its rivers and canals, a dike will turn an enclosed Jakarta Bay into the world\u2019s largest cesspool.The development scheme was also linked to discredited plans for reclaimed islands inside the bay. Delayed for years by recession and legal wrangling, the islands started to get built in 2013, marketed as posh oases of condominiums, yacht marinas and golf courses primarily to customers in places like Malaysia and Singapore.Enraged fishermen sued, claiming that the islands destroyed their traditional fishing grounds. When one developer was exposed for bribing local officials, a scandal erupted and construction was halted.At the same time, the islands had become tied up with the Great Garuda. Officials, including Ahok, realized that a tax on the islands\u2019 developers could help Indonesia pay for the giant dike, along with other costly initiatives to clear waterways and stop the sinking.In essence, a plan that environmentalists and many poor fishermen agreed would wreak environmental havoc on the bay and North Jakarta was being touted by Jakartan leadership as a means to save the city itself \u2014 and from climate change.From Mr. Brinkman\u2019s perspective, just \u201ccounteracting subsidence will account for 90 percent of what this city needs to do to deal with climate change.\u201dTokyo was in a similar predicament after World War II, he likes to point out. It had sunk about 12 feet since 1900. But the city poured resources into new infrastructure and established stricter rules about development, and within a decade or two made itself a global model of urban innovation, better able to cope with the effects of climate change.\u201cJakarta could become a 21st-century version of Tokyo in the 20th century, an example for urban redevelopment,\u201d Irvan Pulungan, the climate change adviser to the city\u2019s new governor, imagined.But \u201ca city that can\u2019t deliver basic services is a failed city,\u201d he added. \u201dOn top of conventional issues like flooding and urbanization we now have climate change, tipping the scale. And at this rate, people will be fighting in the streets for increasingly limited resources like clean water and safe living spaces.\u201dLike Tokyo half a century ago, Jakarta is at a turning point, he said: \u201cNature will no longer wait.\u201dRestidia Putri contributed research.Map by Jugal Patel.

{"Headline": "New York Today: History in a Holiday Window", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayUpdated, 7:48 a.m.Good morning on this damp Monday.Between the Radio City Rockettes and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, the holidays in New York City are nothing if not flashy.Another beloved, sparkly holiday tradition? The window displays that line Fifth Avenue\u2019s iconic storefronts.The displays do far more than advertise clothing; they are works of art in their own right. And though they emerge for only a few months every year, the artists behind them work on them year-round.Mr. Gagnon said he began collecting ideas in March. He and David Hoey, Bergdorf\u2019s director of visual presentation, visited the museum several times. They also spent days poring over the organization\u2019s online archives.When Mr. Gagnon saw an item that caught his eye \u2014 an old parking meter, or a Tiffany lamp \u2014 he set to work in his downtown Manhattan apartment, painstakingly reproducing each item with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, Bubble Wrap and masking tape. While each of the 83 handmade items in the window has a historical counterpart at the museum, Mr. Gagnon took some artistic liberties, turning some portraits into sculptures, or tall statues into figurines.Mr. Gagnon and Mr. Hoey especially agonized over what figures to put at the center of the display, flanking the mannequin in a Gucci dress, Mr. Hoey said. They toyed with Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, or a Pilgrim and a Native American from an old New York City seal.They settled upon a bear and a bull, inspired by a 19th-century board game called \u201cThe Great Wall Street Game.\u201d The final figures are seven feet tall.While Mr. Gagnon sculpted the items, designers at Bergdorf mapped them on a 3-D visualization software. Then came the installation in the window itself, in October. The Bergdorf staff worked in top secret, behind tarps that obscured the view from the street. The windows were unveiled on Nov. 14.The greatest challenge, Mr. Hoey said, was combining scholarly appreciation for the museum\u2019s holdings with the desire to transform them into a spectacular holiday display.Mr. Gagnon, who was born in Ohio but has lived in New York for almost 30 years, said the window is his own love letter to the city.\u201cI made a conscious effort to push different kinds of people in the window,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I did put George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in there, I wanted to celebrate all different kinds of walks of life in New York, because that\u2019s really what New York is to me.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Here\u2019s hoping you kept your windows closed overnight, as a cold rain gave the city an early-morning soak. The rest of the day should be dry, though a bit muggy for this time of year, with temperatures staying in the low 40s.Tuesday is expected to be warmer, before things return to the 40s and stay there through the end of the week.You could spend all day taking in Mr. Gagnon\u2019s window at Bergdorf, but that would mean missing all the other spectacular displays.We spoke to the visionaries behind some of New York\u2019s other iconic holiday windows, and they pointed out a few details of their creations that you might not have otherwise noticed.And die-hard Disney fans should try to spot the hidden Mickey Mouse heads in every window. Mr. Briggs offered a hint for the window showing the seven dwarfs crossing a log: look at the mushrooms.The displays are built off-site in Woodside, Queens, and then disassembled and transported to the store\u2019s basement, said Roe Palermo, Lord & Taylor\u2019s divisional vice president of store visuals. They\u2019re reassembled underground and then raised into the windows on hydraulic lifts.But look closer and you\u2019ll see details on the opposite end of the scale. Phillip Nuveen, an artist who specializes in miniatures, also designed tiny Christmas trees and shopping bags, each just an inch or two tall, said Pina Ferlisi, Bendel\u2019s creative director.Alexandra S.

{"Headline": "Deliverance From 27,000 Feet", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "Five Sherpas surrounded the frozen corpse. They swung axes at the body\u2019s edges, trying to pry it from its icy tomb. They knocked chunks of snow from the body, and the shattered pieces skittered down the mountain. When they finally freed a leg and lifted it, the entire stiff and contorted body shifted, down to its fingertips.More than a year of exposure to the world\u2019s wickedest elements had blackened and shriveled the man\u2019s bare face and hands. His hydrant-yellow summit suit had dulled to the hue of a fallen leaf. The bottom of his boots pointed uphill. His frozen arms were bent at the elbows and splayed downhill over his head. It was as if the man sat down for a rest, fell backward and froze that way.The Sherpas picked at the body and used gestures and muffled words to decide how best to move it off the mountain. The ghoulish face and bone-white teeth scared them, so they covered the head with the jacket\u2019s hood.There was no time to linger. That altitude is called the \u201cdeath zone\u201d for good reason. The Sherpas knew from experience how difficult it was to scale the world\u2019s highest mountain. The only thing more daunting might be to haul a dead body back down.The man\u2019s name was Goutam Ghosh, and the last time anyone saw him alive was on the evening of May 21, 2016, when it was obvious that he would become another fatality statistic, soon frozen and as inanimate as the boulders around him.Ghosh was a 50-year-old police officer from Kolkata, part of a doomed eight-person expedition \u2014 four climbers from the Indian state of West Bengal and four Sherpa guides from Nepal \u2014 that ran out of time and oxygen near the top of Everest. The four Bengali climbers were eventually abandoned by their guides and left to die. Three did; only one, a 42-year-old woman named Sunita Hazra, survived, as did the guides.At the time of the tragedy, the climbing season for Everest was almost over. On their way to the summit over the next two nights, the last two dozen of the year\u2019s climbers had come upon Ghosh\u2019s rigid corpse on a steep section of rock and ice.To get around him, climbers and their guides, sucking oxygen through masks and double-clipped to a rope for safety, stripped off their puffy mittens. They untethered the clips one at a time, stepped over and reached around Ghosh\u2019s body, and clipped themselves to the rope above him.Some numbly treated the body as an obstacle. Others paused to make sense of what they saw \u2014 a twisted man still affixed to the rope, reclined on the slope as if he might continue climbing after waking from his awkward slumber.Apparently abandoned at his time of greatest need, he was a mute embodiment of their worst fears. One climber stepped on the dead man and apologized profusely. Another saw the body and nearly turned around, spooked by the thought of his own worried family back home. Another paused on his descent to hold a one-sided conversation with the corpse stretched across the route.Who are you? Who left you here? And is anyone coming to take you home?Mount Everest occupies a rare spot in the collective imagination \u2014 a misty mix of wonder, reverence and trepidation. Hundreds of people successfully and safely reach the summit most years and return home with inspirational tales of conquest and perseverance. Other stories detail the occasional tragedies that leave a few people dead in a typical year. Those disaster stories are now their own genre in books and film.Where most of those stories end is where this one begins, long after hope is gone \u2014 the quiet, desperate and dangerous pursuit, usually at the insistence of a distraught family far away, to bring the dead home. The only search is for some semblance of closure.That was why the Sherpas with their oxygen masks and ice axes had come this far, this high, more than a year later.The four Indian climbers, from a vibrant climbing culture in West Bengal, were like so many others attempting Everest. They saw the mountain as the ultimate conquest, a bucket-list item that would bring personal satisfaction and prestige. They dreamed of it for years and made it the focus of their training. As motivation, they surrounded themselves with photographs of the mountain, from their Facebook pages to the walls of their homes.In other ways, however, they were different. Climbing Everest is an expensive endeavor, something to be both bought and earned. Many climbers are middle-aged Westerners \u2014 doctors, lawyers and other professionals \u2014 with the kind of wealth that the group from India could not fathom. Some spend $100,000 to ensure the best guides, service and safety.These four climbers measured monthly salaries in the hundreds of dollars. They borrowed money and sold off possessions simply for a chance. They cut costs and corners, because otherwise Everest was completely out of reach.Ghosh shared an apartment with eight members of his extended family. Paresh Nath, 58, was a one-handed tailor who barely scraped by with his wife and young son. Subhas Paul, 44, drove a small-goods truck and used his father\u2019s pension to pay for his Everest attempt. Hazra was a nurse, married and raising a son.They knew one another from the climbing circles of West Bengal, connected more by their common mission than strong friendships.About 5,000 people have reached the 29,029-foot (8,848-meter) summit of Everest at least once since Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary first did it in 1953. Nearly 300 people have died on the mountain in that period, according to the Himalayan Database, which tracks such things.Nepal officials estimate that about 200 bodies remain scattered across Everest. A few are so familiar, so well preserved by the subfreezing temperatures, that they serve as macabre mileposts for the living, including one corpse commonly called Green Boots. Other bodies remaining on Everest include those of George Mallory, dating to his fatal attempt in 1924, and the guide Scott Fischer, part of the 1996 disaster depicted in \u201cInto Thin Air.\u201dMost of the bodies are far out of sight. Some have been moved, dumped over cliffs or into crevasses at the behest of families bothered that their loved ones were someone else\u2019s landmark or at the direction of Nepali officials who worry that the sight of dead bodies hinders the country\u2019s tourist trade.More and more, however, families and friends of those who die on Everest and the world\u2019s other highest peaks want and expect the bodies to be brought home. For them and those tasked with recovering the bodies \u2014 an exercise that can be more dangerous and far more costly than the expedition that killed the climber in the first place \u2014 the drama begins with death.When someone dies, those left behind, from climbing partners on the scene to family and friends half a world away, are immediately faced with enormously daunting decisions and tasks. The rituals, customs and logistics of what happens next are always different.There are practical considerations, including whether to search for the bodies of those presumed missing or dead, if that is even feasible, and whether to recover the body or let it rest eternally where it is. There are emotional considerations, maybe cultural and religious ones, often in the name of closure, which can mean different things to different people. There are the wishes of the deceased, if those were ever communicated. There are logistical concerns, including danger and cost, local customs and international laws. Sometimes, in some places, recovery of a body is not just wanted, it is needed, to prove a death so that benefits can be provided to a family in desperate need of financial support.All these things came into play after the bodies of three men from India were scattered high on Everest in 2016. The dim hopes for rescue kindled into demands for recovery, led by the West Bengal government.Within a few days, in the short window between the last of the season\u2019s summit attempts and the start of the summer monsoon that racks the Himalayas and shuts down the climbing season until the following year, a recovery team of six hired Sherpas tried to find the deceased and carry them down. They had neither the manpower nor the time.The first they found was Paul, the delivery driver and a part-time guitar instructor who lived with his sprawling family, including his wife and 10-year-old daughter, in the small town of Bankura. He was steps from the well-worn route below Camp 4, roughly 26,000 feet above sea level. He was faceup, but only the toes of his boots stuck out of the fresh snow. It took four hours to chip and pry him from his icy grave and another 12 to drag him to Camp 2, where a helicopter carried the body to Base Camp.A few days later, thousands crowded Bankura\u2019s rough and narrow streets for a miles-long procession of Paul\u2019s body, which was carried on the open bed of Paul\u2019s small truck. The procession led to the banks of the Dwarakeswar River, where the body was cremated and the soul set free, according to Hindu tradition. There was heartache, but also closure.Back on Everest, above where Paul\u2019s body was extricated, two of the Sherpas moved up to Camp 4. At roughly 26,000 feet, higher than all but about 15 of earth\u2019s peaks, it sits at the edge of the oxygen-depleted death zone and is the last rest stop for climbers before their final push to the summit. The Sherpas searched the abandoned tents, some shredded to ribbons by wind, until they found the body of another of the missing Indian climbers. They knew it was Nath, the tailor, because he had only one hand, the other lost in a childhood firecracker accident.Raging winds kept them from climbing any higher in search of Ghosh, and the men were called back. The summer monsoon was on the way, ending the climbing season. Everyone rushed to pack up camp and get off the mountain. Ghosh and Nath, left dead in the death zone, would remain on Everest for at least a year, and maybe forever.The thought of Ghosh somewhere up there \u2014 alone and frozen, or maybe wandering around the Himalayas lost and crying into the wind for help \u2014 haunted his wife, his brothers, his mother and all those who lived in the cramped home off Old Calcutta Road, hundreds of miles away. Kolkata lies on the improbably flat and vast plain of the Hooghly River, a slow and wide offshoot of the Ganges in eastern India. There is nothing, not even a hill, to poke the horizon, and the thought of a mountain like Everest feels as far away as another planet.And so his wife, Chandana, kept the vermilion sindoor in the part of her hair, and the red and white bangles on her right wrist, to indicate that she was a married woman. She would not remove them until she was certain she was a widow. She left the calendar on the wall of the bedroom turned to May 2016. In her mind, that was when time stopped.\u201cI still believe he is alive,\u201d she said in her home in February. \u201cI am not a widow. I am the married wife to Goutam Ghosh. Not a widow. Unless I see him, and we cremate him, I will not change.\u201dIn the steel town of Durgapur, 100 miles northwest of Kolkata, Nath\u2019s wife, Sabita, tried to move on. She and Nath were poor, even by Indian standards, and she had no money to bring the body home. She and her husband never spoke about what to do if he died, but now she convinced herself that he would want to be left on the mountain. He dreamed about Everest so much that a photo of the mountain was one of the few things that decorated the chipped concrete walls of their bedroom.The two of them sat side by side through countless nights sewing backpacks and jackets to sell to support his quest. People in town marveled at his ability to cut and sew with just one hand, just as climbers wondered how he could navigate the ropes and harnesses used in mountaineering.Sabita let herself imagine that she might awake and find him sitting behind his sewing machine. The couple\u2019s 9-year-old son silently pretended that nothing had happened, that his father was simply on a long trip.That\u2019s what happens when the body is left on the mountain. Death feels like hearsay. Only the body coming through the door at home could make it something more than a haunting phantom in the imagination. Its return could bring honor and closure. It might not answer all the questions, but it could end the nightmares.But even if it could happen, even if the bodies of Ghosh and Nath were found where they were last seen, and even if impossibly huge sums could be raised to pay to recover them, and even if there were people willing to risk their own lives on Everest to honor the dead and appease the living, nothing could happen right now. It would have to wait a year.On the afternoon of May 20, 2016, Ghosh, Nath, Paul and Hazra anxiously rested inside a tent at Camp 4. They wore oxygen masks and bright, bulky snowsuits filled with down. They sipped tea and munched crackers. There was little chatter.They did not know one another well, but formed a ragtag group of modestly accomplished climbers, joined by their individual desires to summit Everest and their common need for a low-budget expedition. All had spent 10 years or more saving, borrowing and raising money for an Everest expedition. They found a company popular with West Bengali climbers that charged them each about $30,000, cheaper than other outfitters but still a daunting sum, far more than any of them dreamed of making in a year.Adding to their desperation was that it was their third attempt in three years. Their 2014 quest was scuttled by an avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas, ending the season just as it was about to start. The 2015 season was canceled after an earthquake rocked Nepal in late April, killing nearly 9,000 people. It caused an avalanche that roared into Everest Base Camp, killing 18.Now, finally, after weeks at Base Camp and on the lower slopes of Everest, they were within reach of the summit. If all went well, they would be back at Camp 4 within 24 hours, on their way home to India, where Everest summiters are revered as conquering heroes. \u201cEveresters,\u201d they are called.In the early evening, after dark and later than they had planned, they emerged from the tent, each with a guide. (Guides in the Himalayas are often called Sherpas, though not all are part of the ethnic group of Sherpa, from which many take their surname.) The sky was clear and the moon was full. A line of headlamps slinked up the face of the mountain above them.The summit of Everest cannot be seen from Camp 4, but much of the route can. It leads up a series of ropes, used by every Everest climber, that are tied to anchors drilled into the rock and ice and set by Sherpas at the start of the season.The route leads across a barren ice field, sliced with deep crevasses, and shoots up a steep and rocky slope until it reaches a small flat spot, a burr on the side of the mountain. The landing is known as the Balcony, and from there it is two hours or more along the exposed, knife-edged Southeast Ridge to the South Summit \u2014 at 28,700 feet, it would be the world\u2019s second-highest peak, if it were considered separate from Everest. From the South Summit, the top of Everest finally emerges in full view, tantalizingly close up a serrated ridge.The round-trip journey from Camp 4 takes some people less than 12 hours, and experienced guides and climbers know that it should take no more than about 18 \u2014 12 hours up, six hours back. Most follow a rule that at a predetermined time \u2014 rarely later than noon \u2014 all climbers still moving up should retreat. Prolonged exposure is dangerous, and sometimes deadly, because of the unpredictability of afternoon weather, the limited number of oxygen bottles that can be carried and the toll caused by extreme elevation and temperatures.A woman and two guides were the first of 74 people to reach the summit that day, at 3:36 a.m., according to the Himalayan Database. The last recorded time for climbers reaching the summit was 11 a.m.The West Bengal expedition stood at the Balcony well after dawn, resting and taking in the majestic views of snow-covered peaks and cloud-shrouded valleys. There were four clients and only three guides because Nath\u2019s guide appeared to stay behind at Camp 4, for reasons never understood. Other climbers were already coming down, having reached the summit hours before.The Base Camp manager for the Indian expedition received a radio call from Bishnu Gurung, the only one of the group\u2019s guides with experience reaching the summit of Everest. He said he recommended to the clients that they turn back, but they refused.\u201cI told them, \u2018If we are still on the Balcony at 10 in the morning, how can we reach the top?\u2019 \u201d Gurung said.Ghosh cried at the prospect of giving up, Gurung later said. Paul began ascending on his own.\u201cI stopped there just to check if he will return back if I didn\u2019t continue,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa, Paul\u2019s guide, said. \u201cI thought he would listen to me. Sherpas can\u2019t use force or hit him in that situation. They are our guest. All we could do is convince. As he wasn\u2019t convinced, I followed him.\u201dOnly Nath was persuaded to turn back to Camp 4. The three other Indian climbers persisted. The three guides joined them, carrying a dwindling amount of oxygen and a growing sense of dread.\u201cI thought that I won\u2019t return back,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa recalled.Throughout the late morning and early afternoon, dozens who had reached the summit descended past the Indian climbers. Paul Pottinger, a Seattle doctor, reached the summit at 7:48 that morning. He wore a camera on his head to record much of his daylight descent on the rope, a one-way lane used by both those going up and coming down. Negotiating past oncoming climbers can be a slow, clumsy and dangerous exercise.Pottinger passed Paul and his guide, Lakpa Sherpa, well below the South Summit. Lakpa Sherpa asked for the time. Pottinger lifted the sleeve of his jacket to expose his watch, visible to the camera. It was 10:23. He repeatedly told the guide that it was 10:20. He later speculated that the guide wanted Paul, his client, to hear how late it was.\u201cWho climbs Everest without a watch?\u201d Pottinger said months later. \u201cNow I wonder if he had a watch. And I wonder if he was really saying, \u2018Please tell my guy to stop because I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u201dMinutes later, Pottinger passed Pasang Sherpa, Hazra\u2019s guide, climbing alone. At 10:45, on a particularly steep pitch at an anchor tangled in a knot of ropes, Pottinger passed a group of three: Ghosh, Gurung and Hazra.Paul and Lakpa Sherpa reached the summit at 1:45 p.m., according to the camera later recovered from Paul\u2019s body. There were 31 photographs taken at the summit over 16 minutes.The others in their group \u2014 Ghosh, Hazra, Nath and their guides \u2014 were somewhere below.The last photograph of Ghosh taken with his camera appeared to be at the South Summit at 1:57 p.m. He wore an oxygen mask. He held flags and banners that he had carried in his backpack. A video recorder dangled around his neck. Ghosh turned it on.Wind whipped through the camera\u2019s microphone, but not enough to obscure the sound of Ghosh\u2019s quick-paced breathing. It was as if Ghosh were checking himself in a mirror. With a bare hand, he lifted his sunglasses to his forehead. His eyes were bloodshot. He pulled his oxygen mask to his chin, briefly showing his teeth and his gray-speckled mustache.\u201cGoutam,\u201d a voice said, and Ghosh glanced in its direction, put his mask on and reached to turn off the camera. It was the last record of him alive.Yet Gurung, Ghosh\u2019s guide, apparently kept going, alone. About 40 minutes later, he photographed himself 21 times with Ghosh\u2019s camera at what appeared to be the summit. There was no sign of Ghosh.(Hazra, the lone survivor, said that she reached the summit at about 3 p.m. There is no evidence that she got there. She has petitioned for a summit certificate from Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism, the arbiter of such matters, without success.)In the area above 8,000 meters (over 26,000 feet), from Camp 4 to the summit, a dearth of oxygen and brutal weather kill those who dare stay exposed too long. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, and with the thin air comes less oxygen for the lungs and the bloodstream.The body tries to overcome it by sending more blood to the brain, which can cause swelling, leading to symptoms like headaches, nausea and exhaustion. At extreme heights, a condition known as high-altitude cerebral edema can also cause a lack of muscle coordination, impaired speech, confusion and hallucinations. As the body continues to fight for equilibrium, it sends blood to the lungs. High-altitude pulmonary edema results in coughing and major breathing problems.The sun\u2019s strong rays at high altitudes can burn the skin and eyes, causing snow blindness. The subfreezing temperatures, exacerbated by perpetually strong winds, cause frostbite, killing the skin and the underlying tissue, especially in the extremities.Confused and numb, climbers sometimes react to the onset of hypothermia by shedding their clothes, believing they are burning up, not freezing to death. It is why those who die in extreme conditions, like the ones on the slopes of Everest, are often discovered in a state of undress.Back in West Bengal, vague and inaccurate news reports spread quickly on May 21: The climbers had reached the summit. The houses of the climbers filled with friends offering congratulations and customary sweets.By nightfall, however, the festive moods faded. Updated reports from Everest arrived. The West Bengali climbers were lost on their way down.That evening, down at Camp 4, the first group to leave for a summit attempt included an experienced American climber and photographer, Thom Pollard, and his Nepali guide.They first passed a Sherpa, then another, both cold, scared and without oxygen. Then they came across climbers below the Balcony. One was a woman. One was a man in a yellow snowsuit, lying sideways across the hill, still attached to the rope. His hands were uncovered. He appeared close to death.Options for would-be rescuers are few at such extreme altitudes. Climbers carry finite amounts of oxygen, just enough for their own expected need, because of the weight of the canisters. They worry about their own survival, knowing that extra time exposed to the elements can prove fatal. They are often in a depleted state, physically and mentally. Even if they have all their faculties, they have paid tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps devoted many years of their lives, to this one day, and might be reluctant to abort it all for a faceless stranger whose needs cannot be assessed easily and who, most likely, speaks a different language.Pollard and his guide stopped, discussed the situation and continued past.\u201cI\u2019ve wrestled with this for a year,\u201d Pollard said from his home in New Hampshire.Pollard and his guide were the first to summit on the morning of May 22, at 2:40 a.m. On their descent, still in the dark, they were relieved to see Hazra was gone. There were marks in the snow where she had either scooted downhill or been dragged away.But Ghosh was still there, splayed on the slope and now alone.\u201cHe was dead,\u201d said Pollard\u2019s guide, Lhakpa Gyaljen Sherpa. \u201cI shouted: \u2018Hello, hello!\u2019 There was no response. Looking at his face, he was dead. That\u2019s why the others must have left him.\u201dLike everyone else who went up and back for the remaining days of the season, they stepped over him, clipped out of and back onto the rope around him, and continued down.Sunita Hazra\u2019s memories of that night are spotty, but she remembered leaving Ghosh, her closest friend on the expedition.\u201cI told Goutam, \u2018You must come,\u2019 \u201d she said in the living room of her home near Kolkata. \u201cI thought if I started moving downward, he would follow me. I had neither the strength to help him or to even look behind me to make sure he was coming.\u201dShe believes she would have died, too, if not for Leslie Binns, a British climber who was ascending above Camp 4 when he found her with her mittens off and her jacket unzipped. He gave her a shot of oxygen, which lifted her energy, but soon realized she would not make it to Camp 4 on her own. He aborted his own summit attempt to drag, encourage and cajole her downhill.They soon discovered Subhas Paul, in a dazed and hypothermic state of his own. Binns slowly coaxed the two Indian climbers down, sharing hits of oxygen and trying to lift them when they collapsed. They lost track of the roped route. Paul fell into a shallow crevasse and flailed his arms.Binns eventually made a decision to try to save one or the other. Figuring Paul had energy to expend, he chose Hazra and escorted her to a tent.\u201cWhen I got to Camp 4, Subhas was not behind me,\u201d Hazra said. \u201cI thought he was there. I thought Goutam and Nath were somewhere safe.\u201dSome in Camp 4 later awoke in the night to someone shouting, rhythmically but incoherently, over and over. They presumed it came from within the camp, part of another expedition. No one ventured into the dark to explore.When climbers emerged from their tents in the first rays of sunlight, they realized the shouting was from Paul, about 100 yards uphill from camp. He had been out in the elements for at least 32 hours.Hazra and Paul were reunited with their three guides in the tent. They did not know where Ghosh and Nath were.By midafternoon, persuaded by doctors from other expeditions to get to lower altitude immediately, the group was on its way downhill again, without Ghosh and Nath, carrying the last bits of oxygen it had stashed at Camp 4. Paul soon collapsed.\u201cSubhas started getting very weak,\u201d Lakpa Sherpa said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t getting better even after supplying oxygen. His hands froze. We tried very hard to rescue him from there.\u201dTwo guides stayed with Paul. The third led Hazra downward, but soon left her behind, feeling he was in worse condition than she was, suffering from frostbite on his hands and feet. Darkness came, bringing snow and wind.Alone, Hazra fell and broke her wrist. She had frostbite on her hands. Eventually, the other two guides caught up to her.\u201cI understood from the Sherpas that Subhas sat down to rest,\u201d Hazra said at her home earlier this year. She began to cry. \u201cAnd they left him,\u201d she said.Hazra and the guides made their way to the icy landing spot above Camp 2, where a helicopter winched Hazra to Base Camp. Ferried to Kathmandu, she was hospitalized for her injuries. A few days later, she received a hero\u2019s welcome at the airport in Kolkata.She knew little of what happened behind her, up the mountain. At about the time that Paul, Hazra and the three guides left Camp 4 to descend toward Camp 3, another Indian expedition returning from the summit spotted Nath off the trail in afternoon light. He was upright and alive, mindlessly digging into the ice with his one hand.Nath was carried to Camp 4. His eyes were swollen shut with snow blindness.By the next morning, the last day that anyone would summit Everest for the season, Nath was too weak to hold a bowl of soup. He died in a tent at Camp 4.Goutam Ghosh was still somewhere higher on the mountain. At least 27 people stepped over him on their way to the summit and again on their way down before the season ended and the mountain emptied for most of a year.Every spring, as hopeful climbers from around the world trek to Everest Base Camp in Nepal, an elevation of about 17,500 feet, to begin acclimating for a summit push in May, a team of local Sherpas is hired to create the season\u2019s route up the mountain. They establish the course up more than two vertical miles that hundreds of others will follow.First, the \u201cicefall doctors\u201d set ropes, ladders and makeshift bridges through the notoriously dangerous, ever-shifting Khumbu Icefall immediately above Base Camp. Others keep moving upward, setting anchors and stringing ropes until they reach the summit. The process can take weeks, and is often delayed by bad weather.Only when the ropes are fixed to the top does the Everest climbing season open. It usually lasts only a few weeks, squeezed between the route opening in early May and the projected start of the monsoon at the end of the month.Everest is rarely climbed at any other time of the year. That meant the rope-fixing Sherpas were likely to be the first to see Ghosh and Nath, if their bodies were still there from the year before. The forces of wind, snow, ice and gravity could have moved them or hidden them.Nath was last seen in a tent at Camp 4, at more than 26,000 feet, which gets battered into something unrecognizable from one year to the next. Ghosh was last seen higher on the mountain, clipped to a rope on a steep section called the Triangular Face, just below the perch called the Balcony. If that rope from last year\u2019s route was damaged \u2014 perhaps by a falling piece of ice \u2014 Ghosh\u2019s body could have fallen and disappeared for good.There were three major reasons the Ghosh family desperately wanted Goutam\u2019s body returned. The first was emotional. The idea that he lay near the summit of Everest, alone, exposed to the elements, left to serve as a tragic tourist marker for future climbers, was nearly too much to bear. And they wanted answers about what happened. Maybe his body could provide those answers. Maybe that video camera around his neck, if it was still there and still worked, held clues. Maybe there were memory cards from his camera in his pockets or backpack. Maybe a message for the family. Something.The second was religious. Hindus believe the body is merely a temporary vessel for the soul. Once the soul is severed from the body through cremation, it is reincarnated in another body. Like most in West Bengal and across India, the Ghoshes were devoutly Hindu. To them, closure required a cremation, and all the ceremonies that came with it.The third reason, as important as the others, was financial. Legally, in India, Ghosh was considered a missing person. Only when a body was produced, or seven years had passed, would the Indian government issue a death certificate, which the Ghosh family needed to gain access to his modest bank accounts and to receive financial death benefits like life insurance and the pension he had earned as a police officer.Ghosh was a police sub-inspector, the second in command at the local precinct of the Kolkata police. It was a good job that paid about $500 a month. Ghosh was a talented player of tabla, the Indian bongo-like drums, and sometimes performed with his wife. He took army courses to become an adept equestrian and was known in the neighborhood as a good soccer player. He had been mountaineering and rock climbing for most of his life.It might seem a strange hobby in Kolkata, hundreds of miles from the Himalayan foothills, but West Bengal is a surprising hive of mountaineering. There are hundreds of mountaineering clubs, in just about every small town and every neighborhood of the cities. Kolkata has dozens of them. The state government heavily promotes the activity through the West Bengal Mountaineering and Adventure Sports Foundation, where a 60-foot climbing wall rises outside its offices.The foundation gives grants to those who apply with realistic ambitions of scaling the biggest peaks. In the case of Ghosh, Paul, Nath and Hazra, it granted each 500,000 rupees, or about $7,500, toward their quest to climb Everest.Ghosh was the most experienced of the mountaineers \u2014 not a well-known climber in West Bengal, but a respected one. He was an instructor at summer camps held at a climbing center on Susunia Hill, a 1,450-foot hiccup on the plain a couple of hours\u2019 drive northwest of Kolkata. He had successfully climbed a number of 7,000-meter peaks in the Himalayas. In the bedroom he shared with Chandana was a poster of Everest. It hung there for 20 years.\u201cWe try to go through our routines,\u201d Chandana Ghosh said in February. \u201cThe peace is not there. We try to eat and we try to sleep. But all the time we are thinking about the beloved man of this family, lying up there all alone.\u201dGoutam Ghosh was the youngest of three brothers, all in their 50s. They lived with their parents, wives and children in a dim, two-story apartment in the concrete jumble of Barrackpore, a district of northern Kolkata. Their father had recently died. The door from the street led to an outside hallway, open to a sky obscured by rambling apartments, one on top of another, squeezed tight. The bathroom was to the left, a hole behind a half wall and a pitcher of water next to a hose.Debasish Ghosh, 53, unlike his younger brother, was not a mountaineer. A small man with a bushy mustache and a bit of a paunch, he ran a fast-food stall, serving chow mein and mutton rolls, not far from the family\u2019s home near the Barrackpore train station. He made a vow: If the body could be found, he would bring Goutam home.Debasish Ghosh hoped that the West Bengal government would coordinate and finance a retrieval attempt a year later. For months, he requested meetings with officials, slowly climbing the government\u2019s chain of command, until he and Chandana met with Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal.She expressed concern for the cost, Debasish Ghosh said, and asked who would venture up Everest to bring back the bodies. She wondered about the state\u2019s responsibility if members of a recovery team were hurt or killed.Without a commitment from the state government, the Ghosh family sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. His office forwarded it to the state government, with a note that said \u201cfor action as appropriate.\u201d Secretly, the state government approved money for the operation, but it did not share its plans with the Ghosh and Nath families.\u201cThey were saying that only if the body is located will they take up the decision,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said. \u201cBut who will inform us that the body is there? It has to be the Sherpas, because otherwise nobody is obligated to find the body.\u201dSo the family hired an experienced guide who was known among West Bengali climbers and who had been to the Everest summit five times. He told Debasish Ghosh that he would recover his brother\u2019s body for 26.3 Indian lakh rupees, or roughly $40,000, more than the cost of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s original expedition.The family agreed to pay 2.5 lakh (about $4,000) upfront, to organize and buy oxygen for those who would make the initial search, following closely behind the rope-fixing teams. The rest would be paid at intervals along the way \u2014 when photographs were produced, for example, and when the body reached Kathmandu.The Ghosh family did not have the money, but agreed to sell a small lot in Kolkata that Goutam owned, where he hoped to someday build a house. They sold jewelry, including a gold necklace that Chandana wore for her wedding. Family members and mountaineering club members scrounged the small bits of savings that they had. By early May, as the rope-fixing team was doing its work, it was still not enough.\u201cWe have arranged about 20 lakh so far,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said in Kolkata.A day later, too anxious to wait helplessly any longer, he packed a small yellow daypack with a few changes of clothes, plastic containers of homemade chicken and roti, and a folder of paperwork, protected in plastic sleeves. The sleeves held copies of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s identification card, his police service card, his permit for climbing Everest \u2014 all things that would help identify a body and cut through the logistics of bringing it home.He knelt at his mother\u2019s bed and touched his mother\u2019s feet, a sign of respect. He prayed with her as she cried. He stepped into the hot sun and through a huddle of well-wishers. Accompanied by one of Goutam Ghosh\u2019s friends, he waved and disappeared around a corner, swallowed by a street filled with cars, rickshaws, scooters, bicycles, walkers and cows, and walked to the train station.\u201cI cannot keep my mind cool staying at home,\u201d Debasish said. \u201cI want to be closer.\u201dAfter two trains, two buses and 40 hours, the two men were in Kathmandu. They found a $5-a-night room to share, and waited.The rope-fixing team reached Camp 4 on April 23, but weather stopped the Sherpas from going higher. The team descended to refresh at lower altitude in anticipation of its next push, carrying rumors that a body was seen amid the tatters and rubble at Camp 4 \u2014 the body of Paresh Nath, presumably.His wife, Sabita Nath, had little communication with the government for nearly a year. No one reached out to the family to discuss what might happen if the body was found. No one, in fact, had asked her if she even wanted her husband\u2019s body back.Sabita Nath did not share her tiny home with a large, extended family. With her husband gone, it was just her and their 9-year-old son, Adrishikar, living behind a storefront where her husband sold his handmade backpacks and jackets.\u201cAfter a while, I began to think there is no reason to bring him here,\u201d she said at her home one day, sitting near the sewing machines where they used to work side by side. \u201cHe loved the mountains like God. If he is there, let him be. His soul must be happy somewhere.\u201dShe and Paresh were not deeply religious. Some of Nath\u2019s relatives performed rituals after it was clear that he had died in 2016, but Sabita did not attend. She allowed herself the traditional 10 days of mourning, then removed all the signs of being a wedded woman \u2014 the circular red bindi from her forehead, the vermilion sindoor along the part of her hair and the red and white bangles on her wrist. She was a widow.Money was an issue. Paresh Nath once had a life insurance policy, his wife said, but the premiums were not paid and it was worthless. Sabita got busy at her sewing machine, making simple nylon shopping bags she sold to a nearby grocery market for about 1,500 rupees (about $23) per month. Climbers and friends provided donations of about 2,500 rupees per month ($39) to keep her financially afloat.For most of a year, Adrishikar did not ask if his father was dead, and his mother did not have the heart to tell him.\u201cI tell him that papa has built a room on Everest that he is living in,\u201d Sabita Nath said in February. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him the real fact, that he is gone.\u201dLike many Indians, the Naths ate without utensils, and Adrishikar carefully washed his father\u2019s one hand after meals. Paresh Nath drove the boy to school on a scooter even though he had no license because of his disability. Theirs was a special bond, Sabita Nath said, and her focus was on the boy\u2019s well-being, not her husband\u2019s body.\u201cEven if the government brings the body, what\u2019s the use to me?\u201d she said. \u201cIt is just a mortal body. To me, the more urgent thing is a job, so I can raise our son. To bring a body from Everest is a huge cost. And I cannot spend that money.\u201dIf the government wanted to help financially, she said, the money would be better spent on her son\u2019s education than on her husband\u2019s dead body. She reiterated her stance in May, just before photographs of Nath\u2019s body appeared on social media. He was identified by his boots and the snowsuit he had sewn himself.Nath\u2019s family and friends were stunned by the photographs. Sabita experienced chest pains and went to the doctor.\u201cI felt sick,\u201d she said afterward at her home in Durgapur. \u201cUntil that day, I was trying to console myself by thinking that maybe he was still alive and only lost.\u201dThe route to the summit of Everest changes slightly each year, depending on variable conditions, like the snowpack or snow slides. In 2017, it opened on May 15, later than usual. The new route was strung near previous ones, and the worn, faded ropes of past seasons could be seen threaded among the rocks and through the snow.The rope-fixing team returned down the mountain and reported seeing a body most of the way up the Triangular Face, below the Balcony \u2014 just where Goutam Ghosh\u2019s body was last seen, about 360 days before.\u201cI think that was the body of the Indian climber,\u201d Chime Chundub Gurung, one member of the team, said at the airport in Kathmandu a few days later. \u201cThe body was upside down with legs up. It was very close to the new rope. I didn\u2019t touch it, and I didn\u2019t see the face. I only saw boots, and he was wearing mountaineering clothes.\u201dThe hundreds of climbers below, eager for the route to open and seeing a forecast for good weather, began to stream toward the summit. Within days, dozens reached the summit and came back again. Few of them saw Paresh Nath\u2019s body, stashed away on a far side of Camp 4. But every one of them climbed within feet of Ghosh\u2019s body.The first photographs arrived on Tuesday, May 16. Debasish Ghosh received one on his phone at 6:17 that evening while sitting at his hotel. Numbly, he stared at it, tugging the edges with his fingertips to zoom in for a better look. He sent the message to his son and to Chandana at home in Kolkata. He also sent it to Sunita Hazra, the only survivor among the four Indians in the expedition the year before.The photo showed a body in a faded yellow snowsuit bent like a horseshoe and half-buried in snow. It looked like something archaeologists were midway through excavating. There was no face visible, but the boots and the gear matched what Ghosh was wearing a year before. The pattern of the yellow-and-black snowsuit matched what Sunita had in her closet at home, the one she bought alongside Ghosh at a little shop in Kathmandu.Everyone agreed: It was Ghosh\u2019s body.Three men from the West Bengal government rushed to Kathmandu, taking the 90-minute commercial flight that Debasish Ghosh could not afford. They quickly struck a deal with Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summit Treks, a major Himalayan expedition company based in Kathmandu. The sides agreed on a price that the government would pay for the two bodies to be recovered: $90,000, roughly the amount the government quietly set aside weeks earlier. The government announced it would pay for the retrievals.Sabita Nath and Chandana Ghosh received calls from a government official asking them to sign a \u201cno objection\u201d certificate to allow for the attempted recoveries. They agreed.Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism, which oversees the country\u2019s mountaineering trade, placed only one major provision on the operation: It did not want the bodies coming down at the same time that hundreds of climbers were going up.\u201cWe just want to ensure that other mountaineers who planned to go up this season will not be hampered,\u201d Director General Dinesh Bhattarai said. \u201cI have talked to them, and they will try to bring them down at nighttime, and when there are less climbers moving up.\u201dThe issue, he admitted, was one of optics as much as congestion.\u201cThe climbers, they know pretty well that it is dangerous, and they are ready to encounter these kinds of incidents,\u201d Bhattarai said. \u201cThey are mentally prepared for that. It\u2019s more about not hampering the existing climber. But at the same time, we are also concerned about what they see.\u201dIt was also a matter of practicality. Digging out and dragging a body off the mountain typically requires at least six Sherpas. This effort needed about a dozen people. And most of the Sherpa guides were either still on the mountain with clients, or just returning, too exhausted to turn right back around and go up.The days of waiting piled up.It was late May, the tail end of the Everest climbing season, when five hired Sherpas quietly left Camp 2 at 1 a.m. Into the dark they carried ropes and oxygen canisters, but no food, only a little bit of water and a plastic half-liter bottle of Coke. The Coke froze quickly in the bitter temperatures, even inside their packs. When they wanted a sip, they used a small stove to melt ice and put the bottle in the warm water to turn it back to liquid.They turned their oxygen on low at what they called the \u201ccrampon point,\u201d an hour above Camp 2, where the trail becomes predominantly ice and climbers attach crampons, with fang-like spikes, to the soles of their boots.Sherpas typically use oxygen only in the death zone, at Camp 4 and above, but they wanted to move quickly. Oxygen was fuel, feeding the lungs and the blood, and it allowed them to keep a brisker pace than usual. Each man had two bottles, enough to last about 24 hours, they figured.The leader was Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, a 29-year-old guide who had been to the summit of Everest five times. He received a call a couple of weeks before from Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits. The company needed an experienced guide to lead an expedition to retrieve a pair of bodies, he was told.(The New York Times hired Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, through Seven Summits, to shoot video of the retrieval effort.)Guides often did two, even three, major expeditions in the Himalayas each spring. By late May, many were either already home or exhausted. Mingma Sherpa dangled a $3,000 payout for a few days of work and scrounged up about a dozen men. He promised beer if they were successful.Like most Sherpas, Dawa Finjhok Sherpa did not love working as a guide, carrying heavy loads and the hopes and demands of foreigners \u2014 and sometimes the foreigners themselves \u2014 up and down the world\u2019s highest peaks. But it paid better than anything else.Many of the guides came from remote villages, and there was little work there. Some, like Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, were from Kathmandu. They knew that more conventional jobs, in construction or retail or finance or anything else, wouldn\u2019t give them the same money for the same amount of work. But it did not mean they liked it.\u201cI\u2019ve almost quit this job,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said over a beer in Kathmandu one evening, \u201cbecause there are so many ways to die.\u201dAbout 11 a.m., the retrieval Sherpas reached Camp 4, a ghost town of abandoned tents and gear so late in the season. They heated their Cokes and sipped from the plastic bottles, but did not dawdle. Once rested, the five men stood in the midday light, put on their packs, secured their oxygen masks and kept moving, up the Triangular Face toward the Balcony of Everest, looking for a frozen man who had waited a long time for someone to take him home.A few hours behind them, following the same route, six more Sherpas left Camp 2 and headed to Camp 4. Their mission was to recover Paresh Nath.The danger increased with every foot of altitude toward the summit, where the air grew thinner and the chances of rescue, should anything go wrong, grew slimmer. The same threats faced by climbers from around the world were faced by Sherpas from Nepal. But Mingma Sherpa, an experienced climber himself, said no mission to recover bodies was off limits, if the price was right.\u201cAbove the South Summit, from the South Summit to the summit, we might have to think about it,\u201d Mingma Sherpa said. \u201cBut below the Balcony, the only question is weather. I cannot fight the weather. The technical part, we can handle. The weather can kill us.\u201dIf it all went right, then, the bodies of the Indian climbers would return from Everest. They would be among the highest-altitude recoveries ever made.At 1:39 local time on a Wednesday afternoon, the recovery team searching for Goutam Ghosh got to his body, a pale-yellow crescent on a steep black-and-white backdrop, icebound between jagged rocks the color of coal.The head was downhill, the face turned slightly to the outside. The arms were splayed overhead, the back was arched and the feet were curled to the right. His once-bright clothes were bleached by the elements. So was the rope that was still attached to the rigging around his waist. It was red when all the Everest summiters of the year before climbed it, but was now faded to a dusky pink.There were no signs of his depleted oxygen bottles, probably scavenged and sold in Kathmandu for a hundred dollars. There were no signs of his mittens, likely pulled off by Ghosh in his final desperate, hypoxic moments. The snowsuit was unzipped to the waist, a sign that hypothermia had tricked Ghosh into thinking he was overheating.A skull cap that Ghosh wore the day of the summit attempt was still on, but the yellow down-filled hood attached to his snowsuit was loose and filled with snow. It was still knotted where Ghosh had cinched it at the chin. His hands were bare, black and leathery, like his face. His white teeth, like the silver crampons still attached to his boots, gleamed in the sunshine.The men were able to pry Ghosh\u2019s hood loose and pull it over his face. They tied the hood with rope so they would not have to see the face.\u201cAt first when we saw him, we were a little bit afraid,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see the skin, it\u2019s easier.\u201dThe Sherpas connected Ghosh to a new rope, anchored in a rock about 30 feet uphill, and used ice axes to dig and pry the body from the snow. When the body moved, it moved as one piece, without torque, all the limbs, muscles and joints frozen solid. Pulling on a wrist turned the body all the way to the toes. Once the body was freed from the mountain\u2019s grip, the men hammered blocks of ice from it. Dawa Finjhok Sherpa estimated the load weighed more than 300 pounds, double Ghosh\u2019s weight when he was alive. Two men could not lift the body. Three struggled to maneuver it.They tied ropes through Ghosh\u2019s carabiner. They lowered him by rigging a pulley-type system through the same anchors used for climbers attempting the summit. They used Ghosh\u2019s jumar, a ratcheting device used in climbing, to help belay the load, sliding it downhill one stretch of rope at a time.They had the mountain to themselves above Camp 4, which they could see far below in the saddle between Everest and Lhotse.\u201cIt was easier because there was a lot of snow this year, so the rocks were covered in snow and we could slide him,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cBut the snowy, flat areas were hard. He was heavy.\u201dNot far from where they found Ghosh\u2019s body that morning was another body that Dawa Finjhok Sherpa estimated had been there for five or six years. And somewhere nearby, they knew, was the body of a doctor from Alabama who had died a few days before. There was no plan to bring it down.It took an hour to drag Ghosh\u2019s body to Camp 4, where Dawa Finjhok Sherpa opened Ghosh\u2019s backpack. Inside he found a video camera and a pair of gloves. There were banners and printouts of the India and West Bengal flags, and for the Kolkata police department and Ghosh\u2019s climbing club.Dawa Finjhok Sherpa put the gloves on Ghosh\u2019s hands and put the video camera in his own backpack. He left Ghosh\u2019s backpack at Camp 4, with the wind-torn remains of the 2017 climbing season.The recovery team had a rolled-up plastic toboggan that it intended to use as a stretcher, but Ghosh\u2019s body was too stiff and contorted to fit on it properly. So the men found an abandoned blue plastic tarp, wrapped it around Ghosh\u2019s lower body and lashed it tight with mismatched pieces of rope. They found a thin, gray foam sleeping pad and did the same thing for his upper body.The men tried to keep the body on its back, but it slid better facedown. Soon the snowsuit was ripped open at the elbows, spilling down feathers.By nightfall, the team was pulling, lifting and sliding Ghosh down the mountain, past where Subhas Paul had died the year before. It came across the group assigned to retrieve Paresh Nath, which was on its way up. There were few other climbers. The mountain was practically empty so late in the season, and those who remained traveled different parts of the slopes at different times. Like drivers familiar with a city\u2019s traffic patterns, the recovery Sherpas knew the rhythms of the route.They rested in the middle of the night at Camp 3, which is carved into the precipitous ice of the Lhotse Face. A Seven Summits cook had hiked up from Camp 2 to meet them, and fed them noodles and juice. The Sherpas trudged downhill from there.\u201cI started to make a system to belay the body below Camp 3,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cMy partner was holding the rope, but he fell asleep. He let the rope slip just as I was hooking up our system. Three of us held on as tight as we could and we screamed. We all got rope burns. If we wouldn\u2019t have held on, the body would have slipped down the mountain.\u201dAt dawn, Ghosh\u2019s body arrived at the crampon point. The Sherpas assigned to get his body had been working nearly 28 hours, but Ghosh\u2019s journey was held up, awaiting Nath and the helicopter that would carry them off the mountain.Clouds shrouded Everest. Ghosh\u2019s recovery team sought shelter down at Camp 2, leaving Ghosh alone on the mountain again. The body was soon covered in snow.The body of Paresh Nath, still in the red-and-black snowsuit that he sewed for himself, reached the crampon point at about 2 p.m. on Thursday, May 25. He was wrapped in a malleable, plastic stretcher, with a tangle of ropes laced through grommets at its edges.Nath\u2019s right hand, his one hand, was bare and appeared to grip a rope across his chest. His other arm was tucked along his side. It was the position he died in a year before. His body was hard as stone.Their toughest work done, the sun shining again, the Sherpas assigned to Nath\u2019s recovery shed their outer layers. They huddled on the snow and were presented with noodles and juice.The Ghosh team came up the short distance from Camp 2, and having strapped the contorted Ghosh into a plastic stretcher of his own, his arms sticking over the edges, coaxed both men downhill in their makeshift sleds. It was not an easy journey, the trail pocked by crags and crevasses. In an hour, they got to the helicopter landing spot, nothing but a relatively flat space covered in snow and ice near the tents at Camp 2. At more than 21,000 feet, it is the highest spot on the mountain that most helicopters can reasonably reach.When the Sherpas called to Base Camp, they were told the helicopter would not come that day. It would come tomorrow, the 26th. The next day, reports were the same. The helicopter would come the 27th.The excuse was weather; it was raining in Kathmandu, and clouds were thick between there and Everest. What the Sherpas did not know, and what the families of Ghosh and Nath did not know, was that they were also waiting for the body of another Indian climber, one who had died just days before.A third team of Sherpas hired by Seven Summits had rappelled into a crevasse near the Balcony and pulled him out. The team followed the teams of Ghosh and Nath back down the mountain, and arrived at Camp 2 late on May 26, well after dark.The biggest expense for most recovery operations is helicopters. Seven Summits wanted to minimize the cost by ferrying three bodies down at once, rather than performing multiple missions over several days.Finally, on May 28, the bodies were in place and the sky was clear and blue. A helicopter curled around the valley and touched down, just for a moment, in a cloud of blowing snow. Its skids briefly tickled the slope, and the helicopter spun sideways. Its tail nearly wiped away the man trying to direct it.The pilot brought it around for another try, flying about 10 feet above the ground as he approached. The helicopter landed and slid 20 or 30 feet before it stopped. The pilot kept the rotors on to hold the copter on the icy shelf. Three men pulled Ghosh\u2019s body to the vessel, and a fourth helped them lift it into the small space behind the pilot, who breathed oxygen from a tank through a tube to his nose.The helicopter, already at its altitude limit, unable to take more than one body at a time, lifted off the snow only slightly and followed the throat of the snow-filled valley downhill, into some low clouds and over the steep, chunky landscape of the Khumbu Icefall.A year before, the climb between Base Camp and Camp 2 took Ghosh and his colleagues about 20 hours, divided by a night\u2019s sleep at Camp 1. The ride down took two minutes.The icefall gave way to a barren strip of gray moraine dotted with yellow and orange tents, the remnants of the season\u2019s Base Camp. The helicopter landed in front of about two dozen people, some pointing cameras and others shielding their faces from the dust.Two men pulled Ghosh\u2019s body out of the copter, letting it drop to the rocks, and another four carried it by the ropes. Soon the helicopter was gone again, to get Paresh Nath.Over a couple of hours that morning, the bodies, along with guides and supplies coming off the mountain for the season, were ferried to a green plain at about 14,000 feet. At noon, the bodies of Ghosh, Nath and the other Indian climber were piled on top in the small cargo space behind the pilot\u2019s seat. Several guides climbed on top of the bodies, happy to have a ride downhill.They flew down a cloud-covered river bed, thick with spring runoff. Seven minutes later, the helicopter landed at Lukla in a cold, light rain. Men muscled the bodies to the ground.Among the men waiting who converged on the cargo was one of the three West Bengal government officials and several police officers from Lukla. Soon, more officers arrived, in uniform. Part of their job was to identify and investigate dead bodies coming out of the mountains above.\u201cThe police tried to take the bodies inside, but we didn\u2019t have the manpower to move them,\u201d Dawa Finjhok Sherpa said. \u201cThey asked us to remove the clothes and the wraps, but they were all frozen. So they said, O.K., just unwrap their faces. They took pictures of their faces.\u201dThe formal investigation took a couple of hours. Down in Kathmandu, Debasish Ghosh stood among about three dozen people waiting at a hospital helipad in the late-afternoon light. The helicopter soon appeared as a silent dot over the city\u2019s skyline. It grew larger and louder until it touched down in a swirl of wind and dust.\u201cI cannot stop thinking about the money spent to retrieve his body,\u201d Debasish Ghosh said. \u201cIf we had spent the money earlier, if we had helped Goutam when he was alive, so that he could find a better agency, or buy more oxygen or make better preparations, could he have survived? Would he be home now, alive? Did we contribute to his death because we didn\u2019t help him until now?\u201dNo one paid Debasish much attention. Not the government officials from West Bengal, quick to reach the helicopter the moment it landed. Not Loben Sherpa, who organized the fateful expedition the year before, or Mingma Sherpa, the owner of Seven Summits, who was paid to recover the bodies. Not the few journalists who had gathered, nor the neighborhood children who rushed to see what the excitement was about.Debasish stood back, without expression, his hands folded behind him. His brother\u2019s body was the first out, laid stiffly on the concrete. People surged forward to get closer. Debasish crossed his arms.Within a couple of minutes, the helicopter was emptied of its cargo and gone again. People and their cameras followed its skyward arc, but Debasish stared intently at his brother\u2019s corpse. No one spoke to him. No one asked if he wanted to get closer to the body. No one comforted him. No one offered to have him meet Dawa Finjhok Sherpa, who led the recovery effort and accompanied the body every step from its yearlong home near the Balcony of Everest to the helipad in Kathmandu.The bodies were lifted into the back of a waiting, unmarked sport utility vehicle and driven around the vast compound of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, to the service entrance at the Department of Forensic Medicine. Government officials arrived quickly by car. Nobody offered Debasish a ride. He walked the 10 minutes, alone.On the ground floor was a warm, dimly lit hallway where a dead body lay uncovered on a table. The lights and air-conditioning in the building had been on sporadically because of power failures, a persistent problem. A service entrance from the dock was on one end. A table was at the other, where a police representative kept guard.Two silver, dented doors opened into what was called the Forensic Demonstration Room. There were three stainless steel tables, each framed with edges to keep things from spilling off the edges. The tables had drains that fed into tubes under the table, and the tile floors had drains, too. Above each table was an electrical outlet to plug in power tools.The three bodies were unloaded from the car and carried into the service entrance. Ghosh\u2019s and Nath\u2019s were placed on the floor of the hallway, to one side. Their names were written in marker on the tattered coverings that had wrapped them all the way from near the summit of Everest.Debasish Ghosh was escorted inside. He told someone that his brother\u2019s name was misspelled.The bodies were not unwrapped, and Debasish did not see his brother\u2019s face. He touched the body only through the layers of clothes and wrappings, and tried to give it a squeeze. It needed to thaw for a couple of days before it could be examined.At 11 in the morning on May 31, a team of forensic doctors huddled over the body of Goutam Ghosh.The bodies had been placed on their own examination tables the day before. A pipe ran warm water over them to help them thaw. For the first time, Debasish Ghosh was taken to look at his brother\u2019s face. He was struck not by overwhelming emotion, but by how black his brother\u2019s face was. He was in the room for less than a minute.Bodies found at such high elevations, where the temperatures remain below freezing, are well preserved. The outside of the body appears intact, if shrunken and mummified. There is little decomposition internally. Threats found in other remote locations, such as heat, soggy conditions or animal scavengers, are not an issue at such high elevations.The university\u2019s forensics department, led by Dr. Pramod Kumar Shrestha, performs six to eight post-mortems on a typical day. Maybe 15 examinations a year are for people who died high in the Himalayas, some of them climbers, some of them villagers.\u201cAfter one year, it may be difficult to determine the cause of death,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cBut we eliminate the possibilities one by one, until we are left with plausible explanations.\u201dMany climbers who succumb to the elements are said to have died of high-altitude illness, a vague diagnosis. It was presumed to be what happened to Ghosh and Nath.\u201cThe head-regulating mechanics stop functioning when you\u2019re in extreme cold temperatures,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cWith a lack of oxygen, the brain stops functioning. It is not able to coordinate various functions of the body. It\u2019s the brain that coordinates the regulation of your body.\u201dSometimes there are several possible explanations.\u201cThey may have some injuries from falling or something,\u201d Shrestha said. \u201cThey may have broken bones, internal injuries, a skull fracture, bruises. It depends on the conditions of their death. A lack of oxygen, an exposure to cold, starves the brain. The lungs get a froth in the respiratory passages. But it could be accompanied by a disease. Maybe they died there, but they had heart disease. We check all the internal organs for signs of pre-existing conditions.\u201dWith Ghosh, the doctors began with external observations, something often done by a police investigator looking for clues to a violent death. \u201cThe face appears partially mummified. Both the feet are soddened,\u201d the doctors wrote in the final report for Ghosh. The eyes were \u201cshrunken and collapsed,\u201d they reported. They found lacerations on his right hand, perhaps stemming from rough handling during the recovery. There were no broken bones.A saw was used to cut into the head to retrieve the brain and to split the rib cage to inspect internal organs. The saw cut from behind one ear to the other, over the top of the head. The skin was pulled back, front to back, the skull opened and the brain removed. It was weighed and examined. No abnormalities were found. The brain was replaced, the skull fitted together and the skin sewn.\u201cWe try to keep the body as presentable as possible,\u201d Shrestha said.There was an abnormal amount of fluid in the lungs. The chambers of the heart contained only \u201cpost-mortem clot.\u201d The kidneys \u201cappear congested,\u201d the report said. But the heart and Ghosh\u2019s other organs, most of them removed and weighed, were determined to be normal for a 50-year-old man.The abdomen and the chest were sewn back together, leaving a crude, thick laceration. The exam lasted about 45 minutes. In the final report, the doctors listed the cause of death as \u201cundetermined.\u201dA similar examination for Nath, noting his missing left hand and some abrasions, ended with the same conclusion.The bodies of Ghosh and Nath were carted to a nearby room, in the Department of Anatomy, for embalming. A mix of formaldehyde, glycerin and rectified spirits was injected into their cavities and soft tissue. The bodies were shrouded in plastic wrapping and placed inside wood coffins, along with white cotton cloths.On one coffin was a photocopy of Ghosh\u2019s passport. On the other was a copy of Nath\u2019s. They were attached to the lids of the coffins with clear packing tape.Before the coffins were sealed, though, Debasish Ghosh, wearing a surgical mask, entered and took another look at his brother. He asked for his brother\u2019s boots as a memento. And he asked for the boots of Nath, to give to his family.Preparations were complete at the Ghosh house when the sun came up in Kolkata on June 2, the temperature on its way past 100 degrees. The family\u2019s sitting room, really an unused storefront with yellow walls, was cleared of furniture and the roll-up door raised. Ghosh\u2019s faded climbing boots sat in a corner near his photograph.\u201cI must see him again,\u201d his wife, Chandana, said in the room the day before. \u201cMost times, the bodies are left on Everest. No one can see the body again. No one can touch the body again. At least I will see him once more. I will touch him one more time.\u201dThe hearse crept into the crowd, and was immediately surrounded by mourners. Some hung on to the vehicle and cried. Many aimed their cameras inside, where Ghosh\u2019s body was out of the coffin, draped in white cloths, his feet and face exposed for all to see. A yellow cap, like the one he wore when he died, was on his head. It covered the scar from the autopsy on his skull.The women of the family rushed inside the house, and the body was carried through the throng and placed on the floor. A human chain formed to keep people back amid pushing and shouting. The room, about 10 feet by 20 feet, was stuffed with 50 people. It was swelteringly hot. Women knelt at Ghosh\u2019s side and cried.Chandana broke down near her husband\u2019s left hip and flung herself on top of his corpse. She sat up again, inconsolable, her face and hair wet with tears and sweat. Her nephew lifted a cup of water to her lips and wiped her face with a wet cloth.Ghosh\u2019s mother, her face anguished, wailed and fell atop her dead son.After 20 minutes, the body was carried across the street, onto a platform in the shade. A line formed to pay respects, starting down the block and curling around Ghosh\u2019s body, soon piled with flowers.After an hour in the midday heat, the body was lifted back into the hearse. A group with a banner led the procession onto Old Calcutta Road, followed by mourners in two single-file lines. The hearse followed, and then family members and close friends, some dropping puffed rice and splashing water to the ground, followed by police and military officers. Debasish\u2019s teenage son had downloaded the music of his uncle\u2019s favorite singer into his phone, and Kishore Kumar\u2019s voice warbled from the hearse\u2019s speakers en route to the crematory.At the same time, more than 100 miles to the northwest, a similar ritual unfolded for Paresh Nath in Durgapur. His body arrived in a hearse to the courtyard of his home, where a huge crowd awaited. The lid of the coffin was pried off, and the plastic wrap that encased his body was torn open at the head. A flag of the Durgapur Mountaineers Association was draped on top of him. The body was soon smothered in garlands and petals.Sabita Nath sobbed, and held tight to her son, Adrishikar, now 10, who came face-to-face with the corpse of his father after a year of denying his death. The body was taken to the mountaineering club, where another crowd gathered, and then to the Birbhanpur Cremation Ground along the Damodar River.Adrishikar, as his son, was responsible for the cremation rituals. He was shown all the ritualistic steps and performed them \u2014 the touching of rice and water and fire to the lips, the chanting, the circling. The young boy who had washed his father\u2019s hand after meals when his father was alive was there when his father\u2019s body was slid into the incinerator, and there to take the ashes to the river, and to break the urn, and to dunk himself in the water. And when it was over, he returned home and held his mother again.Thirteen men carried Ghosh\u2019s body up some steps inside the dim, dusty crematory in Kolkata. In the room upstairs, fluorescent bulbs overhead did not provide enough light, and a ceiling fan did not provide enough breeze. One side of the room had an iron gate that opened to an incinerator.The group lifted Ghosh\u2019s body onto a bamboo stretcher. The white linen sheet that covered him was pulled back to reveal a red-and-black track suit. The jacket was opened, exposing a thick, zipperlike scar from the autopsy.Several sticks of incense were lit. In a bowl, rice, banana and ghee were mashed together. A nephew fed it to his uncle\u2019s lips. He poured sacred Ganges water into his hand and sprinkled it on Ghosh\u2019s blackened face, then over the rest of his body. The group chanted prayers and mantras. Debasish Ghosh stood in the corner, expressionless.The body was carried and placed headfirst on rails that disappeared under the metal door of a 10-foot-tall oven. Several times, a man called, \u201cBalo Hari.\u201d The group answered, \u201cHari Bol,\u201d a plea to Lord Krishna to take Ghosh from earth to heaven. The door opened slightly to reveal an orange glow. Someone pulled a lever, and the body slid into the opening. The door closed behind it.Back at the Ghosh house, Ghosh\u2019s widow, Chandana, had changed clothes. Gone was the colorful sari, replaced by a white one with small, subtle flowers. She had no sindoor tilak, the vermilion smear along the hairline that signaled marriage, and no red bindi dot on her forehead.The red and white bangles on her wrist were gone, too. While her husband\u2019s body was cremated, she broke them. A year after her husband died on Everest, she was finally a widow.The calendar on the bedroom wall still showed May 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florida Plane Crash in Dense Fog Kills 5 on Christmas Eve", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe arrived around 6:30 a.m. on Sunday bearing the small gifts that the employees at a municipal Florida airport had come to expect from him. (On Christmas Eve, they were cookies.)He also dropped off a flight plan that indicated he would take an approximately 45-minute flight to the Florida Keys for a family getaway before returning later in the day.But shortly after taking off in dense fog near Tampa, the pilot, John H. Shannon, 70, and four others \u2014 including two of his daughters \u2014 were killed in a crash, the authorities said. The twin-engine plane burst into flames after going down at Bartow Municipal Airport in Polk County, Fla.The Cessna aircraft took off despite thick fog that had settled over the airport shortly before sunrise and had limited visibility to less than one-fifth of a mile.\u201cNo one should have attempted to take off in a small plane in that weather,\u201d Grady Judd, the Polk County sheriff, said at a news conference on Sunday.An airport employee who was filming the fog on a cellphone recorded the sounds of the plane taking off and crashing, Sheriff Judd said. The fog was so thick that the plane could not be seen in the video, he said.Also killed on Sunday were two of Mr. Shannon\u2019s daughters, Olivia Shannon, 24, and Victoria Shannon Worthington, 26, as well as Ms. Worthington\u2019s husband, Peter Worthington, 27. A family friend, Krista Clayton, 32, was also on board, the authorities said. The group had planned to eat lunch in Key West.\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy of monumental proportions when it happens on Christmas Eve,\u201d said Sheriff Judd, who said he had been friends with Mr. Shannon for years.Mr. Shannon had been planning to take the trip from Lakeland, Fla., where he lived, to the Florida Keys with his daughters for the holidays, said John Liguori, a friend. Over coffee several days ago, Mr. Shannon told him he would depart on Christmas Eve or Christmas, depending on the weather.\u201cMore than the flight, he was looking forward to spending time with his two girls and the husband of his daughter,\u201d Mr. Liguori, a lawyer in Lakeland, said in a phone interview.Ms. Worthington and her husband arrived on Friday from Baltimore, where they lived. She taught fourth-grade English at a public school in Baltimore, and Mr. Worthington attended law school. They were married in June, and her father\u2019s Facebook profile photo shows him with his daughters at her wedding.Ms. Shannon attended Southeastern University, a private Christian college in Lakeland. Ms. Clayton, a middle school teacher, had a husband and two children \u2014 a 3-year-old girl and an 18-month-old.Mr. Liguori said that Mr. Shannon, a longtime personal injury lawyer, changed his lifestyle after he separated from the daughters\u2019 mother when they were young. He gave up golf and devoted himself to them, he said. Mr. Shannon had another daughter from a previous marriage, Mr. Liguori said.Mr. Shannon was still practicing law, and had also embraced two other passions: politics and planes. He ran for Florida state representative in 2014 as a Republican and lost in a primary election by fewer than 175 votes. In 2010 he received his pilot\u2019s license and flew regularly, including on trips to Alabama to visit a daughter in college, Mr. Liguori said.He said that Mr. Shannon, a former Marine, took both his legal practice and flying seriously. \u201cHe was very focused when he flew,\u201d he said.On Sunday morning, the Cessna 340 briefly lifted off the runway but quickly plunged to the ground, the authorities said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy who responded to a 911 call found the wreckage in flames in a grass field.The cause of the crash is under investigation. But Sheriff Judd said it appeared that fog could have been a factor in the accident. About 45 minutes before the plane took off, the National Weather Service in Tampa reported low visibility at regional airports and forecast worsening fog after sunrise. Visibility at the Bartow airport was 0.15 miles at 7:15 a.m., the Weather Service said.\u201cThat\u2019s being quite generous,\u201d Cindy Barrow, the executive director at the Bartow airport, said in an interview. \u201cWhat I was understanding was that visibility was pretty much zero.\u201dMs. Barrow said that the control tower was closed for Christmas Eve but that pilots like Mr. Shannon can decide to take off on their own. She noted that pilots who fly in those conditions must be experienced because they have to use a plane\u2019s instruments, as opposed to looking outside, to determine speed, altitude and direction.Sheriff Judd said a pilot with the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office who was at the airport at the time of the crash told him that conditions were unsafe for small aircraft. \u201cThe conditions were not conducive for taking off this morning,\u201d the sheriff said.Advertisement"}

Maybe they\u2019ll believe me, too.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Moretti, who is now in Europe, said that the encounter was consensual and that he was \u201chorrified by the allegations.\u201dOne student, Emma Eisenberg, who received her master\u2019s in creative writing in 2014, claimed that Mr. Casey repeatedly touched her and other female students on their \u201cshoulders, buttocks and lower backs and made sexual and gender-based comments,\u201d according to a university document.In an email, Ms. Eisenberg explained why she was coming forward now.\u201cIn my gut I knew there was something wrong about those experiences, but it was so openly talked about within the program that I figured I was overreacting,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing this recent flood of women coming forward confirmed what I had always known \u2014 his behavior was problematic and inappropriate.\u201dThe university said it was investigating the complaints, and Mr. Casey, who was on sabbatical this semester, has been barred from teaching in the spring. In an email, Mr. Casey said it \u201cwould be premature and possibly improper to discuss a matter that has scarcely begun.\u201dAt the University of Southern California, officials said they had received an \u201cuptick\u201d in complaints since the first Weinstein reports, many of them describing a comparable dynamic: a man who is powerful in his field, mistreating younger women who depend on him for career advancement. Some of the reports named professors long gone from the university, while others accused men still teaching there.In a letter to the campus on Oct. 29, the provost, Michael Quick, announced he was convening a series of forums and task forces. \u201cThere is no place on our campuses, or in our society, for abuse of power,\u201d it said.Neither Spelman nor Morehouse would disclose how many complaints it has received, and in interviews, Spelman students and professors said they did not believe sexual assault was any more common there than elsewhere.But most said they believed the colleges had not been taking the issue seriously enough. Now their pent-up frustration has burst into the open during a national moment of reckoning.In a three-minute speech on Nov. 9, the day the graffiti was found on the King chapel, Harold Martin Jr., the interim president of Morehouse, said there was \u201cclearly a belief that there is a population that does not feel heard.\u201d\u201cWe will do the work,\u201d he said, encouraging victims to come forward. (Almost all of the names on Twitter had been posted anonymously.) \u201cNobody has come by my office, but I hope you will.\u201dThe issue was particularly painful for Spelman students, who spoke of a shared legacy with Morehouse that gave them great pride and, they said, could be perversely discouraging victims from coming forward or assailants from being punished.The students are also steeped in African-American history, and many Spelman women said they felt a responsibility to protect black men from negative stereotypes.\u201cHaving your brother\u2019s back or your sister\u2019s back, that\u2019s something that\u2019s said,\u201d said Euphoria Davis, a 21-year-old senior. \u201cI\u2019ve had someone tell me to my face that I\u2019m tarnishing the reputation of Morehouse by speaking out.\u201dMs. Davis said she was na\u00efve and had never done more than kiss a man when she arrived from the Philadelphia suburbs in 2014. During her first semester, at a warehouse party off-campus, she said, a Morehouse student asked her to dance. When she declined, she said, he grabbed her and pulled her outside the building, assisted by other men.She said she was too intoxicated to defend herself while the men pushed her against a wall and took turns raping her.After struggling emotionally throughout the year, she found solace in telling her story to others and speaking out on behalf of sexual assault victims, she said. When she was contacted by Morehouse\u2019s Title IX office, which handles sexual-misconduct complaints and had heard about her allegations, she declined to pursue a claim.She was intimidated, she said, by a competitive campus culture where reputation is paramount. She and other students described a fierce social hierarchy that existed among the two schools \u2014 which have only about 2,000 students each \u2014 where one false step can cause a person to be ostracized.\u201cI\u2019m not going to get the outcome that I want from this,\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to go through the stress of having my whole life exposed to have them just walk away.\u201dAnother senior, Evalyne Neely-Savitt, said that when she arrived for her freshman year, she was hoping to become part of another mythic Spelman-Morehouse power couple.Instead of her idealized vision, one of her first encounters with Morehouse men was at a fraternity party where one threw her over his shoulder, placed his head between her legs and simulated oral sex while squeezing her thighs and bottom.The crowd cheered and afterward, people around her congratulated her for capturing the student\u2019s attention. So she felt she would not be supported for speaking out against what she considered an assault.\u201cI feel like I wouldn\u2019t have been heard,\u201d she said.Students also described practical barriers to adjudicating sexual assault. The porous boundaries that allow students to mill back and forth between the two campuses to study and socialize are not mirrored in the way that the schools are governed. Numerous Spelman women said that because complaints against Morehouse men were investigated by Morehouse, they did not expect fair treatment.In an email, a Spelman spokeswoman, Joyce E. Davis, said the college had expanded its Title IX office in the last two years and reached out to women to encourage them to report complaints. \u201cSpelman takes every reported incident extremely seriously,\u201d she said.She added, however, that the college is \u201cnot permitted to sanction students from other educational institutions.\u201dAt Morehouse, reaction to the campaign was mixed. Isaiah Smalls, the editor of The Maroon Tiger, the campus newspaper, said he planned an entire issue on sexual assault. \u201cI believe that as a campus, we\u2019re not as educated as we should be,\u201d he said.But an angry backlash emerged from some on the campus, who called the public accusations reckless and said that at least some were untrue.\u201cI was devastated,\u201d said one of the students named on Twitter. \u201cI felt the energy that I had gained up to that point being drained out of me.\u201dThe student, who asked that his name not be published, said he had sex with a Spelman student during his first semester after receiving her consent. She later accused him of assault.The allegations triggered a yearlong investigation, which, according to a Morehouse document, was ultimately decided in his favor. But by the time it was resolved, the student said, his grades had dropped, he had struggled to sleep because of anxiety, and he lost some scholarship money after being temporarily barred from playing sports.In his speech, Mr. Martin, the Morehouse interim president, said that anyone who committed sexual violence or harassment would be held accountable. He also cautioned against \u201cjumping to judgment\u201d about students who were accused.He ended with an admonition. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to be the last time that anybody defaces the chapel on our campus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will do the work on this important issue. Is that clear?\u201dThat day, maintenance workers removed the spray paint from the chapel. Its faint outlines, however, remain.Caitlin Dickerson reported from Atlanta, and Stephanie Saul from New York.

{"Headline": "For Russian \u2018Trolls,\u2019 Instagram\u2019s Pictures Can Spread Wider Than Words", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The enduring popularity of a provocative post on Instagram, created by a company with connections to the Kremlin, demonstrates why fighting propaganda on social media will be an uphill battle.The photograph in the post, of a smiling woman wearing a black hijab, seems innocent. But the text around it was crafted to push buttons. This is a woman, readers are warned, who hates everything from Jews and Christians to lesbians and wine \u2014 yet she \u201ccomplains about Islamophobia.\u201dSince it was posted on Nov. 8, the image has been \u201cliked\u201d by more than 6,000 people on Instagram, the image-sharing site owned by Facebook. What those people probably did not know was that it was created by the Internet Research Agency, or I.R.A., a so-called Russian troll farm that employed hundreds to influence discussions online by stirring debate in comment sections below online stories and creating provocative posts on social media.The account where the post first appeared was banned by Instagram this year, but other accounts continue to spread the image.A Facebook spokesman said the company takes disinformation seriously and was continuing its efforts to \u201cstop foreign interference.\u201d\u201cAs part of our investigation, we found and removed around 170 I.R.A. accounts on Instagram that were responsible for approximately 120,000 posts,\u201d the spokesman, Tom Reynolds, said.He added, \u201cOur review of this activity is ongoing, and we continue to monitor for and remove fake accounts.\u201dMr. Albright\u2019s research documented how the photo-friendly service was widely used by Russian trolls, and how it continues to be a hub for those images to be shared and shared again. He analyzed 28 of the 170 accounts that Instagram removed from its platform after discovering that they had been created by the I.R.A., which is based in St. Petersburg, Russia.Using publicly available information on sites that archive social media posts, Mr. Albright found 2.5 million recorded interactions with posts from the accounts, as well as 145 million likely interactions with people who had passively viewed them.Mr. Albright said that those figures were not the complete picture \u2014 he was not able to account for how many people had shared images on Instagram by taking screen grabs or through a variety of third-party apps that allow for reposting of images.This month, it was shared to a popular Instagram account called Republican.s, which says it represents \u201cthe Republicans and Conservatives of Instagram.\u201d It has more than 100,000 followers.An administrator of Republican.s declined to answer why the account had shared the image, or if the person running the account was aware of the image\u2019s Russian origin. When reached on Instagram, which allows users to send a message to any account they follow, the administrator said he or she had only recently taken over the account.The person responding to messages refused to answer any other questions about who he or she is or who previously controlled the account and managed its posts. No information was provided on the Instagram account other than a brief description.Mr. Albright said it was not unusual for accounts to share images without checking their source.\u201cInstagram has all the social aspects of Facebook, but it is more powerful for visual messaging than Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about sharing images from many different sources with a community. It\u2019s more focused on the conversations sparked by those images, on the controversy around them.\u201dNir Eyal, author of \u201cHooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,\u201d said Instagram was expressly designed to make images quick and easy to share.\u201cInstagram is a much more intimate place than Facebook and Twitter,\u201d Mr. Eyal said. \u201cPeople on Instagram have a more targeted list of people they follow. It\u2019s a tight network of people who share images with each other.\u201dWithin Instagram, users often share one another\u2019s posts, a process known as \u201cregramming,\u201d or copy and post images they have spotted from other social media platforms. That makes it difficult to entirely eliminate an image from the site.The images created by the Russian accounts were designed to draw both interest and anger on divisive issues. In one image, a father and son hold guns, and the text asks whether all fathers wouldn\u2019t choose to protect their families, given the chance. In another, a young child, presumably a Syrian refugee, holds a jagged knife. The text around his head suggests that Americans are being killed for \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201dIn comments below the images, thousands weighed in on whether the United States should allow refugees from Syria to enter the United States. Mr. Albright said it was a typical example of how Instagram had become more than just a site for sharing images \u2014 and had become a hub for debate.Advertisement"}

She was 77.With the publication of her latest book in August, Ms. Grafton\u2019s alphabetical series had reached \u201cY Is for Yesterday.\u201d\u201cShe was adamant that her books would never be turned into movies or TV shows,\u201d her daughter wrote, \u201cand in that same vein, she would never allow a ghost writer to write in her name. Because of all of those things, and out of the deep abiding love and respect for our dear sweet Sue, as far as we in the family are concerned, the alphabet now ends at Y.\u201dMs. Grafton\u2019s husband, Steven F. Humphrey, said her illness had prevented her from making any progress on the planned final book in the series, although she did have the title.\u201cShe always said that last book would be \u2018Z Is for Zero,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019d been saying that for 30 years.\u201dSue Taylor Grafton was born on April 24, 1940, in Louisville, Ky. Her father, C. W. Grafton, was a lawyer who also wrote mystery novels, and her mother, the former Vivian Harnsberger, was a teacher.Ms. Grafton graduated from the University of Louisville in 1961 and tried but quickly abandoned a graduate program, instead moving to California. Her first novel, \u201cKeziah Dane,\u201d was published in 1967. She helped adapt her second, \u201cThe Lolly-Madonna War\u201d (1969), into a screenplay, and after that movie was released in 1973, she worked intermittently writing for television. A series she created, \u201cNurse,\u201d ran for two seasons on CBS in the early 1980s.But she did not care for the dynamics of writing for TV and film.She had actually written seven novels before she began the alphabet series.\u201cOf those, No. 4 and 5 were published,\u201d she told The Star Tribune. \u201cThe rest are in the trash.\u201d\u201cA Is for Alibi\u201d was her eighth book and, she said, \u201cmy ticket out of Hollywood.\u201dThe notion of the alphabetical series, she said, was inspired by \u201cThe Gashlycrumb Tinies,\u201d Edward Gorey\u2019s macabre 1963 rhyming book in which 26 children meet bizarre ends.\u201cI was smitten with all those little Victorian children being dispatched in various ways,\u201d she told The New York Times in 2015. \u201c \u2018A is for Amy who fell down the stairs; B is for Basil assaulted by bears; C is for Clara who wasted away; D is for Desmond thrown out of a sleigh.\u2019 Edward Gorey was deliciously bent.\u201dHer book series features Kinsey Millhone, a private investigator, whom \u201cA Is for Alibi\u201d introduced this way:\u201cMy name is Kinsey Millhone. I\u2019m a private investigator, licensed by the state of California. I\u2019m thirty-two years old, twice divorced, no kids. The day before yesterday I killed someone and the fact weighs heavily on my mind.\u201dMs. Grafton read the Nancy Drew books and Agatha Christie growing up, but, she said, the first book that really rocked her was Mickey Spillane\u2019s \u201cI, the Jury.\u201d\u201cAfter Nancy Drew and Agatha Christie, what a revelation!\u201d she said, \u201cand it may have been the moment when the spirit of Kinsey Millhone first sparked to life.\u201dKinsey\u2019s debut, though, did not impress at least one critic.The reading public apparently thought otherwise. The Millhone books routinely made best-seller lists. They also established a star female presence \u2014 both character and author \u2014 in a genre that leaned heavily male.\u201cMs. Grafton and P. I. Millhone floated in on the same zephyr of welcome fresh air that during the past decade has brought us a number of other women writing about women operatives in the traditionally male-dominated genre of American private eye fiction,\u201d the writer Ed Weiner said in reviewing \u201cF Is for Fugitive\u201d for The Times in 1989.\u201cNone of them \u2014 and Ms. Grafton may be the best of the bunch \u2014 have gone so far as to redefine the genre,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey play it fairly conservative and conventional. But in their work there is thankfully little of the macho posturing and luggish rogue beefcake found so often in the male versions, no Hemingwayesque mine-is-bigger-than-yours competitive literary swaggering.\u201dMs. Grafton said one difference between her books and the ones with male protagonists was her willingness to deal with the \u201chuman and emotional ramifications\u201d of violent crime.In addition to Mr. Humphrey, her third husband, whom she married in 1978, and Ms. Clark, her daughter from a previous marriage, Ms. Grafton is survived by another daughter, Leslie Twine, and a son, Jay Schmidt, also from previous marriages; four granddaughters; one great-grandson; and a sister, Ann Cox. She had homes in Santa Barbara County and Louisville.\u201cWhen I started, she was 32 and I was 42,\u201d Ms. Grafton said. \u201cAnd now she\u2019s 39 and I\u2019m 77, which I just do not think is fair.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the N.F.L., Stability Comes With a $200 Million Price Tag", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballIn a word, continuity, numerous owners said, and the start of a smooth transition to new leadership, as Goodell begins the process of finding a suitable successor to take over when his deal expires in 2024, if he does not decide to leave sooner.Goodell, the owners acknowledge, is hardly the perfect leader for North America\u2019s most successful sports league. His tenure, they know, has been filled with missteps and controversies, unforced errors and self-inflicted wounds.But he has worked for the league for 35 years, and he knows, better than anyone, the owners, their ancestors and their progeny. That is no small thing. He knows which ones he must listen to, and which ones he can pretend to listen to, and how to finesse them. The same goes for the media titans who have helped turn the N.F.L. into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. During his tenure as commissioner, which began in 2006, Goodell has helped team values skyrocket, and the owners are betting that will continue under his leadership.\u201cYou can\u2019t be cutting off your nose to spite your face,\u201d one owner said of his colleagues who want to replace Goodell for his missteps, most notably in his handling of player discipline and off-field controversies. \u201cPeople tend to focus on the things he did wrong. But who\u2019s going to replace him? That\u2019s when things bog down.\u201dThe owners did not want to speak publicly about league business before Wednesday\u2019s owners\u2019 meetings.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones tried for months to undermine the new deal, arguing that Goodell should not be rewarded with a new contract while the league was facing big challenges, like the decline in television ratings and player protests during the national anthem. Jones hired the star lawyer David Boies and threatened to sue his fellow owners if they did not halt the contract talks, a move that led to his ouster last month from the compensation committee.At the one-day owners\u2019 meetings here on Wednesday, Jones and several of his allies continued to quietly complain about the deal, Goodell\u2019s leadership and a league office they believe is filled with too many meddlesome executives.Speaking after the meeting, Goodell tried to downplay the friction created by his contract extension. He said that the league was stronger because owners were able to disagree, both among themselves and with the commissioner. He added that his relationship with Jones has not been damaged.\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, I\u2019m not paid to agree and he\u2019s not paid to agree with me,\u201d Goodell said.Goodell then gave Jones an awkward hug and left the room.Jones took the podium and said the owners will consider changing the N.F.L.\u2019s constitution to give them more sway over league executives, including the commissioner. He added that the owners would look at trimming the power of the department that investigates off-field behavior by players.Jones tried to downplay the tension he created when he threatened to sue the owners on the compensation committee, saying that he was only trying to improve the league. But he also took a dig at the size of the commissioner\u2019s new contract.\u201cI know how much Roger Goodell loves the National Football League, and he should love it even more right now,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Jones failed to derail Goodell\u2019s new contract because of a basic truth: Whatever their differences, most owners believe Goodell is still the best man to lead the league, and they know there is no credible replacement they could agree on. That\u2019s why, in May, the owners voted unanimously to extend his contract through 2024, and they raised little fuss when the compensation committee offered him a deal worth up to $40 million a year.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the compensation committee, said on Wednesday that most of the other owners were glad the fight with Jones was over.\u201cThe owners were bothered by anything that was a distraction from the league, the league\u2019s business,\u201d Blank said. \u201cThere was a strong feeling in the room that we need to bond together, be together.\u201dMany owners say it would be risky to replace Goodell at a critical juncture for the N.F.L. Roughly half of the league\u2019s revenue comes from broadcast and media deals, yet television ratings are down for the second straight year. In the coming years, networks could balk at paying even more for the rights to show games as the league continues to chip away at the legacy media companies\u2019 traditional lock on N.F.L. content. Digital media companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, have shown little appetite for competing for rights that now cost more than $1 billion a year.Some of the world\u2019s most prosperous companies clamor to become league sponsors, but that enthusiasm has been eroded by a series of public relations disasters, including, most recently, the protests during the national anthem.\u201cWe take that very seriously,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThose are issues that are important to us. We want to make sure all of our employees, whether at the NFL Network or league office, or at clubs, are working in a safe and comfortable environment.\u201dAlso, with the league\u2019s labor agreement set to expire in 2020, and its television contracts expiring in 2021 and 2022, Goodell\u2019s institutional knowledge could be difficult to replace. He has been willing to cede much of the power during labor and media negotiations to a handful of key owners, something a hypothetical replacement might not be willing to do.\u201cIn an industry as complicated as ours, with fans, media, owners and players, you have to have someone who understands the league\u2019s business,\u201d another owner said. \u201cYou need to understand each owner\u2019s personality, understand the process and understand how to get votes.\u201dStill, several owners said that they have protected themselves in case Goodell falters. They structured his contract so that 90 percent of his compensation is based on financial and nonfinancial goals, and the members of three influential committees made up of about 20 owners will decide whether he meets the targets.According to several owners, Goodell has already said that he will not seek another contract beyond 2024, when he will be 65. Grooming a successor, or searching for one outside the league\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters, will be one of his chief responsibilities. One owner added that Goodell may leave after a new labor deal is struck or the league\u2019s broadcast contracts are renewed, and not finish his contract.\u201cI think there is a limit to how many years you should serve in this,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared and ready to go.\u201dAt the very least, the fight over Goodell\u2019s contract and his leadership skills has forced the owners to openly discuss the league\u2019s future, another owner said. With the contract dispute seemingly resolved, the owners are confronting the far more complex and daunting tasks ahead.Advertisement"}

His decision to step down ended a standstill arrangement between the company and the Icahn Group.\u201cThe CEO is the most important person in the company. We believe Xerox still has potential, but it will go the way of Kodak if there aren\u2019t major changes. The times have changed but not the old guard that controls the board,\u201d Mr. Icahn said.\u201cCorporate actions taken by Xerox, though commendable, are no match for the ravages of the digital world. Selling the company may be the logical next move.\u201dIn 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content. Siri should be able to extract valuable information for the user from what it hears and what it sees. It could also then let you add that song to your Apple Music playlist, watch the trailer, or even buy the movie on iTunes, and so on. That\u2019s much easier to achieve once Siri has swallowed Shazam.In arguing that NXP Semiconductors is worth $135 per share \u2014 on an independent basis, and therefore leaving aside Qualcomm\u2019s takeover bid \u2014 the activist hedge fund is threatening to add more to Broadcom\u2019s hostile acquisition campaign for Qualcomm.\u201cWhile NXP\u2019s operating performance has fully bounced back over the past year, its stock price has not \u2013 again, likely due to, in our view, the ceiling created by Qualcomm\u2019s low priced offer.\u201dThe Qualcomm responseFor now, the chip maker said that it disagrees with Elliott\u2019s analysis. Its statement:\u201cElliott\u2019s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda. We remain fully committed to closing the acquisition of NXP and believe that the agreed-upon price of $110 is full and fair.\u201d\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedAs of this morning, Bitcoin futures hit $17,540, from an open of $15,000.The Bitcoin flyaroundFrom the article by Irene Plagianos and Kitty Greenwald:Batali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they \u201cmatch up\u201d with ways he has behaved.\u201cI apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses.As recently as October, one of his employees had reported inappropriate behavior by the celebrity chef to human resources, according to Eater.\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\u201cFundamentally, the bill has been mislabeled. From a truth-in-advertising standpoint, it would have been a lot simpler if we just acknowledged reality on this bill, which is it\u2019s fundamentally a corporate tax reduction and restructuring bill, period,\u201d said Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.).Speed kills?Some high-income business owners could face marginal tax rates exceeding 100 percent under the Senate\u2019s tax bill, far beyond the listed rates in the Republican plan. That means a business owner\u2019s next $100 in earnings, under certain circumstances, would require paying more than $100 in additional federal and state taxes.From Mr. Raines\u2019s piece:Mr. Bishop, a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, said he had drifted over to the Democrats when Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal paid him and his jobless friends to work on the kind of infrastructure projects promised by candidate Trump. But he sees modern Democrats as detached from common folk. He\u2019ll vote for Mr. Moore and intends to \u201csway\u201d his wife from her plan to support Mr. Jones.Who else is on deck?\u2022 The big question remains: When will Gary Cohn leave? He\u2019s currently promoting the Republican tax plan, but will he depart afterward?In the F.C.C.\u2019s cornerBut since the giant edge providers \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter \u2014 are content providers, they are exempt from \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d rules, free to restrain content by censoring out all conservative and libertarian views at will, without so much as an explanation to anyone why the objectionable views were banned.A lament for Ms. Yellen\u2019s one term\u201cJanet should\u2019ve been renominated, as every past Fed chair has been renominated for nearly the last 40 years,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the first time and certainly not the last a highly qualified woman is passed over for a job she clearly deserves.\u201dBut Barron\u2019s also offers some caveats:The outlook isn\u2019t entirely rosy: Interest rates are headed higher, stocks are expensive, and a tax overhaul could still stall or fail. But so long as corporate earnings keep climbing and the Federal Reserve raises rates in a measured way, the strategists see more room for gains.Some people close to the deal talks said 20th Century Fox could become a production label within the Walt Disney Studios, akin to Pixar and Marvel. In that scenario, Fox operations such as theatrical and home-video distribution would likely be cut back, resulting in job losses among the studio\u2019s approximately 3,200 employees.The M. & A. flyaroundThe bigger picture David Fickling of Gadfly writes that there\u2019s a lesson here for other inveterate corporate deal makers \u2014 notably HNA of China.

{"Headline": "Instagram Is Now a Dating Platform, Too. Here\u2019s How It Works.", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAfter a couple, I was like, \u2018He\u2019s back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Forgione, 31, a photo producer in Brooklyn, said. He decided to take a chance and reach out in his direct messages. \u201cI asked him if he wanted to hang out, and he said yes,\u201d Mr. Forgione said. The two have continued seeing each other since, spending Thanksgiving together and attending a wedding as each other\u2019s dates.Anthea Fisher, 22, a project manager in finance, began a relationship on Instagram with someone she had known peripherally. \u201cWe liked each other\u2019s stuff from time to time,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, he started liking a lot of my stuff and watching all of my Stories. He would DM me, he would send me memes. And I sort of knew he was trying to get my attention.\u201dNot only does Instagram provide a visually driven collage of your life, it also offers a subtle way of expressing interest through likes and comments, and connecting in the form of a private chat. Meanwhile, the lists of users who have looked at each of your Story cards mean that you now have data \u2014 rudimentary and inconclusive, but still, data! \u2014 on who exactly is obsessing over you today, tomorrow and yesterday.\u201cThe theory is that whoever are your biggest stalkers on Instagram are at the top,\u201d Ms. Fisher said, referring to the lists of users who have looked at your Story. But that is just a theory. According to a spokesperson, the order is \u201cbased on a number of signals including people who recently viewed your story, accounts you interact with the most on Instagram, and more.\u201dTheir experiments yielded mixed results, and Instagram will likely keep the algorithm under lock and key until the end of time. So, if you want to gauge interest anytime soon, we recommend a tried-and-true thermometer: the thirst trap.Thirst: a strong desire for something; a lust for attention.Thirst trap: An image or video that\u2019s intended to attract attention from someone and elicit a response.\u201cA thirst trap can be as simple as a selfie,\u201d said Andrew Keller, 25, a creative strategist at Paper magazine. \u201cI can put up a really cute selfie of me, and the caption can be, \u2018Just ate a bag of Twizzlers, hate myself.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re throwing out a net into a sea of fish,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cWhenever I post a story, I kind of have an idea already of who will respond or what kind of response I will get.\u201d If you are successful, the person you are targeting will be tempted to comment. Might even actually comment. Might even \u201cslide into your DMs.\u201d If so, you have pulled off your very own thirst trap.\u201cEveryone has that one person in their mind that they want to see it,\u201d Mr. Keller said. Waiting for their response, he said, \u201ccan be torture in itself.\u201dOnce you have mastered the thirst trap, advance your skills by making use of the blocking tool. If you want to post something racy for a select few fans of your Stories, you can go into settings and hide the Story from other users. Ta-da! Now Susan from work will, quite fortunately, not see that photo of you perched seductively on her desk after-hours, a bottle of champagne from the holiday party in your hand.If you want your Dulcinea to know that you\u2019re categorically interested, you will have to do more than check their Stories and post thirst traps. Attend to their profile page, where you can see all their photos, as well. Paying a compliment on Instagram is as simple as liking a few photos. \u201cOne \u2018like\u2019 could be, \u2018I randomly liked your stuff\u2019\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cTwo is, \u2018I like two of your photos.\u2019 Three is, \u2018I\u2019m intentionally trying to get your attention.\u2019 It\u2019s the equivalent of eyeing someone in a bar.\u201d\u201cCommenting would be equivalent to walking up to someone and saying a very basic hello,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThe DMing is the official, \u2018I\u2019m here and I\u2019m not playing around.\u2019\u201d Ms. Fisher agreed: \u201cOnce they\u2019re in your DMs and they\u2019re commenting on things, that\u2019s when they\u2019re trying to make a move.\u201d As in real life, reciprocation is important. \u201cYou, of course, have to wait a little bit to see if they like your photos back,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you\u2019re looking at someone at the club and they\u2019re not looking back.\u201dAnother factor to keep in mind in the era of Insta-fame is how many followers your romantic interest has. \u201cAnyone above 75,000 is probably not going to notice you if you like their stuff,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIf they like your stuff, that\u2019s a different ball game because it means they went out of their way. Then it\u2019s, \u2018Ding, ding, ding.\u2019\u201dAnd though Instagram can offer more depth than an abbreviated Tinder or Bumble or Grindr profile, do not forget that it is still a curated highlight reel. \u201cI\u2019ve had guys straight up refuse to believe that I\u2019m me,\u201d said Kris Kidd, 24, a writer and model in Los Angeles with more than 24,000 followers on Instagram. When men meet him IRL, they are surprised to find that his real-life personality is not as exaggerated as his Instagram persona. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-dimensional platform, which inherently means we can\u2019t see everything. It would be really unhealthy to show all of ourselves on social media.\u201dAdjust your expectations accordingly.Unfortunately, Instagram is not all romance and daisies. In some cases, rather than serving as a conduit for an attraction, Instagram is a reminder of what is gone.When Mr. Forgione began dating his current flame, his ex-boyfriend started paying a lot of attention to his Stories and his feed. \u201cThe level of him creeping on me was out of control, to the point that he texted asking me, \u2018Who is your new boyfriend?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy I\u2019m seeing has posted things about me and just from him doing that and tagging me, I\u2019ve seen on my Stories guys who follow him looking at my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are creeping on him and then creeping on me.\u201dAnd he is not alone. \u201cI add a guy on my fake account even before we break up,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cAs soon as I know things are going south, I\u2019ll add him. I have a fake account that all my exes are on. And I have two exes watching my Stories on their fake accounts.\u201d Why look? \u201cI delete them [from my main account] to make a statement: \u2018I don\u2019t want to keep up with your life anymore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cBut I believe that knowledge is power,\u201d Mr. Yau said. \u201cEven if it makes me feel crappy, I still want to know.\u201d\u201cThe only person you want to be in that much pain with when you\u2019re breaking up is the person you\u2019re breaking up with, so maybe there\u2019s some impetus to look at their page to gauge how they\u2019re doing and look for some sign that they\u2019re also feeling bad,\u201d said Leora Trub, an assistant professor of psychology at Pace University and a clinical psychologist.Michel Kobbi, 27, a marketing manager from Montreal, offered a more positive take. \u201cSeeing the new life in pictures helps bring a certain closure,\u201d Mr. Kobbi said. \u201cThen I know I\u2019m totally fine with the relationship ending and I think it ends with another layer of healthiness to it. It\u2019s really turning the page for both people.\u201dOther social media platforms have had similar effects, but Instagram is massive (just Stories has nearly twice as many users as Snapchat does), and other pervasive platforms, such as Facebook, are not as dominated by daily, visual updates. Nor, frankly, are they considered as cool as Instagram. \u201cI obviously have Facebook, but I rarely, rarely use it,\u201d Mr. Forgione said. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s on it.\u201dAs with real-life breakups, each person will have a unique experience. \u201cHow we interpret it is totally idiosyncratic,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cIt could be, \u2018They\u2019re having such a great time\u2019 or \u2018They must be really compensating for how sad they are.\u2019\u201d\u201cPeople are giving themselves just enough information to come to conclusions about how that person is doing that have more to do with how they\u2019re perceiving how that person is doing rather than how they\u2019re actually doing,\u201d Dr. Trub said.And therein lies the final lesson: Instagram is a window, but also a facade. \u201cThe truth is you can\u2019t look at someone\u2019s Instagram account and know how they\u2019re feeling,\u201d Dr. Trub said.Advertisement"}

With the tap of a finger or the click of a mouse, social media users perform these actions so often they might seem insignificant. News publishers, however, pay attention.Why? Because these types of social interactions help publishers create a sense of community around their journalism and build reader loyalty, both key drivers for acquiring subscriptions and appealing to advertisers, who are eager to target their products to the most engaged readers.Ultimately, though, it was a lighter moment, that came during a dark time, that generated the most likes, comments and shares from Times readers.On Reddit, users were a little more wary. \u201cI honestly thought it was an article from The Onion at first,\u201d wrote one. \u201cThey are Category 5 ADORABLE,\u201d a Redditor wrote. \u201cNo way, Jose,\u201d said another, a reference to the third hurricane that was building on the heels of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Mrs. Schluter, who turned 93 in November, said in a recent phone interview that she thought The Times article was \u201creal nice,\u201d but she was surprised by the scale of the response. She said Mr. Schluter, 104, was too.\u201cHe says, \u2018Well, how could that happen?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Schluter said.Readers on social media gravitate to this type of story, though, and this one had all the right elements: It traced a union that has endured for over seven decades, and it offered an uplifting message during a summer dominated by disaster. It also probably didn\u2019t hurt that the Schluters proved to be exceptionally altruistic people, who had fostered more than 120 foster children over the years.Mr. Bromwich\u2019s hypothesis: \u201cPeople were hungry for something other than tales of woe.\u201d\u201cIt was not an article that people read and kind of reflected on too much,\u201d Mr. Bromwich said. \u201cIt was an article that made people smile, made them feel good, and then they went about their day basically, and I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Buyers Be Told About the Killer Next Door?", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI live in a one-family house adjacent to the house of a family whose son was a serial killer 25 years ago. He was 20 at the time and killed two people. He was recently released and now lives there. My son will inherit our house after us and plans to live elsewhere closer to work. A house is for living in, and you might conclude that things that don\u2019t affect its use for that purpose are up to you to divulge or not. Yet a house is also an investment, and buyers reasonably want to know about circumstances that could affect its resale value. The simple fact that a buyer would want to know something, though, doesn\u2019t require you to tell them.Some buyers might be deterred by the fact that a previous occupant had AIDS, that the house is believed to be haunted, that there\u2019s a senior-living facility in the neighborhood, that there\u2019s a mosque at the corner or that a mentally disabled person lives across the street. Depending on your pool of prospective buyers, these things could affect the home\u2019s resale value. So you might think that these facts should be disclosed as latent defects, akin to poorly insulated pipes that freeze in the winter. Yet by doing so, you\u2019d be acquiescing to prejudice and superstition.I\u2019m not talking about the law here, but it\u2019s notable that a number of states don\u2019t require you to disclose the presence of sex offenders in your neighborhood or the fact that your home was once a murder site. Owing to fair-housing laws, there\u2019s a general prohibition on discussing the ethnic or religious composition of a neighborhood. (The disclosure of some of the other circumstances I listed earlier could be prohibited, too.) Legislators, guided by moral concerns, have decided that transparency isn\u2019t the only value to be considered.In this welter of things that you must disclose, may disclose and must not disclose, where should we situate your neighbor\u2019s troubled past? Obviously, most buyers would want to know about it. But there are reasons for doubting that they have a right to be told. One is that the legal system has judged the murderer next door to have paid his debt. We need to rehabilitate offenders, even murderers. That is one aim of a decent system of criminal justice.Calling him a serial killer suggests that you think he\u2019s mentally ill in a way that poses a continuing threat to others. But if that were so, the courts should have committed him until psychiatrists were convinced he posed no danger. Putting aside the movie stereotype of the serial killer, what you really know is that this is someone who killed two people. A sane person who has just spent a quarter of a century in a prison cell for murder would know that he\u2019d be the first suspect if anything happened near his home. Reoffense rates for people like your neighbor are hard to come by, but in her 2012 book \u201cLife After Murder,\u201d the journalist Nancy Mullane identified a thousand convicted murderers who were paroled in California over the previous two decades; not one was rearrested for murder.The likelihood is that buyers would react irrationally to the information about your neighbor. That is emphatically true if you were to call him a serial killer, which evokes an image of someone meticulously planning the murders of innocent strangers. If a buyer asks a question, you ought not to lie. But you can certainly say, for example, that you don\u2019t want to spread gossip about the neighbors. Only if you have reason to think that the fellow next door poses a significant threat do you need to talk about his history.I am Facebook friends with a well-known practitioner in my field. I\u2019ve never met him, but he posts interesting things and blogs about various developments in our field. I sometimes comment on his blog.One morning I saw a bunch of posts in my Facebook feed featuring pictures and such from a somewhat flamboyant blond woman with the same last name as this fellow. Having never seen her before, I assumed she was his spouse, and I\u2019d somehow accepted her friend request. There were a lot of posts that I was not interested in (fashion, glamour), so I quickly unfriended her. I continued to scroll down and saw her first post \u2014 she had just come out as trans. She was formerly he, the practitioner I knew and followed. My husband and I have our medical insurance through a Medicare Advantage insurance plan. In addition to paying monthly premiums and having Medicare payments deducted from our monthly Social Security benefits, we paid, in 2016, more than $6,000 for prescriptions, doctors\u2019 visits and other medical expenses that were not covered by our insurance.As a perk, our plan offers gift cards when a member participates in certain \u201cbest practices\u201d such as having an annual flu shot, an annual physical or a mammogram. When I recently called to request a $50 gift card (you can select gift cards to several restaurants or shopping sites such as Amazon or Target) after having my annual physical, my husband became extremely angry and told me to cancel my request. He insisted that by requesting these gift cards I was participating in the high cost of medical insurance. I told him he was being ridiculous and refused to do so. (The gift card for a flu shot is $10.)Of course, if you wanted to avoid the complexities, you could adopt a policy of not accepting any gifts at all. That way you could truthfully say, \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but I have a policy of not accepting gifts from patients.\u201d A response like that might still be regarded as disrespectful by people in some communities, with contrary customs, but that\u2019s much less likely if you report your refusal as one of your own customs.Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

{"Headline": "Facebook Job Ads Raise Concerns About Age Discrimination", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was written through collaboration between The New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization.A few weeks ago, Verizon placed an ad on Facebook to recruit applicants for a unit focused on financial planning and analysis. The ad showed a smiling, millennial-aged woman seated at a computer and promised that new hires could look forward to a rewarding career in which they would be \u201cmore than just a number.\u201dSome relevant numbers were not immediately evident. The promotion was set to run on the Facebook feeds of users 25 to 36 years old who lived in the nation\u2019s capital, or had recently visited there, and had demonstrated an interest in finance. For a vast majority of the hundreds of millions of people who check Facebook every day, the ad did not exist.Verizon is among dozens of the nation\u2019s leading employers \u2014 including Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Target and Facebook itself \u2014 that placed recruitment ads limited to particular age groups, an investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times has found.The ability of advertisers to deliver their message to the precise audience most likely to respond is the cornerstone of Facebook\u2019s business model. But using the system to expose job opportunities only to certain age groups has raised concerns about fairness to older workers.Several experts questioned whether the practice is in keeping with the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which prohibits bias against people 40 or older in hiring or employment. Many jurisdictions make it unlawful to \u201caid\u201d or \u201cabet\u201d age discrimination, a provision that could apply to companies like Facebook that distribute job ads.\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly unlawful,\u201d said Debra Katz, a Washington employment lawyer who represents victims of discrimination.The revelations come at a time when the unregulated power of the tech companies is under increased scrutiny, and Congress is weighing whether to limit the immunity that it granted to tech companies in 1996 for third-party content on their platforms.Facebook has argued in court filings that the law, the Communications Decency Act, makes it immune from liability for discriminatory ads.The precision of Facebook\u2019s ad delivery has helped it dominate an industry once in the hands of print and broadcast outlets. The system, called microtargeting, allows advertisers to reach essentially whomever they prefer, including the people their analysis suggests are the most plausible hires or consumers, lowering the costs and vastly increasing efficiency.Other tech companies also offer employers opportunities to discriminate by age. ProPublica bought job ads on Google and LinkedIn that excluded audiences older than 40 \u2014 and the ads were instantly approved. Google said it does not prevent advertisers from displaying ads based on the user\u2019s age. After being contacted by ProPublica, LinkedIn changed its system to prevent such targeting in employment ads.The database of Facebook ads collected by ProPublica shows how often and precisely employers recruit by age. In a search for \u201cpart-time package handlers,\u201d United Parcel Service ran an ad aimed at people 18 to 24. State Farm pitched its hiring promotion to those 19 to 35.Some companies, including Target, State Farm and UPS, defended their targeting as a part of a broader recruitment strategy that reached candidates of all ages. The group of companies making this case included Facebook itself, which ran career ads on its own platform, many aimed at people 25 to 60. \u201cWe completely reject the allegation that these advertisements are discriminatory,\u201d said Mr. Goldman of Facebook.After being contacted by ProPublica and The Times, other employers, including Amazon, Northwestern Mutual and the New York City Department of Education, said they had changed or were changing their recruiting strategies.\u201cWe recently audited our recruiting ads on Facebook and discovered some had targeting that was inconsistent with our approach of searching for any candidate over the age of 18,\u201d said Nina Lindsey, a spokeswoman for Amazon, which targeted some ads for workers at its distribution centers between the ages of 18 and 50. \u201cWe have corrected those ads.\u201dVerizon did not respond to requests for comment.Several companies argued that targeted recruiting on Facebook was comparable to advertising opportunities in publications like the AARP magazine or Teen Vogue, which are aimed at particular age groups. But this obscures an important distinction. Anyone can buy Teen Vogue and see an ad. Online, however, people outside the targeted age groups can be excluded in ways they will never learn about.\u201cWhat happens with Facebook is you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said David Lopez, a former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is one of the lawyers at the firm Outten & Golden bringing the age-discrimination case on behalf of the communication workers union.Age discrimination on digital platforms is something that many workers suspect is happening to them, but that is often difficult to prove.Mark Edelstein, a fitfully employed social-media marketing strategist who is 58 and legally blind, doesn\u2019t pretend to know what he doesn\u2019t know, but he has his suspicions.Mr. Edelstein, who lives in St. Louis, says he never had serious trouble finding a job until he turned 50. \u201cOnce you reach your 50s, you may as well be dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into interviews, with my head of gray hair and my receding hairline, and they know I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cHypothetically, had I seen a job for a social media director at HubSpot, even if it involved relocation, I ABSOLUTELY would have applied for it,\u201d Mr. Edelstein said by email when told about the ad.A HubSpot spokeswoman, Ellie Botelho, said that the job was posted on many sites, including LinkedIn, The Ladders and Built in Boston, and was open to anyone meeting the qualifications regardless of age or any other demographic characteristic.She added that \u201cthe use of the targeted age-range selection on the Facebook ad was frankly a mistake on our part given our lack of experience using that platform for job postings and not a feature we will use again.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Edelstein says he understands why marketers wouldn\u2019t want to target ads at him: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me a bit. Why would they want a 58-year-old white guy who\u2019s disabled?\u201dOne reason is that Facebook\u2019s sheer size \u2014 two billion monthly active users, versus LinkedIn\u2019s 530 million total members \u2014 gives recruiters access to types of workers they can\u2019t find elsewhere.Consider nurses, whom hospitals are desperate to hire. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to use LinkedIn,\u201d said Josh Rock, a recruiter at a large hospital system in Minnesota who has expertise in digital media. \u201cNurses are predominantly female, there\u2019s a larger volume of Facebook users. That\u2019s what they use.\u201dThere are also millions of hourly workers who have never visited LinkedIn, and may not even have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but who check Facebook obsessively.Deb Andrychuk, chief executive of the Arland Group, which helps employers place recruitment ads, said clients sometimes asked her firm to target ads by age, saying they needed \u201cto start bringing younger blood\u201d into their organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that we wouldn\u2019t take someone older,\u201d these clients say, according to Ms. Andrychuk, \u201cbut if you could bring in a younger set of applicants, it would definitely work out better.\u201dMs. Andrychuk said that \u201cwe coach clients to be open and not discriminate\u201d and that after being contacted by The Times, her team updated all their ads to ensure they didn\u2019t exclude any age groups.But some companies contend that there are permissible reasons to filter audiences by age, as with an ad for entry-level analyst positions at Goldman Sachs that was distributed to people 18 to 64. A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Andrew Williams, said showing it to people above that age range would have wasted money: roughly 25 percent of those who typically click on the firm\u2019s untargeted ads are 65 or older, but people that age almost never apply for the analyst job.\u201cWe welcome and actively recruit applicants of all ages,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cFor some of our social-media ads, we look to get the content to the people most likely to be interested, but do not exclude anyone from our recruiting activity.\u201dPauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, unlike the federal anti-discrimination statute that covers race and gender, allows an employer to take into account \u201creasonable factors\u201d that may be highly correlated with the protected characteristic, such as cost, as long as they don\u2019t rely on the characteristic explicitly.In various ways, Facebook and LinkedIn have acknowledged at least a modest obligation to police their ad platforms against abuse.Earlier this year, Facebook said it would require advertisers to \u201cself-certify\u201d that their housing, employment and credit ads were compliant with anti-discrimination laws, but that it would not block marketers from purchasing age-restricted ads.Still, Facebook didn\u2019t promise to monitor those certifications for accuracy. And Facebook said the self-certification system, announced in February, was still being rolled out to all advertisers.LinkedIn, in response to inquiries by ProPublica, added a self-certification step that prevents employers from using age ranges when placing an employment ad, unless they affirm that the ad is not discriminatory.With these efforts evolving, legal experts say it is unclear how much liability the tech platforms could have. Some civil rights laws, like the Fair Housing Act, explicitly require publishers to assume liability for discriminatory ads.But the Age Discrimination in Employment Act assigns liability only to employers or employment agencies, like recruiters and advertising firms.The lawsuit filed against Facebook on behalf of the communications workers argues that the company essentially plays the role of an employment agency \u2014 collecting and providing data that helps employers locate candidates, effectively coordinating with the employer to develop the advertising strategies, informing employers about the performance of the ads, and so forth.Regardless of whether courts accept that argument, the tech companies could also face liability under certain state or local anti-discrimination statutes. For example, California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act makes it unlawful to \u201caid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing\u201d of discriminatory acts proscribed by the statute.\u201cThey may have an obligation there not to aid and abet an ad that enables discrimination,\u201d said Cliff Palefsky, an employment lawyer based in San Francisco.The question may hinge on Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability for third-party content.Eric Goldman, professor and co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law, who has written extensively about Section 230, says it is hard to predict how courts would treat Facebook\u2019s age-targeting of employment ads.Mr. Goldman said the law covered the content of ads, and that courts have made clear that Facebook would not be liable for an advertisement in which an employer wrote, say, \u201cno one over 55 need apply.\u201d But it is not clear how the courts would treat Facebook\u2019s offering of age-targeted customization.\u201cDepending on how the targeting is happening, you can make potentially different sorts of arguments about whether or not Google or Facebook or LinkedIn is contributing to the development\u201d of the ad, said Deirdre K. Mulligan, a faculty director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology.Julia Angwin and Ariana Tobin are reporters at ProPublica.

{"Headline": "The Return of the Techno-Moral Panic", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe story was a sensation, inspiring a \u201cNightline\u201d feature and drawing the attention of politicians. The full text of the Time article was entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Chuck Grassley, who urged his colleagues to act \u201cto help parents who are under assault in this day and age.\u201d With strong bipartisan support, Congress soon passed the Communications Decency Act, as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which broadly criminalized the transmission of \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d materials to underage internet users. (A Supreme Court ruling in 1997 essentially defanged it.)As moral panics about danger and depravity lost traction, popular tech criticism became nebulous and fretful, concerned with vague themes and forecasts. (\u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d \u201cTinder and the Dawn of the \u2018Dating Apocalypse.\u2019\u2009\u201d) In the absence of coherent critiques, and in the context of a stunningly rapid adoption of smartphones, a righteously defensive posturing about the social consequences of tech went mainstream. Critics were easily dismissed as Luddites, unable to see the future through a misplaced nostalgia for the past. This assumption was frequently vindicated and started to feel a lot like wisdom. As the world truly moved online, abstract fears were repeatedly met with, and answered by, specific, irresistible and unthreatening products and experiences. We had learned our lesson.Our present panics tend to arrive just as new parts of our economy, culture and politics are reconstituted within platform marketplaces \u2014 shifts that have turned out to be bigger than anyone anticipated. Aggravation about \u201cfake news\u201d followed the realization that the business and consumption of online news had been substantially captured by Facebook, which had strenuously resisted categorization as a media company. Children\u2019s entertainment has migrated to new and unexpected venues faster and more completely than either parents or YouTube expected or accounted for. Twitter is now the most effective way to keep up with breaking news, a singular direct line to the president, and a conspicuously mismanaged experiment in centralized public discourse.In this way, these new moral panics do have something in common with Luddism, though not as it is now popularly and mistakenly understood. The original Luddites\u2019 complaint was with the way industrialists were using new textile manufacturing technologies to circumvent labor conventions and to thin their ranks as quickly as possible, not with the technologies themselves. They didn\u2019t so much propose solutions as much as they registered a loud and visceral complaint, smashing machines until they were put down by gunfire. Luddites have been reduced in the popular imagination to misguided fools obstructing the arrival of technologies that we now understand as both primitive and vital to the advance of civilization. Their message was inchoate but fueled by firsthand experience of material change rather than speculative, moralistic doomsaying or elite hand-wringing about what we might have lost.As the internet of 2017 has changed, so has the internet user. We are now in the majority, and our experience is defined by plenitude and freedom, still, but also by a growing sense of exploitation. We find ourselves aware of the power and unaccountability of the new marketplaces in which we socialize, communicate and do business. To cast our recurring panics as technophobic reruns is to misidentify what animates them most: Not fear, but helplessness.It would be a mistake to give credence to every noisy critique of a platform, and some of the inevitable panics about Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 not to mention Amazon \u2014 will be bolstered by sheer reactionary traditionalism. But in more cases, these panics will reveal themselves as concrete complaints, addressed to people and companies whose responsibility for the networks that connect us \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 will finally start to catch up with their power.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Francine Prose\u2019s Oaxaca: An Immersion Course in Mexico\u2019s Delights", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerI can\u2019t think of a better way to counter the \u201calternative facts\u201d we have been hearing in the political discourse about Mexico and Mexicans than to go there and see for ourselves, to experience firsthand the country\u2019s physical beauty, its rich traditions, the hospitality and kindness of its people. And I can\u2019t think of a better place to start than Oaxaca, an easy trip of less than an hour, by air, from Mexico City. At least partly because of its pleasant climate, temperate all year round, Oaxaca has become an appealing tourist destination.Oaxaca was the first place in Mexico to which I traveled with my family, 30 years ago, and the place to which I returned most recently, with husband, our grown son, our Mexican daughter-in-law and three grandchildren in tow \u2014 a city that seems remarkably unchanged, despite the fact that its area and population have grown, over the decades.Even at the busiest times, the mood \u2014 in this city of under 300,000 people \u2014 is relaxed, the traffic manageable, and one never feels mobbed by hordes of sightseers and shoppers. Though there are periodic eruptions of political tension \u2014 several buildings, including the law school, still bear the scars of a teachers\u2019 strike in 2016, and seven months of unrest accompanied an earlier strike in 2006 \u2014 Oaxaca continues to feel friendly, safe and welcoming. The recent earthquakes that so damaged Mexico City and its environs (including Oaxaca State) shook buildings in Oaxaca City, but failed to do serious damage, and the city continues to welcome tourists, on whom a significant portion of its economy depends.Though the exact date of its initial construction is uncertain, we know that Mitla thrived from the 8th century until the Spanish conquest, in the early 16th century. Yet what\u2019s most striking about Mitla is not so much its age as its beauty. Decorating its walls, its pillars, lintels and archways are fragments of brightly painted frescoes, as well as remarkably well-preserved and stunningly elaborate geometric designs made of mosaics of small stones set into the stucco around them \u2014 an architectural feature unique in all of Mesoamerica, the area encompassing much of Mexico and Central America. Even the grandchildren were excited by Mitla, by the sensation of being able to move from one enclosed space to another, almost like going from outdoor room to outdoor room in a magnificent ruined house.But arguably the most beautiful (and certainly my favorite) is the Templo de Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, which was built by the Dominican friars in the 16th and 17th centuries. The ornately gilded interior of the church features a ceiling decorated with bright polychrome figures, including a lively representation of Santo Domingo\u2019s family tree that evokes pre-Columbian images of the Tree of Life. The bas reliefs on the western facade were done by local sculptors, descendants of the artisans responsible for the carving at Mitla, and in one chapel is the statue of a saint dressed in an indigenous costume.There\u2019s a lot to see in Oaxaca, but it\u2019s a place that can also be enjoyed by those with only a limited interest in archaeology, history, architecture and art. Above all, Oaxaca is a wonderful place to be, to stroll, to shop, to spend time in the food, flower and handicrafts markets, and \u2014 not insignificantly \u2014 to eat. And it\u2019s a great walking town. Around nearly every corner in the historical center, you may come upon a bright blue, yellow or orange wall, stenciled with the inventive advertising posters for which Oaxaca is known.I bought several woven tote bags decorated with Mexican folk motifs \u2014 perfect for carrying books, papers and (small amounts of) groceries. I also found a mask made from straw that, as the vendor helpfully showed us, could be rolled into a sort of tubelike parcel and easily stowed in a suitcase without damage. At one end of the market, farthest from the z\u00f3calo, is the section where \u2014 as in all the greatest Mexican markets \u2014 one can eat at counters and small stalls. Here, the adventurous can sample tropical fruit juices and an enormous range of delicious foods.In the market, one can browse the glittering displays of mezcal bottles, many with gorgeous labels advertising their origin in small local distilleries. Agave, from which mezcal is made, is grown throughout the Oaxaca Valley and is one of its most important crops. Driving along the well-marked roads surrounding Oaxaca, one passes agave farms, lined with attractive orderly rows of plants that resemble a cross between an aloe and a pineapple top. Travelers with an interest in sampling the local product (served straight up or in elaborate cocktails) can do so at one of the many stylish mezcal bars that have sprung up throughout the centro.Several smaller and more low-key markets selling crafts \u2014 beaded purses, embroidered shirts, woven belts, filigree earrings, as well as the painted, whimsical wooden animals made in the nearby village of Arrazola \u2014 are near the Templo de Santo Domingo, on the other side of the z\u00f3calo and a 20-minute walk from the 20th of November market. And throughout the centro are dozens of small, inviting boutiques featuring clothes, accessories and household goods that combine traditional craft with high design.If one ventures further afield, it\u2019s possible to visit nearby villages known for their particular specialties. San Bartolo de Coyotepec is celebrated for its unique black glazed pottery. In the village of Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle, nearly every household appears to be involved in weaving gorgeous woolen rugs, and it can be visited on the way to Mitla.Oaxaca is justly famous for its mole, a piquant sauce with a complex blend of spices and flavors including (in one of its more familiar iterations) chocolate. In fact there are many variations on the theme of mole that one can try around Oaxaca, where large numbers of talented chefs, inspired by the region\u2019s culinary heritage, have dedicated themselves to reinventing traditional dishes, and to preparing elegant yet unpretentious food served in surroundings ranging from funky and cool to luxurious, stylish and ultramodern.But by far my favorite souvenir, which I bought in the central market, was a generous amount of the Mexican chocolate for which Oaxaca is famous. Cups of the steaming hot chocolate are among the most reliable ways I know to keep my spirits up during a cold winter and in this unsettling political climate.Sipping the chocolate, I think about Oaxaca and feel ever so slightly warmer as I imagine walking its cobbled streets, past its painted houses, its shaded plazas and Baroque churches. And I watch the video which we took on New Year\u2019s Eve in the courtyard of the Templo de Santo Domingo. Behind those bright swirls of light inscribed on the dusky twilight are two granddaughters with twirling sparklers, celebrating the joy of being in this magical place, with their family, on a perfect holiday evening.There are several direct flights daily from Mexico City to Oaxaca, an hourlong trip.Los DanzantesCalle Macedonia Alcala 403; Phone 52 951 501 1187; losdanzantes.comCatedralCalle Manuel Garcia Vigil 105; Phone 52 951 516 3285; restaurantecatedral.com.mxItanon\u00edAv Belisario Dominguez 513; Phone 52 951 513 9223; email (via Facebook)Francine Prose\u2019s latest novel is \u201cMister Monkey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "San Francisco\u2019s Skyline, Now Inescapably Transformed by Tech", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi, will be inhabited in January, signaling tech\u2019s triumph in the city.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The skyscraper came late to this city, a shipping and manufacturing hub for much of its existence. The wealthy roosted on the hills and the masses toiled on the flats and the docks. Everyone lived close to the ground in a setting renowned for its natural beauty.Now the things being shipped are virtual, and vast amounts of office space are needed to design, build and market them. Salesforce, a company that did not exist 20 years ago, will take up residence on Jan. 8 in the new Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi.Skyscrapers tell a different story. They are the pyramids of our civilization, permanent monuments of our existence. They show who is in charge and what they think about themselves. Salesforce Tower is breaking a San Francisco height record that stood for nearly half a century.\u201cA ceiling has been breached,\u201d said Alison Isenberg, a professor of urban history at Princeton University. \u201cNow the discussion becomes is this just a building that is taller than the ones we already had, or does it raise new questions about the nature of the city?\u201dSalesforce Tower is visible from just about everywhere. Go to the farthest edges of the city and its 61 stories of tapered steel and glass stick up like a forceful thumb. On the drive north from the airport, the tower is the one building discernible over Potrero Hill. From the distant North Bay, it is the first thing you notice as San Francisco sheds its customary morning fog. The building catches the morning sun, dazzling the way none of its lesser neighbors do.The tower is not beautiful but is impossible to ignore. The top floors are set off from the rest, and the crown is flat rather than a spire. It looks as if a rocket were stowed up there, an escape vehicle for the tech overlords when the city is consumed by disaster.\u201cSan Francisco has gone from being driven by multitudes of industries in 2007 to being now focused largely on tech,\u201d said Colin Yasukochi, a CBRE analyst. \u201cThe growth feeds on itself. Tech workers are attracted to the great opportunities in the city, and the supply of workers means more tech companies come here.\u201dSan Francisco has always been like this. There were so few skyscrapers in the city\u2019s first century that the ones that were built tell a tale of rampant egos and unrestrained power. At the end of the 19th century, the city\u2019s newspapers had hubris and wealth to rival today\u2019s internet companies. In 1890, the owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, M. H. de Young, erected a 10-story building worthy of his publication. It was the tallest building on the West Coast.That irked the new owners of the Call newspaper, the Spreckels family, who in 1895 commissioned a tower of their own mere feet from the Chronicle building. It would be more than half again as tall \u2014 18 stories \u2014 and would be, they promised, \u201cthe finest building ever erected for a newspaper office.\u201d It had a 60-foot terra cotta Baroque dome, four corner cupolas and spectacular flourishes.That was just the beginning. Today\u2019s inhabitants of Silicon Valley are no slouches at self-promotion, but even they could learn something from The Call, which published a report calling its new headquarters \u201cthe crowning achievement of mankind in the Western world.\u201dSalesforce, co-founded and run by Marc Benioff, is wisely saying no such thing. It makes software that lets companies handle their relationships with customers better, and so passes unnoticed by the general public. Next year, it will most likely surpass Wells Fargo as the largest private employer in the city.San Francisco has always had conflicting feelings about growth and wealth. It was a gold rush boomtown but in the 1960s was home to the Diggers, a hippie offshoot that dreamed of a society without money. That notion lingered in a thousand communes.\u201cThe mid-1960s and early 1970s in San Francisco simultaneously saw a downtown building boom and by far the nation\u2019s strongest anti-skyscraper movement,\u201d said Ms. Isenberg, author of \u201cDesigning San Francisco: Art, Land and Urban Renewal in the City by the Bay.\u201d \u201cThey went hand in hand.\u201dThe leader of the opposition was Alvin Duskin, a dress manufacturer \u2014 he is said to be the first to use the peace sign in fashion \u2014 and local agitator. \u201cStop them from burying our city under a skyline of tombstones,\u201d one ad urged, while another proclaimed: \u201cNew studies have shown that the more we build high-rise, the more expensive it becomes to live here.\u201dThe protests had an effect. The Transamerica Pyramid was shaved down from 1,040 feet to 853 feet. A proposition in 1971 to limit buildings to six stories did not pass, but it was one of those defeats that is also a bit of a victory.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The Winklevoss Twins\u2019 unorthodox path to fame and Bitcoin fortune\u2022 There is a paucity of women in corporate America\u2019s c-suites.\u2022 Not every analyst is in love with Apple\u2019s stock price.\u2022 A four-year-old Bitcoin investment fund has posted a 25,004 percent lifetime return.\u2022 Apollo\u2019s low-priced deal to buy Qdoba.Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made a risky bet five years ago: They took $65-million settlement with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and loaded up on Bitcoin.That wager has paid off. Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday. The question now is whether their bitcoin fortune will prove fleeting.\u2022 They took their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in Facebook shares. The value of their stake grew to $300 million when Facebook went public in 2012.\u2022 They began buying Bitcoin in late 2012 when the price of an individual coin was below $10.\u2022 They have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum.\u2022 The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make them each of them billionaires.And that\u2019s getting worse. Women hold only 23 percent of senior executive posts with a title that includes the word chief, down from 24 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by Korn Ferry of the top 1,000 American companies by revenue.Here is Breakingviews\u2019s take:A detailed breakdown presents an even bleaker picture. Women make up just 6 percent of the blue-chip group\u2019s chief executive officers, and 11 percent of its chief financial officers. Parity comes, perhaps predictably, in that most social of C-level jobs, chief human resource officers, where females hold 55 percent of positions.The overall decline is even more glaring in the wake of the #metoo movement afflicting media, technology, entertainment and political circles. More women in the higher echelons of the corporate ranks could help change a culture that turns a blind eye to, if not condones, bad behavior.The financial industry might be a test case. The sector outranked all others in the analysis with nearly 30 percent of C-suite jobs held by women. That\u2019s a better track record than more female-friendly industries like retail and consumer at 24 percent, yet even in finance women are largely kept out of the most senior roles. Only 5 percent of the industry\u2019s CEOs and 8 percent of its CFOs are female, among the lowest levels in the survey.What catalyst will propel Apple\u2019s market value above $1 trillion? The Republican tax cuts? The iPhone X? Growth in Apple\u2019s services business?While that question has been a favorite question of market watchers for years, it has become more relevant recently as Apple\u2019s market capitalization has crossed the $900 billion mark.But Nomura Instinet\u2019s Jeffrey Kvaal on Tuesday threw some cold water on those bets. In a report, the analyst lowered his rating on Apple\u2019s stock to neutral. Mr. Kvaal wrote:\u201cWe argue that the stock\u2019s gains for the iPhone X supercycle are in the late innings. We believe unit growth, if not quite [Average Selling Price] growth, is well anticipated by consensus and a historically full multiple.\u201dApple\u2019s stock has gained 55 percent this year and is up nearly 10 percent since it unveiled the iPhone X.\u201cBefore today, two cuts to neutral or the equivalent in June were the last ones, according to data collected by Bloomberg. One of those firms has since upgraded the shares. Analysts are still overwhelmingly positive on the stock, which has been the largest contributor to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s gains this year, with 36 firms rating it a buy, eight advising hold and 0 sell recommendations.\u201d\u2014 Stephen Grocer\u201cWhile Tuesday\u2019s findings won\u2019t lead to fines, they pave the way for Germany to order changes in the way Facebook does business when it issues a final decision as early as summer 2018. If upheld in European Union court, this new line of attack could eventually expand the boundaries of competition law across the bloc to encompass questions of online privacy.\u201cGermany\u2019s case turns privacy into a competition issue by arguing that Facebook is the only major social network in Germany, with more than 90% market share, leaving users no choice but to accept its take-it-or-leave-it terms of service\u2014which include consent for the collection of third-party data.\u201dThe investigation is the most recent example of European authorities going after big American tech companies. Here are a few:So far European regulators have been more aggressive than the counterparts in the United States. But the increasing size and power of these tech giants are raising concerns. Facebook, Google, and Twitter have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers this year over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives.At a hearing on Russia\u2019s involvement in the election this fall, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California told the executives of the three companies: \u201cYou have to be the ones to do something about this.

{"Headline": "Honduran President Declared Winner, but O.A.S. Calls for New Election", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The Honduran electoral commission on Sunday declared President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez the victor in a bitterly contested race, but the Organization of American States called for a new election, arguing that the vote was so riddled with irregularities that it was impossible to be sure of a winner.The electoral commission, which is controlled by allies of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, said he had won by about 50,000 votes over the opposition candidate, Salvador Nasralla.The announcement, and the response from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the O.A.S., seemed likely to escalate the political crisis that has gripped Honduras since the Nov. 26 vote.David Matamoros, the electoral commission president and a member of the Honduran president\u2019s National Party, declared a winner despite an earlier call from Mr. Almagro to hold back.In a statement issued late Sunday, Mr. Almagro said, \u201cFacing the impossibility of determining a winner, the only way possible so that the people of Honduras are the victors is a new call for general elections.\u201d The O.A.S. election observer team had just presented a report that concluded the election process was of \u201cpoor quality.\u201dThe electoral commission\u2019s declaration came as Mr. Nasralla was on his way to Washington to meet with Mr. Almagro and the State Department.In a video posted on his Facebook page from the airport in Miami, Mr. Nasralla said, \u201cThe fight continues and will continue.\u201d He said the result announced by the commission \u201chas no validity simply because the Organization of American States, of which Honduras is a member, does not endorse the results.\u201dIn a sign that Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez was prepared to challenge the O.A.S. directly, the president\u2019s top adviser, Ebal Diaz, accused Mr. Almagro of violating the observation mission\u2019s protocols and of \u201cgenerating more violence.\u201d\u201cYou have been irresponsible, allowing a member of your team to scheme with\u201d Mr. Nasralla \u201cto try and steal the election,\u201d wrote Mr. Diaz, the executive secretary of the president\u2019s council of ministers.On Friday, a national strike led to clashes between protesters and the military police at roadblocks around the country. At least 22 people have been killed since the disputed vote, according to the Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras, a human rights group.Preliminary results on election night suggested that Mr. Nasralla had a strong lead, but the count was then stopped for more than a day. When the counting resumed, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez was reported to have begun closing the gap as new results were registered. Eventually, the electoral commission\u2019s tally gave him a small lead.Election observers from the O.A.S. said on Dec. 6 that the \u201cirregularities, mistakes and systemic problems plaguing this election make it difficult\u201d to be \u201ccertain about the outcome.\u201dThe organization backed a call for a partial recount, and the electoral commission went ahead with the tally. The alliance of leftist parties backing Mr. Nasralla, as well as a third party, the Liberal Party, handed over their copies of the tally sheets from polling places to the O.A.S. and asked for the results to be nullified.On Sunday, Mr. Matamoros, the electoral commission president, said in a brief televised statement that the agency had complied with all the O.A.S. recommendations.But in their final report, the O.A.S. election observers cataloged a series of anomalies and sloppy practices, concluding that the doubts over the election\u2019s integrity had not been dispelled. Among their concerns was the crash of a computer server three days into the counting that left the results vulnerable to tampering, opened ballot boxes, and an inexplicable change in voting patterns as the count went on.\u201cThe differences are too large to be generated by chance and are not easily explicable, raising doubts as to the veracity of the overall result,\u201d Mr. Nooruddin wrote.However, the O.A.S. report did not find any important difference in a sample of the tally sheets handed over by the parties, whose representatives receive them directly at polling places on election night, and those published by the electoral tribunal.Election observers from the European Union also said Sunday that the opposition had failed to show a significant difference between their parties\u2019 copies of the tally sheets and those that were counted by the electoral tribunal. But the group said the tribunal and the Honduran Supreme Court should consider any additional appeals.The election result creates a dilemma for the Trump administration, which has pressed in public for a transparent vote count but said nothing about irregularities.Two days after the election, the State Department certified that the Honduran government was making progress on improving human rights and tackling widespread corruption \u2014 a sign of support for Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez.The Honduran president has proved to be a strong ally on the issues that matter most to the United States, like interdicting drugs and dissuading migrants from making the long trip to the Texas border.But that alliance could prove uncomfortable if Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez rejects the O.A.S. call and begins his second term in January with his legitimacy under a cloud. Although Congress has supported aid to Honduras, legislators have already raised concern over the disputed vote count.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, who has held up delivery of some aid to the Honduran government over concerns about human rights, said Sunday that the election result \u201cleaves too many questions unanswered.\u201cThere were multiple opportunities for fraud in this election, and only a determination by impartial international observers that the vote tally was fair and transparent will provide the necessary credibility to the process,\u201d he said in an emailed statement.Mr. Leahy also called on the government to stop shooting at protesters. \u201cThere is no justification for the tragic loss of life that has occurred,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Nasralla\u2019s alliance has called for protests on Monday. The Liberal party has scheduled protests for Tuesday.An earlier version of this article gave the wrong date for the Honduran election. It was held Nov. 26, not Nov. 27.Jeff Ernst contributed reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Intelligent\u2019 Policing and My Innocent Children", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Last month I spoke at a gathering of African-American technology professionals. I\u2019m a transactional lawyer at a tech company and my husband is an engineer, so the industry is at the center of our lives. We have careers that allow us to help create products and tools our grandparents would never have thought were possible and to provide the kind of life for our family that they couldn\u2019t have imagined. And it\u2019s important to us to ensure that other people of color have a chance to contribute to the field and reap its benefits. With all those things on my mind, I left the conference energized and inspired by the ways in which tech is changing the world and the possibilities it holds for our community.At the same time, I\u2019m terrified for what these advances mean for my two young children. The same technology that\u2019s the source of so much excitement in my career is being used in law enforcement in ways that could mean that in the coming years, my son, who is 7 now, is more likely to be profiled or arrested \u2014 or worse \u2014 for no reason other than his race and where we live.Of course I\u2019m not alone in feeling that technology is both a gift and a curse. This tension exists for anyone who enjoys the real-time conversations on Twitter but loathes the trolls, loves Facebook but abhors fake news, or depends on the convenience Alexa offers but frets about violations of privacy.Yet in my life, because of the way artificial intelligence and machine learning are being increasingly used by law enforcement \u2014 the technology is seemingly growing up alongside my kids \u2014 it\u2019s especially acute.Unjust racial profiling and resulting racial disparities in the criminal justice system certainly don\u2019t depend on artificial intelligence. But when you add it \u2014 as many law enforcement agencies across the country, including those in major cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York, have over the past couple of years \u2014 things get even scarier for black families.These downsides of A.I. are no secret. Despite this, state and local law enforcement agencies have begun to use predictive policing applications fueled by A.I. like HunchLab, which combines historical crime data, moon phases, location, census data and even professional sports team schedules to predict when and where crime will occur and even who\u2019s likely to commit or be a victim of certain crimes.The problem with historical crime data is that it\u2019s based upon policing practices that already disproportionately home in on blacks, Latinos, and those who live in low-income areas.It\u2019s no wonder criminologists have raised red flags about the self-fulfilling nature of using historical crime data.This hits close to home. An October 2016 study by the Human Rights Data Analysis Group concluded that if the Oakland Police Department used its 2010 record of drug-crimes information as the basis of an algorithm to guide policing, the department \u201cwould have dispatched officers almost exclusively to lower-income, minority neighborhoods,\u201d despite the fact that public-health-based estimates suggest that drug use is much more widespread, taking place in many other parts of the city where my family and I live.Those \u201clower-income, minority neighborhoods\u201d contain the barbershop where I take my son for his monthly haircut and our favorite hoagie shop. Would I let him run ahead of me if I knew that simply setting foot on those sidewalks would make him more likely to be seen as a criminal in the eyes of the law?The risks are even more acute (and unavoidable) for those who can afford to live only in the neighborhoods that A.I. would most likely lead officers to focus on.Without a commitment to ensure that the data being used to fuel A.I. doesn\u2019t replicate historical racism, biases will be built into the foundation of many \u201cintelligent\u201d systems shaping how we live. It\u2019s not that I want this technology to be rejected. There are ways to make A.I. work. But before it is used in law enforcement, it must be thoroughly tested and proven not to disproportionately harm communities of color.Until then my excitement about advances in tech will always be cautious. Innovation is at the core of the careers that allow me and my husband to provide a good life for our family. The same innovation, if not used properly, could take it all away.B\u00e4r\u00ed A.

{"Headline": "Is a Trivia App the Answer to Questions About Live Streaming?", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are heady times for the creators of HQ Trivia.The app, which broadcasts live shows to iPhones and iPads twice a day, has taken off since its debut in August. Its ability to attract tens of thousands of people to log in for each 15-minute segment in hopes of winning money by answering a dozen trivia questions has some wondering if it has reimagined the TV game show for the cord-cutting era.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of attention on us now because this thing has blown up overnight practically,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said in an interview. \u201cWe have ambitions to essentially build the future of TV, and, yeah \u2014 there is a lot of pressure to get everything right all the time, and I admit that I made a mistake.\u201dThe show, which can be glitchy, is typically hosted by an energetic comedian, Scott Rogowsky, who cracks jokes as he asks a dozen multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty. Players use their touch screens to respond in less than 10 seconds, and the app shows how many people are eliminated after each round. Players can also share their reactions via a rapid-fire chat function at the bottom of the screen.Early questions tend to be on the easier side, like: \u201cWhich president is featured on the U.S. one dollar bill?\u201d Those who answer all the questions correctly share in a prize that has fluctuated between hundreds and thousands of dollars and is distributed via PayPal.Mr. Kroll, a Twitch fan, said that much of what people knew as live video from apps like Twitter\u2019s Periscope lacked a sense of urgency and participation.\u201cThere\u2019s a point-of-view live, where you\u2019re experiencing something through someone else\u2019s phone, and then there\u2019s this idea of interactive video, where the audience is actually a key component of driving the content,\u201d he said. \u201cI became really interested in the latter and saw there was a real absence in the market of that sort of experience.\u201d\u201cWe schedule our lives, but the apps on our phones have been designed to make content available anytime, anywhere,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. \u201cWe suffer from the paradox of choice ultimately \u2014 you search Netflix for 20 minutes and end up watching nothing.\u201dMr. Kroll added that HQ\u2019s schedule was inspiring people to play with co-workers in the afternoon and again with family and friends in the evening, making it more akin to a broadcast TV program.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit trite to say, but things grow because they\u2019re fun,\u201d said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \u201cThis is way more fun than playing a quiz game on your phone and way more fun than watching \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 on TV.\u201dStill, whether HQ can turn its sudden popularity into a long-term business is an open question. Could it ultimately serve as a blueprint for bigger tech companies that have been looking for ways to drum up interest in live video content? Mr. Kroll and Mr. Yusupov were hesitant to share details around how they produce the show and what, if any, parts of HQ could be patented. They also declined to disclose the number of people they employ.\u201cI learned what I do know, and that\u2019s apps and engineers and designers, and I learned what I don\u2019t know, which is how to work with talent and celebrities,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. He added that the company had since hired a public relations representative and a person to manage talent.The men said that HQ had been approached by a bevy of ad agencies and chief marketing officers but that they were still determining how sponsorships could be worked into the app. Mr. Yusupov said brands could potentially fund the prizes, adding that a goal was offering a $1 million prize.Mr. Liew said he was confident in the start-up and its eventual business plan even as he expected other companies to mimic what HQ Trivia had done.\u201cYou have to let time talk and figure out how people are interacting and using something before you have clarity with a business model,\u201d he said. More important, he added, \u201cif you can become part of popular culture, you can figure out a way to make money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Islamic State Claims Deadly Blast at Afghan Shiite Center", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 At least 41 people were killed and dozens more wounded on Thursday in a bombing at a Shiite cultural center in Kabul that also houses a news agency, Afghan officials said. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.\u201cI have little doubt that this attack deliberately targeted civilians,\u201d said Toby Lanzer, the acting head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. \u201cToday in Kabul we have witnessed another truly despicable crime in a year already marked by unspeakable atrocities.\u201dIn the assault on Thursday, one suicide bomber entered the Tebyan cultural center during a group discussion for the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and then detonated his explosive vest, said Sadiq Muradi, Kabul\u2019s deputy police chief. Two improvised explosive devices placed nearby went off shortly after that, officials said.Wahidullah Majrooh, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry, said at least 41 people were killed and 84 wounded in the attack. Workers at the Istiqlal hospital appeared overwhelmed by the number of victims, some of them lying in the corridors. Many were being treated for severe burns. Family members arrived to claim the bodies of loved ones.The Shiite cultural center attacked on Thursday is believed to have leanings toward Iran; pictures of the country\u2019s supreme leader are often on display at its gatherings.The cultural center\u2019s website and Facebook page showed it hosting discussions and gatherings on religious and political issues, many of them critical of the West\u2019s approach to the Middle East. At a recent event, members stomped on Israeli flags and burned pictures of President Trump.Reza Khalili, a reporter for the Afghan Voice Agency, a news organization run by the center, said that the facility was a three-story building, with the news agency on the top floor, and the cultural center and a gathering hall in the basement.\u201cA suicide attacker entered the hall in the basement, where 150 to 200 people were gathered, and he blew himself up,\u201d Mr. Khalili said. \u201cMost of those killed were participants of the program.\u201dHamid Paiman Azimi, 28, another reporter at the agency, was in the agency\u2019s third-floor offices when the suicide blast went off.\u201cThose who were in the first and second floors all were killed or wounded, no one remained,\u201d said Mr. Azimi, whose father was killed in the mosque attack in October. \u201cI did not see much blood, all the victims were burned by the fire caused by the explosion.\u201dIn a statement on Thursday, the White House pledged to work with the government to bring the attackers to justice, saying \u201cthe enemies of Afghanistan will not succeed in their attempts to destroy the country and divide the Afghan people.\u201dAs Afghan and American officials were busy trying to tackle the affiliate in its stronghold in the east, urban attacks claimed by the group started increasing, particularly in Kabul. The city has long dealt with attacks from the Haqqani Network, a brutal arm of the Taliban, but officials have struggled to gain a clear picture of the Islamic State\u2019s urban cell \u2014 such as whether suicide bombers can be traced to Nangarhar, or whether there are overlaps between the networks that facilitate such attacks for the Islamic State and the Haqqanis.Borhan Osman, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group who has closely studied militant groups in Afghanistan, said the Islamic State had claimed seven suicide bombings in Kabul since October, more than the Taliban. And yet with the focus of military operations in Nangarhar, which largely relies on airstrikes, there is little understanding of the cell that carries out such urban attacks.\u201cAs far as I see, the leaders are veterans \u2014 they were with the Haqqani Network, the Taliban, or Al Qaeda, and defected to Islamic State in Khorasan, bringing their expertise and network,\u201d Mr. Osman said. \u201cBut most of those blowing themselves up are the young Salafis who are indoctrinated into jihadism and find in Islamic State a cool political ideology seeking to dominate the world.\u201dFahim Abed and Fatima Faizi reported from Kabul, and Mujib Mashal from Colombo, Sri Lanka.

{"Headline": "Drug Company Under Fire After Revealing Dengue Vaccine May Harm Some", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first promising vaccine for dengue \u2014 a disease that afflicts hundreds of millions of people around the world \u2014 is in jeopardy after the Philippines suspended it, amid widespread fears about its safety and growing public anger over its use in 830,000 schoolchildren.The Philippines government has begun investigations into the rollout of the immunization program by the French drugmaker Sanofi, which has come under fire for discounting early warnings that its vaccine could put some people at heightened risk of a severe form of the disease.The newly revealed evidence, confirmed recently by Sanofi\u2019s review of study data, found that in rare cases, Dengvaxia can backfire: If people who never had dengue are vaccinated and later become infected, the vaccine may provoke a much more severe form of the illness.The situation has become a public-relations debacle for the drugmaker, which spent decades developing Dengvaxia, the world\u2019s first dengue vaccine. Politicians in the Philippines are demanding information about Sanofi\u2019s advertising campaign and their government\u2019s aggressive push, against the advice of some experts, to vaccinate a million children.The backlash has alarmed researchers who worry that Sanofi\u2019s stumble could stoke mistrust in vaccines around the globe. Sanofi\u2019s vaccine is approved in 19 countries and is the first to combat dengue, a disease spread by mosquitoes that infects about 400 million people worldwide. It puts 500,000 people in the hospital each year and kills 25,000, mostly in Latin America and South Asia.Infection rates can reach 90 percent in the Philippines, according to Sanofi.Death rates are highest among children, and just last week a 7-year-old girl who had not been vaccinated died from dengue in the Philippines, according to news reports there.Even though the risk from the vaccine is low, families fear it has turned their children into time bombs, in whom the virus could set off a life-threatening illness.Leovon Deyro, whose youngest son received his last injection of the vaccine two weeks ago, said he suspects that Sanofi conspired with corrupt Philippine officials to circumvent regulations, something the company has denied.\u201cWe weren\u2019t told it was not safe,\u201d Mr. Deyro said. So far, he said, his son, who is 10, has had no worrying symptoms. But, he added, \u201cThey made my son and other students as guinea pigs.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been very devastating for almost the entire country,\u201d said Dr. Leonila Dans, an epidemiologist and pediatrician at the University of the Philippines in Manila who had been an early critic of the vaccination program. \u201cEven those who are not vaccinated are very emotional about it, because they feel for the kids who had the vaccine.\u201dThe episode could prove to be a cautionary tale for pharmaceutical companies, who have already been reluctant to invest in vaccines and drugs that are used mainly in the developing world.Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of another circumstance when a major public health program was introduced with this much controversy.\u201d The problems with the vaccine rollout have \u201ccast a pall\u201d on other efforts to develop dengue vaccines, he said, and public health experts are worried that the distrust could spill over to other vaccination programs.\u201cVaccines have plenty of controversy,\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make more.\u201dSanofi has said that the risk to people who get the vaccine is still extremely small. Moreover, in those who have previously been infected, the vaccine works well. In people older than 9, Dengaxia is about 66 percent effective. It is even more effective \u2014 81.9 percent \u2014 in those over 9 who were previously infected.But that has not allayed fears in the Philippines, where Sanofi has said 10 percent of the children who were vaccinated probably had no prior exposure to the virus.Dr. Su-Peing Ng, the head of medical affairs of Sanofi Pasteur, the company\u2019s vaccine division, said in an interview that \u201cthere is no cause for alarm,\u201d adding, \u201cthose vaccinated in high-exposure settings are much more protected than those who were not.\u201d\u201cWe did not give a blanket recommendation that the vaccine should be introduced,\u201d said W.H.O.\u2019s representative in the Philippines, Dr. Gundo Weiler. \u201cThis is a decision for governments and governments alone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a huge disappointment and it\u2019s a big lesson in humility,\u201d said Michel De Wilde, the former senior vice president of research and development at Sanofi Pasteur, who oversaw the vaccine\u2019s development until he left the company in 2013.The illness, also called breakbone fever, can be excruciating, with high fevers, headaches, muscle and joint pains and lingering weakness. Sometimes the disease causes hemorrhage or shock, which can be fatal.Some deadly cases have been linked to the fact that there are actually four different types of dengue virus. Research has found that severe illness can occur in people who had one type and later become infected by another. The body\u2019s immune response to the first virus is thought to make the second illness worse, a discovery credited to Dr. Scott B. Halstead, who has been studying dengue since the 1960s.Brazil decided to limit its government program to people who are over age 15.Even as Sanofi pushed back against researchers\u2019 warnings about the vaccine\u2019s potential hazards, it ordered another analysis of the data.Dr. Ng, the Sanofi official, said that before the additional analysis, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a robust way in which we could answer that question. It\u2019s only this new analysis that has given us this insight.\u201dThe new analysis found that lack of past infection was tied to an increased risk of severe dengue. But the risk was small \u2014 two extra cases per 1,000 previously uninfected people vaccinated, over five years of follow-up. And there were no deaths reported.But how to tell if someone has had dengue? Doctors and patients cannot always tell because symptoms can be vague.No rapid test exists. Current tests take a few days to produce results, and may have trouble distinguishing dengue from Zika, a related virus. Trying to use them would further complicate a vaccination process that is already cumbersome, because it requires three visits. Sanofi has said it will invest in efforts to develop a better test.At a Philippine Senate hearing on Dec. 11, Thomas Triomphe, a regional Sanofi official, emphasized the vaccine\u2019s benefits and said that to permanently remove it would leave 90 percent of the population \u201cat the mercy of an epidemic which has been found to be preventable.\u201dBut parents feel they have traded one risk for another that might be worse. Maria Brenal Bernal said her daughter, Reyna Rose, had been sick on and off since receiving her first shot of Dengvaxia in August.Mrs. Bernal had traveled to the health department in Manila, hoping for help.\u201cHer gums were bleeding,\u201d Mrs. Bernal said. \u201cShe has fever. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dengue, but she has been sick about a week.\u201dSanofi saw the Philippines as a key market. In the fall of 2016, the company initiated a \u201cdisease awareness\u201d campaign that did not name Dengvaxia but directed people to a Facebook page where Sanofi was mentioned.The ad concluded: \u201cAsk your doctor about dengue vaccination today.\u201dStill, countries like the Philippines, with endemic dengue, were eager to have a vaccine. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure for Sanofi to proceed, and of course they wanted to make money from it,\u201d said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University\u2019s College of Physicians and Surgeons.Experts in infectious diseases say the vaccine is too valuable to be abandoned.\u201cIf we wait for the perfect vaccine, we will probably be talking about this 50 years from now,\u201d said Duane Gubler, an emeritus professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, who favors using the vaccine, especially where dengue is highly endemic. He is one of the inventors of a competing dengue vaccine made by Takeda and has consulted in the past for Sanofi.The Takeda vaccine and another by the United States National Institutes of Health, which will be mainly sold by Merck, could be approved for use soon.According to the research so far, the N.I.H. vaccine, which is administered in a single dose, \u201cgives a very potent response against all four of the serotypes,\u201d said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is overseeing the vaccine\u2019s development.Some analysts said Sanofi\u2019s struggles could have a chilling effect on investment in vaccines, which are greatly needed in developing countries.\u201cI think anybody who deals in emerging markets noticed this one,\u201d said Les Funtleyder, a health care portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management who invests in domestic and emerging markets. He said that many investors were likely to \u201cask the big companies, why are you doing this? It\u2019s like, all risk, no reward.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the efficacy of the vaccine Dengaxia. It is about 66 percent effective in people older than 9, and 81.9 percent effective in those over 9 who were previously infected. It is not 66 percent effective in those over 9 who were previously infected.Felipe Villamor contributed reporting to this article from Manila.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Of All the Blogs in the World, He Walks Into Mine", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsThe grooms met on the internet. But this isn\u2019t a story about people who swiped right.Adam J. Kurtz, 29, and Mitchell Kuga, 30, first connected Dec. 1, 2012, five years to the day before their wedding.It was just before 5 p.m. and Mr. Kurtz, living in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, ordered a pizza. As one does, when one is 24 and living amid a generation of creative people whose every utterance and experience might be thought of as content, Mr. Kurtz filmed and posted to Tumblr a 10-minute video showing him awaiting the delivery.Among those who liked the video was a stranger Mr. Kurtz had already admired from afar. It was a guy named Mitchell who didn\u2019t reveal his last name on his Tumblr account, just his photographic eye for Brooklyn street scenes and, on occasion, his face. Mr. Kurtz had developed a bit of a social-media crush on him. \u201cI would think, \u2018He\u2019s not even sharing his whole life, that is so smart and impressive,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kurtz said.Mr. Kurtz found Mitchell Kuga there and messaged him. The gist was, \u201cMy pizza is here. You want some pizza?\u201d Then he added his cellphone number and immediately logged off Facebook. His hope was that Mr. Kuga would want to respond and that he would have to do so by texting.Mr. Kuga texted Mr. Kurtz five minutes later: \u201cHi Adam, this is Mitchell.\u201d\u201cIt was like old-school pre-Tinder,\u201d Mr. Kurtz said.Mr. Kuga was pushing a broom when Mr. Kurtz walked in. Before Mr. Kurtz could even introduce himself in person, Phillip Gilmour, then the owner of the restaurant, approached Mr. Kurtz.\u201cWe love Mitchell,\u201d he said to Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIf you break his heart, I will kill you.\u201dThey went for drinks at a nearby bar and then went to Mr. Kurtz\u2019s apartment, where he had set out slices of pizza. They talked till 7 a.m.They soon began dating, and in the intervening months and years, they traveled to Paris, Brazil, Tokyo, Coney Island. They wrote each other love notes in perfect penmanship. On a birthday card to Mr. Kurtz, Mr. Kuga addressed it to, \u201cmy babe my sun my emoji my rock my lol my jew boo my reason.\u201dMr. Kurtz graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2009 and moved to New York in 2012 to work as a graphic artist. He was always creative and enjoyed making crafts with bits and bobs of paper he had saved, ticket stubs and back-of-the-envelope doodles.As their careers grew, so did their affection. After dating for two years, Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Kuga moved in together.For both Mr. Kuga and Mr. Kurtz it was the first big romance.About 10 days after meeting Mr. Kurtz, Mr. Kuga texted his mother a photo of Mr. Kurtz. \u201cI met a boy,\u201d he wrote. He had come out to his mother a few years before but this was the first time he explicitly told her about a man in his life. \u201cYour new \u2018boyfriend\u2019?\u201d his mother, Amy Kuga, responded. \u201cHe\u2019s cute! What does he do?\u201dMr. Kuga also told his sister, Marisa, about Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIt was his way of coming out to me,\u201d said Ms. Kuga, now 24, while sipping from a beer bottle at her brother\u2019s wedding. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise to me that he was gay. But it showed to me how special this is. He finally wanted to put it into words.\u201dIt has been a more complicated situation for Mr. Kurtz, who first came out as gay to his parents when he was 15. They handled it as lovingly as a strictly religious family might, he said. Still, it has been tough for all parties to navigate. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they expected me to become a rabbi,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they expected me to be gay and marry a Japanese Hawaiian man.\u201dWhile some gay men and women in long-term relationships felt an overwhelming urge to marry as soon as gay marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court in June 2015, some younger gay couples felt otherwise. Including Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Kuga. \u201cA lot of us feel like marriage is not that important because it wasn\u2019t an option for so long so it isn\u2019t a factor that should determine the strength of a commitment,\u201d Mr. Kurtz said. \u201cIt can be seen as a heteronormative idea.\u201dWhen the men changed their minds about marriage, it was out of pragmatism. It was the summer of 2016, and they were lying in bed talking.\u201c\u2018I think we deserve the rights and protections that married people are afforded. I want to bury you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kurtz recalled saying to Mr. Kuga. (\u201cRomance!\u201d Mr. Kuga interjected as the men told the story.) From that point on, they considered themselves engaged. A few weeks later they went to Chinatown to buy engagement rings and then posted the news on Instagram to make it real.At first they considered a courthouse wedding or something very small. But then they decided they wanted to host an event that brought together the communities that had helped foster and sustain their relationship. This included the staff of Momo Sushi, Mr. Kurtz\u2019s friends from Baltimore, a large contingent of people the couple met through social media and Mr. Kuga\u2019s family \u2014 except for his father, who could not fly from Hawaii because of recent surgery.Mr. Kurtz\u2019s parents and three siblings were not there. The grooms had decided to marry on the fifth anniversary of their meeting, which happened to fall on a Friday, the Jewish Sabbath. Mr. Kurtz invited them knowing they would not attend because of Shabbat. \u201cIt worked out so that no one had to make any uncomfortable decisions,\u201d he said.However understated the proposal was, the wedding was not.The third floor of the Strand Bookstore took on the look of a well-staged Instagram feed. Strings of bulbs hung from rare-book bookshelf to bookshelf, with the light bouncing off the long pink, white, turquoise and gold dangling tassels. One table at the center of the room had big jars of pickles. Another had tiered cake platters overflowing with doughnuts.Amid circular periodical stands displaying paperbacks like \u201cVultures of Paradise Valley\u201d and $750 copies of \u201cThe Book of Common Prayer\u201d in glass cases, guests in crochet dresses and with large shoulder tattoos of eggplants sipped wine from plastic cups and beer from bottles.After a cocktail reception, the grooms emerged, both dressed in black and wearing leis that Amy Kuga had brought from Hawaii.They were married by Hector Marcel, a Buddhist teacher and Universal Life minister. He asked all in attendance to tie red strings around one another\u2019s wrists in acknowledgment of their role in making and supporting the marriage.\u201cYou are getting married to each other,\u201d he said to the crowd, before asking the men to read aloud the vows they had written. (Mr. Kurtz wrote his in crayon.) Mr. Kurtz, who is 6-foot-2, and Mr. Kuga, who is 5-foot-7, never let their eyes unlock.But it was Mr. Kuga\u2019s mother who returned to the importance of communities, reminding the guests that bonds are created in different ways. \u201cAdam has always been a part of our family, but now he is officially our son,\u201d she said looking up at Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIt\u2019s only taken 30 years to get a child over 5 feet 8 inches.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Disney Deal Expected to Value Fox at Around $40 a Share", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 Disney\u2019s pursuit of Fox is nearing its conclusion.\u2022 The Fed still projects three rate increases next year.\u2022 How will Doug Jones\u2019s election affect the Trump agenda?\u2022 But Mr. Jones\u2019s arrival probably won\u2019t affect the tax bill.Reuters reports:Walt Disney Co\u2019s deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday.That\u2019s the answer to the main question investors had ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy statement on Wednesday.Despite its improved outlook for the economy, the Fed remains cautious about raising rates too quickly. Two officials \u2014 Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2014 voted against Wednesday\u2019s rate hike. The reason? Concerns about inflation.Fed officials predicted that inflation would stay below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target next year, and then stay at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Those were unchanged from September.Here\u2019s how Wall Street economists reacted:\u2022 Republicans will have a harder time passing legislation \u2014 from infrastructure spending to potential cuts to programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 with a Senate majority of just one seat.\u2022 The Republican Party may split further between establishment figures like Mitch McConnell and dissidents in the vein of Mr. Moore whose allegiance aligns more closely alongside President Trump and shaking up the status quo.\u2022 Democrats now have a more plausible, though still difficult, path to regaining a majority in the Senate.The likely changes\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 21 percent, slightly higher than what lawmakers had originally proposed\u2022 A slight lowering of the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent\u2022 Limiting the mortgage deduction to loans of up to $750,000, a compromise on levels set in the House and in the Senate proposalsWhat still needs work\u2022 Whether to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax\u2022 A resolution on the estate tax\u2022 How to treat state and local tax deductions.The tax flyaround\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dWhat was still being hammered out as of yesterday\u2022 The price that Disney would pay for the Fox businesses it would acquire\u2022 What role, if any, James Murdoch would take at Disney\u2022 What sort of protections the companies would need in case antitrust authorities raise objectionsThe F.C.C. is expected to vote tomorrow on rolling back the regulations. But Facebook, Google and their peers have been noticeably quiet. Why? They\u2019re already on the defensive on other issues.\u201cWith the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations.\u201dAndrew writes:If that\u2019s true, it means that employee cuts would be even more severe than I had anticipated. About 12,000 people would lose their jobs, more than the number of people Qualcomm employs at its headquarters.Why did the SEC call up Munchee and cause it to shut down? \u201cBecause Munchee was making reckless and unsupported claims about incredible returns that deceived investors and separated little old ladies from their hard-earned retirement ether,\u201d you might assume, but you\u2019d be wrong.Critics\u2019 corner Lumped together, the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and others in lower-, mid- and senior-level management positions in the financial sector increased from 17 percent to 21 percent in the period.Before diversity advocates cheer, they should read on. While overall diversity increased, the percentage of black managers dropped.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instant Korean Ramen, Made the Hard Way", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review8 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.But fresh wrinkles on the classics were growing rare, while new ramen-yas came along so fast it was getting hard to keep them straight. All that remained, it seemed, was to fill in the blank spaces on the map until bowls of tonkotsu and shoyu ramen were sold everywhere from Tottenville to Gun Hill Road.The one thing this view failed to take into account was the inspiration for Jeju Noodle Bar: Korean ramen.In other words, Jeju, in the West Village, is a tribute to a packaged convenience store item made up of a compressed brick of dried or fried noodles and an envelope of powdered or concentrated soup base. Often it is sold and mixed in a disposable cup.One of them, the so ramyun, is made with veal. It is slightly less thick and rich than eggnog, but just as smooth. Mr. Kim ladles this broth over thin squiggles of chewy noodles, a hunk of stewed brisket and thin red sheets of raw Wagyu striated with white fat. Unbashful amounts of garlic chips and black pepper rough up the edges of the broth\u2019s gorgeously rounded beef flavor.In contrast to the milky opacity of the veal and pork broths is the translucent, sparkling-gold chicken broth in a ramyun called the Fish Coop. The fish in question is bonito, flakes of which bring a mild background of seafood to the intense chicken flavor. Even with slices of jalape\u00f1o and a floating green rim of herb oil tasting of chives and dill, the broth is subtle enough that you can really taste the juicy shreds of chicken confit.Each of the three soups is so carefully considered, so well harmonized, that Jeju\u2019s menu really could end there. But Mr. Kim makes a handful of Korean-inspired appetizers, too, all more nuanced than what you\u2019d find in a typical ramen-ya.I love the cucumber kimchi, skinny little numbers whose soft tartness is almost bubbly and very slightly minty. Is there shiso in the brine? There\u2019s certainly plum in the sweet dressing dotted with black and white sesame seeds.Mr. Kim\u2019s soon du bu doesn\u2019t have the gloom-killing uppercut of more traditional recipes \u2014 it\u2019s a little too dainty and mild \u2014 but its tomato-shellfish broth supporting the usual soft tofu and some unorthodox but welcome green olives is very good on its own terms.One of three raw-fish appetizers is tuna yuk hwe in a pallid, forgettable dressing. But the amberjack salad with chimichurri and brown-butter vinaigrette is very delicious, as is the hwe dup bap \u2014 sashimi and trout roe over warm rice made extra-fishy by tiny black dots of flyingfish roe.There are a few other small dishes, including a likable steamed bun filled with pork belly and corn kernels. It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Kim elaborates this portion of the menu a bit, perhaps adding some larger plates. At the moment, it would be hard to make a complete meal at Jeju without ramyun, which may keep away people who don\u2019t eat meat.Like some other young chefs, Mr. Kim has brought his cooks into the tip pool by asking them to double as waiters. It may help him recruit talent for his kitchen, but it may also be a reason the service is muddled. I\u2019ve been served food meant for another table; I\u2019ve been asked the same question by two people within the space of a minute; I\u2019ve been given empty plates I didn\u2019t need, and had to stop somebody from clearing dishes I hadn\u2019t finished.The confusion even extended to the greeting at the door. One night when I got there before my guests, a host asked how far away everybody else was. I said I was sure they were close.\u201cWell, your reservation was at 8,\u201d was the reply. It was 8:03.It is all clean and orderly, just bright enough that when you stand across the street you can see the new nighthawks bending over their bowls of noodles.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weekend Breakfasts to Warm the Heart, and Belly", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019ve recently been trying to teach my nearly 5-year-old son, Max, to ride a bicycle, with little success. I could possibly blame Max for our tardy progress, but I must take the responsibility myself.I\u2019m the one who hasn\u2019t been tremendously excited about going to the park in the freezing cold to assume the crouch-and-waddle pose behind the bike and wait for the \u201cbalance and pedal\u201d instinct to kick in. I\u2019m the one who has yet to figure out how to adjust the valves so that the tires aren\u2019t permanently flattish.My sense of inadequacy isn\u2019t helped by the fact that my own father was extremely engaged in teaching his children, and the first lot of grandchildren, how to ride a bike. Dad managed to make running after a runny-nosed toddler who\u2019s struggling to pedal and face forward at the same time seem like a breeze. Ditto pumps, valves and flat tires: These were all things my dad was just able to adjust, find and fix.As bad as I may feel about failing to get my kids on bikes, I know that, sooner or later, they\u2019ll get it. But in another area, I am far less confident that I will finally manage to catch up with my folks and give my children the important heritage and life skills that I took in as a kid: breakfast.My mother was, and still very much is, the queen of breakfast. When I was young, she would get out of bed well ahead of anyone else; 6 a.m. was the standard. By the time we all finally huddled up around the table, oranges had been squeezed, bread had been toasted, cheese arranged on a platter, vegetables sliced, jams decanted and coffee brewed. Everything was there, school lunches included.The 6 a.m. scene in my house today, on the other hand, is one of pandemonium. For some reason, it is just impossible to escape the perpetual cycle of washing kids, dressing kids, dressing myself, distracting kids with tablets, defusing fights, brushing hair, brushing teeth.It often falls to our 2-year-old, Flynn, to remind us that breakfast also needs to actually happen. \u201cDownstairs, porridge,\u201d he commands, with little need of preposition or adverb so early on in the day.Stirring the oats, I smile to think of the automated breakfast machine constructed by the eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts in the film \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d from my childhood, or the one Rosita Pig makes in the recent movie \u201cSing\u201d to allow her to slip away from the morning routine for her dozen-plus piglets. Rosita makes me think of my mum, whose combination of extreme competence, composure and controlled urgency made breakfast happen so calmly and deliciously. As I sip my first espresso of the day, I look back in awe.Having said all that, one thing I have learned from these early years of being a dad myself is that it is all too easy to set yourself up for failure on the parenting front. Constantly looking up to others, particularly your own parents, for some ideal standard of homemaking and nurturing is a trap that too many newbie parents fall into. The picture we draw of other parents is probably less than realistic and completely unachievable, but that doesn\u2019t save us. It does not help to know that others aren\u2019t perfect parents; we still want to become one of them.My coping devise for this conundrum, at least on the breakfast front, is to concentrate my efforts on the weekend. Without the time constraints and general frenzy of work and school days, there is far less pressure to get things done in the morning. With this kind of freedom, I can spend time in the kitchen pretending to be my mother.Getting started while the others are still bedded down under duvets, I make sure everything is just so, preparing food for ourselves, and often also for guests, which I wouldn\u2019t dream of on a weekday morning. Recently, I have been cooking cheesy frittatas loaded with herbs and wintry vegetables like leeks, pumpkins and kale. I have been baking sticky buns and quick loaf cakes. I have been making crepes, pancakes and hot cakes, and I have been braising eggs in every sauce I can think of.On weekends, as I sit around a table laden with the fruit of my hard work and surrounded by my nearest and dearest, what starts off as breakfast naturally slips on to lunch, without anyone noticing. Without the time constraints, any sense of parental guilt or domestic inadequacy vanishes into thin air. The day rolls along smoothly, almost effortlessly.In fact, it\u2019s a bit like riding a bike \u2014 without having to face the winter cold.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Today: What Makes an Ugly Christmas Sweater Beautiful?", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this drafty Wednesday.Over the last few years, we\u2019ve noticed a disheartening commoditization and mass production taking hold of a classic holiday tradition.We\u2019re talking about ugly Christmas sweaters.Call us traditionalists, but a true ugly Christmas sweater should lack any irony when it is made. Ideally, the garment\u2019s makers genuinely think their unsightly design is quite lovely.Once upon a time, before ugly Christmas sweaters were a joke, that was the case.\u201cThey weren\u2019t really intended to be funny or mass produced,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThey were just gaudy and stood out when you put them on, and other people thought, \u2018That\u2019s hilarious.\u2019\u201dAccording to his research, the first large, organized ugly Christmas sweater party was at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver in 2002. About a decade ago, the trend caught on more widely.Personally, Mr. Miller favors Nordic designs from the 1970s made with high-quality wool.The mark of a good sweater, he said, \u201cis basically something you would have opened from your great-aunt as a 10-year-old and thrown a fit. Those are the ones I love now.\u201dIn the search for what makes a true ugly Christmas sweater, we called a few vintage shops around town.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Pull on that sweater, ugly or otherwise.Afternoon hot chocolate runs will feel less whipped. The gusts stop around noon.As 2017 draws to a close, we\u2019re looking back and reflecting on the last year.We\u2019d like to hear about the best news you received this year.Did your daughter get into her dream school? Did you find out an old friend is moving back to the city? Or perhaps you heard your favorite restaurant is opening a new location right down the block.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Barca Way Spreads Far From Catalonia", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerEverywhere you look, the fingerprints are visible. They are there in those places where the lights shine brightest, and they are there where the lights don\u2019t shine at all.At the summit of the Premier League; among the rich and famous of the Champions League; at suburban schools in the United States; at provincial, second-tier clubs in China; at village teams in Africa: In every corner of the world and at every level of soccer, there are indelible traces of Barcelona.Wherever they are found, they are present for the same reason. Across the planet, the word Barcelona \u2014 the idea of Barcelona \u2014 has over the last decade come to connote not just success but beauty, too. That has inspired countless clubs, large and small, to try to distill and import the magic, to find someone to sprinkle a little of that stardust on them.Pep Guardiola, a pioneer and product of Barcelona\u2019s philosophy, once compared the club he graced as a player and manager to a church. \u201cJohan Cruyff painted the chapel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coaches who follow merely restore or improve it.\u201dOthers who have worshiped at its altar, or formed part of its congregation, though, have taken a different path: They have spread out into the world, to act as apostles of its philosophy.Albert Benaiges, for example, has built a career as a roving ambassador for Barcelona, working in Dubai and Mexico before landing at Cibao in the Dominican Republic. \u201cWe are the reigning Caribbean club champions,\u201d he said, proudly.Everywhere he has traveled, the demand has been the same.\u201cPeople want to play beautiful football and win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the Barcelona brand.\u201dSome of his teams have come closer than others \u2014 \u201cit was easier in Mexico, with Chivas, where the quality was higher, than at Al Wasl, in Dubai,\u201d he said \u2014 but then he is not employed to create identikit teams, pale imitations of the real thing. Rather, he is there to ensure players learn the game the same way they do in Catalonia.\u201cA style is something a team has, related to its ability, its climate, lots of things,\u201d said Albert Puig, a former director of La Masia, the famed youth academy that nurtured the likes of Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Lionel Messi.He, too, has crossed the globe, spreading the word.\u201cThe Barcelona model is a form of education. Football is a language. You have to learn and understand it before you can speak and write it.\u201d Then, Puig said, \u201cyou can go and play whatever style you like. \u201dOn the field, though Real has the historic edge, the two have enjoyed similar success this century. Each has won the Champions League four times since 2001. Barcelona has eight Spanish championships to Real\u2019s six in that time period. Both believe they boast the world\u2019s best player.Financially, Real Madrid is the more successful. The auditor Deloitte had rated Real the richest club in the world for more than a decade, until this year, when Manchester United took the title. Socially, Barcelona has the edge, claiming around 190 million worldwide followers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, compared to Real Madrid\u2019s 182 million.And yet, in one measure, the gap between the two is clear. \u201cIn terms of influence, you can say that Barcelona is clearly the most important club in the world,\u201d Puig said.That is thanks, in no small part, to Puig, and those like him.Manchester City, the Premier League leader, is by some distance the clearest symbol of Barcelona\u2019s proselytizing power. A cluster of alumni has coalesced around Guardiola, the Premier League leader\u2019s coach, both on the training field \u2014 many of his staff trace their roots to Catalonia \u2014 and in the executive suites.City\u2019s hierarchy is stuffed with Barcelona alumni, largely appointed by Ferran Soriano, who served as a vice president at Barcelona until 2012 when he took up the role as chief executive of City Football Group \u2014 the umbrella organization that runs the team and its affiliates in Australia, Major League Soccer and Uruguay.He has since been joined by Txiki Begiristain, City\u2019s director of football; Omar Berrada, its chief operating officer; Francisco Lopez, business director of one of CFG\u2019s subsidiaries; and Esteve Calzada, another Barcelona veteran, who now works as a consultant to CFG.If that is the most glaring example, it is far from the only one. Marc Ingla, an erstwhile colleague of Soriano\u2019s both before and during his time at Camp Nou, is now chief executive at the French team Lille O.S.C. \u201cProfessionals always want to develop their own projects, and people always like to ape successful stories,\u201d Ingla said. \u201cThat tends to lead to opportunities for the people involved.\u201dLast month, Arsenal confirmed the appointment of Raul Sanllehi, a former director of football at Barcelona, as head of football relations. Carles Romagosa, a one-time director of La Masia, occupies the same role at Paris Saint-Germain. Andoni Zubizarreta, another former technical director at Barcelona, now works for Marseille; until recently, Jose Ramon Alexanco did the same job at Valencia.Those are just the administrators and executives. There are many more managers and coaches, ranging from Oscar Garcia \u2014 most recently of St. Etienne in France, and most successfully of Red Bull Salzburg \u2014 and Eusebio Sacristan at Real Sociedad to two emissaries in China\u2019s second division: Jordi Vinyals at Qingdao Huanghai and Sergi Barjuan at Hangzhou Greentown. Sergi Lobera, meanwhile, is working at FC Goa, in India.The greatest demand is for youth specialists: La Masia, after all, formed the bedrock of Barcelona\u2019s success over the last decade, leading organizations from across the world to do all they can to either learn or acquire its secrets. It is something Barcelona itself has attempted to control, establishing a network of academies across the planet, trawling for a new generation of stars.When Qatar established its ambitious Aspire Football Dreams project \u2014 designed to capture and train the best young talent in Africa, Asia and Central America \u2014 it seemed natural to appoint two men with connections to La Masia, Josep Colomer and Juanjo Rovira, to its senior ranks. Likewise, when Liverpool wanted to modernize its youth development, it looked to Pep Segura, now restored to a position of prominence at Barcelona.Even away from the intense, high-pressure world of elite soccer, though, the Barcelona brand carries weight, as Puig\u2019s story demonstrates.He left Catalonia in 2014, stepping down after a disagreement with the board, and took on a post with the national federation in Gabon. He was struck, there, by Barcelona\u2019s reach. \u201cWe would go to villages in the countryside,\u201d he said. \u201cSome did not have power or running water. But you always saw kids in Barcelona jerseys.\u201dAfter a year, he moved to Aruba, before agreeing to a three-year contract at De Anza Force, a club in Cupertino, Calif. \u201cI wanted to experience the United States, and I wanted a job with less pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very calm here. It is like a paradise.\u201dReal Madrid, by contrast, has no comparable flotilla of ambassadors preaching the glory of the most successful club in Europe.There is a formal connection with China \u2014 Real has sent 24 coaches and committed $185 million to building an academy in conjunction with Guangzhou Evergrande. Real also has an informal relationship with Aspire: Ivan Bravo, the Aspire Academy\u2019s director general, worked as director of strategy in Madrid between 2003 and 2010. He also currently holds a seat on the board of Leeds United.Beyond that, though, Real\u2019s influence is limited: No team supplies more players to Europe\u2019s top five leagues than the reigning Spanish champion \u2014 Madrid overtook Barcelona this year \u2014 but it sends few executives or coaches as emissaries.In part, that may be because of the management model that has brought Real such success: The club\u2019s president, Florentino Perez, has worked with his two closest associates, Jose Angel Sanchez and Ramon Martinez, for so long that friends say they cannot imagine leaving.The stability of Perez\u2019s reign is significant, too. He has been in charge of Real for much of the last two decades. Barcelona has seen coaches and executives leave in purges following regime change. There has been no such upheaval in the Spanish capital. The only people who come and go at Real are managers. That may be to Real\u2019s advantage. There is some concern in Catalonia that the brain drain is hampering La Masia\u2019s success.But there may also be a cultural element to it. In Steven G. Mandis\u2019 book \u201cThe Real Madrid Way,\u201d he concludes that \u201cwinning cultures cannot be imposed or invented.\u201d They are, instead, unique, indigenous. The peculiar alchemy that makes Real Madrid special and successful cannot be packaged up and introduced elsewhere. The history, the context, is incomparable.That is not how Barcelona sees it. It does not want to impose its culture on other teams, to create an army of clones. Its evangelical zeal comes from elsewhere, from a belief that the language it speaks can be learned by others, too, no matter how grand or insignificant, how rich or poor. It can leave its trace anywhere, and everywhere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 New Year\u2019s Resolutions to Protect Your Technology", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixThe cybersecurity nightmares of 2017 highlight the need to protect yourself. Here are some resolutions for living a safer digital life this new year.If 2017 taught you anything about personal technology, it\u2019s that the onus is on you to protect your personal data and devices.Amid Uber\u2019s laundry list of scandals, which included sexual harassment accusations and an undisclosed security breach, there was an important revelation that everyone can learn from. It involved Unroll.me, a free service that unsubscribes you from junk mail.The Unroll.me episode also raised awareness of the sheer number of third-party apps that may be leeching off your personal information. There are probably apps and web services you don\u2019t remember downloading or subscribing to, and they could still have access to your data.At least once a year, it\u2019s worthwhile to do an audit on your third-party apps. On your smartphone, delete apps that you have not touched in several months. For a clean break, in some cases you will also have to visit the company\u2019s website and request that your account be deleted entirely.Also check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.When you browse the web, a broadband provider helps route your device\u2019s internet traffic to each destination website. Every device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.The trend with these fancy new smartphones is to make the display take up as much of the face as possible. That means that a larger part of the body is composed of glass, which is susceptible to shattering. (The iPhone X even has a glass back so it can be charged wirelessly.) This trend is likely to continue, because people love having more screen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eggs, Tomatoes and a Quick Trip to Purgatory", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteLately though, I\u2019ve widened my eggs-and-red-sauce circle to include the evocatively named Italian version: uova in purgatorio, or eggs in purgatory. (It may be named for the boiling tomato sauce the eggs are poached in, or the fiery red-pepper flakes the sauce is spiked with.)Both recipes feature a piquant tomato sauce and softly cooked eggs, but the difference is in the seasonings. While heady spices like turmeric, cumin and coriander scent the North African dish, the Italian incarnation is all about the pungency of good olive oil and garlic, a little basil or rosemary and the pleasurable burn of crushed red-pepper flakes. It can be a mildly or intensely spicy combination, purportedly good for hangovers with all that chile smacking any residual fog from your brain. Crunchy, fragrant garlic-rubbed toast makes it a complete meal.Eggs in purgatory is exquisitely easy to make \u2014 even simpler than shakshuka because there are no onions or peppers to slice and saut\u00e9. The only ingredients you\u2019ll need to cut up are a garlic clove (or two), to be browned in olive oil along with the red-pepper flakes, and some anchovies before you stir in the canned tomatoes.A word to anchovy avoiders: Yes, you can certainly leave them out; they aren\u2019t even traditionally found in this kind of purgatory. But, if you\u2019re at all open to them (or possibly obsessed with them, like I am), they\u2019ll add an umami flavor that works nicely with the acidity of the canned tomatoes.Like shakshuka, eggs in purgatory can be served for breakfast, brunch or a light supper, whether you\u2019re hung over, or just in a hurry to get a satisfying, full-flavored dish on the table quickly.cookingAdvertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "Inside the Home of Instant Pot, the Kitchen Gadget That Spawned a Religion", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "The ShiftThe electric multicooker is a true viral phenomenon. We went to the company\u2019s Canadian headquarters to learn why.Supported byKANATA, Ontario \u2014 Truth be told, the headquarters of Instant Pot don\u2019t look much like a church.But inside this sterile, gray office building on the outskirts of Ottawa, behind a door marked only by a small metal sign, a new religion has been born.\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d reads a fairly typical Amazon rave, one of more than 25,000 reviews on the site for the Instant Pot. \u201cThis is the best kitchen gadget to ever exist in the history of ever.\u201dMr. Wang, 53, did not set out to be a kitchen mogul. An engineering whiz who grew up in Harbin, China, as the son of two professors, he earned a Ph.D. in computer science and intended to develop artificial intelligence systems for a living. After a series of telecom and tech jobs, he was laid off from his dot-com position in 2008, just as the global financial crisis hit.After a brief and unsuccessful attempt to start his own tech company, Mr. Wang turned his attention to kitchen appliances, a market that hadn\u2019t yet been visited by the tech industry\u2019s disruption fairies. A lapsed home cook whose busy schedule rarely allowed him to make healthy meals for his wife and two children, Mr. Wang recruited two other engineers and spent 18 months and $350,000 of his savings developing a high-tech device that would combine pressure-cooking, slow-cooking, saut\u00e9ing and other common cooking functions in a single appliance. In a news release announcing his invention in 2013, he called it the \u201ciPot\u201d \u2014 an Apple homage that his trademark lawyer soon nixed.In person, Mr. Wang is soft-spoken and earnest, with a nerd\u2019s enthusiasm for the technology that powers the Instant Pot. (That enthusiasm extends to his other creations as well: At various points during our interview, he read me excerpts from his doctoral dissertation on logic programming languages, and showed me the hand-built website he made to host photos of his family.)In 2010, after several months of sluggish sales in and around Ontario, Mr. Wang listed the Instant Pot on Amazon, where a community of food writers eventually took notice. Vegetarians and paleo dieters, in particular, were drawn to the device\u2019s pressure-cooking function, which shaved hours off the time needed to cook pots of beans or large cuts of meat.Sensing viral potential, Instant Pot sent test units to about 200 influential chefs, cooking instructors and food bloggers. Reviews and recipes appeared online, and sales began to climb.You wouldn\u2019t know it from his small, bare-walled office, but Mr. Wang, who cooks steamed sweet potatoes and soft-boiled eggs in his three Instant Pots at home, has built a profitable empire. Exact figures are elusive because the company is private and has never raised money from outside investors, but there is no doubt that as the company\u2019s largest shareholder, Mr. Wang has done very well.\u201cThey\u2019re expanding as fast as they can produce the appliances,\u201d said Coco Morante, a food writer and author of \u201cThe Essential Instant Pot Cookbook.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve built this word-of-mouth advertising and community around their appliance that\u2019s pretty fervent.\u201dBut why, and why now? After all, pressure cookers aren\u2019t new, and most of the Instant Pot\u2019s functions are replicated by other common kitchen appliances. Mr. Wang credits the device\u2019s technological advances \u2014 most notably, a group of sensors that keep the cooker from overheating or exploding under pressure.Amazon has played a particularly large role in Instant Pot\u2019s rise. Early on, Instant Pot joined the \u201cFulfillment by Amazon\u201d program, in which Amazon handles the packing and shipping of a seller\u2019s products in exchange for a cut of each item sold. Eventually, Instant Pot sent Amazon wholesale shipments directly from factories in China, and Amazon began promoting the machines in its major annual sales. At one point, more than 90 percent of Instant Pot\u2019s sales came through Amazon.\u201cWithout Amazon, we wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Kitchen appliance fads tend to come and go (R.I.P., George Foreman grill). And major appliance makers like Cuisinart and Breville have taken note of Instant Pot\u2019s success and introduced electric multicookers of their own. But Mr. Wang said he believed that the Instant Pot\u2019s passionate online following will protect it from being crushed by a larger rival. He showed me videos in which fans sang the Instant Pot\u2019s praises, and a blog post about a woman who credited her Instant Pot with helping her lose 83 pounds.He also revealed a secret: in every official photograph of an Instant Pot, the unit\u2019s timer is set to 5:20 \u2014 a series of numbers that, when spoken aloud, sounds like \u201cI love you\u201d in his native Mandarin.\u201cIt\u2019s a subliminal message,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows how much we care about our customers.\u201dMr. Wang declined to comment when I asked about Instant Pot\u2019s plans for future products. He said the company wanted to modernize other \u201clegacy appliances\u201d in the kitchen by adding sensors and microprocessors, and eventually using Wi-Fi to connect them to the cloud.Not that Instant Pot needs to branch out just yet. According to the NPD Group, only 11.5 percent of American households own electric multicookers. Which means that there are still millions more potential Potheads out there, still making their vegetarian curries and chili con carne the hard way.Mr. Wang wants to convert these poor souls, and bring them into his flock.\u201cWe know we really make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harassment All Around, Afghan Women Weigh Risks of Speaking Out", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re ugly, Maryam, everyone says so, but I guess you\u2019re a virgin so when you\u2019re ready to have sex, let me know and I will be glad to \u2026\u201d Her male co-worker, writing on her Facebook account, finished the sentence obscenely.It was 10 a.m. on a normal day in the life of an Afghan working woman. The journalist Maryam Mehtar, 24, said she had already that morning been harassed or assaulted at least five times: in the bus to work, on the street waiting for the bus, by a man who grabbed her buttocks, by another man who asked how much she charged and by a young boy who said she had a \u201cpretty vulva.\u201dFinally in the relative safety of her own office, she opened her computer to read the Facebook offer from one of her colleagues to deflower her.\u201cMost of my friends are silent,\u201d said Ms. Mehtar, who works for the Afghan news agency Sarienews. \u201cThey think if they talk everyone will blame them, and they\u2019re right.\u201dMs. Mehtar is one of the few Afghan women willing to name and shame her abusers, something most are afraid to do \u2014 and not just because of fear of public humiliation.When women speak up, they take a big risk, said Shaharzad Akbar, 30, who works as an adviser to President Ashraf Ghani and says she was sexually assaulted when she was an intern early in her career. \u201cIn Afghanistan, women can\u2019t say they faced sexual harassment. If a woman shares someone\u2019s identity, he will kill her or kill her family. We can never accuse men, especially high-ranking men, without great risk.\u201dThey fear not only the vengeance of the abusers, but sometimes even that of their own families, Ms. Akbar and others said.\u201cIn Afghanistan, we are both the victim and the criminal,\u201d Zubaida said. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell my own family that I quit because of sexual harassment. Western women are so lucky.\u201dOne 31-year-old woman, who feared that she and her children could be killed if her name were used, had returned to Afghanistan after years of living in Iran. She had done well in school there, and as an educated woman she quickly found work, first in a provincial government office in Ghazni Province.On her first week at work, the director of her department threw her over a piece of furniture and tried to sexually assault her; she fled the office and quit. In Kabul, she went to buy a plot of land from the government, and the director of the department began sending her nude photographs of himself and asking her for sex, mostly via Facebook messages.The harassment many of them face extends even to Afghan employees of international and Western institutions, according to numerous women interviewed for this article.One woman gave up on government employment after repeated harassment and started her own nongovernmental organization. She began applying for grants from the United Nations, the United States Agency for International Development and various Western embassies.\u201cEvery time the same thing: The Afghan staff would say, \u2018I\u2019ll approve your proposal, if you have sex with me,\u2019\u201d she said, asking that her name not be used because she still hopes to find a grant and does not want to anger potential donors. \u201cEveryone thinks that those women who work outside the home are whores, and Afghan men can say and do anything they want with them.\u201dWomen in the media are particularly frequent victims, in part because they have public profiles, and often use social media with their real identities. That often attracts men who hurl sexual abuse at them with abandon \u2014 often not even bothering to disguise their names. The abuse frequently includes sexually explicit photographs.When Ms. Mehtar posted on Facebook her view that \u201cAfghan women are not safe even in their own homes,\u201d she was deluged with a mixture of hate mail and sexually abusive comments. She received hundreds of Facebook and Twitter messages \u2014 which she has archived. One came from an Afghan writer named Jalil Junbish, who described himself as an authority on women\u2019s rights. It read: \u201cYou\u2019re a whore and have had sex with many men.\u201dContacted by Facebook Messenger about the abuse, Mr. Junbish not only confirmed that it came from him, but repeated his accusation. \u201cMaryam is a whore,\u201d he replied to a female Afghan reporter for The New York Times. \u201cWhy are you her friend?\u201d He added, \u201cYou\u2019re a whore, too.\u201dWhen the reporter contacted Mr. Junbish by telephone, he confirmed that the Facebook account was his own, but he then claimed that it had been hacked by someone else who sent the abusive messages.Within only a few months, however, rumors began to circulate that many women were complaining of sexual harassment at the station, and there was a wave of resignations, according to two women who said they were among those who quit because of that. They were interviewed in the past week on the condition of anonymity because they feared being unable to find another job if they spoke out.Mr. Hamid, the owner, said sexual harassment was not tolerated at Zan TV. \u201cZan TV is a safe place for women,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies trust us and send their daughters outside to work for us, and we never break their hearts.\u201dSulieman Samar, the public relations coordinator for Zan TV, and a brother of the owner, denied that there had been any resignations over harassment. \u201cEveryone who works here signs contracts promising not to sexually harass anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cSexual harassment is wrong.\u201dMaj. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, the spokesman for the defense ministry, said that Col. Ghulam Rasoul Laghmani had been detained and was under investigation, but so far no one has formally accused him of harassment. General Waziri said the authorities had been unable to find the woman, whose identity in the video is unclear.Recently, the Ministries of Interior and Communications jointly set up hotlines to report sexual harassment, with separate numbers for women (989) and men (999). Since the interior ministry is in charge of the police, many assumed the hotlines were for reporting problems with police officers.A woman who answered the 989 number said that was not their role; they handle only phone harassment cases of the heavy-breathing type. \u201cIf a policeman harasses you,\u201d the hotline operator said, \u201cyou should slap him, or ask other women to slap him. We can\u2019t help you.\u201dFahim Abed and Najim Rahim contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The restaurateur and author Eddie Huang on racial stereotypes and diversity in Hollywood. Leon and Rosina Watson on marrying across the color line in 1950 \u2014 when it was still illegal in much of the country.Over the past year, we have hosted weekly live conversations about race and ethnicity on Facebook, tackling topics that ranged from black royalty to Latino baseball players to Asian-American slurs. RaceNYT, as we call the segment, is an extension of the crucial coverage on race \u2014 in America and beyond \u2014 that appears in The New York Times. We see it as a chance not only to explore important stories of race and what they mean to society, but also to give you, our readers and viewers, a chance to join the conversation.These subjects are not always easy to talk about. Why, for instance, is affordable housing built mostly in poor, heavily minority areas? What are the terms about race that make us uncomfortable? And what do the United States and major institutions like universities owe the descendants of the enslaved people they profited from?We explored these issues and more with a wide range of guests, including political strategists, filmmakers, academics and Times viewers. Here are five takeaways from the show:Our viewers tuned in from Australia, Canada, Brazil, Trinidad and beyond, voicing their views and concerns about race and ethnicity in the United States and overseas.Like racial minorities in the United States, Indigenous Australians are often relegated to the fringe of society, Craig Quartermaine, an Aboriginal television reporter and comedian, told us.\u201cWe\u2019re window dressing,\u201d he said.In another segment, Nakkiah Lui, an Indigenous writer and actor, told us, \u201cThe equality of human rights is something in which aboriginal people are still fighting for in many different ways in Australia.\u201dFrida Charriere, one of our viewers, joined the conversation with Mr. Quartermaine from Canada. She said she could relate: \u201cI am First Nation and understand the comparisons with Aboriginal people worldwide. We were taken from our homes and put into schools.\u201dMadeline Vann reached out to us, wondering how she should handle the racially offensive remarks she was hearing in her community. She is a white freelance writer in Virginia.\u201cWhat I need is an elevator speech to address this,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes anyone have an idea of how to counter this?\u201dWe invited her to join us on Facebook Live, and scores of viewers shared advice and experiences. Ronald Wohlman said: \u201cYou must be direct. Honest. Straightforward.\u201dThe first year of the Trump presidency has been marked by a vast racial chasm where perspectives often exist in different worlds.Are Confederate monuments symbols of hate or a preservation of history? What is a black Republican to do in 2017? Americans feel increasingly divided.The Muslim-American activists Aber Kawas and Dalia Mogahed told us how they felt last month when the authorities quickly described an attack by a Muslim man in Manhattan as terrorism, while that term was never officially applied to a white man who fatally shot more than 50 people in Las Vegas weeks earlier.\u201cPretty much we define terror attacks as something that\u2019s done by a Muslim,\u201d Ms. Kawas said.Michael Quess Moore, who is black, and Richard Marksbury, who is white, sparred over the removal of Confederate monuments in New Orleans. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Andrew Jackson or George Washington or Martin Luther King \u2014 nothing should come down,\u201d Mr. Marksbury said. \u201cIf we have issues in contemporary society, that\u2019s the goal of educators and education, which is to explain who these people are, what they did, why we don\u2019t agree with it, etc.\u201dAnd Joseph Pinion and Ernest Lyles, two black Republicans, discussed how difficult it was to engage fellow black people on the issues when many of them view President Trump as racist.Whether we\u2019re talking about seaside resorts or Native American citizenship, history almost always finds its way into our conversations.Stanley Nelson, the documentary filmmaker, talked about black vacation spots like Oak Bluffs in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass., and their roots in segregation.Chuck Hoskin Jr., secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation, described how 19th-century slave ownership among the Cherokee affected the long-running legal battle over membership in the tribe.After the violence in Charlottesville, Isabel Wilkerson, the author and journalist, and Joshua D. Rothman, a historian, talked about how white supremacy flourished openly in middle-class communities in the 20th century.But as we\u2019ve seen in the debates over Confederate monuments, coming to consensus on our history \u2014 and its impact on our lives today \u2014 can be challenging.These issues aren\u2019t theoretical for us. As black journalists, we face them in our day-to-day lives.John told viewers how he and his wife were treated recently in a Mexican restaurant.Rachel described her reaction whenever she is described as \u201carticulate\u201d or praised for her use of the English language. (How often are white journalists praised for that?)Our colleague, Nathalie Nieves, who is Hispanic, shared her feelings about the day when a white co-worker asked whether she was undocumented. (She isn\u2019t.)We are living with these issues and, like so many of you, we\u2019re trying to make sense of them. Our experiences have convinced us: Dialogue matters. If we want to understand one another, we need to talk to one another, and to listen.Advertisement"}

This is the first year Macy\u2019s has made it mandatory to reserve a spot at its flagship store.\u201cThis is new, but they were very accommodating,\u201d she added, explaining that a kind elf had helped her family get added to the queue even without the reservation.They had arrived at Macy\u2019s at 10:30 on a Friday morning, and by 12:30 they were still waiting for their chance, but the children were holding up well. \u201cWe are excited we get to see Santa,\u201d said Ms. Decesare\u2019s daughter Eva. \u201cI want to ask him for a kitty,\u201d added her other daughter Gigi.Theresa Maldarelli, also there that day, had made her family\u2019s reservations three days before her visit.\u201cI love the fact that they are doing reservations this year because in the past there were lines that would go around for at least three hours,\u201d said Ms. Maldarelli, her son and daughter in line with her. \u201cThis is a lot easier,\u201d she said.The rules for seeing Santa vary across the country.By Friday morning, both weekend days were fully booked, and Monday had one slot available: at 8 a.m.A spokeswoman for Macy\u2019s said the company hopes reserving time can help cut down long wait times.\u201cWith thousands of visitors to Macy\u2019s Santaland each year, wait times could be quite long on the busiest days,\u201d said Susan Tercero, Macy\u2019s group vice president of branded entertainment, in an email. \u201cThe new reservation system is designed to minimize this by scheduling visitors to join the line at a time of their choice, allowing for the best possible holiday experience.\u201dAt some department stores and malls, scheduling your time with Santa also allows you to choose the race of your Santa.Candace Lai-Fang, who lives in Maryland, wanted her newborn son to take a photo with a black Santa, so she made a second trip after having him photographed with a white Santa.\u201cI saw on Facebook that a relative had taken her son to get Santa pictures, and her Santa was black,\u201d said Ms. Lai-Fang on Wednesday. \u201cI took my son that weekend to retake his pictures,\u201d she added.\u201cI had my picture taken with a black Santa as a child, and I wanted my son to do the same,\u201d said Ms. Lai-Fang, who traveled to the Prince Georges Mall, in Hyattsville, Md., with her 6-month-old son for the second photo.For most families, the visit is all about the photo, even if they have to schedule it beforehand.\u201cWhen you get the pictures every year it kind of touches your heart,\u201d Ms. Maldarelli said. \u201cThe picture says this is what Christmas is about,\u201d she added, her 9-year-old daughter looking on in a red and green plaid dress.\u201cIt\u2019s magical,\u201d Ms. Decesare said. \u201cChristmas time is magic, and this is going to keep happening, we are going to keep coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parents of 2 Homeless Girls Scalded to Death by Radiator File Suit", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is difficult, even now that a year has passed, for the parents of Ibanez and Scylee Vayoh not to dwell on their daughters\u2019 deaths.The parents have since filed a lawsuit charging that the city was negligent and failed to ensure safe conditions for families seeking shelter.The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in the Bronx in September but not previously reported, blames the city for poor oversight of the apartments that it used to house the homeless, known as cluster-site apartments, a system of thousands of units that Mr. de Blasio has criticized as being rife with problems and has vowed to shut down.The building on Hunts Point Avenue where the girls lived with their parents, Danielle McGuire and Pete Ambrose, is no longer used by the city to house homeless families, according to the Department of Homeless Services.The lawsuit, filed by Robert J. Mongeluzzi, a lawyer for Ms. McGuire and Mr. Ambrose, also names the owner of the building, Moshe Piller, and the social services agency that administered homeless apartments in that building under contract with the city, Bushwick Economic Development Corporation, as defendants.An amended complaint filed last month says that the girls \u201cdied horrific and agonizing deaths in their parents\u2019 arms, while their parents tried to save them.\u201dIt says that the couple \u201cwitnessed a scene that would torment any parents for the rest of their natural lives, finding their two loving and innocent daughters scalded, their bodies purple and skin peeling off while the two girls lay there barely holding onto their lives prior to succumbing to their injuries.\u201dThe lawsuit says that the parents now live in Greenbush, Me., a town near Bangor. They had previously lived in Houlton, Me., near the Canadian border.Wade McGuire, Ms. McGuire\u2019s father, said in a telephone interview that his daughter and her husband were \u201cstill taking it awful hard.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re thinking about having another kid but I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to become of it,\u201d adding that he still thinks about the girls every day.The court papers say that other tenants in the Bronx building had complained about problems with the radiators and that the city ignored warning signs and complaints about dangerous conditions in the building and at other cluster sites.Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Law Department, said that the city would respond to the complaint in court.On her Facebook page, Ms. McGuire wrote about attending a vigil for the girls in New York City last week, on the anniversary of their deaths: \u201cIts crazy its been a year since u girls were takin from us daddy n i miss u so much not a second goes by that u r not on our minds love u so so much ibanez and scylee-vayoh \u2026 thank u so much everyone for the beautiful vigil.\u201dTwo internet fund-raising drives created after the girls\u2019 deaths raised $25,556 for the couple, according to the pages on gofundme.com.Social media posts by Ms. McGuire and Mr. Ambrose also detailed the couple\u2019s struggles since the girls died.In March, the couple took a cross-country car trip through Virginia and North Carolina, across the South to Texas and on to California, a trip that Ms. McGuire said was spurred by their daughters\u2019 deaths.\u201cI cherish the time I had with those girls n I thank god everyday that he gave me them and I curse him everyday for takin them away!\u201d Ms. McGuire wrote on Facebook during the trip.\u201cMy husband and I are traveling around the United States with our guitars to raise money and start a nonprofit fund-raiser to change the shelters in Nyc and make them safe for families to live \u2026 I am going to sing my heart out and spread the story of how Nyc FAMILY shelter killed my baby girls,\u201d she wrote.It is not clear from the posts how much money they raised; Ms. McGuire, when reached by telephone, said she would follow the advice of her lawyers not to speak to reporters.Ms. McGuire also used Facebook to ask for help to pay for gas to drive to and from New York for the recent vigil and complained about not having a winter coat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Journalist Charged With Rioting at Inauguration Day Protest Goes Free", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis five fellow defendants \u2014 Michelle Macchio, Jennifer Armento, Christina Simmons, Oliver Harris and Brittne Lawson \u2014 were also found not guilty of all charges after a nearly four-week trial.\u201cAlexei was overwhelmed in court and doubled over crying,\u201d Brett E. Cohen, Mr. Wood\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview soon after the decision came in. \u201cIn these times of press persecution, I feel this is an important victory.\u201dProsecutors said the six defendants were among a group that cut a violent swath through 16 blocks of the city, smashing windows of businesses, tossing newspaper boxes into the street and damaging a car. Authorities tallied the damages at more than $100,000. The lawyers for the defendants had countered that their clients and most others in the group of about 500 were peacefully protesting, with only a handful becoming violent.Mr. Wood, 37, a freelance photographer and videographer based in San Antonio, was one of over 200 people arrested at the protest, which was organized by an activist group called Disrupt J20. Among those arrested were nine journalists. The government has dropped the charges against seven of those people. Mr. Wood and Aaron Cant\u00fa, a staff reporter at The Santa Fe Reporter in New Mexico who was working as a freelancer in January, were the only two journalists who faced charges. Mr. Cant\u00fa\u2019s trial is scheduled for October 2018.Mr. Wood had primarily worked as a commercial photographer but had been trying to build his portfolio as a photojournalist when he went to cover the J20 protest.Leading up to Inauguration Day, Mr. Wood sent emails to editors in San Antonio, including one to an editor at Rivard Report, a local news website. One email read, \u201cJust checking in. Got any assignments you want to throw at me?\u201d In another, Mr. Wood said he was interested in focusing on \u201cstreet friction, protest and support and police.\u201dThe Facebook video showed Mr. Wood documenting the protest as it turned violent, and into what the government classified as a riot. Mr. Wood can be seen taking photographs and is heard letting out cries of \u201cWhoo!\u201d as he documents protesters vandalizing property. He also identifies himself as a journalist and flashes a press pass.In their closing argument, Jennifer Kerkhoff and Rizwan Qureshi, the assistant United States attorneys, said that by attending the riot and wearing black, Mr. Wood and his fellow defendants were intent on destruction. Mr. Qureshi told the jury that Mr. Wood and the five others who stood trial \u201cagreed to destroy your city, and now they\u2019re hiding behind the First Amendment.\u201dAfter the verdict was announced, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the District of Columbia released a statement that said, in part, \u201cWe appreciate the jury\u2019s close examination of the individual conduct and intent of each defendant during this trial and respect its verdict.\u201dDuring the trial Mr. Cohen asserted that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Wood intended to recruit demonstrators with his live-stream. The video, which now has more than 4,300 views on Mr. Wood\u2019s Facebook page, did not reach many people when it was live. At points during the broadcast Mr. Wood said that only one or two people were tuned in.\u201cWhat we found most troubling was that the prosecutors argued the fact that Alexei filming meant he was supporting it and made him more complicit,\u201d said Alexandra Ellerbeck, the North America program coordinator for Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cI think those arguments didn\u2019t hold up and the jury very clearly saw through them.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re happy that this ordeal is finally over for Alexei Wood,\u201d Ms. Ellerbeck said. \u201cThe fact that this went to trial in the first place, where there was clearly nothing there, was already problematic.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of counts faced by a journalist, Alexei Wood, who was arrested while covering a protest of Donald J. Trump\u2019s inauguration. He faced seven counts, not five. The article also quoted incorrectly Brett E. Cohen, a lawyer for Alexei Wood. Mr. Cohen said, \u201cIn these times of press persecution, I feel this is an important victory,\u201d not \u201cin these times of press prosecution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Planned Obsolescence", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayEvery novel is a letter written to the future. The words we write often don\u2019t appear in print for a year, two years, even more \u2014 and by the time they appear, the world (which we are supposed to be reflecting) has changed. Increasingly, as history seems to speed up, novelists have to ask themselves hard questions about how they\u2019ll possibly keep pace.At the close of the last millennium, when the American literary establishment was focused on a particular kind of white domestic realism, much fiction aspired to timelessness. The stories took place in a suburb outside of history: the empty kitchen at 3 a.m.; the lawn just after the crickets stopped singing. Those were the only markers of chronology. Brand names were often effaced, because to allow them entry would be to taint the story not only with the market, but with mutability. These novels\u2019 meditations on family, on the inner lives of husbands and wives, were intended to burrow into truths beyond the chance meanderings of pop culture. The props were timeless: the table, the chairs, the telephone and a vague shape called \u201ca home.\u201d I recall a prominent short story writer of the time saying slyly that in her work, one would find no \u201cpersonal computers,\u201d by which she meant that her stories were not tied to the passing whims of cultural change.For those of us in M.F.A. programs at the time \u2014 a younger generation, with both the insights and the bone-headed insolence of young artists \u2014 this seemed ridiculous. \u201cPersonal computers\u201d needed no quotes \u2014 they had been around for all our adult lives \u2014 and we knew that we were already constituted by advertising, by brand names and bad jingles. A seminal literary moment for many of us occurred in Don DeLillo\u2019s 1985 novel, \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d when a father in a refugee camp leans over his sleeping daughter and hears her whisper \u201cwords that seemed to have a ritual meaning, part of a verbal spell or ecstatic chant.\u201dThey are \u201cToyota Celica.\u201dWe knew we were mired in a particular cultural and commercial moment.For much of the 20th century, it was possible to ignore historical period in a narrative partially because there were certain technological continuities, the \u201cpersonal computer\u201d aside. You could read about a phone, say, and know that you used it to call people. Its function was the same in a story from the \u201980s by Raymond Carver or from the \u201930s by Tess Slesinger. Sure, you might have to ignore that someone shouts an exchange into the mouthpiece or fingers a dial, or that it was connected to the wall by a wire. But for the most part, continuities concealed historical difference.Technological change is the stuff of the moment, but because of that, it always ages fast. In a book I wrote for teenagers in the mid-90s \u2014 a Jacobean revenge tragedy set in a McDonald\u2019s \u2014 I had, as a running gag, a wireless home phone that picked up the next-door neighbor\u2019s calls, a frequency problem that actually was real at the time. The novel is still for sale, and I often wonder what teenagers now make of that clunky detail, which seemed so topical. Now it just dates the book.The technological micromoment has become a constant pitfall for authors as our emotional life migrates to platforms with ever-changing protocols and social rites. Twitter\u2019s epigrammatic styles change rapidly; grammar itself is a meme there. Facebook\u2019s reaction buttons didn\u2019t, until recently, include anger or tears. You would squint at a friend\u2019s tragedy and wonder, \u201cDo I \u2018like\u2019 his cancer?\u201d Any modern novel of manners would have to deal with how we project ourselves online. We find out about breakups, deaths and marriages on these platforms \u2014 but if we write fiction about those incidents of virtual recognition, we know that by the time the book comes out, the reference and the platform will seem stale. A year after a book is released, it\u2019s a historical novel.If technological change has highlighted the fact that novels are always already embedded in history, the pace of politics does so in a far more threatening and profound way.To some extent, the vision of a timeless suburb removed from national politics was the luxury of a largely white, middle-class literary establishment that did not, in the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s, feel the bite of legislative decisions as keenly as other Americans. Toni Morrison\u2019s novels, written at the same time as the classics of white American Minimalism, include indicators of specific period, because it\u2019s important for the reader to know whether the characters might be whipped or lynched with juridical impunity. Reading her work, we need to mentally run through a legislative timeline of voting acts and equal rights amendments to understand the basic circumstances of her protagonists\u2019 lives.Now it is hard for anyone, white Americans included, to ignore the fact that national politics form the texture of our lives \u2014 now that, for example, tens of millions of us don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll have medical coverage next year. Our marriages, our homes, our health and our lives depend on the loony, whimsical fibs and tantrums of bad-tempered oligarchs.A few years ago, writing an early draft of a satirical speculative fiction novel, \u201cLandscape With Invisible Hand,\u201d I included a plotline that refracted my own struggle with what we now call a \u201cpre-existing condition.\u201d At the time, I actually worried that a focus on a character\u2019s desperate need for health insurance would be like my \u201990s cordless-phone gag \u2014 something that would, almost immediately, seem quaint and a little confusing. After all, as I wrote the first draft, the Affordable Care Act came into effect. Surely it would be perfected in the next few years and worries about paying for treatment would disappear. As it turned out, of course, I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. By chance, that strand of the book rings more true now than in 2014 when I began it.In many other nations \u2014 in China, in Russia, in Germany, say \u2014 it is taken for granted that if you know someone\u2019s age, you also know what he or she survived. You immediately take stock of what that person might have sacrificed and whom he might have betrayed. Americans, especially white Americans, largely felt themselves exempt from that kind of history. But we were never inviolate. Let\u2019s tell the stories of this moment now, and of the future, whether we\u2019re wrong about what will happen or right. Let\u2019s tell the stories of the changes we see.And know that our grandchildren will read them and learn what we survived, and what we sacrificed, and what we betrayed.M. T. Anderson is the National Book Award-winning author of \u201cFeed\u201d and \u201cSymphony for the City of the Dead.\u201d His latest novel is \u201cLandscape With Invisible Hand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Laptops in Class, Trump\u2019s Use of Twitter, Best 2017 Books and More: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationEvery week we use this feature to highlight students\u2019 well-informed and passionate opinions on current events and culture, but this edition, we think, features a particularly strong range of teenage thought._________Personally moving from middle school where there were no laptops to high school where everything we do depends on one was a huge transition. I\u2019ve noticed that I am so much more reliant on the laptop than anything else, in that short span of time I\u2019ve forgotten to spell, because I have relied on the computer to fix any mistake I might have made. I had google at my fingertips if I was unsure of a word. I didn\u2019t really need to know how to spell or not, because the computer would fix it for me. The things I learned in class don\u2019t fully stay in my mind, because I can type what they said word for word instead of rephrasing it into my own words when I write with pen and paper to make it more understandable to me. Laptops also cause so many distractions, because you have an abundance of things you could do instead of what you\u2019re supposed to be doing.When I take notes I tend to \u201cprocess and condense\u201d as that is much faster than writing word for word. It also forces you to process the information that you were just told and then summarize it. When I took notes on a laptop for a college course I took this semester at my high school I found that my notes were excessive and many things I wrote down were unnecessary. The students in the image definitely are making the same mistake that I did. They simply write down everything that the professor says, they don\u2019t think about it.I would tend to agree with Ms. Dynarski, laptops and tablets should be banned in classrooms. The best way to do that would probably be to force students to bring a notebook to class and maybe just have an area where they can temporarily store their device. If I were an educator I would definitely ban electronics in classrooms, I\u2019ve rarely if ever seen them put to good use.I believe that it should be up to the teacher or professor whether or not laptops should be used by students in class... While I believe that laptops are an amazing tool for the classroom, some students abuse this tool. They will use the laptops for games or social media and it can really affect how they perform in the class. I believe that the best solution to this issue is to have stricter punishments for those who mess around while using a laptop.I feel like if I had a laptop in my hands while my teacher is doing a lecture, I would not be as focused on the content and I would become easily distracted by the electronic. If I was sitting in class while taking notes on a laptop, how would the teacher be able to know if I am focused on the content they are teaching. The screen is faced toward me and I can get away with a lot more things.Students spend more time checking the emails, Facebook, snap-chat, and email because of all this they lose focus. By the time they look at the teacher, they are already lost.I would rather take notes with pen and paper. I think I take in the information better when I\u2019m writing than when I\u2019m typing. I also prefer pen and pencil because I can draw little pictures and other things to help me remember what I\u2019m writhing about. Also when I\u2019m trying to type fast, I usually make a lot of typos, which distract me and make me want to go back and fix the mistake. Then I\u2019d end up missing something important.I have a love-hate relationship with using computers to take notes. Though I am just in high school and have not been exposed to having to take as much notes as I will in college, I think that computers can help and hurt. I am a person dedicated to getting good grades. This means that when I am listening to a lecture I try to take in and record as much as I can. I tend to get overwhelmed with information and I am always scared I\u2019m going to miss something. Computers really help with this. They allow a person to write a lot faster and to have more notes to study later.However, I\u2019ve found that when I write things down, I remember them better. I hope to develop my skills of note taking so that I can take notes by hand but have the notes be condensed and make sense.I\u2019m a grad student who teaches playwriting, and I ban electronics in my classroom, partly because I need to practice spending focused time away from my screens. I tell my students that learning to be bored is a vital part of learning to write.I\u2019m an old professor. I was stunned the first time a student corrected me in class. He had checked something (on the Internet) that I\u2019d said and found it wanting. At first I was embarrassed, but when I reflected on it, I felt joy. Think about it: That student was actively engaged in truth-seeking! He cared about the subject and took personal, intellectual action. This is a very good thing.Students are not all alike, and people learn differently. Some would do best to stow their gadgets and just sit and soak it all in. Others should get real active with their laptop while the teacher is \u201cteaching.\u201d (Some people are not able to focus effectively if they are not doing something with their hands.)Teachers must: 1) get a thicker skin and not take it personally when students message with friends in class; 2) entertain a real discussion at the beginning of the course and negotiate agreements about gadgets \u2014 then remind students later about the agreements as appropriate \u2014 and 3) take on the challenge of making your classroom more interesting than Facebook. It can be done. But, you can\u2019t just stand up in front of class and talk and expect everyone to obediently soak in your wisdom. They can do that by watching a video in their bunny slippers in the dorm at midnight. You have to make the most of the situation \u2014 where you are present with them for an hour or two \u2014 to create something special and valuable._________If the world was ending, I would find a way to tell all those I care about how I really feel inside. I would stop hiding things or pushing things away because I don\u2019t want to deal with them. If the world was ending, I would cleanse my life of everything. I would lay everything on the table. Nothing would be left unsaid. I wouldn\u2019t travel the world or buy something expensive, I would stay where I was at the time. I would do everything as I usually do however I would actually appreciate it all for the first time.I would appreciate every teacher that gave me homework, that taught me about math or science. I would thank the lunch ladies for making me food everyday. I would thank the janitors for being so kind and keeping the school clean. I would thank my friends, the adiministrators, I would thank everyone because they all deserve it. I would tell the people I love that I love them and I would continue to say it just like I have everyday. I would stop holding all my grudges and finally let them go. I would spend every second with my pets and make sure that they know I truly care about them with all my heart even if I don\u2019t pet them every second or play with them when they want. I would write a letter. I would write down my last words to the universe, to the world, to myself. I would thank myself, say goodbye to myself, appreciate myself (for the first time) and then I would seal the letter and reflect. I would reflect on myself and find a way to be okay with ending this life.The world has given so much to me, and yet I feel as though I have experienced too little. The world has created so many opportunities and relationships for me. Therefore I would not be able to decide for what I wanted to say with my last words. I guess if I were to say something it would be \u201cI love you\u201d with no other context. There are so many things and people I am thankful for and I love the world for that. I love the people in my life. I love the opportunities and memories I have created. I would not say anything else but \u201cI love you\u201d and leave it to the reader to figure out what I was talking about.If the world was ending, I would say I am sorry. I would apologize for all of the nights I skipped with my parents to go out with my friends. I would apologize to my sister for not being as good of a role model as I should be. I would apologize to my friends for lying about why I do not want to hang out with them. I would also be honest. About everything. I would tell my crush that I liked him, and tell my friends that I am glad that I met them.I know it sounds cheesy, but if I found out the world was ending, the absolute first thing I would do is tell my mom, \u201cI love you.\u201d Here is the women who has sacrificed everything for me; her job, her social life, her freedom, her dreams. I know I don\u2019t say it enough or act like it, and it pains me to think about it, but I really do love my mom. She is my care giver, my therapist, my teacher, and most importantly, my best friend. I wouldn\u2019t want the world to end without my mom knowing how much she was appreciated and loved during her life on Earth. She would do anything for me so I would make sure I give her she the recognition she deserves before its too late.I would like to believe that my last words would be empowering and emotive. But I fear they would be just the opposite. My last words would be of regret and mourning for the things I could have seen and done. The ending of earth and it\u2019s entirety of the life it holds would mean that there would be no one to remember your last words, save for yourself and your loved ones as they lay with their last few breaths. This would mean that my last words wouldn\u2019t need to be anything big or metaphorical in any way. This could simply mean that I tell my friends and family that I love them one last time or that they meant a tremendous amount to me.Ideally, we would all like our last words before the world ended to be amazing and beautiful and enlightening, like in the movies, but frankly, I don\u2019t see a greater point to wanting anything more than a goodbye. I wouldn\u2019t want my last words to be anything more than a simple resolution of my life.THE END IS NEAR! THE END IS NEAR! No, actually, I would probably say one last goodbye to my friends and family, tell my crush how I really feel, tell my parents and siblings I love them, give my dog a final belly rub, etc. It would actually be very sad :\u2019(_________As President of the United States of America, Trump\u2019s use of the internet specifically Twitter is unjustified and completely inappropriate for someone in his level of power. Over the past few days, Trump has made many posts on Twitter degrading Muslims and videos of them doing bad things. What I don\u2019t understand about this is why Trump would do this. He made it clear in his presidential campaign that he didn\u2019t like Muslims but now that he actually is president, these actions are horrible for a man of his position.America is the land of the free, Right? If Muslims want to be in this country but get racially demoralized by some people up to the level of the POTUS, it truly questions whether or not America is truly the land of the free.One of the racist videos that he put out was \u201cMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!\u201d the fact that he would even think of posting this is absolutely absurd and questionable. What\u2019s odd though is that the Dutch Embassy came out and said that this video is unauthentic. So now our President is a racist and he spreads fake news. I would expect this behavior from someone like a white supremacist, not a POTUS.It is my firm belief that a president should not be allowed to use social media - not in the way President Trump is utilising the platform, at least. For centuries past it has been, and will continue to be, the duty and responsibility of the President to keep the states in the Union aligned with one another, and respected on an international level. Thus far in his term, Trump has fulfilled neither of his principle duties. By having the ability to post whatever he wants Mr. Trump is in fact \u201ccircumventing the press\u201d, but when this ability is used to slander a religion that accounts for approximately one fifth of the entire globe, he begins to cross a line.This line is the line commonly referred to as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, and while many of his supporters applaud his use of social media to \u201cspeak his mind\u201d, I maintain that the English language aligned itself accordingly when it labelled the way a politician should act as \u201cpolitically correct\u201d. There is a reason that the word \u201ccorrect\u201d is included in this clever titling (thanks, English). A politician cannot simply disregard this principle, as it encompasses all that constitutes diplomacy, leadership, even basic credibility, and respect. Through his use of Twitter specifically, Trump is abolishing - or at least decomposing - many diplomatic ties, pitting the union against itself in a love-hate relationship, and is slandering his own credibility by making unsupported or unjust accusations against people and societies alike.I really think that Donald Trump is a cyberbully in charge. Since when do Presidents tweet about everything and everything regarding PEOPLE nonetheless. It would be understandable if the President would post things about participating in Community Service, or visiting third world countries or even thanking people for their contributions to society. But there is an outlier for everything, and Donald Trump is that outlier. According to the article, there were directed racially targeted tweets.When in America has it become okay for the President of the United States to openly insult another race? When in America has it become okay for the President to insult women, minorities, and people in general over social media? Or even display acts of domestic violence over social media? The current President of the United States is a child with a tablet. Unaware of the social cues and correctness and even common sense shared by society. But to make matters worse, he\u2019s a grown man and the leader of a once great nation. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d but how are your actions contributing to your statement? Your base of your campaign? Why share these videos of people committing crimes and place a label on them? For a president to make those types of statements about a group of people and claim to be \u201c more presidential than any president that\u2019s ever held this office\u201d is absurd.Obviously, social media must be used since it is most of the time the main source of communication in today\u2019s society. But that does not mean that the President should use it like a teenage girl tweeting in a fight.The President is suppose to be held to a higher standard than the average citizen. Therefore, he should only be using his Twitter to inform people politely rather than bashing other people or parties. Since his tweets have been so controversial the people in the head of his administration should have taken his twitter away from him during the election. Also, the President is someone who is a role model for so many people.Imagine all of the middle and high schoolers who are observing his tweets and think it is okay to subtweet mean things about other people. Not to mention that the First Lady\u2019s community service foundation for Melania Trump is cyberbullying, which is extremely ironic. How is she suppose to teach children that being mean through social media is not okay when the leader of our country does it constantly? Another issue with it is the fact that it is incrediably unprofessional when relating to foreign countries and deals. It simply makes America look worse than it already must look to other countries.I don\u2019t like that the leader of a global superpower uses Twitter to attack other leaders, dissenters, and make announcements of major policies. It\u2019s ridiculous that our leader, at 3 AM, tweets about alleged \u201cfake news\u201d....he does not seem to realize that his words have consequences, and that most of the time his ridiculous tweets only degrades America\u2019s status as a superpower. It is quite inflammatory and reckless, and it does allow transparency, but the effects it has are much more negative. For example, Libya is now using Trump\u2019s claims about \u201cfake news\u201d from CNN to dodge confrontation about a literal slavery crisis in Libya. The fact that his tweets are being cited as \u201cfacts\u201d from other nations and used to demote us creates a real negative impact on America\u2019s reputation.I do feel like President Trump can use the Twitter platform for good, but when he uses it to post racially charged videos like the one on Wednesday that was anti-muslim, it becomes a problem. All this post is doing is putting fear and hatred into the hearts of muslim citizens. Instead of being a truth teller like some believe, he is being counterproductive and dividing our nation even further.I do feel like President Trump is too reckless with his tweets, but he also tweets things that keep the US informed on certain things like some of his plans and ideas. An example of this is a tweet from him in Janurary, \u201cBusy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America,\u201d Tweets like this can keep American citizens in the light about what trump has been doing through his presidency. Twitter can also be a great platform for Trump to interact with the press. According to Sean Spicer, Trumps press secretary, Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions. In my opinion, Trump should be able to use Twitter to his advantage, but he should have someone moderating his tweets so any anti-muslim or inflammatory tweets won\u2019t be posted.I agree that many of his tweets contain useful information like you have mentioned, and also that some tweets he posts just create fear and hatred, and that sort of thing should never be posted by anyone, much less by the President. I definitely feel like it is a big problem and perhaps your idea of tweet-moderation could help with that issue.The Tweets are the only place Trump does not lie and show how much we need to see what he really thinks. What he thinks is what he he believes is absolute fact.I think that Trump\u2019s tweets are a good thing, it is the only way that Trump can give his own public opinion to America that is uncontrollable by the media. If the news knew what Trump would say they would not let him on the air. This way he can express the concerns that he has and tell us what he thinks. This is my own personal opinion._________I\u2019ve read a variety of books throughout 2017, but \u201cCarry On\u201d by Rainbow Rowell stands out not only as my favorite from this year, but of all time. The book is everything I want to be as a person; clever, funny, sweet, and interesting. The characters worm their way into your heart and soul, and yet manage to be believable. Each one flips a character stereotype on its head in a beautiful way. The \u201cchosen one\u201d of the story is horrible at magic, the \u201cevil British vampire guy\u201d is sweet and in love, the \u201csmart female best friend\u201d actually has flaws (wow!) and the \u201cbeautiful girlfriend of the main character\u201d is, in my opinion, vile. Despite my opinion, she is extremely realistic.Reading it in one seven and a half hour sitting during the summer was not my best decision. If I had known that it was a work of pure genius, I would have savored the book, tasted it like a five course meal, and finished it with a content sigh. Instead, I stayed up until 1:26 am and wasn\u2019t able to think about the book without internally shrieking for another week, but there are worse things, I suppose. There are worse things than falling in love with a book.Looking into 2018, I\u2019m looking forward to reading any new book by Rainbow Rowell, having read all of her past ones and loving each one of them. And while a part of my heart will forever remain tucked into the off-white pages of \u201cCarry On,\u201d I will keep my soul open, ready and waiting for a different book to sweep me off into a newer, brighter world.My favourite book of 2017 is The Silver Mask by Holly Black and Cassandra Clare. I like this book because the previous books that came out lead up to this part of the story and the wait made so much more fun to read. The book before this one ended with the death of the main protagonist\u2019s friend.I\u2019m not really someone who typically reads non-fiction book for fun, but the second half of the title, \u201cUnderdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants\u201d really appealed to me. The first chapter gave a summary of the famous biblical story, David and Goliath. Then Gladwell proceeded to analyze the story and explain to the readers why certain things happened and why people should have expected them to happen. The rest of the book was filled with relating real life stories, some of success and some of failure to all relating to his early analyses. He captured the audience by giving information many people didn\u2019t know about some historical events, college statistics and advances in medicine. Every single chapter was captivating and made me reconsider my outlook on life.It\u2019s almost redundant to say that Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 We Were Eight Years in Power is must read 2017 material. Redundant for Coates\u2019 weight as cultural commentator and author of 2015 required reading Between the World and Me. Redundant for the essays\u2019 relevance to our current nationally-held breath between lungfuls of Obama and Trump. Through a collection of his commentary from the Obama years, Coates recounts his own racial awakening in humble, intimate, and direct fashion. In a country where any conversation about race can become electric, Coates dismantles and dissects \u201cracial justice\u201d without justification or apology. I suspect that a book like this\u2014 a hot potato, a splash of cold water, a lightening rod, a call to \u201cwokeness\u201d\u2014 will become an important sign post from this era, a future time capsule that you don\u2019t have to wait to open and learn from.My favorite book of 2017 is \u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d by Jenny Han. This is the final book in the popular trilogy of \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d, a young adult fiction series. \u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d captures the essence of modern teen romance and pleases its readers with beloved characters, like Kitty Covey (Lara Jean\u2019s quick-witted little sister), and humorous conversations. The dreamy and kind-hearted Lara Jean, our protagonist, returns with bigger issues than her previous \u201clove letter fiasco\u201d. . What I admire the most is how she matured but never stopped viewing the world through rose-colored glasses. Han incorporates flowery language and allusions to 80s movies in the text to assure readers that Lara Jean is still the sweet and girly individual who loves to bake treats and daydream.\u201cAlways and Forever, Lara Jean\u201d is the perfect ending to a great series.My favorite book of the year was \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\u201d It\u2019s part thriller, part social history, part whodunit. That the whole thing was true made it ever more compelling. Just a great, great read. Who knew that an American Indian tribe struck it rich on land that had been foisted on them, and then paid for it with their lives when white people (of course) got greedy. Yet there are also white folks in the book who were ethical and helped solve the crime. Ultimately, I felt like the book was a snapshot of the best and worst of people._________Most said that the men should be punished for their misdeeds, but agreed that their artwork could still be appreciated in spite of the reprehensible actions.I am a firm believer that art and artist should very clearly be separated. In Kevin Spacey\u2019s case, I agree he should be punished for everything he\u2019s done. That being said, I wholeheartedly believe everyone of these artist\u2019s work should remain in the same context as when they were published. I think if we can separate the idea of what the disgusting people have done with the art they have created it is possible to both enjoy the artistry and condemn their wrongdoings.The things that these men have done is horrendous, but their work should not suffer because of it. In the article I strongly agree with Camille Paglia when she says that art should be beyond the scope of punishment. Now, art does not always have to be separated from the artist, but in cases like this, with all of the TV favorites, it is okay to separate the artist from the work they created. When I watch a TV show I don\u2019t think, \u2018Wow the director/producer of this show is an amazing person\u201d. Peoples\u2019 actions are not always reflected in their art, and therefore their art cannot be held accountable.There will be a loss in the industry of talent, but men like Louis C.K., Nate Parker, and Kevin Spacey are being held accountable for their actions, and it is becoming understood that this behavior will no longer be tolerated. Since the #MeToo movement began, women have started to find their voice, and are able to speak out. Punishments for these men should not be individual because it allows for a possible bias based on their TV show. Overall, this inappropriate behavior of some men is not acceptable, and they should be held accountable for their actions, but their art should not have to suffer too.House of Cards is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, it\u2019s was intriguing, dark, and really connected with the viewer. Kevin Spacey played a pivotal role in that, his acting on screen, the way he gave power to the words he said in his personal speeches. They made me question his sanity and how far he would go for power. The character was psychotic, manipulative, dishonest, and had very murderous tendencies. In real life, Frank Underwood would\u2019ve been akin to a mix of Charles Manson and Richard Nixon gifted with the mind of Machiavelli. He was terrifying because he represented what one man could do if he played the system right. He was my favorite character and he made Kevin Spacey one of my favorite actors. So the first thought I had when Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct was What\u2019s going to happen to House of Cards?I still feel guilty when I remember that however good that show is it can\u2019t compare what the alleged victims might be going through. Yes, if the accusations should prove true, Spacey should be punished but one must also realize that punishing Spacey also, regrettably, punishes the producers, directors, and other actors of the show. Regardless of Spacey himself, the show has been someone\u2019s vision for years and suddenly a lifework is destroyed. The only solution left if Spacey actually did the deed is continuing the show without him and give support to all the victims.The censorship of an artwork based on the creator is as silly to me as wasting technological advances created by less-than-morally-just men in the past because of their actions. While it might make you feel better, we\u2019d be nowhere if we lived like that. Just like technology, art forms are always changing, advancing, and being redefined.With the acting industry in mind, I don\u2019t agree with Byers\u2019 statement that talent is being lost due to many men being punished for misconduct recently. Why? Because behind all the big names, there\u2019s so much untapped potential. It\u2019s less like a \u201cdrain of talent\u201d and more like a talent circulation. The circulation of new talent keeps art evolving, creators die and some kill their careers before old age has to. Spacey being a prime example.Men in Hollywood and even New York use their riches and power to get away with sexual assault. In recent months following accusations against Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K., Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer, Anthony Weiner, Tyler Grasham, Bill O\u2019Reilly, James Toback, Ben Affleck, Chris Savino, Roy Price, Mark Halperin, Michael Oreskes, Lockhart Steele, John Lasseter, Al Franken, Eddie Berganza, Andrew Kreisberg, Jeffrey Tambor, Ed Westwick, Brett Ratner, Andy Dick, and many more men have lost their or resigned from their high power positions. While not all of these men are artists or have lost their jobs it has set a precedent about sexual assault. While writing this I learned of more men I had not known of before, and learned more about men I had know of.After learning of allegations against any men watching or listening to or reading about something they have created I feel uncomfortable with their work. To enjoy something created by someone who has abused and harassed women to get to his position of power is disturbing. As much as I would love to watch the television shows and movies created by these men for their art and not the artist I simply can not enjoy it knowing that the men who made abused and harassed the women in their workplaces. If we continue to associate these men with sexual assault, when we watch the art produced by them it becomes very hard to forget their inexcusable actions.To be honest, to me, it seems like a trivial and thoughtless concern to be worrying whether your favorite TV show will continue despite allegations against the producer. Judd Apatow, a producer and director quoted in the article, calls this a \u201cselfish instinct,\u201d and I wholeheartedly agree. There are far more important things in this world, such as reshaping our society to make all work fields safe from sexual harassment and prejudice, for one.I think firing these predators is a completely appropriate response and they do not deserve \u201credemption\u201d or a \u201crebound,\u201d mentioned by Ben Travers in the article, who queried if these people would be seen again in their sphere. But I think that there should be a finer line for the art that is created, and removing their creations should be up to the networks that circulate them. We do have the ability to look at things objectively, and appreciate genius impartially. Such as the fascination with psychopaths or serial killers; although psychologists may not condone how they make their name, their intelligence is an intriguing focus of study. Furthermore, I do believe that this flushout of predators from the arts industries does open up new doors for those swept under the rug by said domineering predators, as Mr. Travers says._________Yes, I want to go to the same college, as well as make some of the same decisions my parents make like religion, schooling, and even job. I to develop some of the same personality traits like kindness, patience, and humor. My parents are really wonderful and I want to follow in their footsteps.I think i might want to follow in the footsteps of my mom. She works with people of all ages who have disabilities. I love helping people and making their lives easier. I would not want to work and manage a hospital like my dad, but my sister does; she wants to be a surgeon.I think I already have fallen in the footsteps of my dad. My dad has been doing concrete his whole life and has owner his own business the past five years. I have worked with him the past four years and already know had to do many things on the job. I think I am very likely to take over my dads business when he retires.Concrete work will always be a demand and I already know the skill so I am very likely to pour concrete when I\u2019m older. Out of everyone in my family I think I take after my dad because I\u2019ve looked up to him for as long as I can remember and we like the same hobbies.When my parents first entered the work field, they searched for a job with the sole purposes of financial stability. They were more concerned with raising a family, rather than fulfilling their own goals or pursuing individual interests. My parents have positions as supervisors in manufacturing departments at companies that they have remained loyal to. I don\u2019t believe that I will ever pick up the exact same occupations that they have due to my different values and interests, which I have acquired outside of the household.Cain Miller\u2019s research on the relationship between parents and their children\u2019s occupation is very interesting. He says that boys are 2.7 times more likely to have the same occupation as their father than the rest of the population is. Perhaps kids take the occupation of their parents because they are pleased with the amount of income they bring in. However, I believe it has a lot more to do with their upbringing than economic reasons.Children often grow up to have similar interests with their parents because they spend so much time together and develop similar ways of thinking. It reasonably makes sense that children would have similar character traits because of this, and thus be suited for a similar job as their parents. But, some kids who have poor relationships with their parents would be unlikely to want a life like they had. Therefore, they will be more likely to choose a more unique job to avoid becoming like their parents.My mother is a teacher, which is a fine job. However, I do not like to explain how to do things. I am a very hands on learner, and I would want a job that allows me to use my strengths. In this way, I am different than my parents.I want to touch as many lives as I possibly can, and this desire could have sprung from growing up with a father that was constantly helping people. I don\u2019t like to think of my future as a statistic: \u201cYou\u2019re four times as likely to follow in your parents footsteps\u201d. To me that just makes me want to do exactly the opposite. I don\u2019t want my future to be predetermined from an online calculator, but in reality my father\u2019s previous jobs have definatley had an impact on what I want to do with my life.I personally don\u2019t want to end up like either of my parents. I don\u2019t want to be like my grandparents, my cousins, my aunts, or my uncles, either. It\u2019s nothing against them, but they\u2019re not who I want to be.I always wanted to be like Hikaru Sulu from Star Trek, and have, for years, modeled my life in a way that would facilitate me to study to go to the stars, to pilot spacecrafts, and to grow plants in space. I saw Sulu as a role model, someone I wanted to become, and made myself in his image.Let\u2019s get one thing straight: I am a people person. I always have been, and I always will be. This though, does not mean that I will follow in my mother\u2019s footsteps as a realtor, or my father\u2019s in public relations. My comforts do not always correspond to my interests....By being exposed to both of my parent\u2019s careers, I know that I do not want to find myself in a field where my pay is based on commission or success. Exposure, in the news, politics, and social issues, is the basis for all opinion, and I believe that the same goes for family life and values. As an individual, I believe that I want to be in a place where I am happy, not in a place where I would want to \u201ccarry on the family business\u201d, no matter how likely it may be. I am ME, so why not choose another path?My desire to enter into this field was not fueled by family conversations. My mom does not (and can\u2019t) gush about her patients over dinner. My dad\u2019s job in the produce industry never thrilled me. Look, I love potatoes, but inspecting them as my job? No thanks. My desire to enter this field was fueled by my own passions - hippotherapy, kids, and teaching. My desire to enter this field was inspired by my mom\u2019s 3-11pm shifts in the ER, where she drank cups of bitter hospital coffee (did I mention I inherited her love of coffee? I was practically drinking it straight out of the womb) and worried about raising us in between administering IV fluids and antibiotics._________Sometimes bad things happen to good people. That\u2019s what my mother told me as a young child, when my father died, and now that\u2019s what I tell myself as I see the crashing waves and the plume of darkness swallowing the sky whole. Maybe I should be afraid, maybe I should scream for help, or maybe keeping calm is what I should do. But when do we ever do what\u2019s best for us. I run from the swampy shoreline, through the tall grasses and short shrubs, towards the village I\u2019ve called home my whole life. Maybe it\u2019s the first rubble that comes with results, I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s where it hits me. Soon the dusty sand hits my knees as I start to weep, even if I do live everything will be gone, and that\u2019s why instead of running in fear, I sit and wait for my fate.A boy was out fishing with his father when he heard the sirens roar, screaming at the top of its lungs. They had no motor, just paddles and an anchor, they paddled as fast as they could. Wondering how long they had till it would blow, a cloud of smoke so great it would smother them less than 30 seconds.They continued paddling, slowly, very very slowly. It took them 45 minutes to eventually reach the shore, but when they did they ran as fast as they could back to the house to get into the car to evacuate. They left the boat with no anchor, with the fish rotting, so they could get out alive. They did get out and haven\u2019t been back since the eruption, but hope to come back soon.Slowly, the empty boat drifted ashore, ash settling from the dull, grey sky. The slowly calming breeze started to coat the soft blue interior with dust. The oars were long gone, probably drifting out beside the volcanic isle that had caused all of this. The earth still rumbled softly, the bright green flora burnt and brown. Mother nature was a harsh woman, uncaring and merciless, but she could stop the waters from settling. Beneath them rested life as it slowly lost it\u2019s breath, squirming and struggling to pull itself from the murky depths. Bubbles, though meters apart, rose to the surface, signalling the end of an era._________Although there are plenty of charities, the best ones I think are nonreligious, and non-judgment based. My also favorite charities are foreign orphanages, as many foreign orphanages are lacking the qualities like heating, electricity, and other necessities. My favorite place to donate, is usually Russian orphanages, as I have very high regards for them. I sent about $200 to a Russian orphanage, and in return, they built showers for the many kids, and staff living in the facility.Part 1: I went to a private Catholic school for nine years. During those nine years they had many opportunities to give donations to charities and the poverty-stricken people of our community. Every Friday first thing in the morning the whole school would go to Mass. Everytime we each brought one or two canned goods which we put in a basket when we first walk in. It was amazing because everyone would bring in something to donate every Friday and it was so cool to the the basketball overflowing with canned goods and other foods. It makes a big difference to them because they don\u2019t have to worry about food that day and it just makes them feel better and that impacts their life.There are many charities that have gained importance after all of the trageties that happened this year. Many celebraties and famous people who have donated thousands of dollars to relief organizations, but the average American does not have that much money. A lot of people, in my experience, have felt hopeless in these situations since they knew the how badly people were affected but they couldn\u2019t donate money. They didn\u2019t realize that spreading the word is just as important as donating. Throughout all the disasters, I shared organizations so that people who were able to donate could. I shared organizations that I particularlly supported, including Hurricane Harvey aminal relief.I volunteer as frequently as I can. It is usually at a school for people with special needs. This is my favorite place to donate my time to. Working here has even developed my passion to want to become a special education teacher. I get to help these students feel like they belong.The students that I work with are very low functioning. Many of the students can\u2019t walk, speak, or even eat on their own. Every student sits in a wheelchair for the majority of their day. I am fortunate enough to be able to walk around and eat on my own and even hold a conversation with other people. Walking into the classrooms and knowing that I was able to make these kids happier is a really good feeling. I_________Advertisement"}

Make Goug\u00e8res", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteCaviar and truffles are all well and good, but nothing says \u201cI\u2019m pampering my guests\u201d quite like a tray of hot, crisp goug\u00e8res straight from the oven.It isn\u2019t because these French cheese puffs are expensive to make. They\u2019re not. A humble mix of grated cheese, butter and flour, they\u2019re among the thriftiest tidbits on the hors d\u2019oeuvres circuit. Nor are they difficult \u2014 though if you don\u2019t have an electric mixer, some muscle will be required to beat the eggs into the stiff batter.But there\u2019s a certain amount of planning needed both in terms of timing and oven space to serve them while they\u2019re still piping hot \u2014 or at least still very warm. That\u2019s when their buttery, cheesy charm is at its most pronounced. Putting this kind of planning into action amid the swirling chaotic bustle of the average holiday cocktail party (at least, my average holiday cocktail party) is what I mean by pampering, albeit in an understated way.The upside of serving goug\u00e8res at a party is that you can make them ahead and freeze them before baking. Then, as your guests are unwrapping themselves from scarves and hats and winter coats, simply pop them, frozen, into the oven. By the time the drinks are poured, you\u2019ll be able to pass around a steaming tray for immediate nibbling.If you can work fast or find a helper, you can fill your goug\u00e8res with all kinds of tasty mixes. Slice them open while they\u2019re still hot enough to burn your fingers, and spoon or pipe in the likes of smoked fish mousse, pimento cheese, dollops of chicken, or lobster salad. Or try filling them with a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche topped by an even larger one of caviar \u2014 and pamper your guests to the extreme.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lamb Shanks Show Off Their Inner Beauty", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteBraising isn\u2019t pretty, or at least it usually doesn\u2019t start out that way. The tougher, bonier and generally less appealing the cut, the better it will braise. When braising, go ugly.Lamb shanks are a prime example. Sinewy, muscled and stippled with cartilage, the shanks need hours of slow and gentle cooking for the meat to soften enough to slip off the bone. But once the cooking is done, the payoff is big: The rich and brawny succulence is matched by few other meats.Part of what makes lamb shanks so flavorful is the marrow deep in the bones. As the shanks cook, the marrow liquefies, adding the concentrated essence of the lamb to the sauce. This means that when you\u2019re cooking meat on the bones, you don\u2019t necessarily have to add stock when liquid is needed. The bones have enough flavor on their own.When shopping for lamb shanks, ask your butcher for the biggest ones in the meat case. The bigger the shank, the higher the meat-to-bone ratio. Plus, large bone-in shanks make for a dramatic Flintstones-style presentation at the table. Or, if you\u2019re not feeling like flaunting your inner cave dweller, you can pull the meat off the bones before your guests arrive so they won\u2019t have to. Just make sure to moisten the meat with plenty of sauce, which is the best part.You can braise lamb shanks in any liquid, though something with acidity will help cut their richness. Wine is classic. Here, I use white wine combined with a profusion of fresh herbs, which melt into the pot, adding fragrance and body.Like most braised meats, the lamb can be cooked a few days ahead; it gets better when the flavors are given a chance to meld. Just reheat it on the stove or in a 350-degree oven, kept covered to keep the meat at its juiciest. You may have to add some liquid as you reheat.Then serve it with something pliant to soak up the sauce. Rice pilaf, a mound of polenta or even a torn-up loaf of crusty bread will suffice; this braised lamb has enough personality for the whole plate.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Patch of Bamboo Creates New Legal Thicket for Connecticut City", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW LONDON, Conn. \u2014 The jungle rises at the end of the block, past a few narrow clapboard houses, where an old station wagon is parked on the road. What neighbors said was once a small patch of bamboo has swelled over the years into a thicket, reaching above the utility lines, pushing to the edge of the property and nearly swallowing a white house on Borodell Place, with only a sliver left poking out.Neighbors have noticed visitors creeping toward the end of the dead end street to glimpse the bamboo, and on a local Facebook page one person suggested bringing in a panda, which could \u201cclear it right up.\u201dThe City of New London has declared the overgrowth of bamboo a blight. But officials said the resident, Carlos Carrion, has failed to pay fines and has ignored orders to cut back the plant. Now, he has become one of the first to be criminally charged under the city\u2019s expanded blight ordinance.It\u2019s not the first time New London, a working-class city on the Connecticut coast, has been embroiled in a dispute like this. The city became known across the country for an intense fight over a decade ago between government officials and a homeowner who refused to yield her property to make way for a waterfront development. The case reached the Supreme Court in Washington and led to a landmark decision on eminent domain.This time the case is smaller, the stakes seemingly lower, but it has led to yet another attention-grabbing showdown between local officials and a resident resisting their demands.Mr. Carrion maintains that the city\u2019s interest in his property is politically motivated, coming as retaliation for his outspokenness. At a public hearing related to a separate blight case, involving a different homeowner, he called the case against him a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He said the bamboo was a gift from a friend, a Vietnam War veteran, and he keeps it as a tribute to him. He eats the bamboo, he said, and uses it to construct furniture. It is also, in his view, a rebellion against \u201cperfect square lawns.\u201dIn New London, a port city of 27,000 people bordered by the Thames River and Long Island Sound, residents have become accustomed to a roller coaster looping through episodes of colorful municipal politics and flashes of optimism for a revival before returning to chronic economic distress.Mr. Carrion\u2019s case has stretched for nearly a year, beginning when he was cited in January after the city\u2019s blight officer received a complaint from the mayor\u2019s office, officials said. He was found to have violated an ordinance that limits the growth of plants, except for shrubs, bushes and other cultivated plants, to 10 inches, said Kenyon Haye, New London\u2019s blight inspector. When Mr. Carrion did not take sufficient action after 60 days, Mr. Haye said, the city pursued the case again as a criminal violation. He was charged in State Superior Court in August, and he has pleaded not guilty.\u201cWe couldn\u2019t ignore the situation because the neighbors have had enough of it,\u201d Michael Passero, the mayor of New London, said. \u201cThe neighbors have been reaching out to me for two or three years.\u201dConnecticut allows violations of zoning and building ordinances to be considered criminal offenses, with punishment including fines of up to $250 a day. But Sara Bronin, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said that local governments often rely on other measures, like placing liens on property, as a way to encourage a property owner to act or allow the city to make needed alterations and then recoup the expense. \u201cThat\u2019s more common these days than the blunt instrument of criminal proceedings,\u201d she said.A variety of the plant known as running bamboo can spread by as much as five feet a year and can grow just as much in height. Some forms of bamboo are regarded as invasive plants in several states, including New York, where selling, transporting or planting them has been barred. Running bamboo is not considered an invasive species in Connecticut, though there are limits on where it can be planted and plant sellers are required to warn buyers that it is a fast-growing plant that needs to be contained.Mr. Carrion, who declined through his lawyer to comment, has said that the bamboo on his property is of the \u201cclumping\u201d variety, which grows much slower and is considered easier to maintain. He also said that he keeps the plant from crossing from his property.He contends that the case is essentially political, driven by the mayor, and he has hired a former mayor as his lawyer.\u201cMy client believes it\u2019s retaliation,\u201d Daryl Justin Finizio, his lawyer, said, \u201cthat so much is being done to him by the city because he\u2019s a politically outspoken person in the community who has spoken at blight hearings for other people.\u201dOne of those involved a homeowner who sought to create what she described as an \u201cecological landscape,\u201d where naturalized plants could grow and invasive plants that were not native to the area were removed.\u201cI am excited to be part of a growing movement of citizens to reverse the environmentally destructive side-effects of the American obsession with manicured lawns and landscapes,\u201d the homeowner, Maggie Redfern, who is also the deputy director of the Connecticut College Arboretum in New London, wrote in a letter to officials.The case was ultimately dismissed, with the blight hearing officer finding that her yard was \u201cexactly the opposite of a \u2018neglected or abandoned property.\u2019\u201dBorodell Place, where Mr. Carrion lives, is a stub of a road sprouting off a busier street. It has only seven houses, which occupy tiny parcels, with almost no yards and front doors just steps from the pavement. Mr. Carrion\u2019s property takes up less than two-tenths of an acre, but the thick tangle of bamboo, often too dense to traverse, is certainly conspicuous.But on such a small block, where residents have gotten to know one another and, more or less, get along, some do not see the bamboo as much of a problem. \u201cHe\u2019s very quiet,\u201d Debbie Mullane, who has lived at the other end of the block for a decade, said of Mr. Carrion. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice person.\u201dNeighbors said they have groused over the years about having to cut back the stalks that crept over property lines or simply how unsightly it is. Still, Kurt Nielsen, who has lived here for 18 years and remembers when the bamboo was just a small patch, questioned the forcefulness of the city\u2019s response. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a lose-lose situation for everybody,\u201d he said.Rick Rojas reported from New London, and Kristin Hussey from Stamford, Conn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colorado Gunman Shoots 5 Officers Near Denver, One Fatally", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt began as a predawn call for the police to a disturbance at an apartment complex in a Denver suburb on Sunday. It ended, officials said, in a fusillade of more than 100 rounds fired by a barricaded gunman who shot five law enforcement officers, killing one of them. The gunman was killed by officers.Describing his meeting with the deputy\u2019s widow, the sheriff said, \u201cWhen I sat with his wife and held her hand, I could see in her eyes that her life was over.\u201dTwo civilians, who the sheriff said appeared to have been in a neighboring apartment, were also shot. Their injuries were not life-threatening.Hours after the attack, numerous questions remained, including the gunman\u2019s motive, the type of weapon he used, what exactly happened leading up to the attack and where the officers were positioned in relation to the suspect.The authorities on Sunday night identified the gunman as Matthew Riehl, 37.Much remains unclear about Mr. Riehl\u2019s life and his actions leading up to the shooting, but he did have an interest in guns. In June, he took an introductory course in carbine rifles run by a Colorado company called Kenaz Tactical Group, according to Robert Butler, the company\u2019s owner and lead instructor.\u201cHe was in our class,\u201d Mr. Butler said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sick right now. Oh my God. We don\u2019t train people to do this.\u201dMr. Butler said that Mr. Riehl seemed like \u201cjust the ordinary student,\u201d and did not seem unstable or violent.The course that Mr. Riehl took is geared toward self-defense, Mr. Butler said. It covered the basics of rifle safety and taught students how to shoot and how to align their aim. Students were required to provide their own firearms.The gunfire shattered a quiet New Year\u2019s Eve morning at the Copper Canyon apartment complex, which describes itself on its website as having some of the \u201cfriendliest apartments\u201d in Highlands Ranch, Colo., which is about 15 miles south of Denver.Two men were in the apartment, and one said Mr. Riehl was \u201cacting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown,\u201d the statement said. Deputies left at 3:44 a.m., as no crime had occurred.Deputies were called back to the apartment by a neighbor at 5:14 a.m. about a disturbance, the sheriff said at the news conference. One of the men in the apartment, described by the sheriff as a roommate, had left before officers arrived, returned and gave officers a key and permission to enter but left before the shooting, the statement said.As outlined by the sheriff, what happened next was murky. The officers were talking to Mr. Riehl for about 30 minutes and at some point he barricaded himself in a bedroom.At 5:56 a.m., four officers were hit by rounds fired from the bedroom. Three deputies were able to get to safety but Deputy Parrish was unable to retreat. The three wounded deputies could not immediately rescue him because of the amount of gunfire and their injuries, the statement said.Deputy Parrish was shot multiple times. The other officers, who were hit in areas uncovered by their protective vests, were in stable condition, the sheriff said.Officers with a SWAT team entered the apartment at about 7:30 a.m., and shots were exchanged between Mr. Riehl and officers, resulting in his death, the statement said. An officer from the Castle Rock Police Department was also shot and injured at that time.The sheriff said Mr. Riehl was known to the authorities and had no criminal record, but would not elaborate.Sheriff Spurlock described what happened as \u201calmost an ambush-type of attack\u201d and said the gunman fired \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d with a rifle, though it was unclear what type.\u201cHe knew we were there, and he knew we were coming,\u201d the sheriff said.He predicted a prolonged investigation that would draw on footage from body cameras worn by the officers.Family members of one of the wounded deputies, Jeff Pelle, rushed from their homes in Northern Colorado to the hospital after getting word he had been shot.Deputy Pelle was in visible pain when his family saw him in the intensive care unit after he emerged from surgery, his sister, Shanna Jessen, said in a phone interview.Ms. Jessen said that he had been shot under the armpit and that the bullet had traveled down his torso to his hip. She said he was doing \u201cremarkably well\u201d after surgery.He comes from a law enforcement family. Deputy Pelle\u2019s father, Joe, is the longtime sheriff of Boulder County, Colo. Ms. Jessen said her brother had been in law enforcement for about seven years, and had been looking forward to celebrating his fifth wedding anniversary on Tuesday.A resident of the apartment complex, Steven Silknitter, rushed home from his weekend job as a truck driver when he heard about the shooting. He said he was trying to make his way past a police cordon when he heard what sounded like a fierce exchange of gunfire.\u201cFifteen to 20 gunshots,\u201d he said. \u201cReturn fire and then more fire.\u201dMr. Silknitter, 50, described the apartment complex as a mix of families, couples and older residents and said neither he nor his fianc\u00e9e, Vira Cover, had ever felt unsafe there or knew or any reports of violence.\u201cHighlands Ranch is one of the safest places in the Denver area,\u201d said Ms. Cover, 50. \u201cI cannot believe this happened in our backyard.\u201d\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d Mr. Silknitter added. \u201cWhere do you go without having to worry about being shot?\u201dMaggie Astor, Christina Caron and Zach Johnk contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facts Have a Well-Known Liberal Bias", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are two central facts about 21st-century U.S. politics. First, we suffer from asymmetric polarization: the Republican Party has become an extremist institution with little respect for traditional norms of any kind. Second, mainstream media \u2013 still the source of most political information for the great majority of Americans \u2013 haven\u2019t been able to come to grips with this reality. Even in the age of Trump, they try desperately to be \u201cbalanced\u201d, which in practice means bending over backwards to say undeserved nice things about Republicans and take undeserved swipes at Democrats.Facebook wanted responsible fact-checking organizations to partner with, and several such organizations exist. But all of these organizations are constantly attacked by the right as having a left-wing bias \u2013 so it added The Weekly Standard, even though it clearly failed to meet internationally accepted standards for that role.Similarly, the GOP is deeply committed to climate change denial, despite the overwhelming consensus of scientists that anthropogenic climate change is real and dangerous. Again, where\u2019s the Democratic counterpart?There are, of course, individual liberals who say things that aren\u2019t true, on all sorts of issues. But huge falsehoods by major party figures \u2013 where by falsehood I mean something demonstrably false, not a view you disagree with \u2013 are far more common on the right than the left.It\u2019s interesting and important to understand where this difference comes from. It\u2019s also something of a puzzle. True, the parties are very different institutions \u2013 the GOP has historically been hierarchical, with top-down direction and monolithic doctrine, while Democrats have always been a loose-jointed coalition. But these days the GOP looks pretty chaotic \u2013 yet the insurgent forces seem to be pushing it even further away from any respect for facts.Whatever the deep explanation, however, the parties are not the same. And trying to pretend that they are the same isn\u2019t just foolish, it\u2019s deeply destructive. Indeed, it\u2019s one important reason Donald Trump sits in the White House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meat and Potatoes Get an Upgrade", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenI\u2019m an ardent vegetable lover, but, sometimes, what I really want to eat is meat and potatoes.It could be a weeknight pan-grilled steak, just big enough for two, cooked on the rare side of medium-rare and served with baked potatoes. Or perhaps juicy braised short ribs and a creamy potato pur\u00e9e. I could go on.If guests are coming, a simple meat-and-potatoes option makes for carefree entertaining, especially during the winter holidays. Add a vegetable or two on the side and a green salad. Done.It is the tender rack of lamb, however, that makes the most perfect roast for an elegant dinner, and it is the easiest to prepare. It may be the priciest cut, but a home-cooked rack of lamb is still far cheaper than one from a restaurant.Usually, lamb racks are sold \u201cfrenched\u201d (trimmed of fat, with the bones separated and scraped clean) and ready to cook. A good butcher will take care of this for you. Supermarket racks often need a bit more trimming. Frenching them at home is not necessary, but do remove extraneous fat. Each eight-bone rack, once cooked, may be sliced into four thick chops (my preference), or eight thin chops, if you prefer.A simple seasoning with salt and pepper is fine, but a little more effort will yield a much more flavorful result. I mix pounded garlic and anchovy with Dijon mustard and olive oil into a quick paste to smear on the meat, and add a shower of roughly chopped rosemary. Give this marinade at least 10 minutes to do its work, or longer if possible, up to eight hours.To combine the meat and potatoes for roasting, I chose my new favorite way with potatoes \u2014 crushed. Small potatoes are first boiled in their skins, then squashed flat, drizzled with olive oil and baked until crisp: in this case, right under the lamb, where they can absorb some of the flavors from the meat.I learned this method from the Argentine chef Francis Mallmann. In Argentina and Uruguay, these potatoes are called papas aplastadas, which simply means flattened or crushed, but sounds fancy. You\u2019ll find recipes for them in most South American cookbooks, often with directions to crisp on an iron plancha, or griddle, rather than roast.If you are well organized, you can prepare this meal several hours in advance, and pop it in the oven at the appropriate moment.

Our work force is relatively young, hardworking and productive. America\u2019s universities and other research institutions are strong in areas like materials science, software development, nanotechnology, biotechnology, genomics and many other fields that are important to our future economic growth and employment. We continue to move toward more energy independence and cleaner energy, with advances in battery storage for solar and wind power and a vast untapped capacity to generate electricity from both.Finally, we have a serious set of security challenges, from nuclear proliferation, to terrorism, to climate change, to cybersecurity, the last of which may prove the most daunting because it puts all the systems we need to deal with the other problems, and our very democracy, at risk.In spite of our overall economic progress since the 2008 crash, all these challenges have contributed to declining economic mobility, increasing political and social alienation and more personal insecurity for millions of our fellow citizens. These forces have increased our divisions, and make it even harder to recover our sense of common purpose.The good news is that an aggressive effort to address our problems with known and affordable responses would bolster the strength of our economy and our communities through higher incomes, more upward mobility and greater security. Many cities and several states are proving it every day.But as a nation, we\u2019re on a very different path. All too often, tribalism based on race, religion, sexual identity and place of birth has replaced inclusive nationalism, in which you can be proud of your tribe and still embrace the larger American community. And too often resentment conquers reason, anger blinds us to answers and sanctimony passes for authenticity. These trends are fueled by our Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook worlds, in which the attention span for issues on television news is only a few seconds, and the very survival of newspapers depends upon retweets of headlines from their online editions. Too many social media sites are fever swamps of extremist foreign and domestic invaders. Such resolute efforts to abolish the line between fact and fiction, truth and lies, can offset all the benefits of our interconnectedness. When trust vanishes and knowledge is devalued as an establishment defense of the status quo, anything can happen. We already see citizens being disenfranchised by the millions, targeted by race, ethnicity and age not because they are ineligible to vote, but because they favor inclusive, not tribal, nationalism.Who wins in this kind of environment? Those who already have it made; they\u2019ll make more. The least responsible members of the political media, who will prosper covering each new controversy and outrage. And the enemies of democracy, who feed the discord and hope that Americans will finally concede that informed self-government no longer works \u2014 and perhaps is no longer even possible \u2014 in the modern world.Twenty-five years ago, when I was elected president, I said that every American should follow our Constitutional framers\u2019 command to form a more perfect union, to constantly expand the definition of \u201cus\u201d and shrink the definition of \u201cthem.\u201d I still believe that. Because I do, I favor policies that promote cooperation over conflict and build an economy, a society and a politics of addition not subtraction, multiplication not division. Unfortunately, too many people in power across the world seem determined to do the reverse. If we do that here, we will miss this moment to build our brightest days. Therefore our most important challenge is deciding who we Americans really are \u2014 as citizens, communities and a nation. On that, all else depends.Bill Clinton was the 42nd president of the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, More Facebook Friends Are Asking You for Money", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps your college friend asked you to support her quarterly magazine for her birthday. Or maybe your neighbor nudged you to donate to his favorite food bank on \u201cGiving Tuesday\u201d the week after Thanksgiving. And then there\u2019s that pesky public-health nonprofit you\u2019ve been charitable to in the past.How did we get here? And at what point did Facebook become a hub for this sort of thing?It all started innocuously enough \u2014 with a modest \u201cDonate\u201d button.In interviews, some Facebook users worried that it would take too long for nonprofits to get their donations. Others groused that inviting friends to donate one by one was time consuming. And a few said they were confused about whether they would be charged a service fee.Still, users overwhelmingly said they were amazed by the ease, simplicity and effectiveness of fund-raising on Facebook. A Washington, D.C., woman said she started a Fund-raiser by accident and raised almost $500 in hours. Many said they were stunned by the number of people who donated \u2014 particularly extended family members \u2014 even though they are seldom in touch.Kelly Hewitt, 31, of Chicago, saw the banner advertising the Gates Foundation match this year and decided to open her first Fund-raiser. So many donations poured in that Ms. Hewitt had to increase her fund-raising goal \u2014 twice.\u201cI do think it\u2019s a really powerful tool that connects people,\u201d she said of Facebook. \u201cIf it can be leveraged to do something great like this, then I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201dExperts said that may be true. But they say there is almost certainly another motivation, too.Keith A. Quesenberry, an assistant professor of marketing at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pa., said the social network needs to increase the amount of time users spend on its site if the company hopes to keep increasing its revenue. That\u2019s part of the reason Facebook has pushed native video, and probably part of the reason it built a platform that allows users to donate without leaving the site, he said.Fund-raising platforms such as GoFundMe have always relied on social networks to make campaigns successful, added Jeremy Littau, an associate professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., who studies social networks and civic action.\u201cThis is Facebook deciding they\u2019re no longer happy playing a middleman role,\u201d he said.Both Mr. Quesenberry and Mr. Littau said they consider Facebook\u2019s decision to eliminate the donation fee to be a bold business move aimed at taking more market share and potentially putting competitors out of business.\u201cAny features that are popular on other networks, they just end up adopting,\u201d Mr. Quesenberry said of Facebook.In an email on Tuesday, Stephen Rocco Rodi, a spokesman for Facebook\u2019s social good team, said that giving is growing \u2014 and having more options will help.\u201cPeople have always come together on Facebook to support the causes they care about, and we build products to make that easier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen people raise money for disaster relief, education, the environment and for friends and family in need. Our goal is to help make this even easier for people who are already using Facebook for this reason, and for people who want to support causes they care about on and off Facebook.\u201dA spokeswoman for GoFundMe, which claims to be the world\u2019s largest social fund-raising platform, said in an email that its community has continued to grow \u201cdespite new competition.\u201dThat community includes more than 50 million people, the spokeswoman said.\u201cIn addition to growing our core business in the U.S., we are also rapidly expanding into new international markets as well as the charity fund-raising space,\u201d the company spokeswoman, Kelly R. Galvin, said in a statement.Gabi Jubran, 28, of Menlo Park, Calif., was planning on running a Giving Tuesday campaign for the nonprofit organization he recently founded.Since Mr. Jubran\u2019s organization is in its infant stages, he worried about how long the money might stay in limbo if he used Facebook to raise funds. So he chose a different platform, Classy, and added a \u201cDonate\u201d button to his nonprofit\u2019s Facebook page that redirected users to the alternative platform.Mr. Jubran soon found that when friends clicked the donate button on Facebook, the social network displayed a pop-up box forcing them to click again if they wished to leave. And when he posted a video about his organization on its Facebook page, Mr. Jubran discovered that although the video got more than 5,000 views, far fewer people departed Facebook to visit his nonprofit\u2019s site.Knowing all this, Mr. Jubran is now contemplating a change in strategy. Instead of raising money exclusively on Classy and ignoring Facebook Fund-raisers, he concedes, \u201cI may end up just doing both.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation contributed to Facebook\u2019s matching fund campaign for Giving Tuesday this year. It was $1 million, not $2 million.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s juicy but not gushy, tart and sweet and complex, so it does some of the work normally done by ketchup, but it\u2019s more dynamic and delicious.You could eat it on its own, but it completes the somewhat austere flavor of the beef from a Piedmontese cattle breed. Even under a melted sheet of Comt\u00e9, the patty is not as woozily rich as many contemporary chef-burgers. In all, it\u2019s an ingenious notion from a chef who is on his fourth current restaurant and seems to be in no imminent danger of running out of ideas.The something-for-everybody menu works, in the sense that by around 6:30 p.m. it starts to appear as if everybody has decided to eat there at once: bachelorette-party celebrators in plastic tiaras; people who look like artists and people who look like art collectors; older couples gaping in amusement at younger couples who have no idea they\u2019re being gaped at.\u201cWhat brings all these people here?\u201d somebody at my table asked a server.She thought about it and shrugged. \u201cMichelin-star chef?\u201dThe formality is a peculiarly high-decibel variety. Enhanced by clever but not overly wonky cocktails, people strain to talk over music that is never soft, even early at night before the room fills up. At times I wanted to stuff my ears with the Parker House rolls, and at other times, like when Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock rolled into \u201cIt Takes Two,\u201d I almost thought the noise was necessary for the interior to make sense.Starting with chilled seafood fits the retro mood of the Loyal. It\u2019s always smart to scoop up bay scallops when they are in their short season, especially as they are done at the Loyal, lounging in their shells in a pool of blood orange-ginger juice that you could drink by the glassful. When scallop season ends, the lobster tail dressed in smoked tomato sauce would make a fine consolation prize, as would the sweet, unrubbery shrimp in a cocktail sauce that leans heavily on Old Bay.The snacks are all over the map. Some borrow from Japan, like the soft-cooked eggs in the style of a ramen shop with red lids of jellied chile oil or the beech mushrooms, fried tempura style, wonderful even if their horseradish-cream sauce wasn\u2019t quite an ideal match. Others come from nearer to home.Molding a p\u00e2t\u00e9 of chicken liver so it looks like a stick of butter, then serving it on a glass butter dish, is undeniably a bid for Instagram stardom, but the port wine syrup that surrounded it was so bright and fruity that I couldn\u2019t be grumpy about it.Mr. Fraser is very skilled at getting vegetables to do things they\u2019re not normally inclined to do. Steamed avocado with quinoa sounds like a dish you\u2019d feed your enemies, but while it was on the menu I loved the way it almost melted into its spicy green chermoula sauce. Chayote, rarely an extrovert, got the extra spark it needed from an orange scribble of paprika-piquillo sauce.As partner for a bowl of polenta with truffles, broccoli pesto was unexpectedly sensible. A less eccentric idea, capellini with artichokes, still pulled off some surprises because Mr. Fraser got such bright and lively flavor out of the artichokes.With the main courses, the meal tends to settle down into a routine of standard meats and fish, enlivened by the occasional firecracker side dish. Lamb chops traveled with a terrific rice pilaf, pink with harissa. The burger took not just the 22-step tomato but also a little saucer of potato \u201ctots,\u201d large dice fried in duck fat. The starch for the hanger steak was potato pur\u00e9e with lobster gravy, which may not be the highest use of lobster but is almost certainly the highest use of gravy.Knowing that early in his career Mr. Fraser worked in an ice-cream parlor makes the heavy presence of sundaes on the dessert menu seem less pandering than it would in another restaurant. Or so I thought until our server told us, in breathy tones, about the \u201csundae set and candy shop,\u201d a pile of Neapolitan ice cream that comes with Pixy Stix, Chupa Chups, Gummi Bears, gold coins, M&Ms, chocolate pebbles and other sugar bombs.It would be a big hit with children, preferably somebody else\u2019s. My ageless companions enjoyed the Sonoma Harvest sundae instead, with br\u00fbl\u00e9ed figs and bits of honeycomb around yogurt and Concord grape sorbets. There\u2019s a very clever baked alaska, too; the toasted meringue is filled with graham-cracker ice cream sitting on a base of chocolate cake, so it tastes like s\u2019mores.The California-based artist Lukas Geronimas has been gradually filling the dining room walls with small, enigmatic paintings over the past few months. The ones toward the front could be illustrations from a book for children about friendly relations among humans, vegetables and farm animals. Toward the restrooms, the relations seem more than friendly. They\u2019d probably be a hit with somebody else\u2019s children, too.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Opposition to a Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the founders, Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, have pushed the group\u2019s 1.8 million supporters to flood social media sites with warnings about how the change could favor big companies and hurt smaller ones. They have also supplied online tools to their followers, like one that makes it easier to call lawmakers and another to file comments directly to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency considering the repeal.For next week, just ahead of the agency\u2019s vote on the proposal, they have organized hundreds of internet companies to alter their websites \u2014 slowing them down, for example \u2014 to show what online experiences could be like without the rules.\u201cWe believe people care about this enough to take a stand,\u201d Ms. Cheng, 37, said while sitting inside the house, nearly surrounded in a tiny office by bookshelves stocked with medieval literature.But Mr. Pai and his two Republican colleagues have committed to passing the proposal at the agency\u2019s meeting next Thursday, in what would be a 3-to-2 party-line vote. Mr. Pai, who was nominated as chairman by President Trump, has said that the rules are unnecessary and that market forces would prevent internet service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, from blocking or slowing sites.\u201cWe want to raise the political costs on this issue,\u201d Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, said. \u201cWe want members of Congress to think of this as a third-rail issue that they have to support or else they will suffer in their elections.\u201dThe protests on Thursday mostly took place outside stores run by Verizon, where Mr. Pai used to work as a lawyer. At a strip mall in Shoreline, Wash., just north of Seattle, about 18 protesters turned up on a cold, sunny morning outside a Verizon store between a Costco and a teriyaki restaurant.Shasta Willson, a web developer who lives in Shoreline, said she ran a small literature publishing business and was concerned that the loss of net neutrality could turn the internet into something more like cable television, where access to certain online services are sold as part of content packages.\u201cI feel like this is the most important issue going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s some crazy stuff going on, but if we lose net neutrality you might not hear about any of it.\u201dIn the shadow of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, 15 to 20 protesters chanted, \u201cSave the net\u201d and \u201cFree speech, equal access.\u201d Although demonstrators said they knew the rule change would almost certainly happen next week, they were hopeful that their actions could generate enough last-minute attention to bring about a reversal.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rear-guard action,\u201d one of the protesters, Maxine Rockoff, 79, said. \u201cBut I hope if we protest across the country, the folks in Congress will recognize it was a bad decision.\u201dFight for the Future was started in 2011 by Ms. Cheng and Mr. Holmes, friends from a math and science high school in Worcester. The two initially got $800,000 in seed funding from the Media Democracy Fund, a grant organization focused on media and telecommunication issues, to fight a bill meant to stop the piracy of movies and music online.The friends, who had long fought for artists\u2019 rights and free-speech issues, saw the bill, known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, as a way for big Hollywood studios to control the internet. They helped organize online protests, coordinating with hundreds of websites, including Wikipedia and Reddit, which went offline at the same time and raised broad awareness of action in Washington on an arcane legislative issue. The bipartisan bill, widely expected to pass, was killed after a public outcry.In 2015, the group used many of the same tactics to support the net neutrality rules that were passed.\u201cThey were so creative and brought something totally different to activism,\u201d said Marvin Ammori, the general counsel for Hyperloop One, a high-speed transportation start-up, and a board member of Fight for the Future.Fight for the Future is now has an annual operating budget of $1.5 million, a chief technology officer and staff dispersed around the globe. The Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, venture capitalists such as Brad Feld of Foundry Group and entrepreneurs like Craig Newmark of Craigslist.org support the group financially.The group does not take money from the biggest tech companies. Its biggest Silicon Valley donors include the search engine DuckDuckGo, which donated $25,000, and the reviews site Yelp, which donated $10,000 last year.Of the 23 million comments filed to the F.C.C. about net neutrality this year, two million were through a site that Fight for the Future helped run. The group said its tools allowed people to make more than 800,000 calls to Congress and 6.7 million emails to lawmakers.The potential repeal outraged Lesley Perg, a 44-year-old adult education instructor in St. Paul. She heard of Mr. Pai\u2019s plan in July and submitted her name, email and phone number to BattlefortheNet.com, a site run by Fight for the Future and its partners to see how she could fight back. She is among more than 1,500 volunteers, and for weeks she has put in four to eight hours a week in training organizers of demonstrations and congressional office visits.\u201cNet neutrality underlies everything I care about,\u201d said Ms. Perg, an avid knitter who is deeply involved with knitting communities online. \u201cEven though Pai has three votes, we need to put Congress in a tough spot and to prepare for this to go to the courts. This is a long game.\u201dThe group\u2019s approach has also attracted criticism.In August, Fight for the Future and the other groups put up billboards in the districts of three Republican House leaders that said the lawmakers had sold out to big internet service providers with their support of the F.C.C. plan. The three were Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who heads a communications subcommittee; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cI think it is really unfortunate that this issue has been politicized,\u201d said Dan Lyons, an associate professor at the Boston College Law School. \u201cThis is a dry admin law debate: Is antitrust sufficient to control broadband providers and, if not, will additional prophylactic rules do more harm than good to innovation?\u201dIn an interview, Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner at the F.C.C., said, \u201cThere is a lot of misinformation out there.\u201dEvan Greer, a director for Fight for the Future, said that to get members of Congress to speak out in favor of the issue, the group needed to deploy a range of efforts to make the government officials uncomfortable.\u201cBacklash is our middle name,\u201d she said.Last week, as Mr. Pai was giving speeches that mocked celebrities like Cher and Alyssa Milano for criticizing his proposal, the group was gearing up for a big online protest set for just before the vote. It needed to make net neutrality something that millions more Americans could care about.On a Google hangout, its leaders, designers and political directors were in a heated debate about their protest slogan. Even minute details, like the font they would use and the color on a banner meant to be shared on sites like Twitter and Facebook, drew pointed discussion.Even after several years promoting net neutrality, it was clear that their enthusiasm was undiminished. One design lit up Ms. Cheng.The design, she exclaimed, made her think: \u201cWe can stop the F.C.C.!\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Shoreline, Wash., and Zach Wichter from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Navy Kicker Turns Last-Second Loss into a Lesson in Leadership", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Bennett Moehring knew exactly how he was going to celebrate if he kicked the game-winning field goal against Army.Moehring, a Navy junior, and his holder, Randy Beggs, would fall onto their backs at midfield and make snow angels. Amid a roaring crowd, they would flap their arms and legs as the falling snow chilled their faces. They would feel what it was like to be heroes.Early this month, the dream nearly came true.Late in the Army-Navy game \u2014 a matchup both service academies obsess about all year \u2014 the score was 14-13, with Army ahead and Navy on a drive. Navy advanced to the Army 23-yard line, but penalties pushed the ball back and set up a 48-yard field-goal attempt for Moehring with just a few seconds left. If he made it, he would equal his personal best. He was confident he could do it.Snow and wind pelted his back. His foot smacked the ball just the way he wanted, and that ball flew straight and straight and straight some more. Until it drifted.The kick was wide left, by maybe six inches.Moehring felt his knees buckle. His teammates \u2014 he doesn\u2019t remember who \u2014 grabbed him.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that my team wouldn\u2019t let me fall,\u201d he told me days later, \u201ceven though I\u2019d just let them down.\u201dIn the locker room, he sat with his helmet on, weeping as teammates and coaches approached him to say the defeat \u2014 Navy\u2019s second straight loss to Army after a 14-year winning streak \u2014 was not his fault.Moehring can\u2019t recall the details because everything was a blur, and can you blame him? He had longed for that chance, and it became a nightmare, with a live audience of more than 68,000.\u201cThere\u2019s no way it can end like this,\u201d he said to himself, again and again. \u201cThere\u2019s something else we can do. There\u2019s got to be something else.\u201dHe agreed to talk to reporters, saying he needed to face his failure. He apologized. He didn\u2019t make excuses. He said he felt blessed to play football.\u201cI\u2019ll use this as motivation,\u201d Moehring said. \u201cI\u2019ll get better. It\u2019s the only option.\u201dAlready, his cellphone was buzzing with text messages, emails, Facebook messages and Twitter shout-outs, many from people who had seen Moehring\u2019s quotes online and were impressed with how he had handled the disappointment.It was striking that those messages were overwhelmingly positive. They weren\u2019t from Navy fans telling him how much he stunk \u2014 the kind of reaction that could be expected from fans of schools where football might as well be a major. The notes were mostly from strangers, who recognized Moehring\u2019s effort and propped him up.Generations of Navy football players also reached out, saying that he had tried his best and that was all Midshipmen could ever ask for. It felt as if a \u201cgiant net of a brotherhood was catching me,\u201d said Moehring, who turned 21 several days after the game.Other kickers sent support, too.\u201cHey, man, last kick aside, I don\u2019t even know how you made the first two in those conditions,\u201d Eddy Pineiro, the kicker for Florida, said in a text message that made Moehring laugh.That missed field goal will help define who he becomes. Moehring knows that now.\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to go through this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I made the kick, the glory would\u2019ve faded. But with this, I can be an example of good sportsmanship, and that\u2019s lasting.\u201dMoehring, an economics major from Bentonville, Ark., said he had thought a lot about what he could learn from his failure. His ruminations coincided with final exams, which began just a few days after Navy played Army. His term had included classes called Probability With Naval Applications, Labor Economics and Electrical Engineering.Moehring also took a required course in leadership, which came in handy after the missed kick. In class, he had practiced how to put a positive spin on bad news and motivate people who were struggling. His professor, a former Navy SEAL, often talked to him after the class, giving advice on resilience and relating how the SEALs would succeed on missions that did not go as planned.\u201cIt\u2019s all about how you respond,\u201d the professor would say. \u201cPeople are going to see that and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Is this a guy worth following?\u2019\u201dMoehring knows people will be watching how he responds to the potentially crushing disappointment of his missed kick, and as a future naval officer \u2014 he hopes to fly planes someday \u2014 he feels compelled to be a role model. It\u2019s why he chose Navy in the first place.During his recruiting trip to Annapolis, the coaches didn\u2019t rave about their waterside campus or their top-notch athletic facilities. They talked about character \u2014 a Navy player\u2019s most important quality.\u201cThey tell you straight up that it\u2019s going to be hard, but that the reason they\u2019re recruiting you is that you\u2019re the type of person who, whenever put in an extreme circumstance, can handle it,\u201d Moehring said. \u201cThat totally appealed to me.\u201dA few days after the Army-Navy game, Moehring watched tape of his kick and considered what had unfolded in those final seconds. And he gave himself a break.\u201cI actually crushed the football, so it was probably good from 53,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that there was snow and the length of the kick, realistically, the percentage of me making that kick was slim to none, given everything involved. But I still know it\u2019s my job to make that kick every time.\u201dThe day after his finals ended, Moehring opened a letter from the 1984 Navy lacrosse captain. It was another pep talk, just like the one from Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, who had called to tell Moehring, \u201cGreat kick, but misses happen to the best of us.\u201dLater that day, at a Starbucks, a patron stopped Moehring to offer support. During an Uber ride even later that day, the driver chimed in with kind words, too.But there is more to Moehring\u2019s season. Navy has one game left: It will host Virginia in the Military Bowl on Thursday.So, lesson learned. Moehring is moving on now.\u201cI\u2019m just like, thanks, guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll hit it next time.\u201dEmail: juliet@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}

And it stunned his family, friends and customers.\u201cOur hearts are broken, and we are struggling to process our grief over this tremendous loss,\u201d the Golden Krust company said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cLowell was a visionary, entrepreneur, community champion, and above all a committed father, family man, friend and man of faith.\u201dThe Bronx-based company, where Mr. Hawthorne had worked with his wife and four children, offered thanks to supporters, and said funeral arrangements would be announced at a later date.The police said Mr. Hawthorne, 57, was found dead around 5:10 p.m. on Saturday in his office at the company factory at 3958 Park Avenue in the Claremont neighborhood. Investigators recovered a handgun and a note, but the police did not reveal its contents.On social media, Mr. Hawthorne\u2019s death prompted an outpouring of emotions that ranged from sadness to shock to disbelief. Some people said it was a cautionary tale of the burden of success, while others speculated that his broad smile masked deep pain.\u201cI was always in search of the next honest means to make a dollar,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike many transplanted Caribbean nationals, I struggled to work and raise a family. I can only thank God for everything I have achieved, and if my story here can inspire others to rise up and give it a go, then I would have succeeded in doing something meaningful.\u201dMr. Hawthorne grew up in St. Andrew, Jamaica, the sixth of 11 siblings born to Mavis and Ephraim Hawthorne, who owned a bakery. His parents sent him to the United States in 1981.In New York, he obtained an associate degree in accounting from Bronx Community College and graduated from Herbert H. Lehman College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management and marketing, according to his Facebook profile. He crunched numbers for nine years as an accountant with the New York Police Department before leaving to start Golden Krust.Despite its rapid growth, the company remained a family business, with many of Mr. Hawthorne\u2019s siblings, children and cousins working for the company.Mr. Hawthorne\u2019s widow, Lorna, is Golden Krust\u2019s director of human resources. Their three sons work in the company: Omar is the director of franchise development and community affairs; Haywood is the vice president of information-technology and manufacturing, and Daren is the corporate counsel and executive vice president of franchising. Their daughter, Monique, is responsible for the Mavis & Ephraim Hawthorne Golden Krust Foundation, which is named for Mr. Hawthorne\u2019s parents.On Sunday, visitors left flowers at the entrance to the Park Avenue building, a factory that takes up a full city block between East 172nd and 173rd Streets. Family members and managers were seen hugging each other before an emergency staff meeting.\u201cAs much as we\u2019re mourning, as much as we are trying to understand how we are where we are, we do have to assure our franchisees that we are equipped internally to carry on our uncle\u2019s mission,\u201d Steven Clarke, a nephew of Mr. Hawthorne and the spokesman for Golden Krust, said after the meeting.Mr. Clarke said he last saw his uncle at a family gathering. \u201cWe cut a cake for our aunt\u2019s birthday on Friday,\u201d he said.\u201cHe was himself,\u201d Mr. Clarke recalled.Asked if he knew why his uncle took his own life, he said, \u201cNo.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Andrew Holness.

This includes telling crude jokes or stories and sharing inappropriate videos. About 25 percent of men in the survey said they had done at least one of these things.Another category is unwanted sexual attention: actions like touching, making comments about someone\u2019s body and asking colleagues on dates after they\u2019ve said no. About 10 percent of men reported such behavior. Least common is sexual coercion, which includes pressuring people into sexual acts by offering rewards or threatening retaliation. Two percent of men said they had done such a thing recently.Some men were probably unwilling to tell the truth in the survey. But the results captured just how many admitted to some form of harassing behavior.After answering questions about particular behaviors, the men were asked if some of their own actions might be considered harassment. Many did not identify harassing behaviors as such. But even counting only those who said yes, the survey suggests that, at a minimum, one in 25 men in the average American workplace identifies himself as a harasser. (An additional two in 25 said they did not know whether their actions could be classified in this way.)The actions in the survey don\u2019t necessarily meet the legal standard for sexual harassment. But they fall under a psychological standard that is used more often by researchers, in corporate policies and in everyday life.Legally, harassment is considered problematic if it is severe, like groping or offering favors for a sexual interaction, or if the behavior is frequent and continuing, even if it is not severe.\u201cIn general, frequency is the most important component,\u201d said Louise Fitzgerald, a leading researcher on sexual harassment, who for the past 30 years has advised on the issue for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice. \u201cEven milder forms of harassment can be extremely damaging if they happen frequently and continue over time.\u201dIn the Times polling, 12 percent of men said that they had either engaged in at least three of the listed actions in the past year, or performed the same action at least three times. Excluding jokes or remarks cuts that figure in half.But actions like jokes may not be entirely benign. Men who admitted to telling sexual stories or jokes were about five times as likely to report other harassing behaviors.The phenomenon cuts across demographic divides, the poll shows. Harassing behaviors are committed by blue-collar and white-collar workers, Democrats and Republicans, the young and the old, the married and the unmarried, high earners and low ones, people who feel powerful at work and those who do not.The percentage of men who say they engaged in one of these behaviors38%Blue-collar workerWhite-collar worker2438%Blue-collar worker24White-collar workerBlue-collar worker38%White-collar worker24\u201cMost harassment is not by high-profile celebrities,\u201d Dr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cThis is so common in places that are very far from the spotlight. This is endemic.\u201dA major difference between those who harass and those who don\u2019t is the culture at their workplace. Behaviors associated with harassment are especially prevalent among men who say their company does not have guidelines against harassment, hotlines to report it or punishment for perpetrators, or who say their managers don\u2019t care.The percentage of men who say they engaged in one of these behaviorsThinks immediate supervisor makes reasonable efforts to stop all sexual harassment31%Thinks immediate supervisor does not43Thinks immediate supervisor makes reasonable efforts to stop all sexual harassment31%Thinks immediate supervisor does not43Thinks immediate supervisor makes reasonable efforts to stop all sexual harassment31%Thinks immediate supervisor does not43In short, organizations play a big role in curbing or permitting harassment, said Vicki Magley, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut.\u201cResearch finds that sexual harassment occurs when it is tolerated \u2014 that is, when policies are not enforced and when incidents are not taken seriously,\u201d she said.Men who worked in the food and beverage industry and in blue-collar jobs, as well as those who were white or Republicans, were more likely to acknowledge harassing behavior. So were those who described a feeling of resentment, saying that they were unappreciated by coworkers or superiors or that colleagues received undeserved promotions.Men with graduate degrees or strong disapproval of President Trump reported lower rates of harassing colleagues. Those who said that they never showed up to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or didn\u2019t socialize with colleagues outside of work, were also significantly less likely to acknowledge such actions.The percentage of men who say they engaged in one of these behaviorsStrongly approves of the job Donald Trump is doing as President37%31Somewhat approvesSomewhat disapproves28Strongly disapproves25Strongly approves of the job Donald Trump is doing as President37%31Somewhat approves28Somewhat disapproves25Strongly disapprovesStrongly approves of the job Donald Trump is doing as President37%Somewhat approves31Somewhat disapproves29Strongly disapproves25The Times and Morning Consult started with a widely used survey of harassment of women at work, the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire. With help from Professors Fitzgerald, Pryor and Magley, the questions were adjusted to ask about people\u2019s actions, instead of their possible experiences as victims.Polls asking people to self-report bad behavior are inherently challenging. To ensure that responses were as accurate as possible, respondents were promised confidentiality, and questions about harassing behaviors were mixed among less sensitive ones, about topics like using Facebook at work or commuting by bike.A third approach to determine the prevalence of possible sexual harassment was to ask men and women not about their own behavior but about that of their colleagues. Those results were generally within a few percentage points of the self-reported ones.There are reasons to doubt the absolute numbers from these surveys. Misreporting might make the numbers too low. Counting harmless actions might make them too high.Studies that ask about specific behaviors instead of general questions tend to find greater prevalence of harassment, as do studies that ask about longer time periods.Professor Fitzgerald emphasized the role that companies play, and the ability of perpetrators, especially those who aren\u2019t famous, to deny any allegations and walk away unscathed.\u201cLet\u2019s look at all the other parts that are at play here,\u201d she said. In addition to the victim, \u201clet\u2019s look at the accused. Let\u2019s look at the work group. Let\u2019s look at the supervisor \u2014 what happens is all the responsibility is put on her to report it. Until we take the focus off the victim, we\u2019re not going to get any farther ahead than where we are now.\u201dThe sexual coercion question reflects answers to four different questions: In the last year at work, have you hinted to someone that he or she might be rewarded for engaging in sexual behavior? Hinted that there might be retaliation of some form if someone was not being sexually cooperative? Treated someone badly for refusing to engage in sexual activities with you? Implied better treatment if someone were sexually cooperative?Morning Consult also surveyed 354 men and 299 women from Dec. 19 to Dec. 21 about their colleagues.The online and phone surveys took place across three weeks from late November to mid-December, on days when sexual harassment dominated the news and on days when it did not. The results were about the same for each of those weeks.Additional work by Derek Watkins and Amanda CoxAdvertisement"}

Ms. Hall-Tompkins was preparing for a one-woman show but found herself struggling to focus after the death of a close friend. In need of company, she took to a shelter near Lincoln Center and began making her way through Mozart\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 4 in D Major. Twelve people listened to the same notes she would soon play before an audience of 1,000. Some tapped their feet, laughed or smiled. Others, who told the violinist they had never heard classical music before, cried.\u201cYou can reach people in this situation on a deeper level, sometimes, than ticket-buying audiences,\u201d Ms. Hall-Tompkins said. \u201cOf course, the nature of my career is playing concerts for ticket-buying audiences, but there\u2019s something more profound reaching people with these pieces at this time in their lives.\u201dClassical music can reach people in a way that other genres cannot \u201cbecause it has a bigger harmonic palette, and a harmonic palette corresponds directly to every emotion that we feel as human beings,\u201d Ms. Hall-Tompkins said. \u201cClassical music will take you through so many different iterations of all of the complexities that we feel as human beings.\u201dHomeless adults are an underserved audience, she added. \u201cA lot of programs we have cater to children \u2014 they\u2019re still coming up and there\u2019s still hope for them \u2014 but there\u2019s a bleakness and a sense of hopelessness that sometimes people take on in the shelter\u201d as adults, Ms. Hall-Tompkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that they have the opportunity to be so moved.\u201dAt one recent concert in an immigrant educational center in Brooklyn, Ms. Hall-Tompkins led a singalong for the famous \u201cFiddler\u201d number \u201cSunrise, Sunset.\u201d\u201cHow many people have ever been to a Broadway show?\u201d she remembered asking the audience. Only one person out of a room of 70. \u201cHow many people have ever heard of \u2018Fiddler on the Roof\u2019?\u201d (Just one, the same man.) \u201cHow many people have ever heard classical music before?\u201d (Again, just one.)She passed around the lyrics and sang the words while playing the melody. Those who watched her hesitated at first.\u201cIt was the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ms. Hall-Tompkins said. \u201cYou could hear this little din that started, and by the time we got to \u2018Sunrise, Sunset\u2019\u201d \u2014 she interrupted herself, singing and swaying to re-enact the moment.\u201cPeople from completely different, non-Western cultures really connected with the timelessness of those words \u2014 it just transcended time, place, culture, everything,\u201d she said.\u201cI played that show for 13 months and I never quite connected with the words and how profound they are until that moment.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:If you\u2019re curled up next to the fire as you read this, you may want to stay there.Tomorrow should be equally clear, but even chillier.Advertisement"}

One member abstained from voting because of a possible conflict of interest.The decision was not a surprise; election officials had previously said in interviews that he would be ineligible to run. Mr. Navalny, 41, was also prepared for the decision, recording his reaction in a video before it was officially announced.\u201cWe won\u2019t have an election because Vladimir Putin is horribly afraid, he sees a threat in competing with me,\u201d Mr. Navalny said in the video. \u201cHe gave an instruction to his servants from the Central Electoral Commission to reject my registration.\u201dIn the video, Mr. Navalny called on his supporters to boycott the election, scheduled for March. He said that 84 campaign offices he established across Russia would now be organizing an election boycott.

Jane Goodall, Mohsin Hamid, Oscar Murillo, James Dyson, Richard Dawkins, Kyung-sook Shin and Daniel Humm tell us.Jane GoodallThe world, as I know it, is ending. I close my eyes and again experience the wonder of the rain forest, the murmuring streams, the rustling leaves and the myriad sounds of animal life, chirping and singing and buzzing. Flashes of color; birds, butterflies, fish shining in the water. Monkeys feeding overhead. The smell of damp earth and flowers. Each species, no matter how small, playing its part in the rich tapestry of life. I move my mind\u2019s eyes to the wetlands, the mountains, the coral reefs, the golden prairies. The sun glittering on the Arctic ice. The pine trees of the cliffs I climbed as a child. In these few minutes the beauty of the world I once knew is real again.I open my eyes reluctantly. I am surrounded by land and water that is dead, polluted, plundered. The natural world destroyed. Our cities collapsed. Nature has hit back at we humans, who so greedily stole her riches, with hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires and earthquakes.But suddenly I realize that though the Earth may seem destroyed, it is alive in my mind. And I am aware of another kind of beauty: that of the indomitable human spirit. The lust for greed and power has destroyed the beauty we inherited, but altruism, compassion and love have not been destroyed. All that is beautiful in humanity has not been destroyed. The beauty of our planet is not dead but lying dormant, like the seeds of a dead tree. We shall have another chance.Jane Goodall is an ethologist, a conservationist and a United Nations Messenger of Peace. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977.Mohsin HamidEntities of the cosmos, greetings from the humans of Earth.Our world as we know it is coming to an end.Humans are a biological life-form. Our individual existence is characterized by impermanence. We live, and then we die. Our greatest achievement is that we are not entirely overwhelmed by our awareness of this predicament.We know we will die, yet we experience love and tenderness and wonder and joy. Our mortality forms the basis of our compassion. We know that every human, no matter how different we are from each other, will experience death, and this creates a sense of closeness.We were not less because we died. We were more. But the desire to live forever was strong in us. We gave birth to machines that we hoped would help us achieve this wish. We hoped to merge with these machines. Now, in our attempt to extinguish our mortality, we are on the verge of extinguishing ourselves.Farewell. May our example be of benefit to you.Mohsin Hamid is a Pakistani novelist. His latest book is \u201cExit West.\u201dOscar MurilloThe pursuit of new frontiers in the name of science and empire has almost always come at the expense of others. Early explorers, from the conquistador Cort\u00e9s to Captain Cook, voyaged across the globe for the sake of expansion and knowledge. However their aim was not to discover more about the world; it was to spread an already-formed worldview. Thus their path was littered with casualties \u2014 communities, countries, corpses.History is told by those with the loudest voices. And the voices of imperialism remain the loudest, even today. The astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission trained in the desert of the Western United States \u2014 formerly Native American land \u2014 in order to prepare themselves for the final frontier. According to an old joke, a native chief asked the astronauts if they could pass on a message to the holy spirits who live on the moon. The man spoke some words in his own language, and when the astronauts asked what the message meant, the chief told them it was a secret between his tribe and the moon spirits. But the astronauts managed to find someone who could translate the words.The message was: \u201cDon\u2019t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your land.\u201dOscar Murillo is an artist based in London.James DysonThe way engineers tackle seemingly insoluble problems with ingenuity and grit is something to behold.Tomorrow is more exciting than today because of engineers. They drive all progress using their brains and hands. With intelligence and persistence, they show human resourcefulness at its best. They are the most genuine form of wealth creator an economy can hope for, and they are incredibly resourceful.Engineers don\u2019t always follow the rules; they approach challenges from new angles and with a na\u00efve intelligence in order to find the right solution. No challenge is too big.I therefore find it implausible that the world is coming to an end. Engineers will find a way to avoid this catastrophe!James Dyson is an inventor, designer and founder of the Dyson company.Richard DawkinsDear fellow cosmic citizens,If you have the technology to intercept this last testament from our doomed planet, chances are that you are far more advanced than us; you have probably been evolving for much longer and your codebreakers are capable enough to decipher my language.You will be aware that, like any other life-form, we evolved by gradual degrees from simple beginnings, through the nonrandom survival of digitally coded instructions. We called those instructions genes (doubtless yours differ in detail from ours). They survived mostly by building what we called bodies. Our life-form was driven by energy from our star (the \u201csun\u201d) and intercepted by static bodies called plants, using specialized photon collectors called leaves. The energy of plants was then stolen by mobile bodies called animals. Some animals, in turn, consumed other animals, and the energy was passed along in a \u201cfood chain.\u201d All used the same genetic code, a linear string of digital characters drawn from an alphabet of four. As you will easily calculate, this was sufficient to encode a huge diversity of forms, which was one of the stupendous glories of our tragic planet.Among the many millions of kinds of animals, our own, called humans, were distinguished by our large on-board computer (the \u201cbrain\u201d) which enabled us to make some progress toward understanding the universe and our origins. We were quite proud of understanding such things as evolution and the fact that matter comes in a finite set of \u201celements.\u201d While we made a start on what we called quantum theory, we found it bewildering, probably because our brains never evolved to understand the ultrasmall.We dreamed of a final Theory of Everything and a complete understanding of the origin of all things, including time. Perhaps you already have that. It is among our griefs that we perished before we could reach it.Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and author. His most recent book is \u201cScience in the Soul: Selected Writings of a Passionate Rationalist.\u201dKyoung-Sook ShinI was happy to be able to live on this Earth as my mother\u2019s daughter. She taught me how to walk, how to put on clothes, how to speak my name. After I grew a bit older, she taught me that reading books is an important part of living in this world. Through her life itself, my mother taught me how to plant seeds, and that you reap what you sow, as well as how to console people when they are sad.When I was 22, I started writing novels in my mother tongue, a language filled with the essence of my mother. I wrote about everything that is born in our hearts and in this world, from sorrow and beauty to passion and love. With words, I strived to restore things that had disappeared. I also wrote about my mother, who gave me everything but whom I took for granted at times.Writing was my way of paying tribute to everything that was once alive on Earth and has since left. If I had raised a daughter, I would have taught her everything that I learned from my mother. I wish I could have.Kyung-sook Shin is a Korean novelist whose book \u201cPlease Look After Mom\u201d won the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2012, making her the first South Korean woman to do so.Daniel HummThe ultimate beauty of life on Earth can only be described in the context of personal relationships. Natural, true beauty is enhanced exponentially as a shared experience.As a chef, I am lucky enough to see this every single night in my restaurant: people from all walks of life, all ethnicities, all ages, all connecting deeply around a table. The human connection is significantly beautiful, and nothing showcases that more than our experiences in 2017.Through all of the disasters, both natural and man-made, there is one thing that proved to be more powerful than the devastation: that absolute, and most human, intention to look into each other\u2019s eyes \u2014 not at each other\u2019s skin color, political views, or religious or sexual preferences \u2014 and connect on a completely soulful level. To will someone else to triumph over adversity; to lift someone else up when they are at their lowest point; to connect with each other below the surface ... this is us at our most beautiful.Daniel Humm is a Swiss chef and co-owner of Eleven Madison Park in New York.Advertisement"}

I didn\u2019t consider my voice important, nor did I think it would make a difference.When so many women came forward to describe what Harvey had done to them, I had to confront my cowardice and humbly accept that my story, as important as it was to me, was nothing but a drop in an ocean of sorrow and confusion. I felt that by now nobody would care about my pain \u2014 maybe this was an effect of the many times I was told, especially by Harvey, that I was nobody.We are finally becoming conscious of a vice that has been socially accepted and has insulted and humiliated millions of girls like me, for in every woman there is a girl. I am inspired by those who had the courage to speak out, especially in a society that elected a president who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women and whom we have all heard make a statement about how a man in power can do anything he wants to women.Well, not anymore.In the 14 years that I stumbled from schoolgirl to Mexican soap star to an extra in a few American films to catching a couple of lucky breaks in \u201cDesperado\u201d and \u201cFools Rush In,\u201d Harvey Weinstein had become the wizard of a new wave of cinema that took original content into the mainstream. At the same time, it was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood. And even though I had proven them wrong, I was still a nobody.One of the forces that gave me the determination to pursue my career was the story of Frida Kahlo, who in the golden age of the Mexican muralists would do small intimate paintings that everybody looked down on. She had the courage to express herself while disregarding skepticism. My greatest ambition was to tell her story. It became my mission to portray the life of this extraordinary artist and to show my native Mexico in a way that combated stereotypes.The Weinstein empire, which was then Miramax, had become synonymous with quality, sophistication and risk taking \u2014 a haven for artists who were complex and defiant. It was everything that Frida was to me and everything I aspired to be.I had started a journey to produce the film with a different company, but I fought to get it back to take it to Harvey.I knew him a little bit through my relationship with the director Robert Rodriguez and the producer Elizabeth Avellan, who was then his wife, with whom I had done several films and who had taken me under their wing. All I knew of Harvey at the time was that he had a remarkable intellect, he was a loyal friend and a family man.Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn\u2019t my friendship with them \u2014 and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney \u2014 that saved me from being raped.The deal we made initially was that Harvey would pay for the rights of work I had already developed. As an actress, I would be paid the minimum Screen Actors Guild scale plus 10 percent. As a producer, I would receive a credit that would not yet be defined, but no payment, which was not that rare for a female producer in the \u201990s. He also demanded a signed deal for me to do several other films with Miramax, which I thought would cement my status as a leading lady.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.I did not care about the money; I was so excited to work with him and that company. In my na\u00efvet\u00e9, I thought my dream had come true. He had validated the last 14 years of my life. He had taken a chance on me \u2014 a nobody. He had said yes.Little did I know it would become my turn to say no.No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night, hotel after hotel, location after location, where he would show up unexpectedly, including one location where I was doing a movie he wasn\u2019t even involved with.No to me taking a shower with him.No to letting him watch me take a shower.No to letting him give me a massage.No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage.No to letting him give me oral sex.No to my getting naked with another woman.No, no, no, no, no \u2026And with every refusal came Harvey\u2019s Machiavellian rage.I don\u2019t think he hated anything more than the word \u201cno.\u201d The absurdity of his demands went from getting a furious call in the middle of the night asking me to fire my agent for a fight he was having with him about a different movie with a different client to physically dragging me out of the opening gala of the Venice Film Festival, which was in honor of \u201cFrida,\u201d so I could hang out at his private party with him and some women I thought were models but I was told later were high-priced prostitutes.The range of his persuasion tactics went from sweet-talking me to that one time when, in an attack of fury, he said the terrifying words, \u201cI will kill you, don\u2019t think I can\u2019t.\u201dWhen he was finally convinced that I was not going to earn the movie the way he had expected, he told me he had offered my role and my script with my years of research to another actress.In his eyes, I was not an artist. I wasn\u2019t even a person. I was a thing: not a nobody, but a body.At that point, I had to resort to using lawyers, not by pursuing a sexual harassment case, but by claiming \u201cbad faith,\u201d as I had worked so hard on a movie that he was not intending to make or sell back to me. I tried to get it out of his company.He claimed that my name as an actress was not big enough and that I was incompetent as a producer, but to clear himself legally, as I understood it, he gave me a list of impossible tasks with a tight deadline:1. Get a rewrite of the script, with no additional payment.2. Raise $10 million to finance the film.3. Attach an A-list director.4. Cast four of the smaller roles with prominent actors.The latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.Much to everyone\u2019s amazement, not least my own, I delivered, thanks to a phalanx of angels who came to my rescue, including Edward Norton, who beautifully rewrote the script several times and appallingly never got credit, and my friend Margaret Perenchio, a first-time producer, who put up the money. The brilliant Julie Taymor agreed to direct, and from then on she became my rock. For the other roles, I recruited my friends Antonio Banderas, Edward Norton and my dear Ashley Judd. To this day, I don\u2019t know how I convinced Geoffrey Rush, whom I barely knew at the time.Now Harvey Weinstein was not only rejected but also about to do a movie he did not want to do.Ironically, once we started filming, the sexual harassment stopped but the rage escalated. We paid the price for standing up to him nearly every day of shooting. Once, in an interview he said Julie and I were the biggest ball busters he had ever encountered, which we took as a compliment.Halfway through shooting, Harvey turned up on set and complained about Frida\u2019s \u201cunibrow.\u201d He insisted that I eliminate the limp and berated my performance. Then he asked everyone in the room to step out except for me. He told me that the only thing I had going for me was my sex appeal and that there was none of that in this movie. So he told me he was going to shut down the film because no one would want to see me in that role.It was soul crushing because, I confess, lost in the fog of a sort of Stockholm syndrome, I wanted him to see me as an artist: not only as a capable actress but also as somebody who could identify a compelling story and had the vision to tell it in an original way.I was hoping he would acknowledge me as a producer, who on top of delivering his list of demands shepherded the script and obtained the permits to use the paintings. I had negotiated with the Mexican government, and with whomever I had to, to get locations that had never been given to anyone in the past \u2014 including Frida Kahlo\u2019s houses and the murals of Kahlo\u2019s husband, Diego Rivera, among others.But all of this seemed to have no value. The only thing he noticed was that I was not sexy in the movie. He made me doubt if I was any good as an actress, but he never succeeded in making me think that the film was not worth making.He offered me one option to continue. He would let me finish the film if I agreed to do a sex scene with another woman. And he demanded full-frontal nudity.He had been constantly asking for more skin, for more sex. Once before, Julie Taymor got him to settle for a tango ending in a kiss instead of the lovemaking scene he wanted us to shoot between the character Tina Modotti, played by Ashley Judd, and Frida.But this time, it was clear to me he would never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another. There was no room for negotiation.I had to say yes. By now so many years of my life had gone into this film. We were about five weeks into shooting, and I had convinced so many talented people to participate. How could I let their magnificent work go to waste?I had asked for so many favors, I felt an immense pressure to deliver and a deep sense of gratitude for all those who did believe in me and followed me into this madness. So I agreed to do the senseless scene.I arrived on the set the day we were to shoot the scene that I believed would save the movie. And for the first and last time in my career, I had a nervous breakdown: My body began to shake uncontrollably, my breath was short and I began to cry and cry, unable to stop, as if I were throwing up tears.Since those around me had no knowledge of my history of Harvey, they were very surprised by my struggle that morning. It was not because I would be naked with another woman. It was because I would be naked with her for Harvey Weinstein. But I could not tell them then.My mind understood that I had to do it, but my body wouldn\u2019t stop crying and convulsing. At that point, I started throwing up while a set frozen still waited to shoot. I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse. As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene.By the time the filming of the movie was over, I was so emotionally distraught that I had to distance myself during the postproduction.When Harvey saw the cut film, he said it was not good enough for a theatrical release and that he would send it straight to video.This time Julie had to fight him without me and got him to agree to release the film in one movie theater in New York if we tested it to an audience and we scored at least an 80.Less than 10 percent of films achieve that score on a first screening.I didn\u2019t go to the test. I anxiously awaited to receive the news. The film scored 85.And again, I heard Harvey raged. In the lobby of a theater after the screening, he screamed at Julie. He balled up one of the scorecards and threw it at her. It bounced off her nose. Her partner, the film\u2019s composer Elliot Goldenthal, stepped in, and Harvey physically threatened him.Once he calmed down, I found the strength to call Harvey to ask him also to open the movie in a theater in Los Angeles, which made a total of two theaters. And without much ado, he gave me that. I have to say sometimes he was kind, fun and witty \u2014 and that was part of the problem: You just never knew which Harvey you were going to get.Months later, in October 2002, this film, about my hero and inspiration \u2014 this Mexican artist who never truly got acknowledged in her time with her limp and her unibrow, this film that Harvey never wanted to do, gave him a box office success that no one could have predicted, and despite his lack of support, added six Academy Award nominations to his collection, including best actress.Even though \u201cFrida\u201d eventually won him two Oscars, I still didn\u2019t see any joy. He never offered me a starring role in a movie again. The films that I was obliged to do under my original deal with Miramax were all minor supporting roles.Years later, when I ran into him at an event, he pulled me aside and told me he had stopped smoking and he had had a heart attack. He said he\u2019d fallen in love and married Georgina Chapman, and that he was a changed man. Finally, he said to me: \u201cYou did well with \u2018Frida\u2019; we did a beautiful movie.\u201dI believed him. Harvey would never know how much those words meant to me. He also would never know how much he hurt me. I never showed Harvey how terrified I was of him. When I saw him socially, I\u2019d smile and try to remember the good things about him, telling myself that I went to war and I won.But why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war to tell our stories when we have so much to offer? Why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity?I think it is because we, as women, have been devalued artistically to an indecent state, to the point where the film industry stopped making an effort to find out what female audiences wanted to see and what stories we wanted to tell.Until there is equality in our industry, with men and women having the same value in every aspect of it, our community will continue to be a fertile ground for predators.I am grateful for everyone who is listening to our experiences. I hope that adding my voice to the chorus of those who are finally speaking out will shed light on why it is so difficult, and why so many of us have waited so long. Men sexually harassed because they could. Women are talking today because, in this new era, we finally can.Oct. 6, 2017Salma Hayek (@salmahayek) is an actor and producer.Produced by Jessia Ma, developed by Danny DebeliusAdvertisement"}

The Solomon family, a prominent civic and philanthropic force in New Orleans, has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy the festival from Ann Tuennerman, the organization\u2019s founder, and her husband, Paul Tuennerman. If the transaction proceeds, the convention will run as scheduled in July \u2014 something many people had begun to doubt.Following years of steady growth and expansion, Tales of the Cocktail hit a bump last March after the Tuennermans, who are white, donned blackface as guests in the Zulu Mardi Gras parade on Feb. 28. Mr. Tuennerman then made what some perceived as racially insensitive remarks in a Facebook Live video; he was compelled to apologize and then step down.The Solomons began talking with the Tuennermans in November about taking over the event, Gary Solomon Jr. said.The Solomon family has deep roots in local entertainment. Its patriarch, Theodore Solomon, once owned a string of movie theaters across Louisiana, Mississippi and other states. After divesting themselves of that empire, the family members ventured into philanthropy, collaborating extensively with local schools, museums and government.Solomon Group, an entertainment design firm co-founded by Gary Solomon Jr. in 2009, has worked with Tales for years, assisting on various events, including the annual Spirited Awards, which honor bar professionals.Mr. Bodenheimer, whose family has lived in New Orleans since the late 1800s, had been busy searching for a way to keep Tales in the city. \u201cI was very concerned what the loss of Tales would mean to the local community,\u201d he said.In an email message on Friday, Ms. Tuennerman said she had received inquiries from nearly two dozen parties interested in taking over the event. She would not disclose the dollar amount of the sale, but added: \u201cWe did not accept the highest offer. There were other factors that were more important. Paul and I believe that Solomon and Bodenheimer will be the best stewards of the brands and share the same values as us.\u201dTales has been criticized for its slowness in responding to social ills that surround the drinks world, such as substance abuse, sexual harassment and assault, and a lack of diversity. Mr. Bodenheimer and Mr. Solomon said they want to change that, and plan to set up a diverse panel of bar and spirits professionals to determine who should receive charitable grants.\u201cWe need to find a way to give bartenders better access to education,\u201d Mr. Bodenheimer said. \u201cWe need to take care of attendees.

Foreign Firms Find It\u2019s Not That Simple.", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.The reality on the ground was more complex.That message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\u201cChina\u2019s door will not close to the world but open wider,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.But the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.Others were more blunt in their assessments.\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201dNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Thirst for Cheap Labor Fuels a Boom in Disposable Workers", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of the workers had been recruited from Romania, Bulgaria and other Central European countries by a large employment agency. When their contracts are up, they will be sent home, with another group of migrant workers brought in as required \u2014 replaceable cogs in a tireless machine.Across Europe, nearly 55,000 agencies recruit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers each year for cheap manual labor and service jobs. The agencies allow employers to tap into a more flexible work force \u2014 and avoid some of the region\u2019s more onerous labor costs.For companies, the challenges of hiring low-cost workers are growing: An economic recovery is shrinking the pool of cheap labor that initially attracted Foxconn and others to Europe. Employment agencies like Xawax, which finds workers for the Foxconn and Panasonic factories, are an important conduit.For migrant workers, the choice is difficult. Those from poorer European countries are eager to find better paying jobs. But the agencies sometimes operate in a gray area: requiring workers to sign contracts in foreign languages, and saddling them with conditions and pay that few in-country nationals would accept.Nearly a dozen workers at the Pardubice plants, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said they had possessed little understanding that the contracts they had signed would expose them to frequent overtime shifts, including nights and weekends, while leaving them constantly on call. The Czech government is conducting an inquiry into Foxconn\u2019s employment practices.One Romanian couple were jobless until they saw a Xawax ad on Facebook this summer.The couple, ages 23 and 24, said a recruiter had promised free lodging, regular shifts and wages on par with Czech factory workers \u2014 at least \u20ac585 a month \u2014 better than what they could get in Romania. They boarded a bus packed with other recruits bound for Pardubice. There, they signed a six-month employment contract with Xawax that was written in Czech, a language they couldn\u2019t comprehend, without a translator present.At 5:30 the next morning, they were transported to the Panasonic factory to join more than a hundred laborers in a cavernous hall assembling electronic components. The couple said Xawax had soon told them that they would have to frequently work overtime or receive bonuses just to get their promised wage. The terms were included in the contract they could not understand. After the woman got sick at work and fainted one evening, requiring her to be rushed to a hospital, she received little help from the agency in organizing follow-up treatment, she said.\u201cThe agencies have a lot of power over these people,\u201d she said.In a statement, Foxconn Technology Group said it and the agencies that recruited on its behalf had ensured workers received wages and benefits above the Czech Republic\u2019s basic requirements. Foxconn added that its operations were regularly audited, and that it complied with relevant local laws and regulations.Panasonic said that it relied on agencies like Xawax to recruit workers amid a tight labor market and that both parties complied with Czech labor law. In a statement, the company added that migrant workers, who hold agency contracts, did not work beyond the legal workweek and were paid above the Czech minimum wage.Pardubice became a low-cost manufacturing hub after the fall of Communism.It managed to attract Foxconn in 2000 after the Czech government gave the company a 10-year investment tax break. Foxconn quickly energized the region, buying a mothballed electronics factory and hiring thousands of workers. Restaurants, clothing stores and other businesses soon sprang up to cater to the growing population.Agencies like Xawax are a powerful tool for Foxconn and other manufacturers to juice productivity and manage costs.The Taiwanese company has assembled electronics for HP, Dell and Cisco, using recruitment agencies to expand or shrink its labor force around production cycles. At its peak, about half of a nearly 10,000-person work force were temporary workers; today, the company said, there are 4,000 workers, of which 20 percent to 30 percent are temps.The agencies give Foxconn and other companies another advantage: The workers aren\u2019t technically employed by Foxconn. The setup transfers legal and other responsibilities, including the risk of potential labor violations, to the agency.In the concrete dorms, which are managed by Xawax and other agencies, workers from Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere filed in from an afternoon shift and cooked a modest meal in a threadbare communal kitchen. They were tired, but neither the heat nor the hot water was working. One grumbled that he had lost pay after he injured his arm on the assembly line. Still, the workers said, they needed the money.Here in the Czech Republic, the authorities have been looking into Foxconn\u2019s labor practices, though Jiri Vanasek, the deputy labor minister, acknowledged it can be hard to prove wrongdoing. The government is also scrutinizing the country\u2019s many employment agencies. It recently imposed a registration fee to discourage attempts by agencies to change their names frequently to avoid putting workers in full-time jobs once temporary contracts have expired, and to clamp down on fly-by-night operators.Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But while many saw the humor, others were creeped out by the specificity of the information, with some complaining that Netflix appeared to be using its data in a flip manner that mocked some customers.This is amazing. Except for the \u201cwatching us like big brother \u201c part ;)It\u2019s no secret that companies, especially those born in the digital age, are amassing deep and detailed troves of information on the habits and preferences of their consumers. For streaming services, that data fuels the recommendations. But companies are also taking a bit of a risk when they turn those findings into marketing, whether through conversational social media posts or advertisements from Spotify with lines like \u201cTake a page from the 3,445 people who streamed the \u2018Boozy Brunch\u2019 playlist on a Wednesday this year.\u201dA message that one person might see as clever and unexpected can just as easily be seen by another as an ominous reminder that Big Data is often lurking just around the corner.\u201cThis gives the public a kind of view into the ways that the major content companies are gathering and using our data,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, which advocates for consumer protection and privacy. \u201cBehind the ease of being able to access video and audio content are very sophisticated customer surveillance and analytics applications, and there\u2019s nothing funny about that.\u201dOthers scoffed at such concern last week, saying Netflix\u2019s joke was harmless and noting that people were complaining on a social media platform that engages in similar data collection practices.Spotify is in the midst of its third ad campaign featuring tag lines rooted in highly specific listener data. (Indeed, several people called Netflix out for seeming to copy Spotify with its post.) The music streaming service recently bought ads on billboards and buildings with a marketing message built around the theme \u201c2018 Goals,\u201d with cheeky messages that sometimes have a political bent.\u201cDeliver burns as well as the person who streamed \u2018Bad Liar\u2019 86 times the day Sean Spicer resigned,\u201d one proclaims. Another says, \u201cEat vegan brisket with the person who made a playlist called \u2018Leftist Elitist Snowflake BBQ.\u2019\u201dSpotify\u2019s marketing executives said last year that they avoided lines that appeared to be laughing at people\u2019s habits in favor of those that celebrated unusual behavior. They also said they sought permission from people when using their playlist names in ads. The people were usually delighted to be asked, the executive said, who noted that the data collection wasn\u2019t a surprise given that that\u2019s how Spotify provides users with its weekly recommendations and year-end lists.People and publications such as AdWeek and AdAge called the campaign \u201camusing,\u201d \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201chilarious.\u201d While that has largely continued this year, there has also been criticism that some of the messages veer too close to making fun of users.And the Netflix hubbub didn\u2019t seem to help.Netflix, which has more than 100 million members, emphasized that the use of data to better serve users was a main part of its business and that its behavioral data was collected anonymously.The company has frequently shared interesting information about viewers\u2019 habits in the past, said Jonathan Friedland, a Netflix spokesman. He added that last week\u2019s tweet might have inspired an intense reaction in part because \u201cit was brought down to an individual level as opposed to a broader trend level.\u201d But he pointed out that Netflix does not use customer data to sell ads on its platform, as Google and Facebook do, or sell it to other entities.Tidbits on Netflix viewing habits are \u201cfascinating to people,\u201d Mr. Friedland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re breaching anybody\u2019s privacy, because the core proposition here is we know you and try to put the right\u201d films and TV series in front of you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Will They Take Me, Too?\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "FeatureMore than a thousand children are counting on Nora S\u00e1ndigo to become their guardian if their undocumented parents are deported. How many of those promises will she now have to keep?Supported byThe strategy worked, for a few days at least, with the youngest three. They were all under 5 and were used to the world going about its strange business without them. But then there was Kelly. She was 8 and sharp-eyed, a good student who preferred English to Spanish and wanted to someday be a doctor, or maybe a gymnast, and who had watched a presidential candidate on television say he wanted to send people back to Mexico, where both her parents grew up.Kelly came home from school one day in October last year and demanded to know where her father was. Because his construction job started so early in the morning, Javier was usually the first home. That was part of how he and Kelly\u2019s mother, T., fell in love. They boarded in the same house more than a decade ago, when she was 19 and freshly arrived in South Florida, having followed her sister from their small village in southern Mexico. T., who is being identified by her first initial to shield her identity, quit school after sixth grade. She helped her parents plant corn and beans but dreamed of something better for herself and her infant son; she decided to leave him in her mother\u2019s care and support him from afar. Javier was from the same region, and because he finished work early, he cooked for her while she was still out in the Florida sun. The food was delicious and tasted like home. Soon they were a couple, and then Kelly was born, and her father, who fainted with anxiety in the birthing room, adored her, and she adored him back.\u201cHe\u2019s late from work,\u201d T. told her daughter.But Kelly wasn\u2019t having it. Before heading to school that morning, she saw uniformed men come to the door and ask her mother for her father\u2019s passport; she heard her mother on the phone, asking what had happened, what to do. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Kelly said, and started to cry. \u201cWhere did they take him? What did he do?\u201dBy now T. knew. One of her first phone calls was to an immigrant advocate and former refugee named Nora S\u00e1ndigo, who, in this poor area south of Miami, was the most powerful person in many people\u2019s worlds: She knew lawyers, county commissioners, even members of Congress. After T. called her, S\u00e1ndigo quickly discovered that Javier had been detained by the Department of Homeland Security. T. didn\u2019t tell Kelly the details she had learned from S\u00e1ndigo, or from Javier, when he was finally able to make a brief call. That they arrested him just a few yards away from their home, as he stood waiting for his ride to work. That now he was on the edge of the Everglades, in a gray-and-tan detention center adjacent to a state prison, a half-hour\u2019s drive away, a distance that, for T., had suddenly become unbridgeable. \u201cHe was arrested,\u201d she told Kelly, simply. \u201cWe have no papers to be here, like you do.\u201d\u201cWill they take me, too?\u201d Kelly asked. She didn\u2019t know what papers her mother was talking about, what this thing was that she had and her parents didn\u2019t.T. didn\u2019t tell her daughter the other reason she called S\u00e1ndigo. Across South Florida, T. knew, undocumented parents of citizen children were preparing for possible deportation by signing power-of-attorney forms that allowed S\u00e1ndigo to step in should their own parenthood be interrupted by a surprise visit from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. If they were taken away, at least Norita, as they called her, could provide stability while the family sorted out what to do; she could also sign forms on their children\u2019s behalf at school, or at the hospital, or in federal court.S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s responsibilities extended to many hundreds of children, and were growing all the time. Parents, some of whom had never met her in person, were desperate for any solution. Her qualifications were simple. She was compassionate. She was willing. And, like their children, she was a United States citizen.For years, T. never felt the need for such an extreme contingency plan. Now she was thinking of adding her own children to S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s list. \u201cImagine if they detained me too,\u201d she said after Javier was gone. She couldn\u2019t envision taking her American children with her to Mexico, where she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to give them education, shoes, clothes,\u201d and where they would be separated from their friends and lives and ambitions, from the only home they had ever known. But what would happen if they stayed behind, with no parents left to care for them?Families like Kelly\u2019s are known as \u201cmixed status\u201d \u2014 a reminder that the way we talk about immigration, with clear lines of legality separating groups of people, is often a fantasy. The reality is a world of families with separate legal statuses but intertwined fates. More than four million American children are estimated to have a parent in the country illegally. If deported, those parents face a difficult choice: Take their children to a country they do not know, whose language they may not speak and one that lacks the security and opportunities they have in the United States; or leave them behind, dividing the family. Courts have regularly responded to the argument that a parent\u2019s deportation will deny a child, as one lawyer put it, \u201cthe right which she has as an American citizen to continue to reside in the United States,\u201d with the counterargument that such children are not, in fact, deprived, because they retain the right to stay in their country and the right to live with their parents \u2014 just not both at the same time. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call a choiceless choice,\u201d says David B. Thronson, a professor at the Michigan State University College of Law, who helped found the Immigration Law Clinic.But it\u2019s a choice that\u2019s familiar to millions of families, including S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s. \u201cI lived that,\u201d she said one day when I met her at her office in the suburbs of Miami, a one-story stucco house that serves as the headquarters of the Nora S\u00e1ndigo Children Foundation. When she was 16, her parents sent her away from Nicaragua to escape the violence of its civil war; her family, she says, was targeted for opposing the Sandinistas. \u201cI feel like I am one of those kids,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause I came with the same problem. I had my father and mother, but I was an orphan without them. Separate from their parents, they become orphans, like me.\u201d She remembers sobbing as she watched the country of her birth recede from the plane window.When she left Nicaragua, S\u00e1ndigo went to Venezuela, then France, \u201ctrying to get something legal,\u201d and in 1988 finally ended up in the United States, where the organization that helped her settle here offered her a job working with other refugees from Central America and advocating for their asylum. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act was passed in 1997. In Miami, she helped other immigrants with paperwork and resettlement matters, like looking for apartments or jobs. She also started a business of small nursing homes, which, along with a plant nursery, helps cover her foundation\u2019s bills. She never went back to Nicaragua, not even when her father was dying. He told her to stay in the United States and be safe. It was her country now, he said.As S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s reputation grew, it became common for strangers in Miami\u2019s immigrant communities to seek her out, asking for help; the requests opened S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s eyes to the depth of people\u2019s need. She remembers bringing six towels to a woman with five children, who was shocked at the abundance: \u201cSo many!\u201dOne call, in 2006, was for a new kind of assistance: A Peruvian woman, whom S\u00e1ndigo had never met, was being held in a detention center, and she wanted to give S\u00e1ndigo power of attorney to make decisions about her children\u2019s care. (Unlike full legal guardianship, which is conferred by a court, power-of-attorney forms don\u2019t involve a transfer of parental rights.) Others in the center had warned her that if she didn\u2019t do something, she might lose her children to the child welfare system. S\u00e1ndigo doesn\u2019t know why the woman thought of her, but she felt honored, and obligated, by her trust: \u201cWhen she called she had the papers signed and notarized already in my name.\u201dThe Peruvian woman\u2019s children never called on S\u00e1ndigo, but word of what she had done got out. In 2009, a brother and sister, ages 9 and 11, showed up at S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s door with their uncle; their mother, they said, was in detention, and they weren\u2019t going to eat until she was released. S\u00e1ndigo remembers the oldest, Cecia, now a student at Georgetown University, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d to which she replied, \u201cBut this is an office, baby.\u201d Still, she made a place for them. Jerryann, one of S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s two biological daughters, recalled: \u201cYou were like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re going to stay the night.\u2019 And then one night became forever.\u201d The children moved in \u2014 they ended up staying for six years \u2014 the case attracted a lot of publicity and soon there was a steady stream of requests. \u201cThat gave the perception to the people, probably, that I was accepting the power of attorney from everyone in the same situation,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo said.Many of the people who contacted S\u00e1ndigo wanted only a temporary backup, a documented adult whom their kids could call in the moment of crisis to avoid ending up in the child-welfare system. According to an ICE spokeswoman, \u201cICE is committed to ensuring that the agency\u2019s immigration-enforcement activities, including detention and removal, do not unnecessarily disrupt the parental rights of alien parents and legal guardians of minor children.\u201d But navigating the immigration and child-welfare systems simultaneously can be difficult. Emily Butera, a senior policy adviser at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, told me that many parents have come to believe that they will lose their rights automatically: \u201cWe\u2019ve started explicitly saying to people, \u2018Your children are not the property of the U.S. government.\u2019\u2009\u201dOther parents planned for their children to stay with their undocumented friends or relatives, but wanted S\u00e1ndigo to sign papers or fill official roles that they couldn\u2019t. Still others hoped that their children would live with her, maybe for the remainder of their childhoods \u2014 something S\u00e1ndigo wasn\u2019t promising and worried that people assumed she was. But still, she never said no. When people came to her looking for help, S\u00e1ndigo found it impossible to deny them. The numbers grew into the dozens, and then to the hundreds. \u201cWe never planned this,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo said one day. \u201cIt was planned by nobody. It just came.\u201dIn April, a volunteer updated S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s spreadsheet of names and, before she had finished, showed S\u00e1ndigo a number that made her quail. \u201cWe are now at 1,089!\u201d she gasped \u2014 more than a thousand kids who might call her at any moment to say that their parents were gone and they needed help figuring out what to do. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much! Too many kids, in the last few months with Mr. Trump. The increase is incredible.\u201d The latest count is 1,252.S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s office is decorated with American and Nicaraguan flags and pictures of her \u2014 in neat makeup, her long auburn hair worn loose \u2014 meeting various politicians. Beyond the public spaces are two emergency bedrooms, their shelves filled with picture books and SAT prep guides, and a hallway stacked with beans and rice and diapers and condensed milk.The chance that many of these children would need her help all at once seemed higher now. In the past, it was unusual for ICE to deport both parents of a child \u2014 fathers were more common \u2014 but the immigrants S\u00e1ndigo knew feared that the rules were changing. The same month that ICE reported that its arrest of noncriminals had doubled under the new administration, a mother of four with no criminal record \u2014 someone who in previous years wouldn\u2019t have been a priority for enforcement \u2014 was deported from Ohio. S\u00e1ndigo saw the possible future of her charges. She estimates that perhaps a third of the children on her list have already had at least one parent deported. What if there were a sudden wave of children who needed her?\u201cThat could happen anytime,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s husband, Reymundo Otero, told her one day. \u201cIt\u2019s for real, you know.\u201dS\u00e1ndigo did know. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time or resources even for the first hundred kids,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo said. \u201cEven for the first 10!\u201dS\u00e1ndigo began pulling donated clothes out of her minivan. With S\u00e1ndigo was one of her wards, 16-year-old Ritibh, who was helping unload groceries. He was born in Washington State, but his parents were deported to India when he was 9. They were caught, he said, at a checkpoint while driving him to Disneyland. Though he had moved to India with them, he dreamed of finishing high school in the United States and going to the Naval Academy, so he contacted S\u00e1ndigo on Facebook and asked her to take him in. He was sure she\u2019d say no, that her famous helpfulness must be a scam. He had now been living with her for nearly eight months, and they had developed an easy rapport; he likes to help with family-support work, which often keeps them up late into the night. That evening, fueled by sugary coffee, they had rushed through a discount grocery store, piling cart after cart with staples. At the checkout, Ritibh practiced his Spanish with the cashier, listing what they had bought: 50 cucumbers, 20 bags of onions, six 20-packs of chicken legs, 20 gallons of milk, 20 loaves of bread and so on. \u201cAnd one bag of hot Cheetos for myself,\u201d he added.Ritibh kicked a soccer ball with some of the kids as S\u00e1ndigo caught up with their parents. She wasn\u2019t sure, when I asked her, which of the parents had actually entrusted her with their children\u2019s care; she would have to check her files. It didn\u2019t really matter, she said. The power-of-attorney forms were about the future, and most days it was all she could do to focus on more pressing needs. Kelly\u2019s mother confided that she\u2019d been fired from her job the week before, after reporting her supervisor to the police for physical assault. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to take care of the kids.While she talked, one of her daughters climbed into S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s lap. Kelly snuggled with a stuffed bear that she\u2019d pulled off the donation table. \u201cYou\u2019re on the floor!\u201d S\u00e1ndigo said, in English. \u201cOn a bear!\u201d But Kelly just looked up at her silently.Ever since her husband was detained, T. explained, Kelly had had no energy, no desire to eat. Before, she loved school and did her homework without being asked. But after the detention, she lay motionless on the couch. She didn\u2019t want to sleep; when she did sleep, she couldn\u2019t make herself get up. Within a week, her teacher called T. to ask what was wrong, saying that Kelly was \u201cnot the same student.\u201d She was always distracted, either staring at her fingernails or chewing on them. \u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s not there,\u201d the teacher said. When T. tried to make Kelly eat, she would cry and refuse. She had lost five pounds \u2014 a lot when you\u2019re supposed to be growing and you weigh only 45 pounds to begin with.T. was sure Kelly was sick. She took her to a pediatrician, but there was nothing physically wrong. \u201cWhy have you changed so much?\u201d she begged her child one day as they sat at the round wooden table squeezed between the couch and the kitchen, which she\u2019d painted teal and pink in an effort at cheerfulness. \u201cDid something happen to you? Was it at school? Trust me, tell me.\u201d\u201cI want my dad,\u201d Kelly answered. \u201cI need him with me. Why did they take him?\u201dLuis H. Zayas, a psychologist and the dean of the University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work, has examined many citizen children of undocumented parents, whom he refers to as \u201cforgotten citizens,\u201d a new generation of American exiles and orphans. The first to arouse his interest in the issue hadn\u2019t spoken at school in some 15 months, so great was her fear of revealing her parents\u2019 status. He calls what he sees \u201cpsychological erosion\u201d: clinical levels of depression, separation anxiety and low self-esteem. As Joanna Dreby, a sociologist at the University at Albany, writes, even \u201cthe threat of deportability\u201d can be devastating, plunging children into a state of constant dread and hypervigilance.T. herself was afraid. Driving was a huge risk given that she had no license and that a misdemeanor could get her deported (\u201cIf you go out to work, you risk everything,\u201d she said), but she began taking Kelly across the county twice a week to see a psychologist. She didn\u2019t know what else to do for her daughter. \u201cFor her \u2014 her world, I don\u2019t know, it ended.\u201dBefore Trump was elected, S\u00e1ndigo dreamed of a political solution for her young charges that went far beyond housing. In April 2016, she took some of them, including T. and her daughters, to Washington to advocate for an Obama order known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), a kind of sister action to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that would have allowed parents to apply for work permits and temporary protection from deportation in order to care for their kids. Thanks to a lawsuit and a split Supreme Court, DAPA never went into effect, and this June the Trump administration officially rescinded it.In United States family law, \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d is a widely accepted standard. Judges are required to use it in every state when deciding custody cases, and dozens of states explicitly list the maintenance of family unity or family emotional ties as primary components of \u201cbest interests.\u201d Immigration law is the exception. Children affected by their parents\u2019 immigration cases \u201chave no opportunity for their best interests to be considered,\u201d writes Bridgette A. Carr, founding director of the University of Michigan Law School\u2019s Human Trafficking Clinic. The closest option, before 1996, was that immigrants living in the United States for at least seven years could petition to cancel their removal on the grounds that it would cause \u201cextreme hardship\u201d for themselves, their children or other qualifying relatives. Acceptable reasons included war in the home country or serious medical needs. Hardships like being separated from your parents or having to leave your country usually didn\u2019t count, explains Thronson, of the Immigration Law Clinic, because \u201cthat always happens in deportation \u2014 that\u2019s just your starting point.\u201dIn the immigration overhaul of the mid-1990s, Congress made the standard even harder to meet, changing \u201cextreme hardship\u201d to \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d and imposing a limit of 4,000 cases a year. Alfonso Oviedo-Reyes, a lawyer who works with S\u00e1ndigo, says he\u2019s lucky if one client qualifies a year. \u201cThey should have said a nearly impossible hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can withstand it!\u201d\u201cGenerally speaking, under the law,\u201d says Donald L. Schlemmer, an attorney specializing in immigration law, \u201cif there\u2019s some kind of wrong, there should be some kind of remedy \u2014 or at least you should have your day in court.\u201d But the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, the same 1996 law that raised the standard for deportation relief, made it much more difficult to use class-action lawsuits to challenge immigration policies. When S\u00e1ndigo tried filing a lawsuit in federal circuit court in 2007, on which Schlemmer worked, they were told that only the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear such cases; when she brought the case to the Supreme Court, the clerk replied with a letter explaining that there was no jurisdiction there either. Oviedo-Reyes says that letter is their chance: proof that citizen children, unconstitutionally, have nowhere to go for redress.Since Trump\u2019s election, S\u00e1ndigo has been combing through her list of children to see which would be good candidates for a class-action lawsuit \u2014 something that might lead to the kind of law that helped the Central American refugees she worked with. She wants the suit to reflect the variety of children\u2019s experiences: some with both parents gone, some with one, some simply afraid of losing either. She put Ritibh\u2019s name on her list; he was so gregarious and happy to tell his story. (\u201cI have the tunnels under the Congress memorized,\u201d he told me.) She also added Valerie, 17, and Matthew, 15, a sister and brother born and raised in Fort Lauderdale whose undocumented parents took them to their home country, Colombia. Once there, they were threatened by people attempting to extort the family, with its American ties. Their mother contacted S\u00e1ndigo on Facebook, asking her to take the children in. \u201cShe explained that if I don\u2019t do anything her kids would be kidnapped or dead,\u201d S\u00e1ndigo says.Valerie was counting on being reunited with her parents through DAPA. When it failed, she says, \u201call my hopes went down. I just started to cry. It was bad.\u201d Like other children in her situation, she has only one legal avenue: wait until she\u2019s not a child anymore, and then, when she has fewer needs but more rights, try to sponsor her parents for green cards. To get her parents back, Valerie says, \u201cI have to wait until I\u2019m 21.\u201dKelly was more animated than she had been a few months before. The psychologist had played games with her and explained, as Kelly put it: \u201cI need to get better so I can have more energy. I need to eat food so I can\u2019t be dead.\u201d But what helped the most, T. thought, was when Javier was released from detention to return to Mexico. From there, he could at least talk to her on the phone every day.Still, things were hardly back to normal; Kelly had just failed the school year. She looked over at her mother signing the papers. \u201cEach day I get sadder and sadder,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to tell my mom because she could get worried about me.\u201dAnother family stepped forward: a couple and their three American sons, ages 3, 10 and 11. The youngest was wearing a Mickey Mouse hat. They drove from Broward County after learning on a local news segment the day before about S\u00e1ndigo and her willingness to serve as a guardian. Though they didn\u2019t need S\u00e1ndigo\u2019s help financially, they were thrilled to have an emergency plan to offer their sons: Before, \u201cwe just told them not to answer the door when they came and knocked,\u201d the mother said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth \u2014 how scared they are,\u201d the father said. \u201cI imagine they are.\u201dThe family took their turn with the notary, then stuck around to eat cake and sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Matthew, who was turning 15 that day, far from his parents. \u201cIt\u2019s already my second birthday without them,\u201d he said. He misses them the most, he said, when he scores a goal at a soccer game. \u201cHe sees friends with their parents, all the social media posts with parents,\u201d explained Valerie, in braces and pastel-blue fingernail polish. \u201cSometimes he asks me, \u2018Why can\u2019t we be with them?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re asking the wrong person.\u2019\u2009\u201dValerie\u2019s phone rang; it was their mother, asking how the birthday was going. Valerie estimated it was the 10th call of the day from her. During the school year, the first ring always comes at 6 a.m., a long-distance version of the wake-ups that used to happen in person.Finally, space was found for all the diaper bags and suitcases and gallons of frozen milk. The kids lined up for a group photo around an American flag. The plan was to drive through the night, a challenge with so few licensable drivers among the adults. The vans pulled out past a small lineup of news cameras.A few minutes later, they were back. S\u00e1ndigo had gotten a call from the only English-language station to respond to her news release: The cameraman was running late. S\u00e1ndigo agreed to redo the exit scene. \u201cFor us, the English news is the most important,\u201d she said. Its viewers were the ones whom she most wanted to hear from the children, their fellow citizens.Kelly and the others dutifully spilled out of the van into the sunshine. Valerie, in her native, teenage English, told the new camera the same things she\u2019d told the others in Spanish: about missing her parents, about how hard it was. She was proud that she\u2019d finally learned to talk about them without crying.Then the children all climbed back inside for another try at reaching their nation\u2019s capital.The cameraman stood in the empty street for a long time, watching them disappear.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "That Game on Your Phone May Be Tracking What You\u2019re Watching on TV", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the gaming apps \u2014 with names like \u201cPool 3D,\u201d \u201cBeer Pong: Trickshot\u201d and \u201cReal Bowling Strike 10 Pin\u201d \u2014 seem innocuous. One called \u201cHoney Quest\u201d features Jumbo, an animated bear.Yet these apps, once downloaded onto a smartphone, have the ability to keep tabs on the viewing habits of their users \u2014 some of whom may be children \u2014 even when the games aren\u2019t being played.It is yet another example of how companies, using devices that many people feel they can\u2019t do without, are documenting how audiences in a rapidly changing entertainment landscape are viewing television and commercials.The apps use software from Alphonso, a start-up that collects TV-viewing data for advertisers. Using a smartphone\u2019s microphone, Alphonso\u2019s software can detail what people watch by identifying audio signals in TV ads and shows, sometimes even matching that information with the places people visit and the movies they see. The information can then be used to target ads more precisely and to try to analyze things like which ads prompted a person to go to a car dealership.Some of the tracking is taking place through gaming apps that do not otherwise involve a smartphone\u2019s microphone, including some apps that are geared toward children. The software can also detect sounds even when a phone is in a pocket if the apps are running in the background.The spread of these technologies, combined with the proliferation of internet-connected TVs and tools that can identify video content through pixels and audio snippets, has resulted in some questionable practices.Companies gathering such data, especially through games, need to make their business practices clear to consumers \u201cbecause it\u2019s so inherently unexpected and surprising,\u201d said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union, and a former policy director at the trade commission who worked on the Silverpush case.\u201cWhen you see \u2018permission for microphone access for ads,\u2019 it may not be clear to a user that, Oh, this means it\u2019s going to be listening to what I do all the time to see if I\u2019m watching \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cThey need to go above and beyond and be careful to make sure consumers know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThrough its software, Alphonso can follow the ads that people see in friends\u2019 homes and elsewhere. The company has also worked with movie studios to figure out theater-viewing habits, Mr. Chordia, Alphonso\u2019s chief executive, said. Smartphone apps that are running Alphonso\u2019s software, even if they are not actively in use, can detect movies based on film snippets provided by the studios ahead of time.\u201cA lot of the folks will go and turn off their phone, but a small portion of people don\u2019t and put it in their pocket,\u201d Mr. Chordia said. \u201cIn those cases, we are able to pick up in a small sample who is watching the show or the movie.\u201d Mr. Chordia said that Alphonso has a deal with the music-listening app Shazam, which has microphone access on many phones. Alphonso is able to provide the snippets it picks up to Shazam, he said, which can use its own content-recognition technology to identify users and then sell that information to Alphonso.Founded in 2013, Alphonso initially focused on working with apps to capitalize on ads through so-called second-screen viewing, as people increasingly turned their attention to smartphones and tablets during TV breaks. Now, the company has broadened its focus to gathering troves of viewing data from companies like TiVo and directly from TVs and streaming devices through deals with manufacturers.The disparate viewing information is tied to IP addresses, which can be matched to characteristics like age, gender, income and more through big data brokers like Experian without using personally identifiable information like names and addresses.\u201cWe have to be really careful as we have more devices capturing more information in living rooms and bedrooms and on the street and in other people\u2019s homes that the public is not blindsided and surprised by things,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s legal. It is what\u2019s not creepy.\u201dOn the other hand, many people have had issues recognizing audio through apps like Shazam if there is too much background noise, so it\u2019s not clear how much information Alphonso\u2019s apps can pick up on a daily basis.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not normally, I don\u2019t think, going to be expected that an application is going to be listening for what you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily expecting your TV to be watching what you\u2019re doing either.\u201dNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Beat the Line and Get Reservations at Hot New Restaurants", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor food fans, it\u2019s the worst: Everyone, from the restaurant critic you would trust with your death-row meal to your co-worker who always has the best leftovers, has visited the newest hot spot, but you can\u2019t snag a table.Don\u2019t despair: We talked to restaurant critics, professional food writers and reservationists (the people who accept yours) to get their tips for getting into the most popular places.Although convoluted reservation techniques and cutthroat competition for tables can make eating at a hot table feel like a privilege, restaurants exist to please customers.\u201cRestaurants are a service industry. They want to serve,\u201d said Sam Sifton, the Food editor at The New York Times. \u201cGive them a reason to, and they\u2019ll try \u2014 at least the good ones will try.\u201dEspecially when calling reservationists, playing nice with the gatekeeper goes a long way, and not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do.Pete Wells, the restaurant critic at The Times, agrees. \u201cYou have to break out of that mind-set that you can get everything you want with the touch of a finger,\u201d he explained. Many restaurants \u2014 especially popular ones \u2014 do not list their prime-time tables on reservation apps or online. If, say, Barack Obama doesn\u2019t call by the afternoon before dinner service, making a phone call might secure that coveted seat.\u201cYou can also get a better sense from the reservationist about when you have the best chance of grabbing a reservation,\u201d Ms. Preston added. \u201cThey might be able to tell you if certain days or times are slower, or if it\u2019s easy to dine at the bar. Sometimes the best source of advice on how to get a reservation is a person who actually works there.\u201dIn any case, staying flexible is essential when trying to nab that hot spot.It may sound counterintuitive, but bringing a larger party can actually help you land seats. Choosing off-peak times and having a list of restaurants to cycle through also increase your chances of getting a great meal. Every food expert we consulted emphasized the importance of flexibility. Saturday nights at 8 p.m. tend to go quickly, so strategize carefully.Of course, sometimes you want to eat dinner at, well, dinner time. In that case, think about sitting somewhere other than the dining room.\u201cA little tip from us would be to visit our lounge,\u201d Ms. Sheary said. \u201cThe lounge is a great way to experience Le Bernardin without requiring advance reservations or too much planning.\u201dMany restaurants offer special menus at the bar or in the lounge, so sitting there might get you better prices, too.\u201cI know some people want a table, but I love eating at the bar if it\u2019s just two of us. You almost always get great service because the bartender\u2019s right there,\u201d Ms. Preston noted.While many restaurants use their social media presence solely for marketing purposes, that\u2019s not always the case.\u201cWe do have some guests who, after waiting almost a whole year, find they need to cancel their reservation,\u201d said its front of house manager and reservationist, Mary Ellen Whitmire. \u201cWhen this happens, we post open dates on Instagram, Facebook, our website, and send emails to those signed up for our mailing list.\u201dNot all of these methods are an exact science. While Ms. Izzo recommended putting yourself on a waiting list for a hot table, Mr. Wells said that method has never worked for him.\u201cIf they\u2019re popular enough to have a waiting list, someone\u2019s going to call them for a table,\u201d he reasoned.\u201cAnother method is to call the restaurant and tell the reservationist that you\u2019re in town for a day and will die if you can\u2019t get into that particular restaurant,\u201d Mr. Sietsema suggested. \u201cSay you will be glad to take a cancellation at any time. And mean it.\u201dAs with anything else, follow-up is key.\u201cIf you do score a table at the hot restaurant and you love your meal? Don\u2019t be a dope,\u201d Mr. Sifton advised. \u201cMake a reservation to come back on your way out the door. No one gets better treatment in a restaurant than a regular.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Long after publication. Long after the headlines fade and readers move on to the next big news event.Yet in the kinetic media world, it is rare that a journalist gets to return to those people and places and continue the conversation.I was fortunate recently to be able to do just that.Many months after I\u2019d finished my reporting, I still wondered how Sunayana Dumala and Mindy Corporon were rebuilding their lives after their loved ones were killed three years apart in Kansas hate crimes.On Dec. 6, I went back to the Kansas area to reconnect with them, and to meet interested readers, at a public forum on the campus of Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Mo.A question posed in March by Marc Lacey, The Times\u2019s national editor, helped to shape my original assignment and, in a broader way, my focus on the aftermath of hate crimes. The question was deceptively simple: What happens to the families of hate crimes\u2019 victims?Mr. Lacey made another suggestion: Go beyond the horror; find the humanity.During four visits, I went with Ms. Dumala to temple, the grocery store and singing lessons. Sometimes she would share her most precious memories of her husband. Other times, we sat in silence, which was equally revealing, because there is power in stillness. I wanted to chronicle her grief, explore cultural differences and understand the ruin left behind. But it was also a way to think about the nation\u2019s fault lines of race, ethnicity and otherness.Ms. Dumala agreed to tell her story because she believed people needed to see the victims as humans rather than statistics.Along the way, I learned about Ms. Corporon, whose father, William Lewis Corporon, and 14-year-old son, Reat Griffin Underwood, were killed by a white supremacist in the parking lot of a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kan., in April 2014. The two crimes were similar and familiar.The public forum included Ms. Dumala, Ms. Corporon and Ian Grillot, who was wounded that dreadful night in February as he tried to stop the gunman at the Olathe bar. Onstage, I still struggled to find the right words to ask them about the deaths. I stammered through those opening questions and the F.B.I.\u2019s hate crime statistics \u2014 there were 6,121 bias-motivated criminal incidents in 2016 \u2014 feeling awful that I was calling on them, once again, to revisit the most painful details. Afterward, Ms. Dumala and Ms. Corporon said their mission was to fight hate and never let Kansas \u2014 and the rest of America \u2014 forget the husband, father and son they lost, even if that meant sharing the events of Feb. 22, 2017, and April 13, 2014, over and over.\u201cSpread love, spread humanity,\u201d Ms. Dumala told the audience as a final thought. \u201cLive for each other, care for each other.\u201dAfterward, community members told me they wanted The Times to write more about local gentrification, the reintegration of neighborhoods, the juvenile justice system and how people have recovered from trauma.Repeatedly, I was asked why I went to Kansas in the first place. My answer was straightforward: We go to the story.These days, my job is to explore hate, one of the nation\u2019s most vexing social issues, wherever it unfolds, and also to share the next chapter after the front-page headlines.In Kansas, for Ms. Dumala and Ms. Corporon, that next chapter is an anti-hate movement built on kindness.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Months After Maria, Roughly Half of Puerto Ricans Still Without Power", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time in the 100 days since Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico, the government finally knows how many people still don\u2019t have power: about half.\u201cWe understand how difficult it has been for the people for Puerto Rico who have been without power for so long,\u201d said Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, the governor of Puerto Rico, as he announced a request for up to 1,500 more restoration workers from the mainland\u2019s electric industry.In its statement on Friday, the authorities said power restoration has been slow because of the sheer scale and complexity of the damage. Much of the island\u2019s 2,400 miles of transmission lines, 30,000 miles of distribution lines and 342 substations were damaged in the storm, they said. Carlos D. Torres, the system\u2019s restoration coordinator, said workers were finding \u201cunexpected damage\u201d in some areas even as they make repairs in others.Jos\u00e9 E. S\u00e1nchez, who heads the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers task force to restore power in Puerto Rico, said some homes were so damaged they are unable to receive electricity, though he did not know how many homes were in that situation.The island\u2019s governor and power utility said that of the homes that could receive electricity, roughly 55 percent have had their service restored. He noted that the government\u2019s new estimate includes five towns that recently received temporary fixes from Corps generators.Mr. S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the 55 percent restoration was hardly a success.\u201c55 percent? No, oh my gosh, I want it quicker, faster, better,\u201d he said.He said the Corps has increased its number of crews working on the island, and many of the materials ordered in October are beginning to arrive. Some private companies that had committed to help Puerto Rico will begin to arrive in January.Several investor-owned electric companies that are members of the Edison Electric Institute will deploy nearly 1,500 additional restoration workers and support personnel to Puerto Rico in early January to accelerate ongoing power restoration efforts across the island, the agency announced Thursday.Mr. S\u00e1nchez said the companies faced the same kind of logistical challenges that kept them from arriving sooner.\u201cA lot of people are angry,\u201d said Cannabis Nebot, 43, who lives in Arecibo, where power was largely restored. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe what the government says about the power outage. You can see on Facebook a lot of people saying that they got no light. A lot of people in the countryside have no light. Or some towns have it, but it comes and goes.\u201dThe government had previously not been able to say how many people had power because of damage to the outage management system. The government has repaired the fiber optic cables that allow the system to read meters.\u201cWe won\u2019t be satisfied until it\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d said Gerardo Qui\u00f1ones, a spokesman for Prepa. \u201cThe media can criticize all it wants, but this is a result of a lot of hard work.

{"Headline": "Marina Popovich, Record-Breaking Soviet Test Pilot, Is Dead", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarina L. Popovich, a test pilot who broke more than 100 flying records and who was the first Soviet woman to break the sound barrier, died in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia on Nov. 30.Her age was unclear; Tass listed her as 86, but it also said she had added six years to her age as a young woman in order to enroll in a military flight school.Ms. Popovich followed in the footsteps of female aviators who had gained prominence in the Soviet military during World War II, some of whom were called the Night Witches by German forces.\u201cThe first flights on a high-speed fighter jet were breathtaking,\u201d she told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in 2012. \u201cBefore I even pull up the chassis on takeoff, the sky turns dark violet, and there are small unblinking stars in the zenith.\u201dShe broke the sound barrier in 1964 flying a MiG-21 fighter jet for the State Red-Banner Scientific Research Institute, run by the Air Force.\u201cA pilot is overcome with a special kind of inner excitement after breaking the sound barrier,\u201d she said.She was the third woman to achieve that feat. The American pilot Jacqueline Cochran was the first, in 1953. Jacqueline Auriol of France broke the sound barrier later that year.Marina Lavrentyevna Vasilyeva was born in what is now the Smolensk region of Russia, west of Moscow. Her father was a musician, and she was expected to become one, too, until German troops advanced on her town in World War II, forcing the family to flee.They settled in Novosibirsk, more than 2,000 miles to the east, where she decided to become a pilot \u201cto take revenge on the fascists,\u201d she told a magazine for military officers\u2019 wives in 2011. She said she had also been inspired by her uncle, who was a fighter pilot.She made her first attempt to learn to fly at age 14. But at 4 feet 9 inches tall, she was so small \u2014 \u201cpractically a Lilliputian,\u201d she said \u2014 that her feet could not reach the pedals. Determined nevertheless, she hung herself upside down using alpine ropes in the hope that it would make her grow. Whether by those means or naturally, at 16 she ultimately cleared 5 feet and was able to join an air club.But her advancement was stalled by bureaucratic barriers; once the war was over, women were no longer permitted to fly.She managed to gain an audience with Kliment Voroshilov, a prominent Soviet military officer, and she was accepted into an aviation academy. She also graduated from a civil aviation academy in Leningrad.Despite their initial skepticism, most male instructors and pilots came to be in awe of her.\u201cShe learned strikingly fast,\u201d Nikolai A. Bondarenko, a test pilot, wrote in his memoirs, adding that she had piloted an L-29 fighter jet \u201cas confidently as she walked the ground.\u201dIn \u201cThe First Soviet Cosmonaut Team: Their Lives and Legacies\u201d (2009), the space historians Colin Burgess and Rex Hall wrote that most of Ms. Popovich\u2019s success \u201cwould lead to later speculation that she was about to become the first Soviet woman to travel into space.\u201dAt one point the Soviet space program did train female cosmonauts, and Ms. Popovich was admitted for testing. But ultimately only one, Valentina Tereshkova, was sent into space. Ms. Popovich said that she was advised to focus on her family, and that she was forced out of the program.\u201cI and a group of women were rejected,\u201d she told the news site Pravda.ru in 2011. \u201cOfficially I was told: \u2018You have a small daughter, so we\u2019re not going to take the risk, we\u2019re only taking unmarried women.\u2019 Well then, why did they subject me to testing for two months, torment me?\u201dHer disappointment was heightened by the fact that she lived among some of the first cosmonauts. Her first husband, Pavel R. Popovich, trained with Yuri A. Gagarin, who in 1961 became the first human to orbit Earth. Mr. Gagarin was their neighbor in Star City, the space training center near Moscow.Ms. Popovich told Seagull, a Russian-American magazine, in an interview published in 2008 that she even declared a hunger strike in protest, only to be told by generals overseeing the cosmonauts that she \u201cshould let your husband fly first, and then you can.\u201dHer marriage to Mr. Popovich, with whom she had two daughters, ended in divorce in the 1980s. She is survived by her second husband, Boris A. Zhikhorev, also a pilot; her daughters, Natalia and Oksana; and three grandchildren.\u201cBefore we pilots used to be afraid to say a word about this because we\u2019d be sent straight to the loony bin,\u201d she told Seagull magazine.\u201cI saw rivers drying up, lakes dying, the whole ecological disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew we would have to call a higher intelligence to enlighten us, to guide us through this mess.\u201dThere were, Ms. Popovich insisted, no atheists among her fellow pilots.\u201cWe didn\u2019t go to church, we didn\u2019t pray, but we had faith,\u201d she said in 2008. \u201cTest pilots are in contact with something sublime.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year\u2019s Best Baking Cookbooks, for Novices and Pros", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCookbooksNovice bakers might be hesitant about folding egg whites and proofing yeast, but nothing frightens their floury souls more than the prospect of making pie dough from scratch.The authors of this year\u2019s books \u2014 a stunningly photographed and ambitious lot \u2014 know that for average cooks, advanced baking can be an intimidating trial. Without a guide, exploring beyond muffins or brownies is like taking a test you haven\u2019t studied for. But home bakers can move into more sweetly complex territory while they graduate from snickerdoodles to French macarons, from muffins to homemade chocolate croissants. And all of these volumes are up to the task.These books ease baking anxiety by explaining the whys behind every technique, and giving myriad tips for skirting the usual baking mistakes. There are no hidden prerequisites here; the authors spell everything out.But even though written for novices, the best of these titles are a boon for bakers of any skill level. Because even if someone isn\u2019t at all intimidated by making a pie crust (or a chocolate croissant for that matter), true pastry geeks know there\u2019s always room to learn how to make a better one.My biggest takeaway was to stop using the food processor. Although the machine does bring everything together in a flash and without the possibility that the heat of your hands will melt the butter, it\u2019s also too easy to overprocess, yielding a crust that\u2019s tender but flat as a cracker.As Ms. McDowell promises, mixing by hand gives you more control, thus a flakier result. And if you have perpetually cold hands, as I do, spending a few minutes squashing butter doesn\u2019t seem to do the cubes any harm.There are dozens of simpler recipes in the book as well, including a cinnamon-scented, fudgy, one-bowl flourless cocoa cookie that my daughter and I stirred together in minutes. A gluten-free keeper for sure.It\u2019s an excellent recipe, but it\u2019s not the main reason you should buy her book. Buy it for her fascinating historical essays that show, over and over, how many of our favorite American dessert recipes (pumpkin pie, white mountain cake and chocolate fudge, to name just a few) were adapted and popularized by corporate food manufacturers pushing product.Ms. Parks\u2019s subversive brilliance is in recreating these sugary classics entirely from scratch, substituting homemade sweetened condensed milk for canned in her tangy Key lime pie, and using freeze-dried corn and malted milk powder in her homemade animal crackers to mimic the store-bought versions\u2019 mellow flavor. The recipes are not quick and they aren\u2019t easy, but they are often delicious, well explained and very thorough.Mr. Yosses\u2019 kabocha persimmon pie, a fluffy riff on pumpkin pie, calls for only three tablespoons of sweetener (maple syrup and honey), relying on the natural sugars of dead-ripe persimmons and roasted, caramelized squash. His Pavlova uses two-thirds less sugar than the standard meringue, with a dash of yogurt powder to give the egg whites bulk and structure. It\u2019s a testament to his skill and ingenuity that he\u2019s able to pull off such low-sugar feats that don\u2019t lack a thing in terms of sweet satisfaction.But beyond the purple prose are excellent recipes with exacting instructions. For the crisp-crusted, nicely oily pizza bianca, you\u2019ll know that the dough has been kneaded enough when it is trying to climb up the mixer paddle. Helpful visual cues like this abound.The book also features recipes for a handful of roasted meats and vegetables, salads and a smattering of cakes and tarts. The unassuming chocolate-chip banana cake, in particular, flavored with molasses and spices, was outstanding \u2014 caramel-flavored, aromatic and happily damp.The book offers all these classic recipes and an eclectic assortment of others that reflect the wide-ranging interests of the bakers who have passed through the community over the years. There\u2019s chewy dinkelbrot (German spelt bread), \u201cnew deli\u201d crumb cake (a delectable Indian-spiced coconut and pistachio version), langos (Hungarian fried potato flatbread) and, yes, plenty of pies, along with a comprehensive pie crust recipe to round out the offerings.After all, how can you resist a crunchy-sweet brittle with smoked almonds and cacao nibs, hot chocolate cookies with toasted marshmallows and Aleppo pepper, or tender thumbprints with spicy cardamom plum jam?All of these books guide with a gentle and humorous hand, perfect for those who long to know everything about baking \u2014 as well as those who thought they already did.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it\u2019s likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon\u2019s listing of own-label products ahead of competitors\u2019 offerings.The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It\u2019s probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere \u2014 reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.Parts of Europe\u2019s agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it\u2019s no monopolist. The iPhone\u2019s combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects\u2019 phones. Apple\u2019s inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.Apple is not carefree. The company\u2019s attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine.

The Ministry of Information said on Facebook that they had tried to obtain information relating to Rakhine State in western Myanmar. A campaign of killings, rape and arson carried out in Rakhine by Myanmar\u2019s military has driven more than 620,000 Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh since August.The ministry said the reporters had been accused of violating Myanmar\u2019s sweeping Official Secrets Act, which dates from 1923, when the country, also known as Burma, was under British rule. The two could face up to 14 years in prison. Two police officers were also charged, according to the ministry, which posted a photo of the reporters in handcuffs.\u201cFor a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,\u201d the embassy said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the government to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the journalists.\u201dU Myint Kyaw, a member of the Myanmar Press Council, an independent organization that advocates for the news media, said that 80 to 90 percent of government documents were considered confidential or secret under the Official Secrets Act.\u201cWe are very concerned about the arrests of these two journalists,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few documents are public documents. We don\u2019t have a freedom of information act in our country yet.\u201dHe said that Parliament had considered modifying the law in 2014, but that the changes were opposed by the Home Affairs Ministry, which is under military control.Reuters said that Wa Lone joined the news agency in June 2016 and had covered a range of stories, including the Rohingya crisis in Rakhine. Kyaw Soe Oo began working for Reuters in September.Press advocates and human rights activists expressed concern that the arrests were part of a growing crackdown on press freedom in recent months.In November, a judge sentenced two foreign journalists, their interpreter and their driver to two months in prison on charges of filming with a drone without official permission. The journalists, Mok Choy Lin, a Malaysian citizen, and Lau Hon Meng, a Singaporean citizen, were on assignment for TRT World, Turkey\u2019s state broadcaster.In June, the military arrested three journalists who had been reporting on an event organized by a rebel army in northern Shan State. The three were accused of violating another colonial-era law, against unlawful association. They were released after more than two months in custody.\u201cWhile the circumstances of the arrest of the two Reuters journalists remain unclear, their detention comes on the heels of the arrests of journalists in multiple parts of Burma under a variety of charges,\u201d said Richard Weir, a researcher with Human Rights Watch.\u201cThree journalists arrested and later released in Shan State by the military earlier this year were merely arrested for doing their jobs,\u201d he added. \u201cJournalists across Burma have also come under increasing pressure for criticizing the government and military.\u201dWai Moe contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses.It was an all-consuming job.\u201cI have had dreams about Fingerlings,\u201d she said.On Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25 minutes, Ms. Oliver said.\u201cThey are the only one that if I throw it up on social media I feel like my people have a chance to get it before it disappears,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had readers comment that they\u2019ve put the Fingerlings in their cart on the Walmart website and when they go to check out, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWalmart did not respond to a request for comment.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us says on its website that Fingerlings are available in its brick-and-mortar stores. When asked about the cyber bots, the retailer declined to comment, referring instead to a statement from Christin Fernandez, vice president for communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association that said retailers and suppliers \u201care working around the clock to make sure American families have access to the season\u2019s hottest items\u201d and are \u201ccommitted to taking precautions to mitigate fraud and illegal transactions.\u201dAmazon said Tuesday that it monitors bot buying activity, and attempts to limit the purchase of high-demand products.Target has also taken measures to deter resellers, said a company spokesman, Eddie Baeb, \u201cincluding quantity limits for purchases and technologies designed to help us monitor and prevent reseller activity.\u201dOther hot toys, like the Barbie Hello Dreamhouse, the L.O.L. Surprise! Doll and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition have also sold out, but are appearing on Amazon and eBay advertised at prices several times higher than retail.\u201cThe entire ecosystem breaks down,\u201d Mr. Iluz said. Bots are making legal purchases, but they don\u2019t become loyal customers, and they won\u2019t leave positive reviews.And customers get frustrated.\u201cWhen an advertised item is unavailable because of out-of-stocks, customers don\u2019t blame bots, they blame the retailer,\u201d Roger Beahm, a professor of marketing at the Wake Forest University School of Business, said in an email.On Sunday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, asked retail trade associations to take action.\u201cWhen it comes to purchasing products online, major retailers should put forth policies that will help prevent future Grinch bots from stealing the season\u2019s hottest toys,\u201d he said in a statement.Unusual purchases ought to raise a red flag said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.\u201cSay there\u2019s a suspicious order placed \u2014 for example a massive quantity at extreme speed \u2014 they should be able to have some human intervention in that transaction and potentially block the sale,\u201d Mr. Roefaro said in an email.David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Monday that the federation shares Mr. Schumer\u2019s concerns, \u201cand we look forward to working with him and all interested parties to strengthen enforcement against bad actors and take away the tools being used against innocent consumers, particularly during the holiday season.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who also co-sponsored the BOTS Act, said in a phone interview Tuesday that he aimed to introduce new legislation to combat the \u201cplague\u201d of bots that buy up toys, sneakers and other popular retail items.\u201cI think if there was a specific law it would encourage and empower the Federal Trade Commission or criminal investigators to go after them, and we might learn more about them and identify some of the specific culprits,\u201d he said.The yearly rush to buy the hottest toy is often guided by emotions, Mr. Beahm said.Advertisement"}

Prosecutors on Thursday increased the top charge against him, and a judge said the case could proceed.Ms. Heyer\u2019s parents and many of the surviving victims sat in the courtroom, as a police detective, Steven Young, described finding \u201cblood and flesh on the front of the vehicle\u201d when he approached Mr. Fields\u2019s 2010 Dodge Challenger, about a mile from the episode.The prosecution played two graphic videos of the attack that had never before been seen in public; people in the gallery watched, transfixed, and some victims \u2014 two were on crutches \u2014 bowed their heads and dabbed their eyes. Several of the victims wore purple shirts with a picture of Ms. Heyer and her last Facebook post, which has become a national catchphrase: \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201dSeeing the video images, Marcus Martin, the young man in a widely shared photo of him being flipped into the air by the speeding car, jumped up from his seat, shouted \u201cTake me out,\u201d and left with two companions.One video, taken from a police helicopter, showed a car plowing into the pedestrians, drawing a string of profanities from the officers in the aircraft.\u201cDid you see that?\u201d one asks. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he did that.\u201dThe other video, taken from a restaurant near the scene of the attack, the Red Pump Kitchen, showed a string of vehicles heading south on 4th Street, and then the Challenger zooming past.\u201cThat really shook me up; my heart really dropped,\u201d said Rosia Parker, who sat through the proceedings and said she was standing a few feet from Ms. Heyer at the time of the impact.Photos taken the morning of Ms. Heyer\u2019s death show Mr. Fields with members of one such group \u2014 which denied any connection to him \u2014 carrying a shield with one of its emblems.Detective Young, the sole witness at the hearing, said under questioning by Mr. Fields\u2019s lawyer, Denise Lunsford, that investigators had found no evidence that Mr. Fields was affiliated with any of the groups assembled that day.The detective said that while there were holes in the Challenger\u2019s back window, made by outraged people after the impact, there was no evidence of anything hitting the car before it struck the crowd. That testimony was apparently intended to undercut any argument that Mr. Fields had been under attack.Mr. Fields, wearing prison stripes and a beard, sat through the hearing showing no reaction to the videos or the testimony.The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office had initially filed second-degree murder, punishable by five to 40 years in prison, as the most serious charge against Mr. Fields. But on Thursday, they sought to raise that to first-degree murder, with a penalty of 20 years to life, and the judge agreed.The certification of the charges by Judge Downer means that prosecutors will take the case to a grand jury on Monday to seek an indictment.Earlier in the day, the judge certified felony charges of malicious wounding against Jacob Goodwin and Alex Ramos, who were part of a group accused of beating DeAndre Harris, a black man, in a parking garage during the same outbreak of violence.The man who organized the rally, Jason Kessler, denounced what he called a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d for the charges against Mr. Ramos and Mr. Goodwin, and called Charlottesville a communist city.Hawes Spencer reported from Charlottesville, Va., and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Condemns Executions of 38 Prisoners in Iraq", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The United Nations said Friday that it was appalled by a mass execution of prisoners in Iraq and called for an immediate halt to executions, citing flaws in the country\u2019s criminal justice system.Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Justice said 38 prisoners were executed on terrorism-related charges in the southern city of Nasiriya on Thursday, but it gave no details of the prisoners\u2019 identities or the offenses for which they were sentenced to death.\u201cGiven the flaws of the Iraqi justice system, it appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases,\u201d Elizabeth Throssell, a spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office in Geneva, told reporters. \u201cThis raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life.\u201dIraqi courts are dealing with thousands of prisoners, including foreigners and hundreds of children, some as young as 13, who were detained in the past two years because they were suspected of being Islamic State fighters or supporters.Gruesome accounts of summary executions and the brutal torture of detainees suspected of being Islamic State fighters underscore the powerful impulse for revenge against the militants, who carried out atrocities in the areas they seized after 2014.United Nations human rights officials have said that speeding up the execution of accused militants could result in the deaths of innocent people. They warn that perceptions of injustice risk deepening the antagonism between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and lay the foundation for another cycle of sectarian violence.Thursday\u2019s executions raised the number of people believed to have been executed this year to 106, Ms. Throssell said, but the actual number could be much higher.United Nations officials learned of the executions from a statement posted on the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Facebook page, she said. The government has stopped providing information on executions, and human rights investigators suspect that many go unrecorded.Iraqi authorities disclosed 88 executions in 2016, but the number could have been as high as 116, Ms. Throssell said. Human rights groups fear that the pace of executions is set to rise.Thursday\u2019s executions were the largest number in Iraq on a single day since September, when 42 people were hanged in the same prison in Nasiriya.The prison is believed to have about 6,000 prisoners on death row, Agnes Callamard, a United Nations human rights expert monitoring extrajudicial executions, said in an email.A judge in one Iraqi province told the report\u2019s researchers that a counterterrorism court, established to try prisoners seized in the battle to recapture Mosul, had started trials of more than 5,500 people and had sentenced 200 in a six-month period that ended in August.Iraqi authorities have a right to prosecute militants\u2019 crimes to protect public security, but the judicial procedures are flawed, Human Rights Watch said.\u201cEverybody has a public defense lawyer, but it does not appear that they are engaging in the trial,\u201d said Belkis Wille, Human Rights Watch\u2019s senior Iraq researcher. \u201cThey are sitting there because it\u2019s required by Iraqi law; they are not sitting there because they are providing a defense.\u201dIraqi authorities appeared to be prosecuting suspects under counterterrorism laws that impose harsh sentences, including the death penalty and life imprisonment, for membership in the Islamic State, without taking into account the gravity of the offenses they are accused of committing, Human Rights Watch said.There was no difference between a cook for the Islamic State or a fighter, a counterterrorism court judge told Ms. Wille. \u201cA fighter couldn\u2019t go out and kill the next morning if he hadn\u2019t had a good meal the night before,\u201d she said the judge told her. \u201cSo they\u2019re both equally culpable.\u201dThe Islamic State would never have come into existence if the United States military had executed detainees in its Camp Bucca prison, Ms. Wille said the counterterrorism judge told her.

{"Headline": "Australia Makes Same-Sex Marriage Legal", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s Parliament voted overwhelmingly to legalize same-sex marriage on Thursday, overcoming years of conservative resistance to enact change that the public had made clear that it wanted.\u201cThis belongs to us all,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a longtime supporter of same-sex marriage who had previously failed to get it legalized, said on Thursday. \u201cThis is Australia: fair, diverse, loving and filled with respect. For every one of us this is a great day.\u201dAfter the vote, spectators in the public gallery began singing \u201cI Am Australian,\u201d a well-known anthem. Lawmakers stood and looked up at the gallery, some wiping tears from their eyes.The new law expands on earlier legislation that provided equality to same-sex couples in areas like government benefits, employment and taxes, and it changes the definition of marriage from \u201cthe union of a man and a woman\u201d to \u201cthe union of two people.\u201d It automatically recognizes same-sex marriages from other countries.A handful of lawmakers tried to add amendments that they said were meant to safeguard religious freedoms for opponents of same-sex marriage, but their efforts failed. Mr. Turnbull noted that nothing in the legislation requires ministers or other celebrants to oversee weddings of gay couples or threatens the charity status of religious groups that oppose same-sex marriage, two concerns the lawmakers had raised.The final debate in the House of Representatives, which lasted four days, featured more than 100 speakers.The answer came loud and clear \u2014 \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 as did public congratulations from the deputy speaker, Rob Mitchell.That was followed by hours of emotional speeches, as politicians on the left and right fell into a rare moment of relative consensus and embraced public sentiment, which has favored same-sex marriage for years, according to polls.Even former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a staunch critic of same-sex marriage, seemed to have softened.\u201cWhen it comes to same-sex marriage, some countries have introduced it via the courts, some via Parliament, and others \u2014 Ireland and now Australia \u2014 by vote of the people,\u201d Mr. Abbott said. \u201cAnd that is the best way because it resolves this matter beyond doubt or quibble.\u201dAt one point, Adam Bandt, a Greens Party lawmaker from Melbourne, paused for a moment of silence after referring to the \u201cinnocent blood\u201d of gay Australians who were hurt during the long battle for marriage equality.Bill Shorten, leader of the opposition Labor Party, asked for forgiveness \u201cfor the long delay, for the injustices and the indignities both great and small.\u201dHe also paid tribute to a Labor Party colleague, Senator Penny Wong, a gay politician who he said had walked \u201ca lonely road and a hard road\u201d to help change Australia.Passage came just weeks after 61 percent of voters in a nonbinding national referendum, conducted by mail, expressed support for same-sex marriage. Advocates for gay marriage assailed the Turnbull government\u2019s decision to hold the referendum, calling it a delaying tactic intended to appease his party\u2019s far-right faction.\u201cOur very identity has been the subject of public scrutiny and public debate,\u201d Senator Wong said after the referendum results were announced. \u201cThrough this campaign, we have seen the best of our country and also the worst.\u201dAt her office in Parliament House this week, Ms. Wong said Mr. Turnbull\u2019s decision to pursue the referendum had unleashed a campaign of fear-mongering and hate that she would struggle to forgive.\u201cIt is a hard thing to have others judge whether you deserve to be equal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it is an even harder thing to have your family and your children besmirched by those who want to perpetuate discrimination.\u201dMany other gay Australians said they had been hurt and frustrated by the referendum process.Left out of the discussion, he added, were issues that go beyond marriage, such as the way older men and women deal with earlier traumas tied to prejudice and gay bashing, or suicide among teenagers dealing with issues of gender and sexuality.\u201cPeople need to realize that marriage is a certain thing for a certain part of the community, but the real social mission behind all of this is equality,\u201d Mr. Meecham said. \u201cAnd there is a lot of work that still needs to be done.\u201dStill, he said, he could not deny the sense of validation that the process had delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s a breathing process,\u201d he said, \u201ca relief, a cleansing.\u201dIn Parliament after the vote, there was mostly jubilation and relief.Hamish Taylor, 22, from Melbourne, walked out of the gallery and embraced his best friend in a bear hug. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely gobsmacked,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart is beating out of my chest. This debate has been in my life ever since I knew I was gay.\u201dOf the result, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s alleviated a life of shame and embarrassment of who I am,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s just validated everyone\u2019s love here and around Australia.\u201dIn many countries where same-sex marriage is already legal, the tangible effects of institutional acceptance have become more visible, and positive, studies have found.Mr. Wolfson said that in both the United States and Spain, which legalized same-sex marriage in 2005, polls have found support for same-sex marriage growing instead of diminishing, a sign of the laws\u2019 positive effects.\u201cFamilies are helped and no one is hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cThe evidence is overwhelming.\u201dFor now, though, Australia is more focused on the immediate, with the first legal same-sex weddings expected in early January.In his chambers the day after proposing to his partner, Mr. Wilson seemed exhausted and relieved. He said that after many false starts, he was thrilled to finally be getting married in his hometown, Melbourne, early next year.\u201cPeople kept saying go and get married overseas, and we always took a very firm view that we couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cWe had to get married in our home city.\u201dHe predicted a small, private and proud celebration.Damien Cave reported from Sydney and Jacqueline Williams from Canberra, Australia.Advertisement"}

Wrapped in a smoky-sweet banana leaf, they\u2019re typically filled with seasoned meat, stained with sunset-hued annatto oil and boiled up by the dozen at any gathering held between Thanksgiving and Three Kings Day on Jan. 6.\u201cThere\u2019s no holiday if there\u2019s no pasteles,\u201d said Mr. Franqui-Rivera, 45, who, like many members of the Puerto Rican diaspora, used to tote them back to the mainland frozen in his suitcase \u2014 until he insisted that his mother show him her recipe. This year, with groceries and electricity still in short supply on the island, he will execute what he calls Operation Pasteles, bringing frozen masa to his mother from his kitchen in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.Anyone who has ever made pasteles (to pronounce it, many people skip over the last letter: pah-TEH-leh) will understand Ms. Rivera\u2019s plight.But this year, everyone must pitch in. The plan, Ms. Squires said, is to make as many pasteles as possible \u201cfrom whatever we can find\u201d at a cousin\u2019s house near San Juan, then give them out to volunteer relief workers and hard-hit communities.Even when you use a food processor to grate and pur\u00e9e the masa and freeze it in advance (wishful thinking for those without power in Puerto Rico), it\u2019s still \u201ca marathon,\u201d said Angel Roman, 61, a deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. In his spare time, he promotes the food, music and art of the Puerto Rican diaspora.Mr. Roman, a second-generation Nuyorican, recently shot video of his sister-in-law Lucy Ramirez as she made pasteles, so as to pass what he fears are rapidly disappearing skills on to the family\u2019s younger members. \u201cNow people say, \u2018I want pasteles,\u2019 and they find these entrepreneurs,\u201d Mr. Roman said. \u201cPeople hand out cards, or they say, \u2018Hey, call Do\u00f1a Maria.\u2019\u201dA handful of its vendors, like La Union, sell pasteles year-round, but during the holidays even the market\u2019s religious-supply shop makes them to order. In the basement, Jesus Rodriguez works double-time building handmade machines from washing-machine motors that allow semiprofessional pastel makers to grate a box of bananas at a time. And across the street at the 49-year-old Anibal Meat Market, pastel makers like Maria Garcia stop in to buy chicken and pork for the filling.Ms. Garcia, 70, charges $25 a dozen and has been selling pasteles for 35 years. She makes most of her sales through her son, who puts up a handwritten ad at his barbershop in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.Most years, similar scenes would be playing out across Puerto Rico, said Melissa Fuster, 37, a professor of public health nutrition at Brooklyn College who is originally from San Juan, and often writes about Puerto Rican food culture.Though many supermarkets on the island are still empty, she said, pasteles have long been improvised with what\u2019s at hand, resulting in versions made with only yuca, without any filling, or with rice instead of masa.\u201cIn difficult times, one thing that defines us is that we keep positive,\u201d Ms. Fuster said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people found a way to make pasteles.\u201dSuset Laboy Perez, 36, a Puerto Rican native who runs a Brooklyn public relations firm with her sister, Maria, worries less about pasteles this year than about the thousands of Puerto Ricans leaving the island, and the resulting losses to their culture.Still, she said, she never made pasteles herself until years after she moved to the United States, holding her own pastel-making party as a way to connect with home.\u201cThere will be more pasteladas,\u201d Ms. Laboy Perez predicted. \u201cWe need them now more than ever.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the phrase many Puerto Ricans use to describe a pair of pasteles. It is la yunta, not la junta.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Year the News Accelerated to Trump Speed", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWashington MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Barack Obama was president earlier this year.One year out, this may be Mr. Trump\u2019s greatest trick: His tornado of news-making has scrambled Americans\u2019 grasp of time and memory, producing a sort of sensory overload that can make even seismic events \u2014 of his creation or otherwise \u2014 disappear from the collective consciousness and public view.He is the magician who swallows a sword no one thought was part of the act, stuffs a dozen rabbits into a hat before the audience can count them \u2014 and then merrily tweets about \u201cFox & Friends\u201d while the crowd strains to remember what show it had paid to attend in the first place.Poof.\u201cWe crammed six years in,\u201d said Jason Chaffetz, a former Republican congressman from Utah who left the job at the end of June.\u201cWe get to the point where we\u2019re just done dealing with something,\u201d said Matt Negrin, a digital producer at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d recalling unresolved maelstroms like Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with a Gold Star widow, his baseless claim that Mr. Obama wiretapped him and his defense of white nationalist supporters amid the deadly violence this summer in Charlottesville, Va.The disorientation has had far-reaching effects, shaping not only Mr. Trump\u2019s public image but also the ways in which lawmakers, journalists and others in his ecosystem are compelled to operate.It is not exactly that \u201cnothing matters,\u201d to borrow social media\u2019s favorite nihilistic buzz-phrase of the Trump age. It is that nothing matters long enough to matter.\u201cLas Vegas and the church in Texas have fallen off the map \u2014 two of the most heinous mass murders in recent American history,\u201d said Tom Brokaw, the special correspondent at NBC News, flagging two episodes that would have, under previous circumstances, most likely remained seared in the national conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing. It should be one of the defining stories not just of the year but of our time.\u201dThere are a lot of those. And the president\u2019s apparent triumph over the space-time continuum has created practical concerns across newsrooms and congressional offices, exacerbated by forces that predate Mr. Trump: the rise of Facebook and Twitter, the partisan instincts of cable news and, in the case of mass shootings, what many describe as a growing public imperviousness to horror.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who became a prominent gun control advocate after the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn., described his task under Mr. Trump as a \u201ctriage\u201d mission, \u201cnewly overwhelming\u201d every day.\u201cAs someone who works on an issue that is unfortunately driven by news cycles,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it harder to try to focus attention.\u201dThe most heinous shootings once dominated TV news for days. \u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem that there\u2019s much more than 24 hours\u2019 room for any story.\u201dOf course, Mr. Trump runs neither the networks nor the newspapers, much as he might prefer it at times, and the news media has come by its share of criticism honestly. Corralling the fire hose of White House doings has become a near-constant exercise in news judgment, with mixed returns.Not every Twitter tremble requires mass attention. Not all executive skirmishes need a referee on every channel.\u201cTrump is just so dislocating for everybody that it\u2019s making us all nuts,\u201d said Peter Hamby, the head of news at Snapchat. \u201cThere\u2019s so much sexy, salacious, bananas-crazy news happening every single day. But there is a duty, I think, to cover substance.\u201dNo one suggests the mandate is simple. Even Mr. Brokaw, a dean of meat-and-potatoes news delivery, allowed that the daily Trumpian churn is \u201cnot unimportant, and it\u2019s got this Shakespearean quality about it.\u201dAnd while there have been frenzied, tumultuous years before, present conditions are unique.The 2016 presidential campaign season delivered rapid-fire insanities without precedent, but still adhered broadly to the rhythms of an election cycle: the primaries, the conventions, the debates, the big day.In 2017, the chaos tends to be unscheduled.The most oft-cited parallel is 1968 \u2014 a tinderbox of tragedy, protest and political upheaval \u2014 though the composition of the news industry then precluded the minute-to-minute ubiquity of 2017.That was July.Mr. Negrin offered two predictions for the new year: Mr. Trump is unlikely to hold forth on Hezbollah anytime soon.And: \u201c2018 is going to be 10 times worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In our country, there are no harassers,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said sarcastically, drawing chuckles throughout the hall.In truth, Ms. Boldrini said, harassment was rife, but Italian women feared the repercussions of speaking up: \u201cThey know that in this country, there is a strong prejudice against them.\u201dBy turning Montecitorio Palace into a women-only institution on a recent Saturday, Ms. Boldrini hoped to emphasize how sexual harassment and abuse against women are often ignored by what she and many others consider a stubbornly patriarchal society.A list of men who have resigned, been fired or otherwise lost power since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.In Italy, it\u2019s mostly \u201cmeh.\u201d\u201cThis historic moment doesn\u2019t mean much to Italy, sadly,\u201d said Asia Argento, an Italian actress whose accusations of sexual harassment against Mr. Weinstein drew signs of solidarity abroad but a good deal of eye-rolling and insults at home. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d\u201cFor us, defending women is a priority and it always has been,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi, who was cleared of soliciting underage prostitutes but is still fighting charges that he bribed a witness, said in a recent television interview.The audience applauded.\u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, because in the end, Italians think it\u2019s normal,\u201d Lorella Zanardo, a women\u2019s rights advocate and filmmaker, said of the muted reaction to reports of sexual harassment in the country. Especially in high-profile fields such as film, politics and the media, she said, \u201cthe idea of a woman advancing her career by giving or selling her body, it\u2019s taken for granted.\u201dMr. Berlusconi himself has contributed to the country\u2019s perception of women as decorative objects of desire, Ms. Zanardo said, by casting them as scantily clad adornments on his television channels. But she acknowledged that the popularity and durability of those shows over the last 40 years showed an eager audience among Italians, many of whom still think of women in archetypes of care-taking madonnas or corrupting Jezebels, with little room in between.Perhaps nowhere has the view of sex as a transactional feature of Italian life been as stark as in the backlash against Ms. Argento.The daughter of Italy\u2019s most famous director of horror movies, she describes living a nightmare since becoming one of the first women to make a public accusation against Mr. Weinstein, whom she said performed oral sex on her against her will. She says she is afraid to leave her house, and plans to flee the country in response to particularly virulent attacks in the news media.Another right-wing paper repeatedly argued that Ms. Argento knowingly entered into a transactional relationship to further her career, and even people whom Ms. Argento might have expected to count among her allies instead cast doubt on her innocence.She has accused an unidentified Italian actor-director of exposing himself to her when she was 16, and a \u201cHollywood big shot director\u201d with drugging and raping her when she was 26. She warns that abused women know where sexual predators sleep, has resurfaced accusations in tabloids and maligned the \u201cmisogynistic patriarchal Italian society\u201d where \u201csex assault victims are shamed.\u201dMs. Zanardo, the rights advocate and filmmaker, said that to institute cultural change would require teaching Italian children to respect women as equals.Until then, the limited media interest in sexual harassment accusations in the Italian film industry reflects a country with greater interest in Hollywood scandals than in introspection.\u201cIf the actresses had started accusing big producers here, no one would have been interested,\u201d she said.Back in Montecitorio Palace, Ms. Boschi sat near Ms. Boldrini, listening to women describe their stories of harassment, rape, sexual slavery and general discrimination.\u201cThis chamber shows many things,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said, adding that women were united. \u201cThe country cannot ignore us anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She was pronounced dead at the scene and the police turned her 2-year-old daughter, Charlie, over to relatives.Ms. Wells\u2019s husband of nine months, Barry Wells, who was out on bail after an arrest on a charge of choking his wife in September, was taken into custody on Wednesday evening. Charges against him are pending the outcome of an autopsy to determine the cause of his wife\u2019s death.Ms. Wells had bruising around her neck and injuries elsewhere on her body. The police said the autopsy was necessary to determine whether she died from injuries sustained in a fall or from being strangled or beaten.Police Commissioner James P. O\u2019Neill said on Thursday that the department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau was investigating the actions of the officers and everyone else involved in the police response on Wednesday. Officials were still trying on Thursday to figure out the timeline and what went wrong.\u201cI talk about my pride in the N.Y.P.D. each and every day,\u201d Commissioner O\u2019Neill said. \u201cAnd if, unfortunately, there are times that we don\u2019t live up to that standard, it\u2019s up to us to make sure that we fully investigate that. And if discipline needs to be dealt out, we\u2019ll do that.\u201dThe couple married on April 10, according to their Facebook pages, weeks after Mr. Wells proposed with an engagement ring concealed in a takeout bag.But in the spring, Ms. Wells filed a harassment complaint against her husband. In September, he was arrested after Ms. Wells said he dragged her down a flight of stairs and into a closet, where he choked her until she was unconscious, according to a police complaint.He was released on Sept. 21 on $5,000 bail and ordered to stay away from his wife.Domestic homicides \u2014 killings among spouses and families \u2014 have declined this year to 42 so far, compared with 66 over the same period last year, according to the Police Department. But in recent years, those killings have made up a larger share of total murders, which numbered 289 as of Wednesday evening.This year, the police have responded to more calls for help. Domestic incidents over all, which include nonfatal shootings, stabbings and beatings, have risen slightly to 279,996 in 2017 from 278,163 in 2016, according to the police.Mr. Wells was apprehended on Wednesday by the New Rochelle Police Department, in Westchester County, after his brother turned him in. He was taken to Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital after he claimed to have tried to commit suicide by taking pills, but Chief Boyce said that turned out to be untrue.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of domestic homicides recorded by the New York Police Department.

{"Headline": "Malta Arrests 10 Over Killing of Journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacing pressure from the European Union to make progress in the investigation of the car bomb killing of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta announced on Monday that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the crime.The detentions were the first outward signs that the authorities, whose inquiry into the killing has been dogged by accusations of incompetence and political meddling, were any closer to finding those responsible.The family of the murdered journalist took no comfort from the detentions, complaining in a statement that they had been announced by the prime minister instead of the police, a blurring of responsibilities that, along with the swift leaking of the names and mug shots of suspects to local news media outlets, \u201cprejudice the integrity of the investigation.\u201dExpressing concern that the authorities may \u201calso be leaking information to other suspects, some of whom could be in or close to the government,\u201d the family said, \u201cNone of the developments in the investigation or its handling by the Malta Police have served to reassure the family that real justice is within reach.\u201dThe family said it was \u201cconcerned that a number of people who could be implicated continue to receive political cover for crimes they are widely reported to have committed.\u201dAll of those detained were Maltese citizens and were picked up in raids on three locations across Malta, according to a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Most of the suspects were already known to the police in connection with other crimes, including murder, the official said.Investigators have 48 hours to question the suspects before deciding whether to prosecute them, Mr. Muscat said, offering no further details, including what charges might be filed.Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament delegation, said in a statement on Friday that the group had arrived on the island \u201cseriously concerned over the rule of law in Malta and left even more worried.\u201d\u201cThe police and the attorney general have demonstrated an unwillingness to investigate and failure to prosecute corruption and money laundering,\u201d he added.The delegation\u2019s complaints added to momentum in Brussels for action against Malta under what is known as Article 7, a previously unused provision in European Union law that, in extreme cases, allows a country to be stripped of its voting rights and subjected to other punishments. That is unlikely to happen to Malta in the short term, but even the start of a full formal investigation by the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, would be a severe blow.The demonstrations reflected a sense of disgust at the political elite that Ms. Caruana Galizia had been investigating, and the announcement of the arrests on Monday seemed intended in part to persuade skeptical citizens that her death was being properly investigated.Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s relatives have expressed doubt that the case will ever be solved. Over the past two years, the perpetrators of five other car bombings have eluded arrest and prosecution in Malta. The island, the smallest nation in the European Union, has a population of around 430,000 and has become an attractive destination for foreign money as a banking center and as a hub for online gambling.Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s husband and sons filed a suit on Nov. 22 calling for a senior police officer involved in the investigation, Deputy Commissioner Silvio Valletta, to be replaced because he is married to Justyne Caruana, a minister in the Labour Party government, of which Ms. Caruana Galizia was a fierce critic.Leaving Mr. Valletta in charge, family members said, would compromise the investigation and breach their right to a fair and impartial hearing.His involvement, the complaint to the Constitutional Court of Malta said, leads \u201cto serious doubts about the independence and impartiality of the investigation\u201d because the work of the murdered journalist \u201cfocused on people who are politically exposed and on politicians who are members of the same cabinet as the wife of the deputy commissioner.\u201dThe family also complained that it had not been kept informed about the progress of the investigation, even as information was being leaked to local news media outlets.Faith in the police force\u2019s ability to conduct a serious investigation was further undermined by signs that some officers had even welcomed Ms. Caruana Galizia\u2019s killing. Immediately after her death, one officer, Ramon Mifsud, about whom the journalist had written, posted a message on Facebook describing her as \u201ccow dung\u201d and cheering her murder. He was suspended.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defying Trump, U.N. General Assembly Condemns U.S. Decree on Jerusalem", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe resolution is nonbinding and therefore largely symbolic, but the vote indicated the extent to which the Trump administration\u2019s departure from a 50-year international consensus on Jerusalem\u2019s status has unsettled world politics and contributed to America\u2019s diplomatic isolation.Major allies like Britain, France, Germany and Japan voted for the resolution, though some allies, like Australia and Canada, abstained.Carrying out a promise to his base of supporters, Mr. Trump upended decades of American policy with his decision on Jerusalem, aggravating an emotional issue that has festered since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the Israelis occupied the entire city.Many Security Council resolutions since then, which have the force of international law, have warned that Jerusalem\u2019s status is unresolved, that claims of sovereignty by Israel are invalid and that the issue must be settled in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.The new resolution raised questions about whether Mr. Trump would deliver on his threat on Wednesday to withhold American aid from countries that broke ranks with the United States. While he has significant legal latitude to do so, experts said it would be very difficult to substantially cut off countries like Egypt and Jordan that are strategic partners of the United States in the Middle East.The American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, called the vote \u201cnull and void,\u201d declaring that \u201cno vote in the United Nations will make any difference\u201d on the United States\u2019 plans to move its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, which she called \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\u201cWe will remember it when we are called upon once again to make the world\u2019s largest contribution to the United Nations,\u201d she said of the vote. \u201cAnd we will remember when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\u201dThe United States Mission to the United Nations quickly issued a statement seeking to portray the outcome as a victory because the vote could have been even more lopsided. It cited the 35 abstentions, coupled with 21 delegations that were absent, representing a significant chunk of the total membership of 193.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that many countries prioritized their relationship with the United States over an unproductive attempt to isolate us for a decision that was our sovereign right to make,\u201d the mission said in the statement emailed to journalists.But American Jewish organizations that strongly support Israel saw nothing positive about the outcome of the vote. David Harris, the chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee, said he was \u201cdismayed by the overwhelming support of U.N. Member States for the General Assembly resolution condemning U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201dStalwart American allies like France and Britain sought to frame their position as merely reaffirming the Security Council resolutions on Jerusalem dating back to 1967, which are still in force, and to play down the isolation of the United States.\u201cIt is more important than ever to rally the international community around the agreed parameters of the peace process,\u201d said France\u2019s ambassador, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, \u201cand this of course includes the United States, as everyone is aware of its particular role and influence on this issue.\u201d\u201cI think this was a significantly self-inflicted wound and really unnecessary, clumsy diplomacy on the part of the United States,\u201d Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said of the outcome.\u201cIn this case what you had was the Trump administration basically changing the rules of the game that the international community had accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than that, I think it symbolizes the self-defeating notion that for the United States, \u2018it\u2019s my way or the highway.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\u201cHistory records names, it remembers names \u2014 the names of those who stand by what is right and the names of those who speak falsehood,\u201d said Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister.He said that the Palestinians \u201cwill not be threatened,\u201d and that the United States had insisted on \u201cignoring the dangerous repercussions of its decision.\u201dThe Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad H. Mansour, said in an interview after the vote that the Trump administration\u2019s approach had worked against the United States.\u201cThe administration made the issue about them \u2014 not about Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd since they made it about them and they used unprecedented tactics, unheard-of in the diplomatic work of the U.N., including blackmail and extortion, then they in my opinion offended the entire international community.\u201dPakistan\u2019s ambassador, Maleeha Lodhi, said her country remained a steadfast supporter of the Palestinians \u201cdespite the kind of threats we have received in recent days\u201d from the United States.Aside from Israel, the only countries to side with the United States by voting no were Guatemala, Honduras, Togo, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru and Palau \u2014 mostly tiny countries heavily dependent on American aid.The outcome threatened to alienate Arab allies of the United States and further complicate prospects for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Egypt, Jordan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan are among major recipients of American aid that defied Mr. Trump\u2019s warning and voted for the resolution. Three other recipients \u2014 Haiti, Mexico and South Sudan \u2014 abstained. Mr. Trump has already threatened to withhold aid from Pakistan unless it cooperates more on counterterrorism operations.Administration officials said Mr. Trump had significant flexibility to hold up aid \u2014 even from countries, like Egypt, where it is congressionally mandated. The White House delayed nearly $300 million in aid to Cairo last summer over concerns about human rights abuses and evidence that it was playing host to guest workers from North Korea.But the practical effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats seemed blunted, analysts said, by Washington\u2019s reliance on countries like Egypt and Jordan. Israel, analysts said, would be among the first countries to protest a cutoff of aid to Egypt, because it fears the instability that would result from such a decision.Already on Thursday the administration seemed to backtrack somewhat.\u201cThe president had said yesterday that the U.N. vote is really not the only factor that the administration would take into consideration in dealing with our foreign relations and countries who have chosen to go one way or the other,\u201d said Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman.Timothy A. Lenderking, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Arabian Gulf Affairs, insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were not \u201can empty threat at all,\u201d but was circumspect when asked about Yemen, home to a humanitarian crisis and civil war, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are strategic partners of the United States. All three voted for the resolution.The General Assembly resolution, drafted by Yemen and Turkey, cited numerous past resolutions on Jerusalem and urged nations to \u201crefrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions.\u201d The consensus under international law is that East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, should be the future capital of a Palestinian state.The resolution did not mention the United States by name, but it called for a \u201creversal of the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the two-state solution.\u201d\u201cAll of these nations that take our money and then they vote against us at the Security Council or they vote against us, potentially, at the Assembly, they take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.\u201cWell, we\u2019re watching those votes,\u201d he said. \u201cLet them vote against us; we\u2019ll save a lot. We don\u2019t care.\u201dMr. Trump is not the first president to have an antagonistic relationship with the United Nations. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed for the creation of a world body after World War II, presidents have frequently felt stymied by the defiance of its members toward the United States or its allies. For a few, it was \u201ca dangerous place,\u201d in the words of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the American ambassador to the United Nations under President Gerald R. Ford.Relations improved under President Barack Obama, who reemphasized the role of the United Nations as an agent for confronting global problems. The United States, however, continued to oppose Security Council and General Assembly resolutions that singled out Israel.Rick Gladstone reported from the United Nations, and Mark Landler from Washington. Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington, Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem, and Michael Schwirtz from the United Nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Reckoning: Women and Power in the Workplace", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "Essays and art from Jenna Wortham, Ruth Franklin, Vivian Gornick, Parul Sehgal, Heidi Julavits, Paula Scher, Olivia Locher, Amber Vittoria and more.As revelations of sexual harassment break, women have been discussing the fallout and how to move forward. Here, women from across the working world take on this complicated conversation.By Jenna Wortham\u201cRevolution will come in a form we cannot yet imagine,\u201d the critical theorists Fred Moten and Stefano Harney wrote in their 2013 essay \u201cThe Undercommons,\u201d about the need to radically upend hierarchical institutions. I thought of their prophecy in October, when a private document listing allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by dozens of men in publishing and media surfaced online.The list \u2014 a Google spreadsheet initially shared exclusively among women, who could anonymously add to it \u2014 was created in the immediate aftermath of reports about sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein. The atmosphere among female journalists was thick with the tension of watching the press expose the moral wrongs of Hollywood while neglecting to interrogate our own. The existence of the list suggested that things were worse than we even imagined, given all that it revealed. It was horrifying to see the names of colleagues and friends \u2014 people you had mingled with at parties and accepted drinks from \u2014 accused of heinous acts.A few days after the list appeared, I was in a van with a half dozen other women of color, riding through the desert on our way to a writing retreat. All of us worked in media; most of us had not realized the extent to which harassment polluted our industry. Whisper networks, in which women share secret warnings via word of mouth, require women to tell others whom to avoid and whom to ignore. They are based on trust, and any social hierarchy is rife with the privilege of deciding who gets access to information. Perhaps we were perceived as outsiders, or maybe we weren\u2019t seen as vulnerable. We hadn\u2019t been invited to the happy hours or chats or email threads where such information is presumably shared. The list was F.T.B.T. \u2014 for them, by them \u2014 meaning, by white women about their experiences with the white men who made up a majority of the names on it. Despite my working in New York media for 10 years, it was my first \u201cwhisper\u201d of any kind, a realization that felt almost as hurtful as reading the acts described on the list itself.As a young business reporter, no one told me about the New York investor known for luring women out to meals under the guise of work. I found out the hard way. I realized he was a habitual boundary-crosser only after The New York Observer reported on him in 2010. Most recently, after I complained in a media chat room about a man who harassed a friend at a birthday party, everyone chimed in to say that he was a known creep. I was infuriated. That information never made its way to me, and worse, it was taken as a given. Was keeping that secret hidden worth the trauma it caused my friend?The list\u2019s flaws were immediately apparent. It felt too public, volatile and vulnerable to manipulation. But its recklessness was born out of desperation. It detonated the power and labor dynamics that whisper networks reinforce. Information, once privileged to a select few, became decentralized and accessible to all. And the problem of sexual harassment no longer belonged solely to women to filter and share.Once the list leaked beyond its initial audience and men became aware of it, it was effectively shut down. But who knows what would have happened if it lasted longer? Maybe a better mechanism for warning and reporting harassment could have been finessed; it\u2019s clear we still need one. Even now, amid the torrent of reports of sexual misconduct, women of color are conspicuously absent. It\u2019s still not safe enough for many of us to name our abusers in public.But during the initial hours after the list\u2019s publication, when it still felt secret, for women only, I moved through the world differently. The energy in the air felt charged, like after the siren goes off in the \u201cPurge\u201d movies. A friend compared the feeling to the final scenes of \u201cV for Vendetta.\u201d She liked seeing women as digital vigilantes, knowing that men were scared. I did, too. I wanted every single man put on notice, to know that they, too, were vulnerable because women were talking. Maybe, within that, we glimpsed the possibility of a new world order, like the one Moten and Harney gestured at. The list was not long for this world, but it might have lived long enough to prove its point.By Ruth Franklin\u201cMy natural tendency is to observe, not to ask questions,\u201d I wrote in my journal during the spring of my senior year of high school. I had just started a six-week internship at a local newspaper, and it wasn\u2019t going well. At 16, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and journalism seemed the obvious route. But my natural shyness held me back.One day at the diner where all the reporters hung out, my supervisor introduced me to a colleague. \u201cThis is a famous man,\u201d she said with more than a touch of sarcasm. Thirty-two years old and stocky as a bantam rooster, he had shaggy black hair and intense eyes. I recognized his byline \u2014 he had just published an article about an elderly eccentric that detoured through his own obsessions, from the bluesmen of the Mississippi Delta to the traces of his childhood.We talked about ghosts and the poetry of Octavio Paz. He gave me one of his own short stories to read and seemed to care what I thought. Soon I was accompanying him around town in his cluttered hatchback on the hunt for local characters. I thought I had finally found a model to emulate. \u201cMaybe I have reporter potential after all,\u201d I wrote.On those car rides, we talked about writing but also about our personal lives. I was an alienated teenager, feverish to graduate and leave my family behind. He was divorced with young kids and working hard to support them. Sometimes when we were sitting next to each other, he pressed his arm against mine. On a picnic in a city park where more than a few passers-by recognized him, he confessed that he was infatuated with me. All that restrained him, he said, was my age. His sexual energy was palpable and a little bit terrifying. I wasn\u2019t attracted to him physically, and I told him so. But I was entranced by his independent-mindedness, his nostalgic longing for an earlier age, even his affectations. More than that, he seemed to believe in my potential as a writer.He often recommended books and movies, but one in particular sticks with me: \u201cManhattan,\u201d perhaps the most notorious depiction of one of Woody Allen\u2019s favorite paradigms, the pairing of an older man and a much younger woman. The parallels between our situation and this fable of romance between a divorced writer (Isaac) and a high school student (Tracy) couldn\u2019t have been more obvious. But I was struck by the movie\u2019s falseness. The script requires Tracy to be the ardent one, continually pressing Isaac for a commitment he won\u2019t offer. (Indeed, midway through the film he dumps her, to his later regret, for a journalist closer to his age.) Yet Mariel Hemingway portrays Tracy as perfectly blank, her moonlike face virtually without expression, even in the most emotional scenes. The film is only about Isaac: his needs and desires. If Tracy is entertaining questions or doubts beneath the surface, we\u2019re not privy to them.At the time, I would have sworn that what was happening between me and this reporter was consensual. Now, more than 25 years later, I understand more clearly how incompletely the idea of consent conveys the complexity of such a dynamic. Yes, I flirted with him and enjoyed the power of knowing that he desired me. But in the end I needed him more than he needed me, because he offered something I wasn\u2019t finding elsewhere. For a brief period, he gave me confidence. As his behavior became more aggressive \u2014 putting his hand on my leg, asking to kiss me \u2014 I started to pull away. He reacted with anger and petulance, and things between us curdled. A few years later, he depicted me in a story published in a popular anthology as a spoiled, haughty Jewish-American princess who is the subject of crude sexual fantasies.The stories we tell ourselves aren\u2019t just entertainment; books and movies \u2014 still more often by men \u2014 work to establish archetypes for romantic relationships. They constitute our personal and cultural mythology and are essential to the way we understand our world. A man whose interest is piqued by a 16-year-old girl has a ready-made formula for how that relationship might proceed. The very fact that such a model exists offers tacit permission for him to treat his wants as valid. For the girl who tries to enter the story on her own terms, there are two models: the receptive vessel or the Lolita-like temptress. Ambivalence and fear simply don\u2019t enter into it.I\u2019m now more than 10 years older than this man was when we met. I\u2019ve worked in journalism for close to two decades. But I spent the early years of my career anxious, questioning, in search of a validation that I couldn\u2019t define. That wasn\u2019t only his fault \u2014 I was primed to respond to him the way I did by things that happened long before he came around. Still, the power imbalance in our relationship led me, however unconsciously, to continue seeking legitimation in a man\u2019s eyes. I don\u2019t regret those afternoons driving around town, listening to him ask questions, watching him take notes: They\u2019re part of my story as a writer. But I wish that he, as the adult in the room, had looked past his emotions to consider what would have been best for me, an impressionable teenager who admired him and craved his instruction and his approval, if not his affections. And I wish that my intellectual formation hadn\u2019t had to be so inextricably entwined with a man\u2019s assessment of my value.By Meghan O\u2019RourkeWhen I became sick with a mysterious illness nearly a decade ago, doctors kept telling me nothing was wrong. I lived for years in a fog not only of pain but also of self-doubt, questioning my own perceptions. It is difficult to articulate how distorting this fundamental distrust of your own subjectivity is, how distorting it was to accommodate myself to a hobbled, painful reality. When my illness was finally named by a physician, my world changed: It could be addressed. And just as important, I no longer felt that my grasp on reality was tenuous.The conversations I\u2019ve had with my female friends in the weeks since widespread allegations of sexual abuse and harassment have come out \u2014 by text messages, over drinks, while minding young children toddling in and out of the kitchen \u2014 have circled around a contradiction: We knew, and yet we didn\u2019t know; we were sure, and yet we doubted ourselves. For years, we lived in a climate of uncertainty created by the routine institutional denial that harassment was taking place, actions that went unnamed and dismissed, the scores of \u201copen secrets\u201d in plain sight yet not seen. Then, overnight, it seemed, a shift in our accounting took place. We\u2019d been returned to a shared reality.We think of our perceptions as being uniquely our own \u2014 the very stuff that makes us distinctive individuals. But perception is more dependent on a fine social web of recognition than we like to think. And when it came to sexual harassment, we were, in a sense, all guilty of participating in what social psychologists call the bystander effect, in which people are less likely to offer help to someone in distress if there are other people present, especially if the others are passive. In one striking 1968 study, subjects filled out a questionnaire in a room slowly filling with smoke. When alone, 75 percent of subjects reported smelling smoke. But when \u201ctwo passive confederates\u201d of the experimenters were planted in the room and behaved as if nothing were wrong, only 10 percent of the subjects reported smelling the smoke or left the room. (Shockingly, nine of 10 subjects \u201ckept working on the questionnaire they were given, rubbed their eyes and waved smoke out of their faces,\u201d the Socially Psyched website recounts.)In groups, we watch to see what others do and follow suit. By its nature, sexual harassment depends on a social agreement about where we draw lines and how we interpret injury. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that \u201cunwelcome sexual advances\u201d and the creation of a \u201chostile or offensive work environment\u201d came to be considered illegal under the federal protections that derive from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which legislates against discrimination on the basis of sex, race and religion. \u201cUnwelcome,\u201d \u201chostile\u201d: These adjectives are by definition descriptive \u2014 dependent on a consensus of shared reality, evaluated legally on a case-by-case basis. And a shared reality is, sadly, just what so many of us know that we don\u2019t have, even now. In an encounter between two people, the shadows of subjectivity always determine how the light looks: bright and revealing, or dark and eerie. And when it comes to encounters in the workplace, there are genuine questions of scale, lines in the sand to draw \u2014 what is just a clumsy pass? What is actual harassment?This moment of reckoning has helped women who have been victimized \u2014 even in subtle ways \u2014 name what had been happening to them; at the same time, it has made the most culpable bystanders feel less certain \u2014 a productive redistribution of uncertainty, possibly. Many people, especially men, are asking themselves if they are complicit in what has been taking place and examining their own past behavior to see whether they have ever made a woman uncomfortable. There are, after all, two kinds of uncertainty: the self-doubt created by withheld truths and the self-doubt created by a genuine need to re-evaluate. It may not be such a bad thing if more men walk through the world feeling that they don\u2019t have all the answers.As told to Kathy Dobie by a Police DetectiveIn the 20-plus years I\u2019ve been on the job, our department has truly changed. When I first came on the job, it was awful. In the \u201980s and early \u201990s, the male police force really did not want women there; women were \u201cruining the L.A.P.D.\u201d That sentiment was very strong. And if I had made a formal complaint, I would have been called your typical woman, you can\u2019t trust her, she\u2019s gonna roll on you, and then nobody wants to work with you, and it\u2019s just the kiss of death.There\u2019s definitely a cultural shift that makes the men hired today who are in their 20s quite different. At the patrol level, I think guys and gals get along just fine. The biggest issue we have in terms of sexual harassment is that even though there are procedures for reporting, nobody really wants to do anything. Supervisors, the ombuds office, everyone just wants it to go away. \u201cWell, you know, he didn\u2019t mean anything by it; let\u2019s just move on.\u201d So things fester and then blow up. I\u2019ve seen it over and over again. If you look at the lawsuits against the L.A.P.D., I think half the complaints are internal, not some outside person who got roughed up by the police. So they\u2019ve been trying to teach us to report anything we see. The problem is nobody wants to be a rat.I actually think the higher you rise among the ranks, the more likely you are to encounter harassment, because coveted positions are at play. If you look at our top-cop management, it\u2019s still very male, and those guys have been around for a couple of decades. They came on in the \u201970s or early \u201980s, so they\u2019re still carrying those attitudes. I\u2019ll give you an example: There was a captain who got a woman promoted from Detective II to Detective III \u2014 a very coveted position. It was discovered through an internal-affairs investigation that she had performed sexual acts on him. That, to me, smells a lot like Hollywood: Hey, if you really want this part, you do certain things to me, and I can make it happen. Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Roy Moore or a captain at the L.A.P.D. \u2014 what do they all have in common? They have the ability to make or break lives. They hold the key to things that other people want, so I think that\u2019s the common denominator; the psychology of that man is the same.By Zoe HellerI\u2019m disappointed that the story has remained focused so squarely on the villainous doings of the metropolitan elites. I was never under any illusion that this was the beginning of the end of the patriarchy, but I had hopes that there would be more of a ripple effect, that we would begin hearing about sexual harassment and abuse in the farm industry, in fast food, in retail, in hotel housekeeping. It\u2019s delightful that the chickens are coming home to roost for powerful old guys in the entertainment industry, and yet for large sections of the country, I suspect, the toppling of Harvey Weinstein and others has played less as a \u201cMatrix moment\u201d \u2014 a sudden unmasking of the country\u2019s sexist power structures \u2014 than as an old-fashioned morality tale about debauched big-city snoots finally getting their comeuppance.An argument that has kept cropping up in recent weeks, one that will be familiar to those who have followed the debates about campus rape, is that even in the absence of force or explicit threat, the suggestive comments or sexual advances of a male colleague are implicitly coercive. A woman\u2019s ability to register her opprobrium, or to say \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d is always compromised by her fear of repercussions, or by her youth, or simply by her female impulse to placate. The danger with this a priori assumption of women\u2019s diminished agency is that it ends up exaggerating female vulnerability. It casts women as fundamentally fragile beings, whose sexual assent, like that of minors, cannot be trusted to indicate true consent. It presents female passivity as natural. There\u2019s no doubt that women, particularly younger ones, have a tendency to go along with things they don\u2019t want to \u2014 to say yes when they really mean no \u2014 but that propitiatory tendency is not some incorrigible feature of the female character, any more than predation is the incorrigible inclination of men. And we do women a disservice by treating it as if it is. This is not about blaming the victim; it\u2019s about pointing out to the potential victim that she has more power than she knows.Several times in recent weeks, I\u2019ve read and heard people asserting that older women like me, women who came of age before the Anita Hill hearings in 1991, are generally more accepting of sexual harassment and less sympathetic to women who complain about it. (This, it\u2019s claimed, is because we grew up with lower expectations of male behavior and feel that the young should endure as stoically as we did.) I would characterize the generational divide differently. I think older women are, by and large, more reluctant to squander women\u2019s hard-won right to sexual autonomy by characterizing themselves as helpless and in need of special protection. I think they are more likely to see \u201cpower dynamics\u201d between individuals as complicated, fluid and not necessarily reducible to age and status differentials. I think they are also \u2014 although this is less a generational difference than a function of age \u2014 much better at telling men where to get off.By Vivian GornickFor many of us, it is dismaying to behold, in a movement meant to correct for social injustice, the development of what can seem like vigilante politics; the dismay, in fact, is being accorded disproportionate attention, as though its existence is more important than what gave rise to it. But if we stop for a moment to think rather than react, we soon come to realize that the courageous demand that begins with a visionary\u2019s declaration of rights can, and usually does, descend quickly into the maddened belligerence characteristic of those who cannot stop rehearsing a grievance that feels very old and reaches far into the past. That is the course history has usually taken, and for the moment, we in America are all trapped in its turmoil.My generation of second-wave feminists discovered how hard it is to build a case for women\u2019s rights from the inside out, how few approached with a wholeness of mind and heart the prospect of equality for women. Those of us in the 1970s and \u201980s who said (and kept on saying) that the subordination of women had now become intolerable were often denounced as witches, bitches and worse: denatured fanatics staring into a vision of the future that would upend the world as we knew it. Our radicalism lay in declaring the risk well worth taking: a calculation society as a whole is never willing to act on; it must be driven to it. But we feminists were persuaded that the American democracy was not only healthy enough but also mature enough to give up the idea that men by nature take their brains seriously and women by nature do not. We were convinced that what today we saw by the hundreds would tomorrow surely be seen by the thousands, and the day after that by the millions. Only people of serious ill will or intellectual deficiency or downright political greed would oppose the obvious. And after all, how many of them could there be?The silence imposed by that invisibility! For better or worse, only liberationist politics \u2014 loud, brash and bullying as it sometimes seems \u2014 has ever broken it. The pity of it all is that the silence returns as the inequities once again get swept under the rug, where they fester, and wait for the next moment when the rug will turn into a rock under which these wormlike suppressions have morphed into snakes that come out hissing, should the rock be turned over.As told to Yamiche Alcindor by a Capitol Hill AideI think women on Capitol Hill right now are just kind of breathing a sigh of relief that people finally can talk about these things and not have to suffer when they come forward. A lot of people are saying, \u201cI wonder who\u2019s going to be next,\u201d because everyone knows that this is just the beginning. We really feel as if a purge is coming. I don\u2019t think that a lot of people necessarily know who, but as soon as a name comes out, then you start to hear people saying, like: \u201cOh, yeah. I heard that guy was creepy.\u201dThey asked me to pitch in and just talk to survivors who call Representative Jackie Speier\u2019s office. It\u2019s such a gut punch when you hear the name of the member of Congress who harassed them. Al Franken was hard. It hurts the most when it\u2019s men who have built their political careers advocating for women and then show such disdain for actual female human beings. I think it also just really shows how important it is to have women elected to office, promoting more women to senior staff and having more women involved in Capitol Hill positions and in the political process.By Jazmine Hughes and Collier MeyersonI\u2019ve also had long talks with friends who have been named; they\u2019re promising but depressing. They admit to rehabilitation, but also to guilt. They\u2019ve changed, but they had to have something to \u201cchange\u201d away from. Everyone\u2019s trying to get better \u2014 but what does better look like? How do we measure penance?Would I invite \u201cthat person\u201d to a party? If I have an investment in the man, I\u2019d go to my community and speak with them about what they\u2019re comfortable with.This email exchange has been edited and condensed.By Parul SehgalWhen I was a child, I lived near a notorious landfill called Smokey Mountain. It jutted out of the heart of Manila \u2014 a ziggurat of decomposing plastic bags, high as a 10-story building. Squatters made their homes on its slopes and perished in the frequent fires. From time to time, I recall the city promising to raze it and put in proper housing but never making good. Smokey Mountain flourished for years.It was my early object lesson in selective blindness. You can ignore anything if you put your mind to it, apparently \u2014 even two million metric tons of smoldering trash. Anywhere you look, there\u2019s a Smokey Mountain of a kind, a site of shame or suffering that we refuse to reckon with \u2014 even as it bursts into flames.The recent statements from men accused of sexual harassment are among the stranger documents of shame I have encountered: putative apologies garlanded with self-congratulation, bristling with rage. Some sound like grotesque inversions of award-acceptance speeches, dutifully acknowledging family and friends, casts, crews, networks and agents. Others attempt clumsy deflection. Kevin Spacey, accused of assaulting numerous young men, takes the opportunity to come out of the closet and, horrifyingly, equates his alleged crimes with being gay. Louis C.K. repeatedly mentions how much his victims admired him in his open letter \u2014 and invokes his penis so insistently that it feels as if he\u2019s covertly indulging his exhibitionism all over again. Jeffrey Tambor responds to charges of sexual harassment and aggression on the set of \u201cTransparent\u201d with further aggression. Many claim that the behavior is in the past and seem irritated to have to answer for it. After all, as Mark Halperin protests, he\u2019s mostly cured now.These statements of the men seem especially shabby when compared with the majestic testimonies of the women who have come forward. In their interviews, essays and op-eds, they relive moments of terror and humiliation and shame, even as they are forced to establish their credibility and, in some cases, account for their silence over the years. Intense introspection marks these statements. The women audit themselves to a fault and reckon painfully with what speaking out might cost them. In a column in The Hollywood Reporter, the screenwriter Jenny Lumet described being sexually assaulted by Russell Simmons \u2014 and her fear of going public now: \u201cI have built a life in the past 25 years and a reputation in my industry. I need no one to have this visualization of me. I will, like the others, lose work because of this.\u201d She wrestles with guilt \u2014 \u201cAs a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color\u201d \u2014 and worries about the effect of this story on his children. It\u2019s an extraordinary piece of writing. In response, Simmons offered little more than a limp admission of his thoughtlessness before turning to his real task: buoying up his shareholders.But in this way these statements \u2014 even when garbled, terse or self-serving \u2014 are revealing. You can glimpse how the men have learned to live with \u2014 and avert their eyes from \u2014 their own cruelty. You can see how they continue to insulate themselves from fully understanding the suffering they have caused. How much easier it is to cop to \u201cthoughtlessness\u201d or \u201cinsensitivity\u201d (another favorite word of the accused) \u2014 to hurting someone\u2019s feelings, essentially \u2014 than to acknowledge the realities women enumerate: panic, revulsion, rage, depression, decades of lost work. There\u2019s a profound dissonance between the gravity of the events the women describe and the men\u2019s mild interpretations.Odysseus, of course, finds his way home. Which is what many of the women coming forward fear. \u201cThere seems to be a formula for redemption: Apologize, put your head down, remove yourself from the public eye, come back up after enough time has passed, align yourself with the people that you\u2019ve wronged and then resume your place back in line exactly where you were kicked out,\u201d the actress Olivia Munn, one of at least six women who have accused Brett Ratner of sexual misconduct, told The Los Angeles Times. The public censure, the shows being canceled, the outrage, she says, is just pruning; \u201cthe disease still remains in the tree.\u201dSmokey Mountain was eventually shut down in 1995. It\u2019s still inhabited, but more sparsely. You can take tours now and imagine it in its heyday. A few miles away, a new dump thrives. It\u2019s twice the size.As told to Kathy Dobie by a BartenderI\u2019m 32, and I\u2019ve been a bartender for 10 years, five in New York City. There\u2019s always been a sort of warning system that bartenders have for everything from people who drink too much to sexual predators. Even in a city as big as New York, everyone in the industry knows one another. Bartenders and waiters take care of people \u2014 that\u2019s our job. So it\u2019s important that we take care of one another.When I was 21, at my first official bartending job, the owner had already been sued for sexual harassment, I heard. One night, I went into his office to take him the money from the register, and he patted my butt on my way out. I immediately put on a stern face and said, \u201cNo!\u201d as if he were a dog. From that day forward, he never tried anything like that. My experience in the industry has been that if you assert yourself and make your boundaries clear, they will be respected. It\u2019s actually a largely liberal industry, and that sense of community, of fairness, of gender equality, I think it\u2019s felt a little more strongly in this industry than others, because more often than not you work as a team, men and women together. I felt that if somebody were to act inappropriately toward me, I could immediately go to a co-worker, a co-owner, and it would shame them. My industry\u2019s not like the entertainment industry. There\u2019s only so many big-time producers, but there are enough bars and restaurants in the world to employ everyone. I know people are not always as fortunate as I am. I\u2019ve never been in a position where if I were to quit on the spot, I would go hungry the next day, or worked in a small town where there\u2019s nowhere else to go. I don\u2019t have to pick from the bottom of the barrel. But there\u2019s a lot of bottom of the barrel out there.By Laura KipnisWhen Henry Kissinger famously said that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, what he actually meant, I think, is that power makes an unattractive man more alluring. Attractive men don\u2019t need aphrodisiacs: Physical attractiveness is its own aphrodisiac. In Kissinger\u2019s formulation, power is a fungible currency \u2014 interchangeable with beauty, and sufficient quantities of it offset shortfalls in physical appeal.The question is whether Kissinger\u2019s premise has reached its expiration date.Or that\u2019s what I found myself wondering following the first round of sexual-harassment revelations, as conversations with friends inevitably turned, often with dark hilarity, to the physical hideousness of so many of the accused men. Of course, the hilarity was tinged with a bit of guilt, voices were lowered \u2014 because we weren\u2019t in high school, right? Having been subject to the brutality of appearance rankings ourselves, we should refrain from imposing them on others, right? Still, surveying the photo arrays of the accused, you suspected that these were not the sought-after guys in high school. Now, old and smug, bloated with power and fine cuisine, their physical unloveliness gave the unfolding story a pleasing Grimm-like quality: They\u2019d acted monstrously, and they looked the part.As friends shared their own episodes of harassment and gross come-ones, I noticed a theme emerging, something I hadn\u2019t considered. Being hit on by someone you judged unattractive was regarded as more insulting than being encroached on by someone decent-looking. A friend who\u2019d had to physically fight off a drunken but not uncomely movie star with whom she\u2019d shared a limo described the ordeal with amused outrage, but a mild overture from an aging, balding editor who looked like a potato in horn rims (her description) left her fuming. It was a sudden glimpse into a complicated set of internal sociosexual calculations that I suspect we all perform. Clearly it\u2019s the harassing behavior itself that\u2019s wrong, but being harassed by someone from a different attractiveness echelon compounds the affront. Perhaps it risks lowering you in your own esteem \u2014 does he think he\u2019s in my league? \u2014 yet you feel guilty for making such reckonings.Everyone knows the principle of \u201cassortative mating,\u201d even those who aren\u2019t familiar with the phrase. It refers to the tendency to pick mates who are similar to ourselves in characteristics like class and education, and also, of course, attractiveness. There\u2019s nothing random about such choices, and obviously I\u2019m saying nothing a user of Tinder or Grindr would find surprising. The more attractive you are \u2014 or perceive yourself to be \u2014 the more attractive you want your mate to be, other things being equal.But other things aren\u2019t always equal: power and money allow people \u2014 male people, mostly \u2014 to jump the queue, so to speak. At least that rogues\u2019 gallery of unattractive harassers suggests this has been the operative fantasy. In the worst cases, it\u2019s a fantasy that power overrides consent, in the way that handsomeness or charisma wins female favor, \u201csweeps a girl off her feet.\u201d Like how being a rock star must feel \u2014 and were the harassing men rock stars in their imaginations, I wondered? \u201cHe\u2019s a rock star,\u201d people now say fawningly about every C.E.O. with a good fourth quarter. Do some of them start to believe it, misidentifying every woman they meet as a compliant groupie?When I decided to crowdsource the attractiveness question on Facebook, my female friends were eager to weigh in. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for female humans to express their distaste for such male flesh,\u201d one wrote. \u201cMen like these have long lived with the assumption their flesh is tolerable, and some may believe it\u2019s desirable.\u201d Someone who knew one of the accused harassers long ago recalled him as exceedingly brilliant but exceedingly homely; bent on seducing women to get back at the girls who ignored him in his youth. For the women, talking about male appearance leveled the playing field; letting men experience the same kind of vulnerability women have long endured felt like a small victory.Many of my male friends, however, were bristling, especially male progressives. They never thought about women in terms of appearance, more than a few said righteously. I was accused of body shaming, as well as superficiality, to which I retorted, summoning my inner Oscar Wilde, \u201cNothing is less superficial than appearance.\u201dHere\u2019s something else I found curious, but no one was exactly saying: there were not a lot of good-looking men among the accused harassers. Do those guys refrain from harassing women, or is it that they\u2019re less likely to get reported? Apparently men themselves believe it\u2019s the latter. A male Facebook friend directed me to an old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch titled \u201cSexual Harassment and You.\u201d Shot in black and white, in the style of a 1950s educational film, it depicts two different men, one an ungainly dork (Fred Armisen), and the other a handsome stud (Tom Brady), coming on to two female co-workers. The dork is threatened with harassment charges; the stud gets dates and phone numbers. I noted that the writer and director were both male.\u201cMale power\u201d has acquired a sleazier connotation than in Kissinger\u2019s heyday. If some men have operated on the principle that women\u2019s bodies were there for the plucking, regardless of niceties like consent, at least they\u2019ve been getting away with it somewhat less lately. Which is not to say there isn\u2019t still plenty of transactional sex and mating; plenty of \u201carm candy\u201d at the side of powerful unsightly men. It\u2019s not as though women haven\u2019t been complicit in propping up these arrangements. Let\u2019s be honest: We, too, have been known to leverage what we have, where we can. The question, obviously, is whether female versions of power would be less sleazy than male versions have been, especially because we keep hearing that the solution to the sexual-harassment problem is to put more women in positions of power. But even if men act out sexually more than women typically have, do we gain anything by playing the women-as-men\u2019s-betters card? Moral smugness isn\u2019t a great look, either. According to my informants, attractiveness matters plenty to women; we do our share of ranking and assessing, inequitable as that may be. The point is not assuming that your attractions are reciprocated. And that whatever obliviousness certain guys have displayed on that front ends \u2014 right around now.As told to Jaime Lowe by a SoldierI was a service member in the Army for nearly a decade. It seemed that men pulling women on top of their laps was not uncommon. It happened to me only when I was off duty, but always by my superiors. I lost count of how many times my ass was slapped or I was brushed up against. Stuff like that became so exhausting and conflicting. Conflicting because a lot of the time it was with guys I trusted and worked really well with.In the winter of 2011, my unit was in Kuwait. One time during a break, I went behind a shipping container to smoke a cigarette, and I was chatting with a sergeant from our company. About a month later, I was talking to an acquaintance who worked with this sergeant, and he just started joking about the time I gave the sergeant a blowjob behind the shipping container. I found out that the sergeant had been spreading rumors about very specific sexual acts that I had supposedly performed on him and others in the company. It was mortifying, and everyone seemed to know.I decided to make an informal complaint about it, and then I felt ostracized by members of my unit. It felt as if the unit was trying to protect this guy and not me. I was questioned, and some of the queries focused on the fact that I was always seen with men or that I encouraged a certain culture. Basically, I was being accused of asking for it because I told a dirty joke every now and again. I could tell what was happening, so I ultimately filed a formal complaint. That was extremely nerve-racking. It meant I was under an even bigger microscope. There were those who wanted to send me back home or to another base or to another unit altogether. They were just going to leave him there and uproot me. Remove the victim from the situation instead of the person causing the problem. There\u2019s a good-old-boy network.People in power are willing to ignore bad behavior because it\u2019s convenient or because outstanding performers in the unit are being protected. These guys are wonderful at their jobs, but some can be monsters behind closed doors.By Heidi JulavitsIn mid-November, my daughter began to notice the men. She had heard the reports about Harvey and Louis and Kevin and Al, and now she had a question. \u201cWhy have no women been accused of sexual misconduct?\u201d she asked.I was on autopilot and responded from an unthinking place: \u201cThese abuses are often a function of a power inequity, and many more men are in positions of power than women.\u201dWas my response an explanation? A justification? A brushoff? Did it imply an essentialist reading of gender? Was it, at a bare minimum, useful? At 13, my daughter will have her first job next summer. Substantive engagement with a soon-to-be underling about the dynamics of workplace power abuse seemed fairly critical.Around this time, I started to mishear the news. Sound waves entered my inner ear; men became women. I misheard, \u201c[Name of famous female writer that sounds like Roy Moore], Alabama\u2019s Republican candidate for the Senate, is alleged to have made sexual advances toward a woman who was 14 years old at the time.\u201d I heard, \u201c[Name of famous female writer that sounds like Roy Moore] forcibly kissed her when she was a high school student.\u201d In the absence of anything to laugh about, this misheard news made me giddy. Why? Women commit such abuses; it\u2019s no joke whatsoever. Maybe my brain wanted to hear fake news to complicate a secret message that I could not help worrying other people might be hearing and believing: Men abuse power, and women do not. Men have overbearing sex drives they cannot control, and women do not.Such thinking quickly lends itself to other \u201cthinking,\u201d like the thinking displayed by James Damore, the writer of the \u201cGoogle Employee Memo.\u201d Among his messages: The reason so few women work in tech is because women are biologically different from men, and we need to accept that women are gregarious (rather than assertive); women prefer aesthetics to ideas; women seek a work-life balance rather than professional status. The sum being: Women will never be as good as men at, for example, coding.I am not delivering such messages \u2014 at least not intentionally. But I recalled what I heard when I was a girl, when my mother and her friends actively fought for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. I understood \u201cequal rights for women\u201d to mean that women, historically, were not allowed to do what men were allowed to do and that women should be allowed to do all those things. I did not find this message controversial.But combined with the response I gave to my daughter, and the recent habits of my inner ear, I sensed another potential perversion of meaning. Men and women were equal. Men were not hornier than women or slimier than women. I might have been reassuring my daughter that when she assumed a position of power, she would be able to balance the scales; she and her female friends could sexually abuse powerless people, of any gender, with unrepentant (until caught) vigor.I decided to ask my daughter why she thought men were disproportionately guilty of sexual harassment in the workplace. She wondered if the preponderance of men in the news might be connected to the fact that, she had heard or read somewhere, a majority of all murders were committed by men. Then she paused. She thought about what her \u201cthinking\u201d implied. \u201cTo say that is a stereotype,\u201d she said. \u201cThat women don\u2019t murder or rape or harass, and men do. Because really no one should do any of those things.\u201dRight. No one should do any of those things. Somewhere along the way, baked into the acceptable standards of behavior for people in power, is a thing that nobody should do. And yet it became an entitlement. My daughter and I talked about power; was power to blame? Was power an unavoidably corrupting force? But to claim that power always corrupts risked excusing the individual offenders.We finally settled on one useful point for future thinking and action: For the first time during my lifetime, and also by implication, during hers, victims were proving more powerful than the power that created them. The next step would seem to involve the nonvictims in the redefinition of how power works. Because in the current system, it could be argued that there are three types of people: people in power, victims and nonvictims. Recently, I witnessed a nonvictim learn about the decades of power abuses perpetrated by a friend and colleague. \u201cI just wonder if I\u2019ve been complicit,\u201d the nonvictim worried. To which I wanted to reply: There can be nonvictims only so long as there are victims. If you do not call out your friend\u2019s behavior, then yes, you can count yourself complicit.On Thanksgiving, my family played a game of charades. Many people were involved, ages ranging from 8 to 85. I asked my son, who is 8, to contribute a clue. He gave me \u201csexual harassment.\u201d I asked him if he knew what it was. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s when you touch somebody, and they don\u2019t want you to touch them.\u201d Good enough. I put \u201csexual harassment\u201d in the salad bowl; I felt it had earned its cultural place alongside \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d and \u201cKim Kardashian.\u201d Maybe, too, I considered it a bit of an experiment. Who would pull the clue? Would a man\u2019s performance of \u201csexual harassment\u201d be more easily identifiable to the group over a woman\u2019s? Maybe it mattered only that the action be legible to all genders, no matter the body performing it.The person who pulled the clue was a man in his 60s. He approached the other team. He waggled his tongue; he exaggeratedly pretended to grab the bodies of the opposition in all the appropriately inappropriate places. Everyone knew immediately what he was doing. Men and women, girls and boys, all called out his actions, correctly, by name.Emily Bazelon moderates a round table with Anita Hill, Laura Kipnis, Lynn Povich, Soledad O\u2019Brien, Amanda Hess and Danyel Smith to talk about how \u2014 or if \u2014 real change is possible.By THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINEDec. 12, 2017Advertisement"}

But that argument ignores the fact that 72 quarterbacks have appeared in a game this season, dozens of whom cannot match Kaepernick\u2019s talent in any system.Everyone who smokes cigarettes knows that their lungs get a little blacker and death draws a little nearer with each puff.

For a more authentic New York market, though, you\u2019ll need to travel a few blocks farther than the last stop on the sightseeing bus.Every Saturday in December, La Marqueta, a community-based market space nestled beneath the elevated Metro-North tracks along Park Avenue in East Harlem, hosts a holiday pop-up market.Between booths of artistic crafts and cafe counters are tables where visitors can sip coffee, mingle with neighbors or just rest and tap their feet to the salsa music providing a pulse to the market\u2019s ambience.Puerto Rican flags and red bows hang from the walls. Handcrafted jewelry is displayed between knickknacks and paintings. One table sells Caribbean moonshine to the thirsty, while another offers African ingredients.\u201cThis is a market for the neighborhood, for El Barrio,\u201d said Jessenia Cagle, 41, manager of La Marqueta and an associate of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.A fixture of the market is the Hot Bread Kitchen, a nonprofit organization that teaches immigrant women how to bake, then helps them find employment. Peek through the glass window in the back of the market and you can see the full bakery that doubles as their classroom.In partnership with the City Council, La Marqueta grants private vendors permits to operate in their space. Most of the merchants are mom-and-pop shop owners without their own storefront, but with enough regulars to keep their stalls open for business.Melissa Mark-Viverito, who is the City Council speaker and represents East Harlem, announced in September that the market\u2019s outdoor space would undergo a $5.5-million face-lift \u2014 a renovation that will help the market grow and, Ms. Cagle hopes, attract more vendors.La Marqueta hopes to one day boom as it did in its heyday around the 1960s \u2014 when it was the go-to spot for all sorts, serving the wave of Latin American immigrants who planted their cultures\u2019 seeds in the neighborhood.\u201cA lot of residents here have a very strong sense of community,\u201d said Ms. Cagle. \u201cFor a neighborhood like this, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to have.

{"Headline": "Austria\u2019s New Government: A Mix of Far-Right, Pro-Europe and Youth", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A new coalition government was sworn in on Monday in Austria, and for the first time in more than 10 years it includes the far-right Freedom Party, a watershed for the populist movements that unsettled European politics this year.The return to power of the Freedom Party, which was founded by neo-Nazis after World War II, was concerning enough that Austria\u2019s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, took the exceptional step of eliciting several promises from the new government before he would administer the oath of office.Those included acknowledging Austria\u2019s commitment to European Union and its responsibility to a Nazi past that tore apart the Continent last century.Mr. Van de Bellen also reminded the new government leaders that they represent everyone in Austria, a rejoinder to a campaign characterized in large part by an antipathy toward immigrants.But he also reflects the ways in which the far-right has reshaped the political agenda in Europe, even among centrist and mainstream parties that could not ignore the populist surge, or do so only at their own peril.Mr. Kurz co-opted much of the far-right\u2019s political agenda, but to the chagrin of its critics, he gave it a fresh and youthful face in an establishment party, which has now also brought the far-right into government with it.Heinz-Christian Strache, 48 and chairman of the Freedom Party since 2005, will now become vice chancellor. His party was also given the interior and foreign ministries, as well as the defense portfolio, although the new government pledged to uphold and strengthen Austria\u2019s neutral stance.Concerns over the Freedom Party\u2019s neo-Nazi roots and its pro-Russia stance led Mr. Van der Bellen to include several checks and balances in the new coalition government agreement.\u201cA pro-European direction of the future government is central,\u201d Mr. Van der Bellen said in a statement announcing his approval of the coalition agreement on Saturday.\u201cSebastian Kurz and Heinz-Christian Strache have assured me that Austria is and will remain a strong country in the heart of Europe and that it will play an active role in the future shaping of the E.U.,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Van Der Bellen took precautions to try to insulate Austria against some of the turbulence that populist movements have ushered in elsewhere, including in Britain, where they catalyzed the referendum in favor of leaving the European Union.He insisted that the coalition members agree to language stipulating that the country\u2019s participation in the bloc was excluded from increased forms of direct democracy, effectively forcing the far-right party to drop its long-held call for a referendum on the E.U.He also insisted that the far-right abandon its desire to set up a \u201chome security\u201d ministry, warning the country must be mindful of its Nazi past.They seemingly complied, in public statements as well as spelling out their policies in the 180-page coalition agreement that was published on Saturday and will serve as a guideline for government policy for the next five years.\u201cAs a pro-European, a pro-European orientation of the future government is very important to me,\u201d Mr. Kurz said in a statement to supporters posted to his Facebook page hours before he took his oath of office.Mr. Kurz said although his party had to reach compromises with its far-right partners, the Freedom Party, many of the key issues from his own campaign would define the new government. They include increasing security by clamping down on illegal immigration, cutting taxes and making changes to the social welfare system.But Mr. Strache\u2019s interpretation of what the coalition intends to achieve sounded more in keeping with the hard, anti-immigration line of his own party\u2019s campaign. The Freedom Party had pledged to defend the country\u2019s generous social welfare system from abuse by migrants.\u201cNever again will it happen that migrants, who have not worked a single day here and have never paid anything into the system, receive a thousand euros in social welfare!\u201d Mr. Strache wrote on Sunday in a Facebook posting that was approved by more than 10,000 people.At a time when the differences between western European Union members\u2019 desire to distribute asylum-seekers throughout the bloc and eastern members\u2019 refusal to take in any new migrants is straining Brussels, the Austrians\u2019 tough stance could create further tensions.\u201cRealistically, migration will continue to be an issue for the next 20 to 30 years,\u201d said Stefan Lehne, who studies E.U. foreign policy for Carnegie Europe. \u201cIt is a complete illusion that you can block this totally. You need to deal in a responsible way.\u201dHundreds of people demonstrated against the new government in the streets of Vienna in the hours leading up to the swearing-in the city\u2019s Hofburg palace.But the numbers were small compared to the tens of thousands who blocked downtown Vienna for days after the Freedom Party, then under J\u00f6rg Haider, was sworn into government in 2000. That coalition, which lasted until 2003, carried out the privatization of several public entities, including Austria\u2019s postal and telecom companies, which left a legacy of corruption investigations, some of which are still going on today.The European Union responded to the earlier coalition with the far right by adopting sanctions against Austria that were dropped about six months later, when no violations materialized.For now, the measures agreed to by the new coalition appeared to mitigate concerns among Austria\u2019s European partners. Mr. Kurz plans to head to Brussels on Tuesday, where he will meet with Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, and other leaders. And Mr. Kurz has pledged that his government will focus on justice and the concern of the \u201clittle guy.\u201dChancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Mr. Kurz, who in the past has harshly criticized her welcoming stance on migration, saying she looked forward to continuing Berlin\u2019s cooperation with Vienna.Pierre Moscovici, a Social Democrat from France who is now the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, warned that the E.U. must keep an eye on Vienna, while conceding the situation was not the same as 17 years ago.\u201cThe coalition now in power in Austria should elicit vigilance of Democrats committed to European values,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said on Twitter. \u201cThe situation is certainly different than that in 2000, but the presence of the far-right in power is never trivial.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: California Grenache", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolFrom amontillado we go to a much more contemporary sort of wine, grenache from California.Also known as garnacha in Spain, where the grape is thought to have originated, grenache has long been a part of the California equation. It was an essential component in old mixed black heritage vineyards, in which many different black grapes were planted and vinified all together.Over the last 30 years, I\u2019ve seen a few good examples of California grenache, but it\u2019s really been in the last decade or so that grenache has stepped out in California as an interesting wine with a great potential to evolve.Grenache wines must walk a narrow path. The grapes thrive in hot, dry places. But if too hot, and the grapes get overripe, the wines can be sweet, hot and dispiriting. If grown carefully and vinified without solely power in mind, grenache can be spicy, herbal and complex.The three wines I recommend are:One of these, the Dashe, is pure grenache. The other two are blends.I will confess, the wines we will be drinking are new to me, so I\u2019m not yet sure what I would serve with them.

{"Headline": "Sicily\u2019s Emerald Green Gem: the Bronte Pistachio", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Italy, when chefs use those pistachios, they proudly label them Bronte, after the town in the heart of the region. In New York, one of the flavors scooped by the Arte del Gelato chain is pistachio di Bronte. The quality of these particular nuts, which have been growing in Sicily for centuries, is known throughout Italy, and lately, they are being recognized for their distinctiveness in America.Usually, chefs in the United States simply call them Sicilian, said Fortunato Nicotra, the executive chef at Felidia in New York; he thinks it\u2019s because the term Bronte takes too much explaining. But he scatters Bronte pistachios on a beet salad, adds them to a vinaigrette for veal, and relies on them for desserts. \u201cThey\u2019re very fresh and sweet,\u201d he said.At Nougatine, Jean-Georges Vongerichten candies them to serve alongside foie gras, and dresses verdant spaccatelli pasta in basil-pistachio pesto with caramelized brussels sprouts. \u201cThey\u2019re moist and rich, not rancid,\u201d he said. \u201cOthers are dry, like peanuts.\u201dThey are definitely different. Compared with California pistachios, they are smaller, more deeply green, with skins beautifully brushed in royal purple, and they have a more richly concentrated flavor.In Sicily, Bronte pistachios are used everywhere. While visiting the island in mid-October, I met with Mary Taylor Simeti, the author of \u201cPomp and Sustenance: 25 Centuries of Sicilian Food,\u201d about Sicily\u2019s culinary traditions. We were at Antico Caff\u00e8 Pasticceria Spinnato in Palermo, where we discussed the confections colored, perfumed and textured with pistachios that covered our table: cassatas, cannoli, biscotti, cakes, semifreddos, panettones, fig-stuffed buccellatos, cookies and more.Several days later, I took a detour to the source, Bronte. Nunzio Caudullo, 57, whose grandparents founded the Antonino Caudullo pistachio company in Bronte, one of the first to open just after World War II, calls the nuts \u201cgreen gold from the base of the volcano.\u201dMount Etna rose in the distance, a wisp of smoke drifting from its summit. \u201cThe lava in the earth, the minerals in the lava, makes the taste of our pistachios different,\u201d Mr. Caudullo said. \u201cOther places like Iran, Turkey, California, do not have this kind of soil.\u201dA few miles from the center of the town, the trees, fairly low and spreading with shiny green leaves, are tangled everywhere. The harvest, usually from late August through September, is done entirely by hand. The nuts are spread under cloth canopies overnight, then shelled and packaged whole, chopped, ground or as paste at simple factories like the one attached to Mr. Caudullo\u2019s house. His mother, Maria Luca Caudullo, 85, is still involved in the company.With little prompting, she will reel off her favorite recipes for the nuts, like filet of beef encrusted with them, and a simple but lush pistachio cake. \u201cThat one I only make for Christmas,\u201d she said.Her son said, \u201cEvery family in Bronte has some pistachio trees,\u201d adding that the Romans first brought pistachios to Sicily from the Middle East, but then they were more or less forgotten. \u201cWhen the Arabs conquered in the ninth century,\u201d he said, \u201cthey restarted the cultivation.\u201dThe nuts are harvested every other year. Alternate fallow years protect the trees and improve quality. And, unlike with California pistachios, the trees are never irrigated, making the flavor more intense.In the United States, Sicilian pistachios are imported out of the shell and vacuum-packed, to help them retain their freshness. Sicilian pistachio cream or paste and ground pistachios are also sold. But, as Mr. Caudullo explained, since Bronte pistachios account for less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s pistachio production, and they\u2019re very expensive, there\u2019s great demand worldwide for nuts from California and elsewhere.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Mother\u2019s Maiden Name Is Not a Secret", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionResolutions to shake laziness, get organized and gain control of finances are ritually adopted each January and abandoned soon after. But there\u2019s one common bad habit that consumers and billion-dollar businesses alike should have quit long ago and can\u2019t afford to carry into 2018: the use of weak website security questions.Security questions are astonishingly insecure: The answers to many of them are easily researched or guessed, yet they can be the sole barrier to someone gaining access to your account. The cryptology and security expert Bruce Schneier once described them as an \u201ceasier-to-guess low-security backup password that sites want you to have in case you forget your harder-to-remember higher-security password.\u201dStill, this technology has persisted despite the availability of two-factor authentication, and on sites that we use frequently and that contain important, sensitive data \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, eBay, PayPal and many banks and airlines.There has been no shortage of incidents demonstrating these questions\u2019 vulnerabilities. In 2005, Paris Hilton\u2019s T-Mobile account was hacked by a teenager who, like anyone who searched \u201cParis Hilton Chihuahua\u201d on the internet, knew the answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite pet\u2019s name?\u201d In 2008, Sarah Palin\u2019s Yahoo account was hacked by a college student who reset her password using her birth date, ZIP code and the place where she met her spouse. In 2014, after nude photos of several Hollywood actresses were leaked, Apple reported that their iCloud accounts had been hacked through \u201ca very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions.\u201dIf you aren\u2019t famous enough to be a target, you may still be a victim of a mass data breach. Whereas passwords are usually stored in hashed or encrypted form, answers to security questions are often stored \u2014 and therefore stolen \u2014 in plain text, as users entered them. This was the case in the 2015 breach of the extramarital encounters site Ashley Madison, which affected 32 million users, and in some of the Yahoo breaches, disclosed over the past year and a half, which affected all of its three billion accounts.The Equifax breach this year may have revealed some users\u2019 security questions and answers outright, and it certainly gave thieves enough personal information to answer common questions. TransUnion evidently did not heed this warning: Users wishing to freeze their credit files in the wake of the Equifax breach have to create an account, and to do so they must choose a security question, such as \u201cWhat city were you born in?\u201dAccording to Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, organizations continue to use security questions because they are easy to set up technically, and easy for users. \u201cIf you ask someone their favorite color, that\u2019s not a drama,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to give you a straight answer. If you say, \u2018Hey, please download this authenticator app and point the camera at a QR code on the screen,\u2019 you\u2019re starting to lose people.\u201d Some organizations have made a risk-based decision to retain this relatively weak security measure, often letting users opt for it over two-factor authentication, in the interest of getting people signed up.Security questions ask for something you know about yourself, and to be even moderately secure, they should ask for something only you know. It\u2019s exceedingly difficult to design questions that do this. Many security questions ask for biographical information that is publicly available, whether in open records or via social media: where you were married, your first phone number, your paternal grandfather\u2019s middle name.Aside from these questions\u2019 vulnerability to a little research (to say nothing of nosy parents or malicious exes), none of them are relevant to all adults. How many of us can answer the premillennial \u201cWhat city were you in to celebrate the year 2000?\u201d or \u201cWhat year did you take out your first mortgage?\u201d And how many Indian- or Brazilian-born users went to a high school without a mascot, or grew up on a street with no name? How many of our mothers never changed their names?The other main type of security question asks for a subjective answer. Such questions imagine lives punctuated by distinct firsts and bests and filled with enduring favorites, but favorites and bests and even firsts can change when people maintain accounts for decades. At some point, both factual and subjective security questions become archaeological. \u201cIn what month did you meet your significant other?\u201d requires a framing question: Whom were you with when you set up this account?A 2015 study by Google engineers found that only 47 percent of people could remember what they put down as their favorite food a year earlier \u2014 and that hackers were able to guess the food nearly 20 percent of the time, with Americans\u2019 most common answer being pizza. (Google has been phasing out security questions in recent years.) Even when people remember their answers, they sometimes forget their precise form. This hazard has prompted some websites to offer a fixed set of answers. To \u201cWhat is your favorite type of reading?\u201d United Airlines offers a pull-down menu with 19 options, including blogs, cookbooks, professional development and self-help, but nothing like literary fiction (the death of the novel?).As long as security questions are going to be used, professional consensus holds, they should have many possible answers, and each of those possible answers should be simple, stable, memorable and not easily researched or guessed. But questions that are sufficiently general to apply to most people almost never fulfill these requirements: \u201cWhat is your favorite season?\u201d \u201cWhat is your favorite fabric?\u201d \u201cWho is your favorite person in history?\u201dEven exceptions that look good at first fall short. \u201cWhat is the last name of the teacher who gave you your first failing grade?\u201d includes an assumption about academic records; strangely, it appears on the LSAT registration website, whose users\u2019 transcripts are likely to be too unblemished to furnish an answer. \u201cWhat was the name of the boy/girl you had your second kiss with?\u201d is impossible in its Proustian hyperspecificity. Then there\u2019s the State Bank of India\u2019s vertiginous \u201cWhat is the website that you rarely visit?\u201d which reads like a Zen koan whose purpose is to make you reflect on the unknowability of the answer.What would a truly powerful security question be? The ideal is a science-fiction scenario where your future self calls your past self, and your past self asks your future self to prove it\u2019s you. When given the chance to write their own questions, though, most people choose not an intimate secret but something more like \u201c1+1=?\u201dThe temporary solution, Mr. Hunt says, is to create false answers and to keep them somewhere safe, whether in a password manager (which can generate and store a random string for each answer field) or even on a piece of paper. Security questions pit \u201cusability against security,\u201d said Mr. Schneier, the cryptology and security expert, and the former usually wins.Security questions are premised on a paradox: Our experiences are at once universal and particular to us. Yet it seems we are all lazy in exactly the same way.Anne Diebel is a senior investigator at the private investigations firm QRI.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debunking Myths About Estrangement", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "New research challenges the deeply held notion that family relationships can\u2019t be dissolved and suggests that estrangement is not all that uncommon.Supported byIt\u2019s the classic image of the holidays: Parents, siblings and their children gather around the family table to feast and catch up on one another\u2019s lives. But it doesn\u2019t always work that way.After years of discontent, some adults choose to stop talking to their parents or returning home for family gatherings, and parents may disapprove of a child so intensely that he or she is no longer welcome home.In the past five years, a clearer picture of estrangement has been emerging as more researchers have turned their attention to this kind of family rupture. Their findings challenge the deeply held notion that family relationships can\u2019t be dissolved and suggest that estrangement is not all that uncommon.Broadly speaking, estrangement is defined as one or more relatives intentionally choosing to end contact because of an ongoing negative relationship. (Relatives who go long stretches without a phone call because of external circumstances like a military deployment or incarceration don\u2019t fit the bill.)\u201cTo the extent you are actively trying to distance yourself and maintain that distance, that makes you estranged,\u201d said Kristina Scharp, an assistant professor of communication studies at Utah State University in Logan.Estrangement is widely misunderstood, but as more and more people share their experiences publicly, some misconceptions are being overturned. Assuming that every relationship between a parent and child will last a lifetime is as simplistic as assuming every couple will never split up.It\u2019s usually a long, drawn-out process rather than a single blowout. A parent and child\u2019s relationship erodes over time, not overnight.Kylie Agllias, a social worker in Australia who wrote a 2016 book called \u201cFamily Estrangement,\u201d has found that estrangement \u201coccurs across years and decades. All the hurt and betrayals, all the things that accumulate, undermine a person\u2019s sense of trust.\u201dSome adult children, for example, moved away. Others no longer made an effort to fulfill expectations of the daughter-son role, such as a 48-year-old woman who, after 33 years with no contact with her father, declined to visit him in the hospital or to attend his funeral.Still others chose to limit conversations with a family member to superficial small talk or reduce the amount of contact. One 21-year-old man described how he called and texted his mother, but not his father, after leaving for college. \u201cThey still live together so obviously he noticed and that bothered him,\u201d he said.Estrangement is a \u201ccontinual process,\u201d Dr. Scharp said. \u201cIn our culture, there\u2019s a ton of guilt around not forgiving your family,\u201d she explained. So \u201cachieving distance is hard, but maintaining distance is harder.\u201dA complete rupture can be years in the making. It\u2019s been three years since Nikolaus Maack, 47, has had contact with most of his family. But he started distancing himself from his parents and siblings a decade before. \u201cI was staying away,\u201d said Mr. Maack, a civil servant in Ottawa. His father\u2019s temper had always kept him on edge, he said, and he felt that holiday meals were particularly uncomfortable and demeaning. Eventually, Mr. Maack stopped attending Christmas festivities altogether.Reached by email, Mr. Maack\u2019s father declined to be interviewed but insulted Mr. Maack and said he no longer considered him a son.And 19 percent of respondents reported that another relative or they themselves were no longer in contact with family.A woman once insisted to Dr. Agllias that she had not spoken to her son and his wife in seven years because she asked her daughter-in-law to bring a specific dessert to a family gathering, and the daughter-in-law had deliberately brought the same one she had baked. The mother-in-law saw it as \u201ca symbol of total disrespect,\u201d Dr. Agllias said, yet she revealed other factors that had undermined their relationship, including that she felt her son\u2019s wife sometimes kept the grandchildren from her and didn\u2019t properly take care of her son. The dessert, Dr. Agllias said, became a symbol of the \u201ccumulative disrespect\u201d she felt.Most of the participants said that their estrangements followed childhoods in which they had already had poor connections with parents who were physically or emotionally unavailable.For instance, Mr. Maack resented that he was routinely left in charge of his two younger siblings, so much so that he decided never to have children of his own.After years of growing apart, the final straw was his wedding day.In 2014, he and his longtime girlfriend decided to marry at City Hall for practical reasons: They realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to inherit his pension, otherwise. He didn\u2019t invite his family, in part because it was an informal gathering. But also because a brother had recently married in a traditional ceremony, during which his father had backed out of giving his speech. He worried that his father might do something similarly disruptive. He did not want to invite him and said he didn\u2019t think anyone else would come without him.\u201cI agonized over inviting them or not, for a long time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the end, decided, \u2018I can\u2019t have them there.\u2019\u201dHis family found out he was married through Facebook. One brother told him he was hurt he wasn\u2019t even told. And his sister and father made it clear they would no longer talk to him, according to Mr. Maack and his wife. Two other relatives confirmed their account.These days, one brother still talks to Mr. Maack, mostly through Facebook messenger, but they don\u2019t talk about the others.Advertisement"}

That basically lets anyone with a working car sign up for Uber, flooding the market with an enormous supply of cars and growing the business immensely. It\u2019s been a boon for Uber in the United States, and the company has hoped to spread that abroad as well.That said, some of Uber\u2019s most successful markets are those in which the company is tightly regulated and treated essentially like a taxi service. In New York, for example, Uber is required to only use drivers who are registered with the Taxi and Limousine Commission \u2014 that is, cab and private drivers \u2014 unlike most of the other cities in the United States. And yet, New York is still a huge market for Uber, where they do quite a bit of business.So does it cripple the business? No, and there are other cities Uber can try to push its UberX option.

{"Headline": "2017: Our Reporters Reflect on Covering Washington and Politics", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews from Washington dominated headlines and captured the world\u2019s attention this year. Here\u2019s a look at a handful of those stories, with reflections from the reporters who covered them. It would be an understatement to say that 2017 was one of the most exciting years in American politics in decades. January 28A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States after President Trump signed an executive order that sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, leading to chaotic scenes worldwide.At first I couldn\u2019t find the lawyers. I walked back and forth, texting Julie Kornfeld from the International Refugee Assistance Project, \u201cWhere are you I\u2019m at door 2.\u201d She wrote back, \u201cWe r near arrivals.\u201d I was so tired, I hadn\u2019t even realized I was looking for them in the departures area.The arrivals hall at Terminal 4 was eerily quiet. There was a woman selling Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee, but the trays in the glass case were bare of food. It would be hours before the doughnuts and muffins arrived. There were a few drowsy passengers. And there was an active if exhausted legal team of three attorneys.January 30The acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, had ordered government lawyers not to defend in court Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration.Shortly after 9, we walked into Upper Press, the suite of offices where the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, works. He was standing next to a desk where an assistant had her finger poised over a keyboard. Scanning the text on his iPhone one last time, he told the aide to hit \u201csend.\u201d\u201cWe just fired the attorney general,\u201d Mr. Spicer said matter-of-factly, turning to Maggie and me.February 13While at President Trump\u2019s Florida club, the president and his aides coordinated their response to a North Korean missile test. They did not bother to retire to a secure location. No sooner had I lifted fork to mouth than an email popped up on my phone: \u201cURGENT 9:30 P.M. CALL TIME.\u201d It was 9:27 p.m. The lid, evidently, was off.I rushed to rejoin Mr. Trump\u2019s press pool and we piled into S.U.V.s that raced to Mar-a-Lago. On the way, White House sources told me that the president had abruptly decided to join Mr. Abe in a public statement about a missile launch by North Korea that day. Earlier, Mr. Trump had refused to say a word about the test, but this was a president who had already developed a reputation for sudden reversals.March 4The United States has been trying to sabotage North Korea\u2019s missile program. Mr. Trump must decide what to do next.The launches were failing too often.That was the topic of the conversation I was having one day late last spring with Bill Broad, one of The Times\u2019s premier science writers. Just about every time the North Koreans tried to launch an advanced missile, it seemed to end up in the ocean seconds later. Maybe it was bad luck, we said to each other, or bad parts, or bad welding. After all, the North Koreans are not known for quality control. Or maybe something else was going on.April 11With crucial staff positions unfilled and no on-site first lady at the time, the White House had to try to organize the most elaborate and heavily scrutinized public event of the year.I first became interested in the Easter Egg Roll after a colleague alerted me to another quiet drama unfolding on Twitter: The wood products manufacturer that makes the commemorative eggs had been using the platform to nudge Mr. Trump to submit an order for the Egg Roll before he missed the production deadline.Intrigued, I began calling sources who might know something about the planning of the event. Many professed ignorance and even some alarm about whether Mr. Trump would hold the Easter Egg Roll at all; others told me plans were underway but the event would be scaled back \u2014 to about 20,000 attendees from nearly twice that many last year.May 4The House voted on a revised health care bill that would have repealed and replaced major parts of the Affordable Care Act.Unlike in the verbal tally in the Senate, though, the House vote is displayed on four scoreboard-like panels inside the chamber. And the panels aren\u2019t visible on C-SPAN. It was time to do some in-person research.I learned the rules of the House chamber. We could bring laptops, and there would be internet access. But the House press gallery forbids photography; we would have to type out descriptions of any visuals we wanted to capture. We also faced another challenge: hand-entering 431 votes split among four wall-size screens. Worse, the press seats were beneath the screens, making them hard to see. Several ill-placed wall lamps added to the difficulty. And once the voting period ended, the screens turned off, and the vote tally disappeared.May 9Mr. Trump abruptly fired James B. Comey, who was leading an investigation into whether Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.Something was clearly going on. After a few minutes, Mr. Spicer opened the door and announced to me and the half dozen other reporters who were nervously waiting that something important would be in our inboxes momentarily.NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson pushed him to share more as we all checked our email and saw nothing. Mr. Spicer pointed to ABC\u2019s Jon Karl.\u201cIt\u2019s your question from the briefing,\u201d he said, smiling.\u201cComey?\u201d Mr. Karl offered, recalling that he had asked Mr. Spicer whether the president still had confidence in the F.B.I. director.Mr. Spicer smiled broadly and put his finger on his nose. June 8Mr. Comey said that the president had tried to derail an investigation into an adviser and that he had lied about and defamed Mr. Comey.With hearings like this one, I have to preconceive of the scene. I make a layout in my mind of everything that\u2019s going to happen: the moment he arrives, the moment he sits down, the moment he raises his hand to be sworn in. And I set up my cameras to capture all those moments, to be fired remotely, all at the same time. (When I fired the picture of Mr. Comey surrounded by the press, I had the three other cameras firing too.)I put my fourth camera up on a full-length monopod and held it as high as I could. I pre-focused the shot ahead of time, and spent a little time making sure the image would be sharp. And, as more people arrived, I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can\u2019t put all these photographers into the foreground of the picture.\u201d So I took three or four steps back and zoomed out a bit.July 6Mr. Trump said that Western civilization was at risk of decline, bringing a message about \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d and \u201cthe creep of government bureaucracy\u201d to Warsaw.Usually, overseas presidential trips are elaborately choreographed affairs weeks or months in the making, with pre-baked schedules to match. But that afternoon, just five hours before Mr. Trump disembarked, I finally received an email from the White House informing me of his schedule \u2014 and my own \u2014 for the next day. It was the latest I could ever recall getting such information.But the Trump White House eschews many of the protocols and procedures that usually surround a president, and advance warning for the press about Mr. Trump\u2019s movements and plans can be difficult to come by. For instance, there was a mention of a \u201cnews event\u201d with President Andrzej Duda of Poland, but it would not become clear until the next morning whether Mr. Trump planned to take any questions.July 19The president also said in an interview that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, would cross a red line if he delved into Trump family finances unrelated to Russia.Whatever else he is, Mr. Trump is a news machine. He generates headlines every time he speaks. He has made the White House press corps a growth industry. With other presidents, we sometimes struggled to find nuggets of news in an interview; with Mr. Trump we were overwhelmed. After the session on Wednesday, I have now interviewed seven presidents \u2014 some in office, some after they left \u2014 and with Mr. Trump the experience is strikingly different in almost every respect.May 31The debate over what the president meant effectively consumed Twitter \u2014 or at least a certain segment of it.That tweet came on one of the few nights I left the office early, shortly before midnight, so I got the alert while I was driving home. I sat in my driveway for at least 20 minutes, waiting for Mr. Trump to either add to the covfefe tweet or delete it. (Most of us on the Washington bureau staff get Twitter alerts on our phones both when he tweets and when he deletes the tweets.) When he didn\u2019t, I became worried that something had happened to him. Had he fallen asleep? Did he have a heart attack? Was he called down to the SitRoom? It was weird.July 26I suspect that in years to come, when I am recounting what it was like to be a Pentagon correspondent, I will remember far more the combination of hurt and defiance in the voice of a transgender American service member when I asked him how it felt to wake up Wednesday morning to a tweet from President Trump that he was no longer welcome in this country\u2019s all-volunteer military.August 8The White House press secretary is more understated than her predecessor, Sean Spicer, but she still speaks for a president at war with the news media.It was Ms. Sanders\u2019s final meeting before the West Wing closed for a summer renovation, and her office was almost bare. A lone houseplant, a holdover from the Obama administration, drooped from a high shelf. \u201cI\u2019ve kept it alive until the last month and now it\u2019s just fallen apart,\u201d she told me.Was that a metaphor? She laughed. \u201cNo, the plant \u2014 it just didn\u2019t make it.\u201dSeptember 1A Times investigation found that infiltration efforts were broader than previously disclosed and that state and federal agencies have conducted few forensic inquiries.In fact, we discovered that precious little research had been conducted, the result of legal limits on the authority of intelligence agencies to address domestic issues and states\u2019 historic reluctance to permit federal oversight of elections.Michael Wines, who covers election issues for the Times, said that what stood out to him was the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s vast Rube Goldberg election system. Elections, he explained, \u201care run by understaffed, underfinanced and sometimes undertrained local officials, serviced by outside contractors who may or may not be well vetted, conducted with equipment and software that may or may not be secure.\u201dAnd Matthew Rosenberg, who covers national security issues for the Times, discovered that the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that the Election Day vote was not hacked \u2014 was extremely limited in scope.I started calling around to the election security and technology experts who had witnessed some of the troubles that cropped up on Election Day. I found that they, too, were still searching for answers and were befuddled by the lack of any substantial investigation.October 3The calendar of Scott Pruitt, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, showed fine dining with officials from companies he regulates but few meetings with environmentalists.Lisa covers the E.P.A. for The Times. I write about regulatory policy and lobbying. We spent much of the weekend reading through Mr. Pruitt\u2019s calendar.October 15Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona was in political peril ahead of the 2018 midterms, but he said he had no regrets in taking on Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake has since announced that he would not run for re-election next year.What I remember most about Mr. Flake that day was his mood. He was not defiant, as he would later be in his Senate floor speech. Rather, he was deeply reflective; in retrospect, it seems clear he knew even then that his political career was over.The shadowy program began in 2007 and was largely funded at the request of Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, who was the majority leader at the time and who has had a longtime interest in space phenomena.So how does a story on U.F.O.s get into The New York Times? Not easily, and only after a great deal of vetting, I assure you.Advertisement"}

On the other hand, one can\u2019t completely ignore the times we live in; I find that my best literary escapism comes from novels that resonate with the shadows over our lives, pretty much the same way that sad songs seem to help when you\u2019re having personal hard times.Of these, I think the best is \u201cDark Star,\u201d involving a journalist turned reluctant spy \u2014 a typical Furst protagonist, cosmopolitan, living in and loving Paris but being caught between multiple worlds and forces.Furst\u2019s novels have given me a lot of pleasure and relief. I hope they do something for you.Ulysses Grant was Donald Trump\u2019s opposite in nearly every respect. Understated. Underrated. Unadorned. Loyal to his soldiers, his president, his wife. A champion of African-Americans. Compulsively honest. Literate. Magnanimous. A supposed failure with a hidden genius for war \u2014 as opposed to a supposed success with a hidden string of failures.Grant was also an alcoholic who won the Civil War even as he struggled with his addiction. The current president is a teetotaler who behaves like a drunk and may yet be driving us toward another civil war.The book is about 1,000 pages long. I devoured it in a week. In these gloomy political times, isn\u2019t it good to be reminded of the stuff real leaders are made of?Dear Frank,Trillin is a master of the good first sentence. Here are a few of the ways he starts off his chapters: \u201cNow that it\u2019s fashionable to reveal intimate details of married life, I can state publicly that my wife, Alice, has a weird predilection for limiting our family to three meals a day.\u201d \u201cI once wronged the state of Kentucky, but compared with the Kentucky Fried Chicken people I am innocent.\u201d \u201cMy friend Fats Goldberg, the pizza baron, has been slim enough to be called Larry for years, but I still think of him as Fats Goldberg. So does he.\u201dTrillin\u2019s columns delighted me when I was first going into journalism. If not for Trillin I might never have become a columnist. I once mentioned this in an email to him. Trillin, a lefty who used to write for The Nation, responded, \u201cLet\u2019s keep that fact between ourselves.\u201dMaybe this is a little bit on the nose, but I have to recommend Michelle Dean\u2019s \u201cSharp: The Women Who Made an Art of Having an Opinion,\u201d a delicious cultural history that comes out in April. It brings together some of the most influential social critics of the 20th century, including Dorothy Parker, Mary McCarthy, Hannah Arendt, Susan Sontag and Joan Didion, and shows how these glamorous iconoclasts forged their singular careers. Dean makes the convincing argument that women\u2019s voices \u2014 if not necessarily feminist ones \u2014 did far more to define the last century\u2019s intellectual life than we realize. She writes, \u201cThe longer I looked at the work of these women laid out before me, the more puzzling I found it that anyone could look at the literary and intellectual history of the twentieth century and not center women in it.\u201dAs Robert Mueller opens up every Russian nesting doll of the Trump administration, down to that last hidden one, I\u2019m sending Andy all 744 pages of \u201cThe Romanovs: 1613-1918,\u201d by Simon Sebag Montefiore. The dynasty was, according to the author, \u201cblood-spattered, gold-plated, diamond-studded, swash-buckled, bodice-ripping and star-crossed.\u201dSounds like another dynasty we know.One character at court is described by the author as a \u201cshark that can clean its gills only by eating more.\u201d Does that ring a bell in the Trumpian era of turmoil and excess?I\u2019ve been trying to persuade Andy since the Republican convention to use his Russian language skills and sources to dig up the truth of what really happened between Trump and the Russians.I\u2019m hoping reading about another gold-plated, conspiracy-minded dynasty will spur you to head to Red Square, Andy.It\u2019s a villanelle, which, despite Dylan Thomas\u2019s best effort, is an underused, underexposed form: a musical sleight of poetic hand. It\u2019s overwrought and (per the title) madly romantic, like so much of Plath\u2019s work.And it really is right for you, in this sense: You have done such a spectacular, necessary job of chronicling epic suffering on grand canvases. But some of the most wrenching drama happens on the more intimate terrain of a tortured individual\u2019s heart.

{"Headline": "When the Body-Shaming Bully on Social Media Is Mom", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Sweet SpotDear Sugars,I\u2019m a 37-year-old woman with two children and a fantastic husband. I enjoy my career and have a fruitful social life. I\u2019m also obese, though I do my best to eat healthfully. I have spent a lot of energy on self-acceptance, and mostly I feel good about how I look. The problem is my mother.She has always been critical of my looks and has never shied away from telling me that I need to lose weight. Recently, she has started posting about my body on Facebook. Whether it\u2019s a negative comment on a photo or a post about weight loss on my wall, the message is clear: Your body is not acceptable. I delete the comments and hide the posts, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less hurtful.I\u2019m nervous to talk to her about this because she\u2019ll likely claim she didn\u2019t mean it the way I\u2019m taking it, and I\u2019ll end up apologizing and nothing will change. Her self-esteem is low, she\u2019s an alcoholic, and she has depression. I\u2019ve read that alcoholics tend to be hypercritical of others, but sensitive to feedback of their own behaviors. I\u2019m also sensitive to the fact that her behavior is learned \u2014 her mother is likewise critical. But I want to make sure she understands how uncomfortable it is to have your mom talk about your body critically in general, but especially in a public forum. What advice do you have for me in approaching this?Feeling ShamedI encourage you to let go of any notion about changing your mother\u2019s mind. Instead of imploring her to consider your feelings, protect yourself from her by setting and holding a clear boundary. Don\u2019t beg for her compassion. Tell her you will no longer accept her behavior.This will sound odd, but I suspect the reason you haven\u2019t confronted her more forcefully is because you feel guilty. You of all people recognize how sad and isolated she is, and like all loving children, you wish to remain connected to her, even if the price of that connection is withstanding her abuse. It\u2019s a doomed form of loyalty. Your job now is not to abandon her, but to defend yourself from the parts of her that are broken and destructive.You\u2019ve done the hard work of finding self-acceptance in other areas of your life. Now it\u2019s time to demand acceptance from your mother. She may not be able to handle this shift in the terms of your engagement, at least initially. But that\u2019s something for her to work out. Which is to say, it\u2019s her decision and not one you can control.Refusing to allow your mother to have access to you on social media doesn\u2019t mean you have to cut her out of your life. It means you\u2019re closing down a portal through which she has repeatedly chosen to hurt and shame you even after you\u2019ve explicitly asked her not to. Likewise, when she brings up the subject in conversation, tell her you will not discuss your body with her. I suggest you practice ahead of time so you won\u2019t lose your nerve. Write down the sentence you\u2019ll say in response to her criticisms and rehearse it so you\u2019re ready when the time comes.For all the reasons we\u2019ve enumerated, that has to stop. But here\u2019s a final one to consider, one that may stiffen your resolve: your children. You\u2019ve clearly worked hard to build a happy and meaningful life. Your marriage, career and social life attest to this, and your success in each area sends a positive message to your children.But the ways in which your mother has been able to chip away at your self-esteem sends quite a different message. The point isn\u2019t that you owe it to your children to stand up to your mother. You owe it to yourself. But in doing so, you\u2019re also sending a powerful message to your children about how to set limits with troubled people \u2014 even troubled grandmas \u2014 who attempt to inflict their self-hatred on you.Advertisement"}

If he does, he would be the most prominent lawmaker so far to be felled by the swirling allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct sweeping through the Capitol.A freshman Democrat, Representative Ruben Kihuen of Nevada, has faced calls for his resignation since charges emerged Friday that he had repeatedly propositioned his former campaign finance director.Accusations against Mr. Franken include an episode of forcible kissing on a U.S.O. tour before he was elected and several allegations that he groped women as he posed with them for photographs.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, also called on Wednesday for Mr. Franken to leave the Senate.Some have said Democrats are simply too quick to destroy their own, but the party appears intent on holding the high ground as sexual harassment scandals rock politics, entertainment and the news media.\u201cThe Democratic Party will stand up for women and for what is right,\u201d Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cPublic service is a public trust. If you are a candidate for office or an elected official who has engaged in sexual misconduct, you should step aside \u2014 whether you sit in the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate or the Oval Office.\u201dIf Mr. Franken resigns, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, could choose his successor from a list of prominent female Democrats, including Lt. Gov. Tina Smith and Attorney General Lori Swanson.That appointee could then run to fill the remainder of Mr. Franken\u2019s term next year, when the Democrats have the political momentum.Mr. Schumer quietly worked through the day to urge Mr. Franken to step aside. According to a person familiar with the conversations, Mr. Schumer called Mr. Franken before any of his fellow senators went public with their resignation calls and later met with Mr. Franken and his wife in Mr. Schumer\u2019s Washington apartment.Ms. Gillibrand was joined by Senators Mazie K. Hirono of Hawaii, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Dianne Feinstein of California, Patty Murray of Washington State, Kamala Harris of California, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Maria Cantwell of Washington State, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, who issued statements after talking privately with each other for weeks about what to do about Mr. Franken.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, added his support, as did Senators Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, as well as Mr. Perez of the Democratic National Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s time for him to resign,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cIt just seemed that the credible charges continued. I thought it might be an isolated incident or two. It seems to be that there was a pattern of conduct.\u201dBy the end of the day, well more than half of the senators who caucus with the Democrats, 35 of 48, and nearly all of the Democratic women in the Senate, had said that Mr. Franken must go. Some who remained silent did so because they serve on the Ethics Committee, which is considering his case.Mr. Franken has apologized for his behavior, but the senators said his admissions are not enough. Ms. Hirono said Wednesday\u2019s outpouring came after much thought.\u201cWe have been in touch with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult because I consider Al a friend. I\u2019ve sat with him in two committees, but that doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where I think that there can be a cultural change in terms of how women are perceived and treated in this country. This kind of bad behavior has been tolerated and ignored for far too long, but not today.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described Representative Joe Barton\u2019s ranking among the Texas delegation.

{"Headline": "Inside the Hollywood Home of Social Media\u2019s Stars. (Don\u2019t Be Shy.)", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 On any given day, something crazy is likely to be happening at 1600 Vine Street, a 550-unit apartment complex in Hollywood.Videos shot there have been watched billions of times. The common spaces \u2014 a spacious gym, walkways lined with beige blocks and a courtyard surrounded by lush plants \u2014 are so recognizable that it\u2019s like walking onto the set of a popular TV show.Some are comedians, some are models, and some are famous for being famous. But all are so-called influencers, social media speak for people with a huge digital audience.1600 Vine offers a peek into the booming ecosystem of these social media stars. As in any caldron of attention seekers who live and work together in the same building, it\u2019s an atmosphere rife with cliquishness, jealousy, insecurity and the social hierarchy of high school, except everyone knows precisely how popular (or unpopular) you are. And it\u2019s amplified by the fact that influencers can become millionaires with a following on a par with any movie star\u2019s.\u201cYou have all these people in the same environment who grew up together and getting their entertainment chops together,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re some of the biggest people on whatever platform they\u2019re on.\u201dThe origins of 1600 Vine as a social media launching pad are rooted, appropriately enough, in the video platform Vine.Around 2014, the stars of Vine\u2019s six-second videos started flocking to Los Angeles to turn a hobby into a career. A few of the early stars moved into this contemporary, amenity-rich complex, above a Trader Joe\u2019s and between Jimmy Durante and Clark Gable on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\u201cIt was perfect \u2014 we could film wherever, whenever,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to surround yourself with other creative people helps.\u201dSuccess stories like Mr. Diaz\u2019s are the reason wannabe influencers continue flocking to 1600 Vine, paying anywhere from $2,500 to $15,000 a month. Many aspiring photographers and video editors hang out in the common areas, hoping to get a foot in the door by working with a few prominent influencers.The complex is one of many modern apartment buildings in the Hollywood area. There is always the whisper that some other, nearby building is the new hot spot with more welcoming rules for social media stars, but 1600 Vine remains the most prominent and best known.Others see living at 1600 Vine as a golden marketing opportunity.\u201cAs a business expense,\u201d Mr. Offer said, \u201cthis place pays for itself.\u201dCalling 1600 Vine home is still no guarantee of influencer status. It also breeds a certain kind of cliquishness and backbiting.\u201cThat\u2019s considered laughable for most people here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople kind of look at you and just see the numbers.\u201dOne influencer told him that he was following too many people on Instagram. It made him seem desperate. \u201cI thought he was joking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he was dead serious.\u201dThe building also attracts its share of fame seekers, like the Justin Bieber impersonator who has all the same tattoos as the actual singer and is often seen visiting a friend in the building.It is also a magnet for bizarre behavior that doesn\u2019t exactly make for good neighbors. Social media stars need daily content lest they be forgotten. It\u2019s a dynamic that pushes them to do increasingly outrageous things to capture attention.After other neighbors started to complain, management has also limited where residents can shoot. First, it banned filming by the courtyard pool. Then it banned large professional cameras in all common areas. And in June, management went further and now requires residents to seek permission before shooting any video in common areas.Danielle Guttman Klein, chairwoman of Klein Financial Corporation, which oversees the property\u2019s management, said it needed to walk a fine line between embracing its stars and protecting the interests of tenants whose day jobs don\u2019t revolve around getting likes on Facebook.The influencers seem to sympathize, at least for now. Ms. Cerny said that she had been threatened with eviction but that management had allowed her to stay when she promised to not film in any of the common areas. But she said she could understand why many of the big stars had moved out.\u201cIt does get overwhelming sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually, you need somewhere to go and not post about your life for a second.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Make Its Case, Armagnac Has to Teach the Teachers", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cEducation\u201d has become the prevalent sales buzzword for bars that pour high-end liquors, with the idea that enthusiastic customers will buy and drink spirits they\u2019ve never heard of, if only someone can teach them why. But in order to tell the 700-year-old story of Armagnac to their customers, the educators themselves often need to be educated.Ms. Matta-Aliah explained the distillation process, the region\u2019s three geographic subzones, which grapes are used to make the base wine and how Armagnac differs from whiskey or other brown spirits \u2014 namely, that the raw ingredient is grapes, not grain, agave or molasses.Over the course of an hour, Fine & Rare\u2019s employees tasted brandies from top producers like Tariquet, Darroze and Caster\u00e9de.\u201cWhen I taste Scotch and bourbon, I feel like the first thing you get is the oak, but this is all so different,\u201d said Greg Homidoff, a server. \u201cThey\u2019re like French perfumes.\u201dBrandy still suffers from a stuffy image of snifters and smoking jackets, and thousand-dollar bottlings in crystal decanters. Most of that reputation comes from Armagnac\u2019s flashier cousin Cognac. But Armagnac is to Cognac what mezcal is to tequila \u2014 a drink mainly produced by small operators rather than large conglomerates.Armagnac is single-distilled at a low temperature in column stills \u2014 in contrast to Cognac\u2019s double distillation in pot stills \u2014 and some houses are so small that they don\u2019t even own stills, employing roving distillers that go from estate to estate. The single distillation means that fewer of Armagnac\u2019s natural elements are stripped out, making a more boisterous, rustic brandy.\u201cWe have no perfect Armagnac,\u201d said Marc Darroze, whose family\u2019s Darroze label was one of the first imported into the United States in the mid-20th century. \u201cWe don\u2019t want perfection. Consistency, yes. But we want to be as diverse as possible.\u201dThe Armagnac region grows grapes similar to those used to Cognac (ugni blanc, folle blanche, colombard) with one key exception: baco, a hybrid of folle blanche and the North American grape noah, created in the late 19th century to withstand the phylloxera plague.Hybrid grapes are not permitted in Europe, and in 2010, the European Union tried to ban baco. Armagnac producers won the right to retain their beloved hybrid, which many believe is the secret to long-aged Armagnac. \u201cAs a grape, baco is like an American muscle car,\u201d Mr. Palazzi said. \u201cIt can withstand years and years of oak.\u201dThe idea of educating American drinkers often strikes people in Armagnac as funny. \u201cIt\u2019s important to educate people,\u201d said Armin Grassa, whose family owns Tariquet, one of the largest independent Armagnac houses. \u201cBut not too many people should discover Armagnac. Because, after all, we don\u2019t really have enough.\u201dYet Armagnac education seems to be working. Sales in the United States have grown 131 percent since 2009, making the country the top export market for Armagnac.The entire region of Armagnac sells about six million bottles per year worldwide. Compare that with Cognac, which annually sells around 160 million bottles worldwide, more than 60 million in the United States. More than 90 percent of the Cognac sold on the American market comes from one of four major brands: Hennessy, Courvoisier, R\u00e9my Martin and Martell.Mr. Palazzi, who imports both Cognac and Armagnac, insists that Armagnac is easier to sell. \u201cWith Cognac, we have to deconstruct the existing knowledge, then build it back up,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Armagnac, we build on an absence of knowledge.\u201dWith its long aging process, it\u2019s no surprise that Armagnac appeals to the sort of drinker who already enjoys bourbon and rye. \u201cBrandy is hot right now,\u201d said Tommy Tardie, the owner of Fine & Rare.Though brandies traditionally hover around 40 percent alcohol by volume, higher-proof \u201ccask-strength\u201d Armagnac offerings (often 45 to 50 percent A.B.V.) \u2014 similar to those bottlings that whiskey lovers seek out \u2014 are on the rise.As bourbon prices skyrocket, brandy is starting to look more and more attractive. That\u2019s not to say that Armagnac prices can\u2019t still be a shock. The best vintage, single-cask bottles can run more than $200. But it\u2019s easy to find good XO \u2014 Armagnac aged for at least six years \u2014 from $50 to $60. Almost all houses in Armagnac produce XOs that are at least 10 years old, or older. \u201cIn Cognac, you\u2019d never be able to find this value,\u201d Ms. Cooney said.Of course, all of this is going to require a lot more education.\u201cPeople love Armagnac,\u201d Ms. Cooney said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t know it yet.\u201dGood Armagnac is not cheap, but unlike fine wine, it will last a long time. (Each bottle is 750 milliliters.)Young, fresh, spicy and delicate. Great introduction to the spirit.Aged at least 15 years. Big, rich and smoky, with notes of orange zest, fig and nougat.Aged at least 15 years. Creamy, sweet aromas of coconut and cocoa, and a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e finish.Aged at least 10 years.

No, no, no, no, no,\u201d Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 replied, alarmed, and hastily picked up his suitcase himself. \u201cNo, no, no. Thank you.\u201dMr. Prats Monn\u00e9, 61, a quick-witted Spaniard with a ready laugh, runs the 900-employee department of health and food safety for the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union. He routinely mingles with Europe ministers and, once, met President Barack Obama.But this past week, he was in Iceland to speak at what was billed as the largest ever gathering of female political leaders, sponsored by a nonprofit devoted to increasing their numbers. Less than one-quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide are held by women. Among heads of state, 7 percent are female.His topic: maternal health.\u201cWhen you speak to an audience of women about motherhood and you are a man, the risk of mansplaining is very high,\u201d he admitted.I had sought out Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 because I was curious: At an international conference of politicians, how does a man feel when he is in the minority? What could it tell us about gender equality?An anthropologist by training, Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 was intrigued. \u201cI deal with primates every day,\u201d he said of his male colleagues. \u201cMaybe this will be different?\u201dHe agreed to let me shadow him for 24 hours.At 5.30 p.m., that female driver, a 27-year-old named Erla, was taking us to our first event: a reception hosted by Iceland\u2019s former president Vigdis Finnbogadottir, 87, whose cult status is such that all Icelanders refer to her by her first name. Vigdis means war goddess in Old Norse. In 1980, she became the country\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) first directly elected female president \u2014 and was a single mother to boot.Erla told us that gender roles were not that clearly defined in Iceland: Her father, she said, was \u201ca housewife\u201d for a few years when she was a teenager. Her mother, a nurse, was the breadwinner.It was starting to snow. The landscape outside was barren, almost moonlike. \u201cYou need to be pretty tough to survive in this climate, man and woman,\u201d Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 observed.He had noticed the sturdy shoes women wore on the plane flight over.\u201cIceland is also egalitarian in appearance,\u201d he said.When we arrived at the reception, at a newly built language center dedicated to Vigdis, two dozen women were spilling out of a shuttle bus and into the revolving doors. In his suit and tie amid a sea of colorful dresses and blazers and head scarves, Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 turned some heads.The ground floor was packed with women and a sprinkling of men, most of them security guards and journalists. Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9, a regular at conferences, said the room not only looked different, but sounded different, too: \u201cIt\u2019s so quiet,\u201d he said.Next to us, two women \u2014 a center-left lawmaker from Europe and a conservative one from the Middle East \u2014 met for the first time. They hugged and kissed. Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 mostly shook hands.\u201cIt is a cohesive group that has its own signs and body language,\u201d he said, his inner anthropologist emerging. \u201cThey acknowledge each other as being from the same tribe. I\u2019m not from their tribe \u2014 although I do feel very welcome.\u201d\u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d Ms. Koch-Mehrin replied.Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 has never faced such issues himself. But he empathizes. \u201cThere is no such thing as a glass ceiling,\u201d he said at one point, \u201cjust a big fat layer of men.\u201d Of his 35 peers as directorate heads in the European Commission, he noted, only one in five are women.When he was a student in Madrid 40 years ago, Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 read the \u201cThe Subjection of Women\u201d by John Stuart Mill and was deeply affected by it.I asked if he is a feminist.\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cThe opposite of feminism is ignorance.\u201dMr. Prats Monn\u00e9 wanted to know more about the building, a striking modernistic structure, and someone pointed him toward a gentleman in a gray suit.\u201cThe building manager or something,\u201d Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 explained after they spoke.When I told him later that the man turned out to be the speaker of the Icelandic Parliament, Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9 laughed. \u201cIn this setting, when you see a man, you assume he\u2019s the janitor.\u201dThe next morning, we took seats near a delegation of Jordanian lawmakers and a Greek diplomat. At the next table were the presidents of Lithuania, Malta, Estonia and Croatia. Two tables over were the former prime ministers of Canada and New Zealand. All women.On the sidelines were half a dozen young men in suits: aides to the delegates, I was told. One held his boss\u2019s white coat.Each spoke about how gender equality is their fight, too. They mentioned a 1975 strike, when Iceland\u2019s women walked out of factories and kitchens for a day, demanding equal pay, and the subsequent founding of a feminist party. Since then, Iceland, an island of 330,000, has established shared parental leave, banned strip clubs, instituted gender quotas in boardrooms and passed same-sex marriage with a unanimous vote.Today\u2019s global #MeToo movement is claimed by men as much as by women here.\u201cWe men no longer give our tacit approval to sexual harassment,\u201d the foreign minister said. The president concurred: \u201cWe have had enough.\u201dIceland is living its own #MeToo moment, after the country\u2019s youngest female lawmaker, Aslaug Sigurbj\u00f6rnsdottir, 27, went on television last week to share her experience: of rumors that she had slept her way up, of a rival candidate putting his hand on her thigh every time he addressed her in front of a room full of students.An hour after the program aired, Ragnar \u00d6nundarson, a banker, had reposted one of her Facebook pictures. \u201cI want you to think about the kind of image you project,\u201d he had written.A day later you could buy T-shirts featuring a troll with the caption \u201cDon\u2019t be like Ragnar,\u201d and by now 500 people have signed a petition supporting Ms. Sigurbj\u00f6rnsdottir.Watching the gathering from Mr. Prats Monn\u00e9\u2019s perspective only underscored its significance, amplifying the subtle signals, sounds, interactions and exchanges that characterized a room filled with powerful women.When his turn came to speak, it was on a panel with four women. As a health expert, he said he is used to speaking to female audiences, \u201cbut usually I\u2019m on a panel of men talking to a female audience.\u201d\u201cInstitutionalized mansplaining,\u201d he calls it.Afterward, I asked one of the other panelists if the organizers had invited him onto the panel because they were mindful of diversity.\u201cNo,\u201d she assured me, \u201che is definitely not the token man.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Every time I leave the house, I want to look good, even if it\u2019s basketball shorts and a T-shirt. Tell me about your outfitThis is a Supreme for Playboy top, Daniel Patrick pants and Balenciaga sneakers. When did you buy your first Supreme item? When I came to the U.S., like three years ago. I knew about it before I moved, but wasn\u2019t a fan. I would line up for it for my ex-boyfriend.What made you want to come to ComplexCon? I came last year and it\u2019s not as crazy this year, but you can get a lot of exclusive stuff. This year I got the V.I.P. ticket and it\u2019s much easier.

Where are your pants from? Is the watch rose gold? Yeah. So everything is pink. Yeah. Even the glasses have rose-tinted lenses. Do you have a Chanel obsession? I do. I made this shirt, it\u2019s a vintage Marilyn Manson T-shirt that I screen-printed. One of my best friends who worked for Chanel got me this bag, and green is my favorite color. But the pants are Dickies. What do you like about Chanel? It\u2019s traditionally a women\u2019s brand. That\u2019s what I like about it. Some people are afraid to wear it, but it\u2019s so iconic and I\u2019ve always loved it. For me it\u2019s about being confident and wearing what you love. I mean, it\u2019s just a green bag. I love their trainers and I think that Karl Lagerfeld is very special. I like your rings, too. This one I made with this amazing jeweler who used to be based in the East Village, Greg Wolff. This is just Chrome Hearts. And the necklaces, this is Cartier and a black diamond pendant. And my best friend brought this back from Thailand, it\u2019s jade. It\u2019s a bunch of memories. Tell me about this cardigan and turtleneck. I do a lot of vintage shopping, and as a designer I design a lot of my clothes. These pants are samples I made, and the cardigan I got secondhand on Melrose. The turtleneck I found at Macy\u2019s.So you don\u2019t care about designer clothing.

This is one of the most important places for me to be. It\u2019s a free marketplace where all the people who care about our brand come. There\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be. What\u2019s driving street wear now? You want to make things that people don\u2019t have yet, that brings something dynamic to the market. People want something surprising. They want the message, the story. It\u2019s not just about a cool graphic, it\u2019s the story behind it. You may be the only guy here wearing tailoring. I just had to do what feels right for me. I really wanted to wear these shoes, and to make them work I needed to wear these pants. Where is everything from? The shoes are Adidas and I got the pants in Japan, but everything else is vintage. So what made you want to buy a ticket and come? To meet up with friends, continue to work. As an artist, it\u2019s inspiring but also productive from a sensible standpoint, like meeting people. And where\u2019s your hat from? It\u2019s my dad\u2019s hat. Did he give it to you? No, I stole it, but he understands. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Champagne Seeks to Discover Itself in Single-Vineyard Wines", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourChampagne, it is often said, celebrates the art of blending.In the cellars of the best of the big houses, the chef de cave (the head of the winemaking team) selects from dozens of still wines, taken from different grapes grown in vastly different vineyards from many different vintages.From these still wines, the chef assembles an ideal combination, which will then be bottled with a bit of yeast and sweetness. The resulting second fermentation in the bottle produces carbon dioxide, which creates Champagne\u2019s sparkle.This is how the best nonvintage Champagnes are produced. By the time these Champagnes are uncorked, the pleasures they offer will have little connection to the lands on which the grapes were grown. Instead, the Champagnes present, year after year, a consistent style embraced by the house.Even as the vast majority of Champagnes are made in a similar fashion, a growing number now express a different point of view. Instead of wines that convey a house style, these Champagnes \u2014 often produced by small farmers who tend their own vineyards \u2014 reflect the characteristics of grapes grown in a particular village or area. They are specific, individual and occasionally quirky, rather than smoothly consistent.Some producers have taken the notion of specificity even further. In the last 20 years, Champagnes in which all the grapes come from a single vineyard, or a single plot within a larger vineyard, have proliferated.With more discrete wines at their disposal, Champagne producers have more tools for improving their blends. But these microvinifications also give winemakers the opportunity to highlight a truly distinctive wine by bottling it separately.This is nothing remarkable if you are thinking of wines from almost anywhere else in the world. The Burgundy region was built on parsing the minute differences among vineyards, with the greatest respect given to those with the most distinctive characters.But in Champagne, such differentiation represents almost a sort of heresy against the art of blending. For decades Champagne marketing has emphasized the importance of such cellar work over the character of the vineyard.Yet, Krug is also responsible for perhaps the most famous single-vineyard Champagne, Clos du Mesnil. Since 1979, Krug has produced this blanc de blancs (Champagne made solely from white grapes) with chardonnay grown in a small walled vineyard in the center of Mesnil-sur-Oger in the C\u00f4te des Blancs. Krug has also, since 1995, bottled the most expensive single-vineyard Champagne, Clos d\u2019Ambonnay, a blanc de noirs \u2014 made only from black grapes \u2014 from a tiny walled plot in Ambonnay. It runs from $2,000 to $4,000 a bottle.Back in 2003, Mr. Krug called the single-vineyard Champagne \u201ca contradiction wine.\u201d If so, Champagne has been producing more and more contradictions.Pouillon\u2019s Les Blanchiens, by contrast, is made up of pinot noir and chardonnay grown on soils with more clay. As is typical of clay\u2019s influence, the wine is broad and voluminous, savory with an almost exotic spiciness.These two utterly distinct wines might have been blended together. They might have made a more-complete single Champagne, though consumers would have lost the pleasure and fascination of comparing the two different expressions.For Alexandre Chartogne of Chartogne-Taillet, who runs his family\u2019s estate, the decision to make single-vineyard Champagnes is a matter of education, of trying to understand through the medium of the wine the character of the land in all its intricate, natural details, much as Cistercian monks did in France centuries ago.\u201cBy choosing to work with plots, I continue the work of understanding and interpreting nature,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI try to capture the natural wealth and translate it in the best way in my cellar, without modification.\u201dDozens of growers are now seeking to better understand their terroirs through single-vineyard Champagnes. Often, the wines are superb.Single-vineyard Champagnes are largely a high-end pleasure. Less-expensive bottles, like the Chartogne-Taillet Champagnes, run around $85. But most cost more than $100 a bottle, while the Selosse wines can cost as much as $500 or $600, and Clos du Mesnil, $800 to $1,000.So little is known about the terroirs of Champagne \u2014 or, to put it another way, so much that was once known has yet to be rediscovered \u2014 that the single-vineyard Champagnes are an odd sort of pleasure. Without knowing what to expect, as one might with, say, a white Burgundy like Meursault Perri\u00e8res, the sensation is one of discovery rather than recognition. The recognition will come with drinking these wines over the years and noting the characteristics that distinguish one plot from another.\u201cAs a consumer and as a student of Champagne, I\u2019m really happy to see this proliferation because it helps us get a more detailed picture,\u201d Mr. Liem said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the future of Champagne terroir, but these are really important tools for understanding it better.\u201dSingle-vineyard Champagnes are unusual, rare and expensive, generally starting around $100 a bottle. But good, moderately priced Champagne, made in the more typical manner of blending grapes grown in different places, is widely available, though rarely cheap. Expect to pay $45 to $55 for these six excellent, nonvintage choices, in alphabetical order.Lively, savory, deep and rich, yet with great finesse.

{"Headline": "\u2018I Did It for the Islamic State,\u2019 Bombing Suspect Told Investigators", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlong his journey Monday morning toward a crowded subway tunnel below Midtown Manhattan, a would-be suicide bomber posted a statement to his Facebook page deriding President Trump, the federal authorities said on Tuesday. Then, among the throngs of commuters, he detonated a homemade pipe bomb affixed to his torso with the aim of inflicting as much death as possible.The complaint said that Mr. Ullah, who has been held at Bellevue Hospital Center, admitted to investigators that he had built the pipe bomb and carried out the attack.\u201cI did it for the Islamic State,\u201d he said, according to the complaint.It said he also told his interrogators that one of his goals in carrying out the attack \u201cwas to terrorize as many people as possible.\u201d\u201cHe chose to carry out the attack on a workday because he believed that there would be more people,\u201d the complaint added.The Facebook post, published by his account on Monday morning, read: \u201cTrump you failed to protect your nation.\u201dMr. Ullah, while at the hospital, waived his Miranda rights verbally and in writing, the complaint said.Mr. Ullah began to be radicalized by at least 2014, the complaint said, and he viewed ISIS propaganda online, including a video directing followers to carry out attacks where they were living if they could not join the group\u2019s efforts overseas. Using the internet, Mr. Ullah began researching how to build explosives about a year ago, the complaint said. Within the past two to three weeks, it said, he began gathering the materials to construct the bomb: a metal pipe which he filled with explosive material he created; screws to pack inside; and Christmas tree lights and a nine-volt battery to spark its detonation. Then, about one week ago, he built the pipe bomb at his apartment in Brooklyn.Investigators were continuing to delve into the past of Mr. Ullah, who is believed to have acted alone and chose the spot in a narrow hallway connecting subway stations beneath Times Square for its Christmas-themed posters.His device, however, affixed to his torso with plastic zip ties, failed to fully detonate, the police said, and Mr. Ullah himself was the only one seriously injured in a blast that sent smoke billowing through the underground passageways of Midtown and snarled a Monday morning commute. Port Authority police officers, who were the first to reach Mr. Ullah, found him lying on the ground, injured, the fragments of his partially-detonated device around him and wires connected to the battery in his pants pocket running beneath his jacket.\u201cIt didn\u2019t function with the force and power that the recipe intended,\u201d John J. Miller, the New York Police Department\u2019s commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said about the bomb in an interview on Tuesday on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201dMr. Miller said the events could have \u201cbeen far, far worse.\u201dMr. Ullah used metal screws inside the pipe because, as he told investigators, he believed they would cause \u201cmaximum damage,\u201d the complaint said.After his arrest, the complaint said, investigators who searched his residence in Brooklyn recovered, among other things: metal pipes; pieces of wire and fragments of what appeared to be Christmas lights; metal screws similar to those found strewn at the bombing scene; and a passport in Mr. Ullah\u2019s name with handwritten notes including, \u201cO America, die in your rage.\u201dThe charges against Mr. Ullah were announced at a news conference on Tuesday by Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan; William F. Sweeney Jr., the head of the F.B.I.\u2019s New York office, and Benjamin B. Tucker, the first deputy police commissioner.\u201cIn the middle of rush hour,\u201d Mr. Kim said, \u201cas everyday New Yorkers hurried to their jobs, to their schools, ready to start the workweek and get going with their busy lives, one man came to kill, to maim and to destroy.\u201dMr. Kim said that he expected that Mr. Ullah, while he was in the hospital, would be given a \u201cbedside presentment\u201d \u2014 that is, make an initial appearance before a magistrate judge, possibly via videoconference.Some of the charges against Mr. Ullah, if he were to be convicted, carry maximum sentences of life in prison.Meanwhile, a fuller portrait of Mr. Ullah and his motives was emerging as investigators fanned out across New York to track down every lead. Albert Fox Cahn, the legal director of the state\u2019s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, however, said some of law enforcement\u2019s tactics had been too aggressive.Standing outside the apartment building on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, where Mr. Ullah lived, Mr. Cahn said law enforcement officials had held children as young as 4 out in the cold and pulled a teenager out of classes at his high school to interrogate him without a lawyer or his parents present.\u201cThese are not the sorts of actions we expect from our justice system,\u201d Mr. Cahn said on Monday. \u201cAnd we have every confidence that our justice system will find the truth behind this attack and that we will, in the end, be able to learn what occurred today.\u201dThe F.B.I.\u2019s Mr. Sweeney, without addressing Mr. Cahn\u2019s criticism directly, said at the news conference that there were instances after such attacks where the intelligence \u201cmay dictate that we locate, detain and interview individuals\u201d to ensure the safety of the public and law enforcement personnel.\u201cOur teams use appropriate, reasonable and lawful methods to accomplish these goals,\u201d he added, \u201cbut to be clear, our teams will move with speed and move with purpose.\u201dEarly on Tuesday, James Waters, the chief of counterterrorism for the Police Department, said in an interview on NY1 that public safety concerns forced investigators to focus intently on Mr. Ullah\u2019s relatives and associates in the moments after the violence.\u201cWe needed to make sure that this was the only individual involved,\u201d he said. \u201cThat this was not going to be an attack with multiple players involved.\u201dTo that end, investigators also fanned out overseas, with Bangladeshi police officers visiting Mr. Ullah\u2019s ancestral village at Musapur Union in eastern Bangladesh on Tuesday afternoon, speaking with several of his relatives.\u201cThey stayed here for an hour and wanted to know more about Akayed Ullah,\u201d said a cousin named Emdad. \u201cWe shared what we know. But police did not find any criminal record against him.\u201dCounterterrorism investigators also brought Mr. Ullah\u2019s wife in for questioning on Tuesday and questioned her parents, with whom she was living in Dhaka, where Mr. Ullah was born.Nate Schweber contributed reporting from New York; AK Mohammed Moinuddin from Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Jeffrey Gettleman from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

He has lived in Myanmar all of his 72 years, and the history of the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group in Myanmar stretches back for generations before.\u201cThe Rohingya are finished in our country,\u201d said Mr. Kyaw Min, who lives in Yangon, the commercial capital of Myanmar. \u201cSoon we will all be dead or gone.\u201dThe United Nations report also said that the crackdown in Rakhine had \u201ctargeted teachers, the cultural and religious leadership, and other people of influence in the Rohingya community in an effort to diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge.\u201d\u201cWe are people with our own history and traditions,\u201d said U Kyaw Hla Aung, a Rohingya lawyer and former political prisoner, whose father served as a court clerk in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.\u201cHow can they pretend we are nothing?\u201d he asked.Speaking over the phone, Mr. Kyaw Hla Aung, who has been jailed repeatedly for his activism and is now interned in a Sittwe camp, said his family did not have enough food because officials have prevented full distribution of international aid.Myanmar\u2019s sudden amnesia about the Rohingya is as bold as it is systematic. Five years ago, Sittwe, nestled in an estuary in the Bay of Bengal, was a mixed city, divided between an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist majority and the Rohingya Muslim minority.Walking Sittwe\u2019s crowded bazaar in 2009, I saw Rohingya fishermen selling seafood to Rakhine women. Rohingya professionals practiced law and medicine. The main street in town was dominated by the Jama mosque, an Arabesque confection built in the mid-19th century. The imam spoke proudly of Sittwe\u2019s multicultural heritage.But since sectarian riots in 2012, which resulted in a disproportionate number of Rohingya casualties, the city has been mostly cleared of Muslims. Across central Rakhine, about 120,000 Rohingya, even those who had citizenship, have been interned in camps, stripped of their livelihoods and prevented from accessing proper schools or health care.They cannot leave the ghettos without official authorization. In July, a Rohingya man who was allowed out for a court appearance in Sittwe was lynched by an ethnic Rakhine mob.The Jama mosque now stands disused and moldering, behind barbed wire. Its 89-year-old imam is interned.\u201cWe have no rights as human beings,\u201d he said, asking not to use his name because of safety concerns. \u201cThis is state-run ethnic cleansing and nothing else.\u201dSittwe\u2019s psyche has adapted to the new circumstances. In the bazaar recently, every Rakhine resident I talked to claimed, falsely, that no Muslims had ever owned shops there.Sittwe University, which used to enroll hundreds of Muslim students, now only teaches around 30 Rohingya, all of whom are in a distance-learning program.\u201cWe don\u2019t have restrictions on any religion,\u201d said U Shwe Khaing Kyaw, the university\u2019s registrar, \u201cbut they just don\u2019t come.\u201dMr. Kyaw Min used to teach in Sittwe, where most of his students were Rakhine Buddhists. Now, he said, even Buddhist acquaintances in Yangon are embarrassed to talk with him.\u201cThey want the conversation to end quickly because they don\u2019t want to think about who I am or where I came from,\u201d he said.In 1990, Mr. Kyaw Min won a seat in Parliament as part of a Rohingya party aligned with the National League for Democracy, Myanmar\u2019s current governing party. But the country\u2019s military junta ignored the electoral results nationwide. Mr. Kyaw Min ended up in prison.Rohingya Muslims have lived in Rakhine for generations, their Bengali dialect and South Asian features often distinguishing them from Rakhine Buddhists.During the colonial era, the British encouraged South Asian rice farmers, merchants and civil servants to migrate to what was then known as Burma.Some of these new arrivals mixed with the Rohingya, then known more commonly as Arakanese Indians or Arakanese Muslims. Others spread out across Burma. By the 1930s, South Asians, both Muslim and Hindu, comprised the largest population in Yangon.The demographic shift left some Buddhists feeling besieged. During the xenophobic leadership of Gen. Ne Win, who ushered in nearly half a century of military rule, hundreds of thousands of South Asians fled Burma for India.Rakhine, on Burma\u2019s western fringe, was where Islam and Buddhism collided most violently, especially after World War II, during which the Rakhine supported the Axis and Rohingya the Allies.Later attempts by a Rohingya insurgent group to exit Burma and attach northern Rakhine to East Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then known, further strained relations.By the 1980s, the military junta had stripped most Rohingya of citizenship. Brutal security offensives drove waves of Rohingya to flee the country.Today, far more Rohingya live outside of Myanmar \u2014 mostly in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia \u2014 than remain in what they consider their homeland.Yet in the early decades of Burma\u2019s independence, a Rohingya elite thrived. Rangoon University, the country\u2019s top institution, had enough Rohingya students to form their own union. One of the cabinets of U Nu, the country\u2019s first post-independence leader, included a health minister who identified himself as Arakanese Muslim.Even under Ne Win, the general, Burmese national radio aired broadcasts in the Rohingya language. Rohingya, women among them, were represented in Parliament.U Shwe Maung, a Rohingya from Buthidaung Township in northern Rakhine, served in Parliament between 2011 and 2015, as a member of the military\u2019s proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party. In the 2015 elections, however, he was barred from running.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya were disenfranchised in those polls.Mr. Shwe Maung\u2019s electoral district, which had been 90 percent Rohingya, is now represented by a Rakhine Buddhist.In September, a local police officer filed a counterterrorism suit accusing Mr. Shwe Maung of instigating violence through Facebook posts that called for an end to the security offensive in Rakhine. (The military operation began after Rohingya militants besieged government security posts in late August.)Mr. Shwe Maung, the son of a police officer himself, is in exile in the United States and denies the charges.\u201cThey want every Rohingya to be considered a terrorist or an illegal immigrant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are much more than that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christine Keeler, Central Figure in British \u2018Scandal of the Century,\u2019 Is Dead at 75", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChristine Keeler, who in the early 1960s was at the center of a sensational political scandal in Britain, known as the Profumo affair, that played a role in the downfall of a Conservative government, died on Monday in Farnborough, England. She was 75.Her son Seymour Platt announced her death on his Facebook page, saying she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\u201cMy mother, Christine Keeler, fought many fights in her eventful life,\u201d Mr. Platt wrote, \u201csome fights she lost but some she won. She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price.\u201dA startling series of events eventually brought Mr. Profumo\u2019s involvement with her to light, but not before he had tried to save his career.In March 1963, he went before the House of Commons to try to quell rumors about a sexual relationship. \u201cThere was no impropriety in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler,\u201d he said.But details kept coming out \u2014 British newspapers called it the \u201cScandal of the Century\u201d \u2014 and he resigned in June 1963.\u201cI said that there had been no impropriety,\u201d Mr. Profumo said in his letter of resignation. \u201cTo my very deep regret I have to admit that this was not true.\u201dMs. Keeler had had multiple lovers, among them Cmdr. Eugene Ivanov, an attach\u00e9 in the Soviet Embassy in London, and when that relationship came to light, government figures and MI5, the domestic intelligence agency, feared that her affair with Mr. Profumo might have created a grave security breach.When Mr. Macmillan resigned later in 1963, the Profumo affair was often cited as a contributing factor.Ms. Keeler, though, had a lot to say about the scandal over the years, including in \u201cSecrets and Lies,\u201d a memoir written with Douglas Thompson and published in 2012.\u201cI enjoyed sex and I indulged in it when I fancied the men,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I was no hypocrite. It was others who were disguising their peccadilloes in dinner jackets, diamonds and evening dresses, indulging in weird fantasies.\u201dChristine Keeler was born on Feb. 22, 1942, outside London in Uxbridge. She left home at 16 and was dancing in a topless club in London when she met Stephen Ward, an osteopath who moved in fashionable circles.Newspapers said Mr. Ward ran a \u201cvice ring.\u201d He committed suicide in August 1963.He introduced Ms. Keeler to Mr. Profumo in July 1961, at Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire. She had been swimming nude, \u201cwith Profumo watching approvingly,\u201d Ms. Keeler\u2019s book said.\u201cHe knew the technique, what to say and when to brush his hand on your arm or accidentally touch your breast,\u201d she wrote, calling him \u201ca man with a wandering eye \u2014 and hands to match.\u201dTheir dalliance did not come to light until months later, after another lover of Ms. Keeler\u2019s, Johnny Edgecombe, apparently in a jealous fit, fired a gun outside Mr. Ward\u2019s home, where she was staying. That incident led to court proceedings that brought out many of the details of the Profumo affair.As part of the fallout from the events, Ms. Keeler served six months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from false statements she had made about another lover, Aloysius Gordon.Though Ms. Keeler made some money by selling her story to the British newspapers, the film career never came about. But the Profumo affair made it to the big screen in 1989 in the movie \u201cScandal,\u201d with Joanne Whalley playing Ms. Keeler and Ian McKellen as John Profumo.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that film was just a snapshot of what really went on,\u201d Ms. Keeler wrote. \u201cThe surface has barely been rippled.\u201d\u201cScandal\u201d was hardly the first adaptation of the scandal. \u201cThe Christine Keeler Story\u201d came out in late 1963, just months after the matter had made headlines. The BBC plans to begin shooting a six-part series, \u201cThe Trial of Christine Keeler,\u201d next year.Ms. Keeler was briefly married to James Levermore in the 1960s and to Anthony Platt in the 1970s. In addition to her son Seymour, her survivors include a granddaughter.Ms. Keeler was sometimes described as a prostitute, a description she did not accept.\u201cIt\u2019s true that I have had sex for money,\u201d she wrote in her book, \u201cbut only out of desperation, and that is still something that I hate to have to admit even to myself. Ironically, it has been sex for love or lust rather than for money that has always caused me more problems.\u201dAnother woman who achieved some notoriety from the scandal was Mandy Rice-Davies, who shared lodgings with Ms. Keeler. In 2013, when Andrew Lloyd Webber mounted a short-lived musical about Mr. Ward, she recalled the promiscuity of the time.\u201cIn those days, there were good girls and there were bad girls,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cGood girls didn\u2019t have any sex at all, and bad girls had a bit.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of the actor who played John Profumo in \u201cScandal,\u201d the 1989 movie about the Profumo affair, in which Joanne Whalley played Ms. Keeler. He is Ian McKellen, not McKellan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merry Christmas. Now Who Swiped My Tree?", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "From New England to Texas, real-life Grinches keep stealing holiday greenery. But tree owners are fighting back with video cameras \u2014 and the thief-repelling odor of skunks.Supported byFor America\u2019s Christmas trees, it seems no place is safe. Spruces, firs and even artificial evergreens have vanished in recent weeks, leaving behind a trail of conifer crime scenes.Purveyors of holiday greenery are not taking the thefts quietly.In Minnesota, Mr. Ritzer estimated that one or two campus evergreens are stolen each year, including a hearty spruce hacked down last month before the skunk-scent-spraying efforts began.\u201cThey had a pretty sharp saw,\u201d Mr. Ritzer said.In Virginia Beach, where Bill Schratwieser and his wife run a gift shop and tree stand, around 20 Fraser firs went missing this month, a major financial blow to the small business. Because of the limited supplies, Mr. Schratwieser had already stocked fewer trees than he had wished.\u201cWe never raised our prices,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of places that have jacked up prices because of the shortage.\u201dMr. Schratwieser said the thefts felt like \u201cgetting punched in the stomach,\u201d though he said he was heartened by an outpouring of support when his loss made the rounds on local news stations. One stranger insisted on giving him $40. Another tree merchant gave him some to sell.Still, the thievery grated at him. \u201cWho steals a Christmas tree?\u201d he asked.Lots of people, it seems, including a thief who grabbed a small tree with homemade ornaments from the front counter of a Whataburger restaurant in Texas. The theft led to a manhunt that included an elaborate Facebook post from the local police, who created a whodunit video set to Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d theme song and noted that restaurant employees had pooled their money to buy the tree.Elsewhere, trees keep disappearing. In Mobile, Ala., employees of Big City Toys arrived at work this month to find that the artificial evergreens outside their store had vanished. Rather than mope, they decided to buy more Christmas trees and give them away for free.\u201cSome people need these trees to have a little bit of happiness in their life,\u201d said Kristi Houseknecht, a store manager.All the free trees went to new homes within two days. One was delivered to a man in hospice care. Another went to a recently released convict who could not afford a tree for her children.In the end, the missing trees that had inspired the giveaway turned out not to be stolen at all. Someone at the toy store had moved them to an indoor storage room during a rainstorm.There was no such happy ending in Minnesota, where the skunk-spray initiative came too late to spare the spruce that vanished from the university\u2019s campus. The stolen tree \u2014 now just a sad stump in the snow \u2014 had been in a line of evergreens planted about a decade ago.Mr. Ritzer, the campus landscaping manager, said he expected the university to spend around $2,500 to dig out the stump and plant a new tree. Otherwise, he said, \u201cit will look like a missing tooth in a smile.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Founded in 1962, the nonprofit helped bring yoga, organic food and meditation into the American mainstream.The leaders behind humanist psychology worked from the lodge, and legend has it that Hunter S. Thompson wandered the place with a shotgun. Nudity was the norm.\u201cThere\u2019s a dawning consciousness emerging in Silicon Valley as people recognize that their conventional success isn\u2019t necessarily making the world a better place,\u201d said Mr. Tauber, 34, a former Google product manager and start-up executive coach. \u201cThe C.E.O.s, inside they\u2019re hurting. They can\u2019t sleep at night.\u201dStill, there is most likely enough crisis to go around. Mr. Tauber has stacked Esalen\u2019s calendar with sessions by Silicon Valley leaders, which are selling out.Dave Morin, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, will lead a program on depression and tech; a former Google ethicist, Tristan Harris, led a weekend on internet addiction; and tech futurists will host a conference on virtual reality and spirituality. Chargers have been installed for Tesla electric cars, and there is usually a line to use them. The new sessions in 2018 are aimed at the workers building virtual reality, artificial intelligence and social networks.\u201cThey wonder if they\u2019re doing the right thing for humanity,\u201d Mr. Tauber said. \u201cThese are questions we can only answer behind closed doors.\u201dAbout a three-hour drive south from San Francisco along Highway 1, past hundreds of tourists pulled off on the side of the road, Esalen comes in around a turn.The bar serves kombucha, coconut water, wine and beer. Sitting and having a cold kombucha one recent evening was Bodhi Kalayjian, 47, who lives in Big Sur, wears flip flops and has shaggy gray-blond hair.\u201cIt\u2019s about putting Silicon Valley back in their bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a soul. It\u2019s about finding it.\u201dMr. Kalayjian was an early Google employee and Google chef, but \u201conce the I.P.O. happened it was less fun,\u201d he said. Now he\u2019s an Esalen baker and masseur.\u201cThe old-timey hippies are moving into the history books, but why would you ever want to keep things static?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do your work, things are always in a state of change.\u201dGopi Kallayil, the chief evangelist of brand marketing at Google, was running late from work to the class he would host at Esalen called \u201cConnect to Your Inner-Net.\u201dHis assistants were scrambling to set up. \u201cIt has to be so if two engineers are sitting on opposite sides they wouldn\u2019t feel there is too much space between them,\u201d said Jnanada Schalk, who was formerly named Jennie and is assisting Mr. Kallayil as a volunteer.Mr. Kallayil arrived wearing a pink button-down and a large Android smartwatch. He had met Mr. Tauber when they worked for Google Plus, the search engine\u2019s social networking feature.Mr. Kallayil had the participants go in a circle and introduce themselves. There was a health tech investor, a product manager, several software engineers and developers, an entrepreneur who had just sold his food start-up, a nurse, an affordable-housing advocate and two lawyers. Mr. Kallayil spoke in the language of Silicon Valley.\u201cWhat is it that moves the technology to where your inner net moves forward?\u201d he asked. \u201cThankfully, other people have developed the operating manual.\u201dHe said that many of the people who came to him had floundered this year, and that he, too, found himself wondering about the impact of his work.\u201cWhat are these technologies doing?\u201d said Mr. Kallayil, who also teaches at 1440. \u201cDecisions we make affect more than one billion people. Here, you shed your clothes and your inhibition, and there\u2019s a rawness.\u201dThe Inner-Net schedule is loosely packed. The next morning, there would be mindful walking, mindful eating, reimagining work and life integration, then compassion practice, self-compassion and, finally, yoga. After dinner, there would be work on envisioning lives as they are and as we want them to be. Then Mr. Kallayil would lead some chanting.\u201cOne of the portals we use to put the technology for the body at peak performance is music,\u201d he said. \u201cSierra will play the flute, Jennie the violin.\u201dEvery morning is dance awake, a chakra meditation and guitar class where Esalen guests dance across the large hardwood floor.Down in the kitchen, Mr. Kallayil\u2019s assistant collected a large bag of raisins for eating during meditation.\u201cI just sold my start-up and needed a place to reflect,\u201d said Sam McBride, 31, from Chicago. \u201cTo give me some perspective.\u201dEsalen\u2019s hot springs are good all day but are famous for the night scene, when they open to the public between 1 and 3 a.m. A weekend stay for a couple at Esalen can cost $2,890, so budget travelers stay nearby and come wandering in with towels a little after midnight.The dirt path to the baths leads to a concrete corridor and a changing room. Around a corner, it was pitch black with an overpowering smell of sulfur. As the eyes adjusted to starlight, big steaming concrete hot tubs, claw-foot personal tubs and a couple of dozen quiet naked bodies could be seen. The space cannot be photographed.\u201cI was tired of my life,\u201d said Marina Kurikhina, 32, who lives on a ranch nearby. \u201cI represented Latin American art at a gallery in London. Now I teach creative subconscious painting.\u201dShe said people visited Esalen \u201cfor transformation.\u201d Soon, she plans to open a health bar on site serving raw desserts, cold-pressed juices and high-end coffee.With the focus on the emotional life of executives, Esalen plans to close Gazebo, its preschool of 40 years.\u201cIt was the soul of the institution of Esalen \u2014 all those little babies and what they\u2019re going to be,\u201d said Zoe Garcia, a guest and nearby resident, who has been going to Esalen for 30 years.The closing is partly a sign of the region\u2019s changing demographics. As more of Big Sur\u2019s homes are bought by tech executives as second homes, there are not as many young children, so the class of 30 had dwindled to 15 before the floods shut it down.\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly sad,\u201d said Cortlan Robertson, whose daughter attended Gazebo and who said the Big Sur community had offered to pay for the preschool to continue. \u201cBen is always saying it\u2019s just child care. But it was so much more.\u201dClosing Gazebo was also a sign of a shifting culture and new rules.\u201cBack then, we could go topless in the lodge,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cMore conservative people started to come, so they started to make rules. Now next is mindfulness and technology. Who knows?\u201d\u201cI realized I was addicting people to their phones,\u201d Mr. Tauber said. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis that everyone\u2019s in the culture of killing it, and inside they\u2019re dying.\u201dIn the hot spring one night, he ran into an Esalen leader who invited him to a conscious business event. Mr. Tauber quit Google to open a business coaching start-up founders and developed Esalen\u2019s technology strategy, joining the board in 2015. During the springtime flooding, as Esalen cut its staff to 50 from 330, Mr. Tauber took over.His plan is to aim programming at top executives. \u201cHow do we scale our impact as an organization?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe do it through impacting the influencers.\u201dHis house is a wood-and-stone half circle built into the hillside, looking out through the cypress onto the water. He wanted a better view so had the cypress pruned. He has a ukulele, a prayer bowl and various massage tools by the sofa. By the dying embers of a fire that he makes every morning, he was reading a history of Esalen and a Summer of Love coffee table book.Upstairs, the Inner-Net class was doing a compassion exercise. Everyone spent 10 minutes looking into a stranger\u2019s eyes and silently repeating phrases like \u201cthis person has emotions just like me,\u201d \u201cthis person has experienced pain and suffering just like me,\u201d \u201cthis person will die just like me.\u201d They were barefoot. Some were wrapped in coarse blankets.The art teacher downstairs had made a trough of warm, foaming mushroom drink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New African Tradition for Hanukkah", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Meskerem Gebreyohannes, all of the Jewish holidays bring doro wat, a luxurious chicken dish she makes with slowly cooked onions and a red chile sauce layered with flavors from the African spice trail.Despite growing up in a Jewish family in Harar, a city in Ethiopia a few hours by car from Somalia, she never celebrated \u201cmodern\u201d holidays like Hanukkah.Separated from Israel and the Diaspora for more than 2,000 years, Ethiopian Jews followed the Old Testament, which does not include the Hanukkah story, as a source for holiday customs. Mrs. Gebreyohannes fled Ethiopia in 1981 as a refugee to Djibouti, then went to Canada in 1982, where she started observing the custom of lighting a menorah for eight days. She settled in Michigan in 2004.\u201cIn Ethiopia, we were always surrounded by cooking,\u201d she said earlier this fall, while pulverizing the onions and garlic for her doro wat.Ms. Gebreyohannes uses oil rather than the more traditional ghee used in the dish. Bright red berbere \u2014 she uses a chile spice mix from Ethiopia that includes cardamom, ginger, fenugreek and thyme \u2014 lends more than color to the sauce.\u201cWhen you smell a good berbere, you can taste the spices are there, and you don\u2019t need to add anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cThe spices act like cornstarch or flour to give the sauce substance.\u201dMrs. Gebreyohannes learned in Ethiopia to use every part of the chicken: the bones for soups and the skin to enrich the sauces. She nostalgically refers to the birds from her home as \u201csacred.\u201d\u201cWe say that when a woman knows how to pull apart the 12 parts of a whole chicken, she has become a full woman and is ready to marry,\u201d she said. (For the record, that\u2019s a pair each of drumsticks, thighs, breasts and wings, and the chest, neck, ribs and giblets.) \u201cAs a child, I learned to prepare meals and dishes for many people. The idea of making a meal for less than 10 people is American.\u201dHer doro wat recipe may not last for all eight nights of Hanukkah. But it will add warmth, and a new holiday tradition, for one.An earlier version of this article misstated the date when the oral Torah was written.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Do Dogs Need Winter Coats?", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this shining, shivering Thursday.When wintry weather comes to New York City, you can be sure of a few things: Taxis will be hard to hail, subway steps will be slippery, and dogs will be bundled up.Pit bulls in cashmere cable-knits. Greyhounds in flannel onesies. Terriers in down jackets that look more like flotation devices.But we\u2019ve always wondered \u2014 do pets really need clothes in the cold?\u201cA dog\u2019s circulatory system is actually quite good in regards to dealing with the cold,\u201d Dr. Goldstein told us, noting that the average dog is much better equipped to deal with winter chill than summer heat.But not all dogs are created equal when it comes to staying warm.Miniature dogs (like chihuahuas), poodles and poodle mixes have the hardest time because they have hair, which is \u201cnot anywhere near as protective or thick as fur,\u201d Dr. Goldstein said. Wolfish northern breeds with long fur, like huskies and malamutes, do best. Labradors and golden retriever types are somewhere in the middle.\u201cWhen we get goose bumps, it doesn\u2019t do much because we\u2019re not as hairy as we once were,\u201d Dr. Goldstein said. \u201cBut when a dog gets goose bumps, it makes their hair stand up, increasing the barrier they have between the outside and the skin, and that coat is good at minimizing the loss of heat.\u201d\u201cIt would be hard to imagine a larger dog that would need a jacket,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it more for the owner and the cuteness than for the dog.\u201dIf you do decide to get your pup a winter get-up, the key body parts to keep warm would be the face, mouth and nose, because that\u2019s where their heat evaporates, according to Dr. Goldstein. But because covering a dog\u2019s whole head is not exactly realistic, do your best to cloak their belly or abdomen.And as for the paws? Dogs don\u2019t lose much heat through their feet, Dr. Goldstein said, but he recommends shoes or \u201cold-fashioned plastic bags\u201d when city sidewalks are covered in salt, which \u201ccan be quite toxic and cause a lot of damage to the foot pads.\u201dCats, he noted, should not be outside during the winter at all.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Bundle up. (We\u2019re talking to you, not your pet.)And tomorrow, a chance of snow.The observance, meant to remind us of the role aviation plays in our social and economic well-being, got us thinking about the role New York has played in aviation history.It took six minutes for word of Mr. Lindbergh\u2019s landing to travel from Paris back to New York, and when it did, an announcement of his arrival was posted on a bulletin on The Times\u2019s building.

{"Headline": "Stop the Manipulation of Democracy Online", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Surreptitious techniques pioneered in Moscow and Beijing to use the internet to drown out dissent and undermine free elections broke into view during the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States. But Russian efforts to influence the American election are part of a larger, profound challenge to democracy worldwide.Online manipulation tactics played an important role in at least 17 other elections over the past year. From the Philippines and Ecuador to Turkey and Kenya, governing parties used paid commentators, trolls, bots, false news sites and propaganda outlets to inflate their popular support and essentially endorse themselves.In the Philippines, members of a \u201ckeyboard army\u201d said they could earn $10 a day operating social media accounts that supported Rodrigo Duterte or attacked his detractors in the run-up to his May 2016 election as president. Many of those social media fabricators have remained active under his administration, amplifying the impression of widespread support for his brutal crackdown on the drug trade.During the 2017 election season in Kenya, political camps set up teams of paid bloggers, social media influencers and bots to shape public opinion online. Overt disinformation, propaganda and hate speech targeted individuals and organizations affiliated with the opposite political camp via Twitter hashtags, Google Ads and Facebook sponsored posts.In the lead-up to presidential elections in Ecuador, social media accounts belonging to politicians, journalists and opposition activists were hijacked and used to disseminate messages against the opposition\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.Efforts by government authorities to shape and control online discussions go well beyond elections and have grown each year since Freedom House began tracking the problem in 2009. When it examined internet freedom in 65 countries in 2016 and 2017 (representing 87 percent of global internet users), its Freedom on the Net project found governments in nearly half of the nations deploying some form of manipulation to distort online information to stay in power and undermine the opposition.The practice has become significantly more widespread and technically sophisticated. Bots, propaganda producers and fake news outlets exploit social media and search algorithms to integrate seamlessly with trusted content, posing a devastating new threat to democracy. The dangers undermine elections, political debate and virtually every other aspect of governing.In Turkey, 6,000 people have been enlisted by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party to manipulate discussions and counter opponents on social media. The government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico relies on an estimated 75,000 automated accounts \u2014 Pe\u00f1abots \u2014 to overwhelm political critics on Twitter. In Iran, the government has long created internet sites that mimic those of legitimate news organizations like the BBC; these fakes are filled with conspiracy theories and anti-Western propaganda.Unlike direct censorship, like shutting down mobile service, online content manipulation is difficult to detect and is far more difficult to combat, given the sheer number of people and bots deployed. The fabrication of grass-roots support for government policies creates a closed loop in which the authorities essentially use social media to endorse themselves, making the views of citizens irrelevant.Restoring trust in social media and the internet requires defensive actions against the manipulation armies. A first step is for the United States and other democracies to ensure that political advertising is at least as transparent online as it is offline, an issue now being debated in Congress. Online political ads should be required to indicate who sponsored them; social media companies should have to make this information available and indicate the source of the payment for such ads.As we have seen in recent weeks, big tech companies also face pressure from Congress and European governments to more aggressively weed out hate speech and to take other steps to remove online sludge. There is indeed room for smarter curation of news feeds and search algorithms \u2014 with more human oversight.But these approaches, unless handled skillfully, also risk narrowing political debate and undermining internet freedom, as witnessed in Germany, where popular social media companies are now required to take down offending information quickly or risk fines of up to 50 million euros.The problem is likely to get more complicated. More and more data is being collected about Americans\u2019 political views, personal habits and sensitive financial and health information, while that data is becoming harder to keep secure from hackers and hostile governments.Those forces are part of the weaponization of the internet used so skillfully by Russian operatives and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Online manipulation also becomes easier if perpetrators are able to identify a subgroup of people most susceptible to their message and most likely to share it with others in their network, a task made easier by the data-collection practices of popular social media companies.There is no panacea; constant vigilance and education are required to attack this problem. Young people and other web users must be taught to take seriously the demands of cybersecurity. High schools should be including media literacy as part of history and social science curriculums.Most of all, students and others must be put on alert that there really is fake news \u2014 false information deliberately planted by malevolent actors \u2014 and that they need to be on guard against propaganda masquerading as truth.The future of democracy may well rest on our ability to tell the difference.Michael J. Abramowitz is the president of Freedom House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Maine Shrimp Season, Without the Shrimp", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Libby loves the small, delicate Northern shrimp, known fondly here as Maine shrimp, and so do customers at his processing and distribution plant. He bought $700 worth of the books to sell.\u201cI have sold two,\u201d Mr. Libby said.He is unlikely to sell many more. Not long after the cookbook was published in 2009, its central ingredient began vanishing from Maine\u2019s waters. In 2014, regulators closed the shrimp fishery (the term that encompasses both the fishing grounds and those who work there). The hope was that the struggling species would replenish itself if left undisturbed.Last month, regulators voted to keep the fishery closed again through 2018, the fifth consecutive year without a shrimp harvest. That means no shrimping for the Libbys or the hundreds of other Maine fishermen who have long relied on it as a sweet paycheck (and meal) in the dark of winter.What makes this an unusual closing is that fishermen are not being blamed for the immediate problem. Cod was overfished. Sea urchins were overfished, as Maine shrimp were in the late 1960s and \u201870s, But the most widely accepted theory for the rapid decline of this species, which extends no farther south than the Gulf of Maine, is the same force being blamed for disruption of fisheries around the globe: climate change.While summer swimmers may still gasp with shock on entering Maine\u2019s chilly waters, the Gulf of Maine is warming, and becoming increasingly inhospitable to the shrimp. Average winter sea-surface temperatures have increased 4.5 degrees in Boothbay Harbor since 1906.Plenty of shrimpers believe in climate change. Some don\u2019t. All feel stymied.Patrick Keliher, Maine\u2019s commissioner of marine resources, said he had never seen quite as many shrimpers turn out for a meeting as they did on Nov. 29, when a regulatory panel he sits on decided to keep the fishery closed. He raised their hopes, briefly, by arguing unsuccessfully for a \u201cboutique\u201d fishery that would have allowed shrimpers a small but not insignificant catch.After all, many fishermen reason, if shrimp are going to continue to disappear because of an environmental force unlikely to be stopped, why not just reap what\u2019s left? Especially now that unmet demand has sent prices soaring.Some shrimpers favor backing off on the shrimp to see if they can bounce back. And almost all question the scientific data. Surveys are often run with the help of fishermen, but instead of going where the shrimp typically cluster, the surveys by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration go to mostly random, computer-selected spots to trawl.But there is one thing most everyone here agrees on: It would be terrible to see the end of Maine shrimp, a touchstone of local tradition, identity and cuisine.\u201cMaine shrimp is the only shrimp I\u2019ve ever eaten that has a taste to it,\u201d said Arnie Gammage, a longtime shrimp trapper in South Bristol.Last winter at auction, Mr. Cantrell bought 3,100 pounds of Maine shrimp, brought in by 13 lucky Mainers chosen to conduct a research catch designed to give the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration more data. (They were allowed to catch only a tiny amount, but prices were so high, it paid to be in the game.)For this coming, shrimpless season, he could buy Northern shrimp imported from Canada. Some Maine restaurants are already substituting it in shrimp dishes, particularly the fried ones. The Canadian shrimp fishery has also experienced declines, but still brings in far more than Maine ever did.It\u2019s the same species, but somehow not the same. \u201cIt is usually super small compared to our shrimp,\u201d Mr. Cantrell said.But some of Cantrell\u2019s better customers are nostalgic shrimpers, for whom only Maine shrimp will do. Troy Bichrest, a fisherman in Cundy\u2019s Harbor, paid $90 for 10 pounds of shrimp at Cantrell Seafood in February, nine times more than he used to be paid at the dock for his catch. He returned to Cantrell Seafood the next day, repeating this process four more times, until his family, including his elderly mother, had their fill.Maine\u2019s relationship with its shrimp is more complex than just love of a flavor.Mr. Hayward buys the shrimp at every chance, for use in his home and his restaurants. When this year\u2019s research catch was available, he put a nearly raw version, \u201cshocked\u201d with local vinegar, on Fore Street\u2019s menu. That was in February, when the vast majority of his customers tend to be locals.\u201cPeople from away don\u2019t necessarily get Pandalus borealis,\u201d Mr. Hayward said.\u201cI felt like it went on for days and everything smelled like shrimp, and you didn\u2019t even want to eat them when you were done with it,\u201d Ms. French said.Glen Libby used to rush his catch from boat to pot to cook it live, like lobster. The simpler the better.\u201cA load of salt in the kettle,\u201d said Craig Durant, who fishes in Cundy\u2019s Harbor. \u201cYou go find a cold Pepsi, and then you pick until your fingers bleed.\u201dShrimp season usually runs from December to April, when the seas are brutally cold and high, and a shrimper might have to break ice to get to the boat. In those months, shrimp, unlike lobster, can be caught fairly close to shore. And unlike the more restrictive scalloping or lobstering fisheries, shrimping is open to anyone willing to pay for a permit.As a so-called shoulder fishery, shrimping \u2014 whether trawling with a net or setting traps \u2014 served multiple functions, including providing another income source for shrimpers who might spend the rest of the year chasing lobster, scallops, haddock and cod.The catch also filled their pots and pans. The commercial shrimp fishery in New England sputtered into existence in fits and starts from 1927 to 1938, but fishermen had long been eating the shrimp they had caught in their nets while seeking other fish.There wasn\u2019t a market for Gulf of Maine shrimp. As an aquatic biologist for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the environmentalist Rachel Carson noted even in 1943, when there were roughly 25 boats shrimping, that competition from South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico shrimp was hindering development of the Northern resource.But efforts were also underway to raise the profile of Maine shrimp. A cannery in Rockport began processing shrimp in 1942. And around that time, Everett F. Greaton, the executive secretary of Maine\u2019s Development Commission and a booster of all things Maine, presided with the governor over a dinner that included \u201cMaine apples stuffed with gulf of Maine shrimp.\u201d Mr. Lindgren believes that was the first time Maine shrimp was granted such a place of honor.The shrimping fleet grew steadily, except for a few years beginning in 1953 when the species disappeared; scientists pointed to a pulse of warm water in the Gulf of Maine. In 1969, the year of the biggest catch on record, 11,000 metric tons, there were 223 Maine vessels shrimping, and 42 from Massachusetts. The price at the dock was 13 cents a pound. (The average price in the last decade the fishery was open was 67 cents a pound.)Prices like those indicate limited demand, but they also helped establish that proprietary feeling so many Mainers speak of. Maine shrimp belonged to the locals, and sold best in seaside shacks, deep-fried and piled up on a paper tray \u2014 with ketchup, tartar sauce or cocktail sauce on the side \u2014 or in a roll or a stew.As recently as 10 years ago, shrimp was the stuff you could buy by the side of the road, from peddlers who parked their trucks along coastal roads. Gary Libby describes locals coming to the dock with empty buckets and filling them for $10 or less.\u201cOne guy used to come down and he\u2019d give us a loaf of homemade bread, and we\u2019d give him a bucket of shrimp,\u201d Mr. Libby said.\u201cWho would have known?\u201d Ms. French said. \u201cIt happened so fast.\u201dShe approves of the continued closing of the fishery. \u201cUntil we really know,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when it is gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Removes Chechen Strongman\u2019s Accounts, Raising Policy Questions", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe strongman leader of the Chechen Republic has long been a prolific social media user, filling his accounts with photos of him cuddling his cat, lifting weights or soliciting poems about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.So when Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts, which had four million followers between them, were unexpectedly taken down on Dec. 23, people took notice.A Facebook spokeswoman said that Mr. Kadyrov\u2019s accounts were deactivated because he had just been added to a United States sanctions list and that the company was legally obligated to act.Facebook has been pilloried for allowing the spread of fake news on its platform and its limited response. In this case, it says it\u2019s legally obligated to act because of financial sanctions, a standard that has not been evenly applied and which experts say may not be defensible.\u201cThis sanctions law, which was written for one purpose,\u201d said Jennifer Stisa Granick, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology project, \u201cis being used to suppress speech with little consideration of the free expression values and the special risks of blocking speech, as opposed to blocking commerce or funds as the sanctions was designed to do. That\u2019s really problematic.\u201dNow, Mr. Kadyrov \u2014 and the Russian government \u2014 want answers from Facebook about its reasoning.In a tweet on Wednesday, Mr. Kadyrov said Facebook had told him that the accounts were deactivated because he had just been put on the sanctions list.\u201cI am not perturbed by this petty U.S. rat race, but here is my question for Facebook and the Ministry of Finance,\u201d Mr. Kadyrov wrote, referring to the United States Treasury Department, the agency behind the sanctions. \u201cWhere is your praised democracy and the right of citizens to receive information? Or do 4 million followers mean nothing?\u201dMr. Kadyrov and four other Russians were added to the sanctions list on Dec. 20 because of alleged human rights abuses and involvement in criminal conspiracies. The sanctions were imposed under the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allows American authorities to freeze the United States assets of Russian officials considered responsible for human rights abuses. (It also bars them from obtaining visas for the United States.)Mr. Kadyrov used his Instagram account to post a sarcastic video response to the sanctions against him. It showed him sitting on a weight lifting bench in front of a comically heavy stack of weights and mocking the United States government.Mr. Kadyrov was not the only one critical of Facebook\u2019s decision to deactivate his accounts. The Russian government also voiced concern.Facebook, which also owns Instagram, defended its decision to remove the accounts, saying the government\u2019s sanctions against Mr. Kadyrov obligated it to do so.\u201cWe became aware and have now confirmed that the accounts appear to be maintained by or on behalf of parties who appear on the U.S. Specially Designated Nationals List and thus subject to U.S. trade sanctions,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement emailed to The New York Times. \u201cFor this reason, Facebook has a legal obligation to disable these accounts.\u201dMs. Granick, the ACLU attorney, said that raised serious issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not a law that appears to be written or designed to deal with the special situations where it\u2019s lawful or appropriate to repress speech,\u201d she said.The company does not appear to apply this policy to all people sanctioned by the United States. Several other people on sanctions list have active, and even verified, accounts.Facebook did not respond to questions about this discrepancy in removals.After his accounts were removed, Mr. Kadyrov criticized Facebook via the messaging app Telegram the same day. He accused Facebook of trying to appear \u201cofficially independent of Washington\u201d while making a politically calculated decision to remove his accounts.Mr. Kadyrov may be off Facebook and Instagram, but he is hardly without a platform. It remains to be seen what his cat does.He announced that in response to the removal of his accounts , he had opened an account on the Chechen social network Mylistory, which he said was \u201cin the testing phase\u201d but \u201cin no way inferior\u201d to its more popular U.S.-based counterparts.\u201cIn social networks, they can block pages, but the name of Ramzan Kadyrov will never be blocked by either them or their owners,\u201d Mr. Kadyrov said in his Dec. 23 Telegram post.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Will Move Its Israel Embassy to Jerusalem, Following Trump\u2019s Lead", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe spoke of the excellent relations we have had since Guatemala supported the creation of the state of Israel,\u201d Mr. Morales wrote. \u201cOne of the most important issues was the return of the Guatemalan Embassy to Jerusalem.\u201dNo other country has its embassy for Israel in Jerusalem, although the Czech Republic and Romania are said to be contemplating such a move.Mr. Trump upended decades of American policy with his decision on Jerusalem, aggravating an emotional issue that has festered since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the Israelis occupied the entire city.The consensus of international law is that Jerusalem\u2019s status is unresolved, that claims of sovereignty by Israel are invalid and that the issue must be settled in negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.Mr. Trump insisted that he was merely recognizing reality and not prejudging negotiations on the future borders of the city, but Palestinians saw the move as siding with Israel on the most delicate issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Trump had threatened to cut off aid to countries that did not take the side of the United States, but he has not yet done so, and experts say it would be difficult to do. Many Muslim-majority countries that voted for the resolution, like Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, are strategic partners of the United States in the region.Guatemala was one of seven countries to join the United States and Israel in voting against the resolution, along with Honduras, Togo, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia \u2014 mostly tiny countries heavily dependent on American aid.Guatemala was one of the first nations to recognize the state of Israel upon its establishment in 1948.Mr. Morales\u2019s decision was immediately seen as an effort to curry favor with Mr. Trump and, perhaps, to distract attention from his political problems at home. His brother and his son are under investigation by an anticorruption commission that has been strongly backed by the United States and the United Nations.Mr. Morales has clashed with the commission and even tried to expel its chief in August before he was stopped by the country\u2019s highest court.The commission relies on a close relationship with Guatemala\u2019s attorney general to pursue its cases. Washington will be watching to see whether a new attorney general, to be appointed next year when the term of Attorney General Thelma Aldana expires, will prove as committed to collaborating with the commission, known by its Spanish initials as the Cicig.Winning the favor of the Trump administration could prove helpful to Mr. Morales if the new attorney general he selects proves less cooperative with the commission.Guatemala is also awaiting the approval of aid under an Obama administration initiative set up to stem Central American migration to the United States.Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in 1967 and is home to sites important to Jews, Muslims and Christians. Under multiple Security Council decisions, East Jerusalem and the West Bank are considered occupied territory.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement set off weeks of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security forces that have left 12 Palestinians dead.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s title. He is Israel\u2019s prime minister, not president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Signs of a Mass Grave Emerge, Myanmar Cracks Down", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Reuters reporters U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on Dec. 12 after meeting with police officers in Yangon, the country\u2019s commercial capital.At the time, Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of Information said the journalists had tried to illegally procure information about Rakhine State, where international human-rights monitors say Myanmar\u2019s military has killed and raped thousands of Rohingya. Ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who compose the state\u2019s ethnic majority, have also been accused of participating in the bloodletting and burning of Rohingya villages.Three days after the reporters were arrested, five ethnic Rakhine residents of the village of Inn Din, in northern Rakhine, were detained, including the principal of the local school and three teachers.A relative of one of the detained teachers said the five were arrested because they gave some photos and documents to the reporters from Reuters. The person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, did not specify what the photos showed.\u201cStrong legal action will be taken if any member of security forces are involved,\u201d the Facebook post said.The relative of the detained Inn Din villager accused the government of wanting to hide the evidence shown in the documents.U Myint Kyaw, a member of the independent Myanmar Press Council, said he believed the arrests of the reporters and the Rakhine villagers were connected.Myanmar officials say that the office of the president, which is part of the country\u2019s civilian leadership, has authorized the police to proceed with the case against the reporters.\u201cNow it will be hard to stop the case against the journalists,\u201d Mr. Myint Kyaw said.\u201cThe government should have done an investigation first,\u201d into the existence of the mass grave, he added.A week after the reporters\u2019 arrest, high-level members of Myanmar\u2019s civilian government said they had no further information about why the two were arrested.\u201cRegarding this case, we don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said U Pe Myint, the country\u2019s minister of information. \u201cWe can only do something when we know what\u2019s going on.\u201dReuters declined to comment on the specifics of what its reporters were pursuing.\u201cWa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,\u201d Stephen J. Adler, president and editor in chief of Reuters, said in a statement.Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo were charged under Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act. The colonial-era law stipulates up to 14 years in jail for offenders. Two police officers were also arrested when the journalists were detained.Both journalists had reported on the exodus of an estimated 650,000 Rohingya Muslims from northern Rakhine State to Bangladesh during the past three and a half months. While the Rohingya have been persecuted for decades by the Myanmar military, the latest campaign against the Muslim minority began after Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar security posts in late August.With the exception of carefully controlled government-led trips, local and foreign reporters have been barred from visiting northern Rakhine. Reuters has published witness accounts from the region provided by people that the news agency did not identify by name.Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo is from Rakhine, and Mr. Wa Lone reported from the region.Doctors Without Borders estimated last week that at least 6,700 Rohingya, including 730 children, had died in violence in Myanmar in the month after the crackdown began.Among the many unanswered questions is what happened to the bodies of those believed to have been killed by the military and by aligned ethnic Rakhine mobs.In September, reporters on an escorted government trip were shown bodies of dozens of Hindu villagers that the Myanmar military said had been killed by Rohingya insurgents.Hindu survivors, who fled to central Rakhine and to Bangladesh, have provided conflicting reports of who attacked their community. Some say that black-clad Rohingya militants orchestrated the assault, while others blamed the Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar military is known.No Rohingya corpses have been shown to the media. It is not clear what ethnic group the Inn Din mass grave might hold.In November, the Myanmar military released the results of an internal inquiry that cleared all soldiers in Rakhine of any misconduct. Not a single innocent civilian had been raped or killed by the security forces, the report said.On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch published a 30-page report detailing a massacre in the village of Tula Toli, believed to be one of the worst-hit Rohingya hamlets.\u201cSoldiers and Rakhine villagers burned the bodies in deep pits dug in the sand, in an apparent effort to destroy evidence of the killings,\u201d the report asserts.Although Myanmar held general elections in 2015 that ushered in a civilian government led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the military that ruled for nearly five decades still controls most of the important levers of power.During Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s tenure, Myanmar\u2019s news media, which has only recently emerged from decades of censorship, has faced renewed challenges. High-profile journalists have been arrested on various charges. In October, two foreign journalists, a local reporter and their driver were arrested on charges of illegally flying a drone in Naypyidaw, the country\u2019s capital.Meanwhile, the families of Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo and Mr. Wa Lone say they have no idea where the reporters are being held.\u201cI went to the police station, and they said they didn\u2019t know where my husband is,\u201d said Mr. Wa Lone\u2019s wife, Ma Pan Ei Mon. \u201cThe level of our worry is to the moon and back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ken Friedman, Power Restaurateur, Is Accused of Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmy Dee Richardson, a bar manager there, didn\u2019t quit in 2004, when she says Mr. Friedman bit her on the waist as he bent down to duck under the bar. Neither did Trish Nelson, a longtime server who said he grabbed her head and pulled it toward his crotch in front of Amy Poehler in 2007 as Ms. Nelson knelt to collect glasses from a low shelf.But one night in 2012, Mr. Friedman pushed Ms. Nelson too far, she said: He invited her into his car to smoke marijuana and almost immediately lunged forward and pushed his tongue into her mouth.\u201cI was scared,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I had worked for him for six years.\u201dMs. Nelson, 40, said she was pinned against the car door, but managed to open it and scramble out. She gave notice within days. \u201cI was terrified to tell anyone why,\u201d she said. \u201cKen bragged about blacklisting people all the time. And we saw it happen.\u201dBut in more than two dozen interviews with former employees of the Spotted Pig and other restaurants owned by Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield, a dark behind-the-scenes portrait emerged of the owner and the workplaces he runs.Even by the loose standards of the hospitality business, where rowdy drinking sessions after shifts and playful sexual banter are part of the culture, employees described Mr. Friedman\u2019s restaurants as unusually sexualized and coercive.Ten women said that Mr. Friedman, 56, had subjected them to unwanted sexual advances: groping them in public, demanding sex or making text requests for nude pictures or group sex. Many others also said that working for him required tolerating daily kisses and touches, pulling all-night shifts at private parties that included public sex and nudity, and enduring catcalls and gropes from guests who are Mr. Friedman\u2019s friends.In a response to questions from The New York Times on Monday, Mr. Friedman said his personal and professional lives are intertwined with his restaurants and staff. (His wife is a former host at the Spotted Pig.) \u201cSome incidents were not as described, but context and content are not today\u2019s discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize now publicly for my actions.\u201dThe Spotted Pig restaurateur, April Bloomfield and Kelly Berg, the director of human resources at Friedfield Breslin LLC, respond to the sexual harassment allegations.His behavior, he said, \u201ccan accurately be described at times as abrasive, rude and frankly wrong.\u201d He said the women who work at his restaurants \u201care among the best in the business and putting any of them in humiliating situations is unjustifiable.\u201dOn Tuesday, after this article was published, his company announced that Mr. Friedman had decided to take an indefinite leave of absence from the management of the restaurants, effective immediately.Many employees said that they, like Mr. Friedman, sometimes blurred the lines between their professional and personal lives.All the employees interviewed said that for many women, Mr. Friedman\u2019s unwelcome sexual overtures, verbal and physical, were part of the daily routine at his New York restaurants, especially the small, intimate Spotted Pig. They said Mr. Friedman had frequent consensual sexual relationships with employees; openly hired, promoted or fired people based on their physical attractiveness; was often intoxicated at work; and pressured staff members to drink and take drugs with him and guests.Many said they had come to fear Mr. Friedman, a burly man well over six feet tall, because of his volatile temper and verbal bullying.\u201cWe had to brace ourselves every time Ken arrived,\u201d said Ms. Saibel, 40, the server who was groped by Mr. Friedman in the dining room of the Spotted Pig. (Her account was corroborated by two other employees who were present.) \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t coming on to us, he was screaming at us.\u201dThey also said that their fear was motivated by the knowledge that Mr. Friedman had retaliated against employees who stood up to him by firing them, blacklisting them or harassing them via phone, text or email.Ms. Saibel wrote up a formal complaint about Mr. Friedman and sent it to the restaurant\u2019s managers and Ms. Bloomfield. Soon afterward, she and her husband, both longtime employees, were fired for minor infractions.Several other employees say they also brought their complaints and concerns about Mr. Friedman to Ms. Bloomfield. \u201cHer response was always the same,\u201d said Ms. Nelson, who did not bring her complaints to the chef but was close to others who did. \u201c\u2018That\u2019s who he is. Get used to it. Or go work for someone else.\u2019\u201dAllegations of sexual harassment may seem surprising given Mr. Friedman\u2019s longtime collaboration with Ms. Bloomfield, 43. The two have clearly divided their domains: the dining room and bar are headed by Mr. Friedman, and the kitchens by Ms. Bloomfield. \u201cMy energies are directed to the kitchen, food preparation and menu development,\u201d Ms. Bloomfield said in a statement.But staff members said they turned to her for relief. \u201cI went to April directly multiple times about Ken\u2019s inappropriate and abusive behavior, because among other problems it generated huge turnover among the staff,\u201d said Natalie Freihon, a former food and beverage director for the group\u2019s ventures at the Ace Hotel New York, including the Breslin and the John Dory. \u201cShe really didn\u2019t want the turnover to continue. But she completely backed off from getting involved with the behavior.\u201dMs. Bloomfield denied that. \u201cIn the two matters involving uninvited approaches that were brought to my attention over the years, I immediately referred both to our outside labor counsel and they were addressed internally,\u201d she said in her statement. \u201cI have spoken to Ken about professional boundaries and relied on him to uphold our policies. Nonetheless I feel we have let down our employees and for that I sincerely apologize.\u201dKelly Berg, who was hired in May as director of human resources for the restaurant company, Friedfield Breslin L.L.C., said in a statement that no employees had been dismissed or retaliated against for filing a complaint.\u201cAll employees are encouraged to report any concerns about the workplace, and I am saddened to learn some hesitated or chose to not do so,\u201d she wrote. She would not answer questions about specific complaints or discuss how long those policies had been in place.Many employees said Mr. Friedman was often genuinely warm and professionally supportive of women, as long as they tolerated his flirtatious behavior. In retrospect, several women said, his bursts of good-natured playfulness and generosity made it possible for them to ignore the fear, chaos and power imbalance in the relationship \u2014 sometimes, for years.\u201cHe can be charismatic and fun,\u201d said Jamie Seet, who worked for Mr. Friedman from 2006 to 2014, including three years as general manager of the Spotted Pig. \u201cBut everyone goes on the chopping block eventually.\u201dAnd the rewards of a job at a Friedman-Bloomfield restaurant can be great. Servers at the top of their game can earn six figures in a year. Working with Ms. Bloomfield confers prestige in restaurants around the world. Mr. Friedman has treated favored employees to after-work drinks, field trips to his beach house and top-tier concert tickets.Ms. Rza Betts, the former wine director, said working at the Breslin while Ms. Bloomfield\u2019s star was rising was so rewarding that she simply shrugged off Mr. Friedman\u2019s hugs that went on too long, and his occasional slaps on her buttocks.But one night in the fall of 2010, she recalls, Mr. Friedman took her out for drinks at a new rooftop bar near the Breslin, ostensibly to check out the competition. He leaned over, Ms. Rza Betts said, and planted a sloppy kiss on her mouth.\u201cIn the moment you are not thinking at all,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s your boss. You don\u2019t punch him. You just don\u2019t kiss back, and pull away and try to shake it off.\u201dShe left and was in a cab home when the texts started. \u201cG\u2019nite gorgeous. Send me a sexy picture,\u201d he wrote.She politely brushed him off, but they kept coming. \u201cCone on. One sexy pic.\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d she texted. \u201cNo kisses. No pix. I\u2019m a straight shooting career woman.\u201d\u201cJust 1. Your body,\u201d he responded.He gave up only after sending eight separate texts, which she shared with The Times. \u201cI was embarrassed, felt taken advantage of and emotionally manipulated,\u201d Ms. Rza Betts said.She decided to work harder, knowing that pushing back could put her job in jeopardy. Then, one day in October 2011, she was cleaning up after a sherry-themed dinner at the Spotted Pig. Mr. Friedman, she said, remarked that she had started wearing push-up bras \u2014 probably, he added, to conceal the stretch marks on her breasts.Ms. Rza Betts recorded the incident in her journal the next day. Still, she kept working for him until 2013. \u201cI made a decision to stay there because I loved the job and I loved April\u2019s food and I believed in it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hike up your bootstraps and you work. That\u2019s how we all survived working for him.\u201dIndustry veterans say restaurants are especially accommodating to behavior that pushes the boundaries of sexuality in a workplace. Experienced servers accept that flirting is sometimes part of securing a good tip. Shifts are filled with sexual banter that many welcome as playful.But the Spotted Pig turned that formula up several notches. In past interviews, Mr. Friedman \u2014 a former manager of bands, including the Smiths \u2014 has said his goal was to make a restaurant, with exceptional food, that was as sexy as any bar in town.His vision was perhaps best expressed on the third floor of the Spotted Pig, an invitation-only space entered through unmarked doors. Decorated with posters, mismatched chairs and British knickknacks, it looks more like the ramshackle studio apartment of a graduate student than a V.I.P. haunt. The scruffy, bohemian ambience and Mr. Friedman\u2019s talent as a host and gatekeeper have made it a place where celebrities feel comfortable.But late at night, after the first-floor dining room closed and the party moved upstairs, Mr. Friedman made it clear that normal restaurant rules did not apply, several employees said. In the frequently packed room, guests openly groped female servers, who said Mr. Friedman required them to work until parties ended, often after dawn.Ms. Seet, the former manager, said that during a party in 2008, she intervened when she saw on the security camera feed that Mr. Batali, who was drunk, was groping and kissing a woman who appeared to be unconscious.\u201cWe called him the Red Menace,\u201d said Ms. Nelson, the former server. \u201cHe tried to touch my breasts and told me that they were beautiful. He wanted to wrestle. As I was serving drinks to his table, he told me I should sit on his friend\u2019s face.\u201dMr. Batali apologized on Tuesday. \u201cThough I don\u2019t remember these specific accounts, there is no question I have behaved terribly,\u201d he wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cThere are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused.\u201dAmong employees and industry insiders, the third-floor space has earned a nickname: \u201cthe rape room.\u201dMr. Friedman has also been intimidating in other parts of his empire, even to men on the staff. \u201cThere were definitely times I was scared of him,\u201d said David Rabig, a former manager at several Friedman restaurants. \u201cHe\u2019s a very large man. He likes to threaten to fire people. He liked to remind people he was the boss.\u201dMr. Friedman especially likes to show off around celebrities, and \u201cthat involved humiliating the staff,\u201d Mr. Rabig said.Ms. Nelson, the waiter and aspiring comedian whom Mr. Friedman kissed in his car, recalled the time she met an idol, Ms. Poehler. Ms. Nelson said she was bartending on the third floor and happened to be kneeling down, stacking glasses on a tray. Mr. Friedman was standing next to her when Ms. Poehler walked over. He introduced the two women. Ms. Nelson, still on her knees, reached up to shake Ms. Poehler\u2019s hand.As Ms. Nelson recalls it, Mr. Friedman said, \u201cAnd while you\u2019re down there\u201d as he grabbed the back of her head and pulled it into his crotch.Contacted through her agent, Ms. Poehler said, \u201cI have no recollection of this, but it\u2019s horrible.\u201dLike many restaurants, the Spotted Pig operated for many years with a patchwork approach to human-resources management. Employees were told to bring sexual harassment claims directly to restaurant managers.But the managers interviewed by The Times said that they were often promoted because they were close to Mr. Friedman, so that rarely happened. Several employees said that when they did report problems, managers brushed them off or confided that they themselves were too afraid of Mr. Friedman\u2019s verbal abuse to take action.Ms. Berg, the company\u2019s recently hired human resources director, said in a statement that employees now go through anti-harassment training sessions and that personnel policies have been outlined in an employee handbook.Employees said harassment took many forms under Mr. Friedman. Jessica Brown, 35, who now oversees food and beverages at JetBlue, took over as the Breslin\u2019s wine director after Ms. Rza Betts left in 2013. When Ms. Brown became pregnant, she feared for her job.In 2015, soon after her marriage, she requested a meeting with Mr. Friedman and another manager to discuss her compensation. A worried Mr. Friedman asked her if she was pregnant, she said.

He would order employees out of the restaurant in a rage, then rehire them the next day.When they quit, Mr. Friedman offered apologies, promises to reform and make-up gifts: in Ms. Seet\u2019s case, tickets to a Lady Gaga concert and dinner for her and her wife at Quince, an elegant restaurant in San Francisco, where she had moved to manage the opening of Tosca Cafe.\u201cI told him I felt like a battered wife,\u201d she said.Ms. Seet says that when she finally resigned, Mr. Friedman wrote her a long, profanity-filled email threatening to blackball her in the industry.\u201cKen has tried to blacklist many people,\u201d said Ms. Freihon, formerly of the Breslin. \u201cThe restaurant industry is very small and tight knit, and he does know everyone.\u201d\u201c\u2018Everyone\u2019 means the male chefs and the male restaurant owners and the male C.F.O.s,\u201d she said. \u201cAdvancement is incredibly hard for women in this industry because you never know what the men are saying about you.\u201dOver all, Ms. Seet said, working for Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield was nearly as thrilling as it was abusive. The constant drama created tight, familial relationships.But, she and many others said, in order for the restaurant industry to finally allow women to build long-term careers, chaotic workplaces like the Spotted Pig will have to change.\u201cI feel guilty even talking to you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to stop.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Bono\u2019s connection to the Spotted Pig. He has been a guest, not an investor. It also misstated how long Trish Nelson has worked in the restaurant business. It is 20 years, not 30.An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Ken Friedman sent Carla Rza Betts a series of texts seeking nude pictures of her. It was 2010, not 2009.An earlier version of this article misidentified the agency where Jessica Brown, a former wine director at the Breslin, filed a discrimination complaint. It was the New York City Commission on Human Rights, not the state\u2019s Human Rights Division.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is This Genocide?", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "OpinionSurvivors describe Myanmar soldiers killing men, raping women and burning babies in a Rohingya village.Supported bySOUTHEAST BANGLADESH, NEAR THE MYANMAR BORDER \u2014 \u201cEthnic cleansing\u201d and even \u201cgenocide\u201d are antiseptic and abstract terms. What they mean in the flesh is a soldier grabbing a crying baby girl named Suhaifa by the leg and flinging her into a bonfire. Or troops locking a 15-year-old girl in a hut and setting it on fire.The children who survive are left haunted: Noor Kalima, age 10, struggles in class in a makeshift refugee camp. Her mind drifts to her memory of seeing her father and little brother shot dead, her baby sister\u2019s and infant brother\u2019s throats cut, the machete coming down on her own head, her hut burning around her \u2026 and it\u2019s difficult to focus on multiplication tables.\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t concentrate on my class,\u201d Noor explained. \u201cI want to throw up.\u201dYou judge: Here\u2019s what Noor and her mother, Dilbar Begum, say happened in their village, Tula Toli. First, the Myanmar Army separated the women and girls from the men and boys.\u201cThen they shot the men and boys,\u201d Dilbar recalled. \u201cI saw them kill my husband and son. I was screaming.\u201dI delicately tried to probe whether Noor had seen the murders of her father and brother, who was just 4 years old.\u201cI saw everything,\u201d Noor said, biting her lip. In a rush of words, she added: \u201cMy father was the best man in the world. We were a good team.\u201dShe began to cry, and soon my interpreter was wiping away tears, too. And so was I.The Myanmar soldiers herded the women and girls into huts to be raped. Noor and Dilbar were taken into one hut, along with Noor\u2019s 2-year-old sister, Rozia, and another brother, Muhammad Kashel, a baby still nursing.\u201cThey took my baby and cut his throat,\u201d Dilbar said in a trembling voice, adding that the soldiers then cut Rozia\u2019s throat, too. Shortly afterward, Noor remembers a machete blade smashing down repeatedly on her own head, her mother screaming in the background. Then she collapsed unconscious.Dilbar said the soldiers then yanked an earring from her ear \u2014 she pointed to her torn lobe \u2014 and assaulted her beside the bodies of her children: \u201cOne soldier held me down, and another raped me.\u201d When they were finished, she said, the soldiers chopped her on the head with the machete \u2014 she has the same angry scars on her scalp as her daughter \u2014 and left her for dead while setting fire to the hut.The fire and smoke roused her, she said. She checked the bodies of her children and found that Noor was still breathing. Grabbing the girl, she ran into the woods. Dazed, they hiked for two days through the woods to get to the Bangladesh border.The global and American responses have been feeble, so Myanmar is getting away with murder and rape intended to change the country\u2019s demography. The lesson that the world\u2019s complacency sends to other countries is that this is an ideal time to eradicate a vexing ethnic group.Daw Suu, if you\u2019re reading this, I hope that for a moment you\u2019ll open your heart and listen to the story of Hasina Begum, 21, and her 1-year-old daughter, Suhaifa. (Begum is a common honorific for women.)Myanmar soldiers held Hasina and other village women at gunpoint, she said, while the troops executed the men and boys, doused the bodies with gasoline and turned the corpses into a bonfire. Then the troops led the women and girls, five at a time, toward a hut.\u201cI was trying to hide my baby under my scarf, but they saw her leg,\u201d Hasina recalled, her voice brittle, her mouth trembling. \u201cThey grabbed my baby by the leg and threw her onto the fire.\u201dHasina said she collapsed on the ground, screaming. The impatient soldiers then began to club her \u2014 she showed me scars from the beating \u2014 and dragged her into a hut with her sister-in-law, Asma Begum. The soldiers stripped the women naked and raped them, she said, and finally closed the door and set the hut on fire.As bits of the burning roof fell down on them, Hasina said, she and Asma broke a hole in the side of the hut and ran away naked. They rolled in mud to soothe their burns, and the next day they found a Rohingya house and begged for the man inside to throw out clothes so that they could cover themselves.A three-day hike took Hasina and Asma to Bangladesh. But Hasina still suffers from the beating and from the emptiness left by the murder of Suhaifa, and she has trouble sleeping.\u201cWhen I fall asleep, I look for my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI wake up screaming.\u201dOne 14-year-old girl confided her deepest secret: Four soldiers had gang-raped her. She had intended to keep the secret forever, but then she became pregnant and quietly sought medical help. An aid worker helped her get an abortion, but she still hasn\u2019t told even her parents. She shared her story with me only because she is so grateful to the aid organization and it told her that I could be trusted.It\u2019s impossible to know how many women and girls have been raped, but doctors in the refugee camps report a surge in pregnancies as a result of rape, and I encountered two women who suffered fistulas caused by rape.The Rohingya who have reached Bangladesh live in vast, sprawling refugee encampments, where I interviewed them in their tents and shacks; aid organizations provide desperately needed food, water, toilets and medical care, but cannot offer hope. Bangladesh does not want the Rohingya and does not allow aid organizations to teach Bengali, the national language, or to offer an education beyond primary school.\u201cThat man being shot is Sayid Azam, my neighbor,\u201d said Ismal, an 11-year-old orphan, explaining his drawing of a huge gun firing at a man. \u201cI saw it. I was hiding behind a bush.\u201dConsider Shafika Begum, a 15-year-old who may be the only survivor in her family. She said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and four brothers; they then took her, her mother and her 11-year-old sister into a hut. The soldiers cut her sister\u2019s throat in front of her, and she said that when she screamed, the soldiers clubbed her on the head and knocked her out.Flames and smoke brought her back to consciousness: The soldiers had locked the door of the hut and set it on fire. Her mother and sister were dead, and Shafika\u2019s clothes were on fire, but she broke through a wall and fled.Was she raped? \u201cI was unconscious, so I don\u2019t know what they did to me,\u201d she said. But she added that someone had rearranged her clothes.Shafika walked for four days through the jungle to get to Bangladesh. Her back, left hand and both feet are burned, and she has no money to buy burn medicine. I was concerned that interviewing her might traumatize her again, but she was determined to speak.\u201cI want to tell the whole world my story,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to tell what happens in Myanmar.\u201dThe three people whose stories I\u2019ve focused on \u2014 Noor, the 10-year-old; Hasina, whose baby was thrown onto the fire; and Shafika, disfigured by burns \u2014 are all from the same village, Tula Toli. All these atrocities that I\u2019ve described unfolded on a single dot of the map \u2014 and in every direction there are other villages with tragedies of their own.Are the stories they recount true?One thing I\u2019ve learned over the decades (originally while covering China\u2019s murder of Tiananmen democracy protesters in 1989) is that victims lie as well as perpetrators. Outrage leads to exaggerations, to elevated death tolls, to rumors becoming eyewitness accounts. But the attack on Tula Toli has been well documented by human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Fortify Rights, and it is substantiated by satellite photos showing the burned huts. In all, I spoke to seven people who said they were survivors from Tula Toli, and their stories meshed and cross-confirmed one another.There is no easy solution to possible genocide; there never is. But accountability helps, so there should be a major push to prosecute Myanmar military officials in the International Criminal Court. Judges can resolve whether these crimes against humanity also amount to genocide.We do know that international sanctions and pressure matter to Myanmar\u2019s generals, because those were what led them to step back and hold elections. But so far there hasn\u2019t been enough pressure exerted to stop the barbaric treatment of the Rohingya.A Times colleague asked how I can report on these atrocities and not lose faith in humanity. The answer is that I see not only the evil, but also among the survivors a truly inspiring resilience and courage. I am awed by people like Dilbar, Hasina and Shafika with the physical and mental strength to escape through the mountains and then the moral strength to speak out about sexual violence meant to humiliate them into silence.Hasina may be exhausted from nightmares about searching for her baby, but she displays a moral clarity that world leaders can emulate. \u201cThey killed my family members, and they killed my world,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen I tell my story, I feel terrible, and afterward I go cry to myself. But we need justice, and maybe this will help.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}

Five students were lined up in a row to be shot by a gunman, with two others already on the ground in pools of blood. Another figure, ablaze, ran from a schoolhouse that was going up in flames.The words \u201cpew, pew, pew\u201d mimicked the sound of bullets being fired in rapid succession.These were the images that a teacher at Port St. Joe Elementary School in northwest Florida found scrawled in pen on a fourth-grade student\u2019s homework assignment on Friday.The school called the authorities, and the student\u2019s stepfather, Robert Paul Alexander Edwards of Mexico Beach, Fla., was arrested later that day, according to a statement from the Gulf County Sheriff\u2019s Office and an affidavit obtained on Monday.The sheriff\u2019s office said it did not believe Mr. Edwards was planning to carry out the actions depicted in the drawing. There was no information about the suspect\u2019s motive.The discovery at the school in Port St. Joe, a coastal bay city of about 3,400 people, touched a nerve in a state that has confronted gun violence on school grounds and in other public places over the years.\u201cOur country has been affected one too many times with horrific school tragedies,\u201d Sheriff Mike Harrison said. \u201cWe take matters like this very seriously.\u201dThe sheriff said in a telephone interview that Mr. Edwards \u201cdid not have a lot of explanation other than that he didn\u2019t intend to do anything like this and it was a, I believe, in his words, a childish mistake.\u201dWilliam B. Payne, a felony criminal investigator and public records coordinator at the Office of the State Attorney, said Monday that the case was still in its \u201cinfancy\u201d and that he had no immediate information about whether Mr. Edwards had a lawyer. The suspect\u2019s first appearance in court would have taken place within 24 hours of his arrest, Mr. Payne said.He added that recent cases with the same charges had mostly involved schools and juvenile suspects, but that those suspects had directed their threats at a specific person, such as engraving bullets with someone\u2019s name.The suspect was being held on $150,000 bond, Jim Norton, the superintendent of Gulf District Schools, said on Monday.The student at the elementary school had handed a teacher the spelling homework assignment on which the drawing was made, Mr. Norton said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is a new era when you have to look at all angles, when you see something from right field, where it would depict something so horrible,\u201d he said.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to sit on something, so we did react to it,\u201d he added. \u201cWhether the issue was poor taste or an actual threat, that is not for us to separate right there. We have to err on the side of safety.\u201dOn the sheriff\u2019s Facebook page, more than 100 readers commented on the arrest.One man identified Mr. Edwards as a tattoo artist in the Port St. Joe area who goes by the trade name \u2018Purdy Boy Rob,\u2019 saying he \u201cjokes around a lot.\u201d\u201cAnyone who knows him knows he likes offensive jokes,\u201d the man wrote.\u201cThis is not a laughing matter,\u201d another wrote. \u201cThe last thing we need in Gulf County is any threat to our community.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Can the City Prevent Terror Attacks?", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this frigid Wednesday.How can we prevent lone-wolf attacks in New York City?\u201cThe scary part about a homegrown, lone-wolf radical threat is that it\u2019s hard to deal with,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neil said. Because attacks are increasingly carried out with vehicles and homemade bombs, preventing them calls for a collective effort between law enforcement and the community, he added. \u201cThe only way you can really attack it is by having an informed public who sees and reports suspicious behavior, and law enforcement that\u2019s present on location that hopefully can engage attacks before they happen.\u201dWhat is a realistic goal?Mr. O\u2019Neil said that \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I said they\u2019re going to stop every single attack,\u201d especially ones using simple improvised explosive devices. \u201cWhat are you going to do, outlaw match heads?\u201d The best option, he repeated, was citizens working together with the police to keep an eye out. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to stop this, but we need you to help us with this.\u201dHow can members of law enforcement improve their counterterrorism operations?A common theme in recent attacks, Mr. O\u2019Neil said, was the internet\u2019s role in radicalizing attackers and teaching them to make bombs. \u201cWe need to work with online companies to try and pull this material off the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that should be an effort by the national government. Those are the things, from a law-enforcement standpoint, that they really need to attack aggressively that in my opinion they probably haven\u2019t done in the last decade or so.\u201dIs there a danger in overreacting to a terrorist attack?Mr. O\u2019Neil lauded the decision not to close the subways after Monday\u2019s attack, but said that evacuating the Port Authority, while necessary, created a new risk. \u201cWhat you saw happen on Monday was thousands of people crowding into Penn Station. If you want to talk about a target of opportunity, you have a mass casualty target right there.\u201d The challenge for law enforcement, he added, is making life-or-death decisions in mere minutes. \u201cThe real simple answer,\u201d he said, \u201cis you don\u2019t act out of emotion.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s f-f-f-freezing cold today.Layer on a warm sweater and jacket, and hang on to your earmuffs \u2014 it\u2019s going to be very gusty.After the explosion on Monday, The Daily Mail tweeted a photo of New Yorkers on an escalator leaving the Port Authority, calling them \u201cpanicked commuters.\u201dWhich got us thinking: Have New Yorkers become too jaded about terrorist attacks in their city?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump in the Web of Pax Technica", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs striking as the radiant images was the absence of any photograph of President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence. When I inquired, embassy staff explained that the official portraits had not yet arrived. As soon as they did, they would go up, of course.Still, the puzzle remains. A year of Trump and the world has not veered off a precipice. Is there some 21st century iteration of Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d that explains this equilibrium?Certainly the visible \u2014 America\u2019s poisonous relations with North Korea, with Iran, with the Palestinians, and the dangerous vacuum created by Trump\u2019s America-first retreat from the world \u2014 looks dire. Pax Americana has had a good run but cannot be convincingly backed or projected by a self-doubting power.One stab at defining such an invisible force that I find persuasive has been offered by Philip Howard, a professor of Internet Studies at Oxford University. He has coined the term \u201cPax Technica\u201d to define the vast web of internet-connected devices that, together, create a network of stability.Just as Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d alluded to the unobservable market forces that lead to equilibrium in a free market, so Howard\u2019s Pax Technica (the title of a book he wrote) evokes the cumulative stabilizing effect of the tens of billions of connected devices forming the Internet of Things (IoT). There is, simply put, too much connection in the world today to allow space for outright destruction, even emanating from Trump.Implicit in this theory is a radical reordering of the nature of power. Pax Romana, Pax Britannica and Pax Americana depended on the military might of sovereign governments. Pax Technica shifts the source of stability to what Howard calls an \u201cempire of connected things.\u201d National authorities are less influential than supranational connected platforms and the private corporations behind them.Of course, we are beyond the na\u00efve view that the internet would liberate us all. It\u2019s clear, from China and elsewhere, that technology can be used as much to curtail freedom as to spread it, as effectively for surveillance as for fostering free speech.It\u2019s also clear, from Russia\u2019s successful intervention in the last United States election, that Facebook can be a vehicle for propaganda and for the blurring of the line between truth and falsehood. Everywhere, social media is transforming society in ways that may look alarming. Mobs are more easily mobilized. Mainstream political parties are imploding. Democracy is more direct but also more driven by extremes. Trump himself is a product of this transformation.But there will also be the hard-to-measure investment of every owner of those billions of devices in a world of connectedness of which war is the enemy. Trump has come to power at a moment when power is increasingly passing out of the hands of governments. That may be even more reassuring than his incompetence.Palihapatiya suggested Facebook has forged a world of \u201cno civil discourse, no cooperation, misinformation.\u201d Trump, of course, reflects that. But I think Facebook, on balance, also limits the devastation he can wreak.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taken From Ukraine\u2019s War Zone, Grenades Are Used in Crimes, Too", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The murder trial in Nikopol, a town in eastern Ukraine, was entangled in bureaucratic delays that were clearly angering a father of one of the victims.When the 21st hearing led to yet another postponement, the distraught man decided to take justice into his own hands. He pulled the pins from two hand grenades, then threw one at the three defendants and held the second, killing himself.After nearly four years of war with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the spread of weapons stolen from the army has led to an increase in gun violence unusual for a European country. It has also led to something new and more disturbing: Hand grenades are turning up in a variety of crimes, including domestic violence and bank robbery.The Ukrainian police reported seizing about 2,500 hand grenades this year, compared with 100 in 2013.\u201cThis is the consequence of the enormous and uncontrolled circulation of military weapons on the territory of Ukraine after the beginning of hostilities,\u201d said Anna Maliar, a criminologist. \u201cIn the past, people also had aggressive quarrels, but there was no access to grenades or other weapons. Now, it is very easy to purchase weapons from people who visit the war zone.\u201dArms experts say it is no surprise that more and more grenades are leaking from the war zone. Hand grenades are easy to hide and hard to keep a good accounting of in combat situations.As a result, hand grenades have become an increasingly familiar aspect of Ukrainian life. In one of the earliest and deadliest attacks, a hand grenade thrown into a crowd of protesters in Kiev in 2015 killed four police officers and injured 141 people.More recently, a Ukrainian serviceman killed himself by detonating a grenade after a quarrel with his girlfriend. An unemployed man threatened a gas station attendant with a hand grenade and then drove off without paying the bill.Most hand grenade crimes take place in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a frequently lawless area where the Ukrainian Army is fighting Russia-backed separatists.One factor making grenades hard to track is the sheer number of people who have permits to enter the zone of military action, called the counterterrorist operation area. More than 10,300 people have died there since 2014, many of them civilians.Thousands of people can be in the area at any given time, including residents, volunteers who bring supplies to the troops and members of paramilitary groups. \u201cCivilians, especially women, are usually checked less,\u201d said Mr. Petrenko, the researcher.After the antigovernment uprising in 2014, several members of Parliament proposed legalizing firearms to eliminate black-market trading. They have suggested easing regulations to allow civilians to legally possess firearms for self-defense, rather than only for hunting, as is the case now.But even if firearms were made more widely available, civilians would still not be allowed to possess hand grenades.That makes a lot of sense, said Ms. Maliar, the criminologist, who said the war and economic hardship had put a lot of people on a short fuse. \u201cSocial tension increases in the society,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw enforcement is not efficient, and people don\u2019t trust the police.\u201dMany people, she added, think it is easier to take matters into their own hands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shooing Carolers Away for a Love That Stays", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveMy parents, roommate and I could hear carolers down the hallway. \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d shook me out of the haze that had kept me floating above myself in bed, disengaged from a body that was 22 pounds lighter than when I had started chemotherapy weeks before.Eventually the carolers would reach my room, but I was more drawn to the view from my window. I liked staring out at the healthy world\u2019s layers so as not to forget my place in them \u2014 a street, a garden inside a black gate, the East River, Roosevelt Island, Queens, Long Island, the ocean.Stuck to the glass were Christmas and Hanukkah decorations made of gummy material: fat Santas twirling around dreidels with snowflakes falling upon colorful boxed gifts. The pediatric oncology floor felt as festive as a suburban mall. My once-a-day walk of the unit was a stroll through a malignant winter wonderland.The carolers were getting closer. A volunteer would soon knock and ask if it was O.K. for them to come in. All day long there were unwelcome entrances, a revolving door of doctors, nurses, aides, physical therapists, social workers, psychiatrists and one diligent nutritionist. Sometimes, at day\u2019s end, I would hear the quiet knock of a friend, or better yet, Rachel.At some point during that idyllic fall, I developed a cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. Rachel encouraged me to see a doctor. When I finally did, the doctor sent me for a precautionary X-ray, but the machine was broken, so I left, relieved to return to my life as a busy recent college graduate.The cough remained, however. A few hospital visits later, I learned I had an aggressive form of pediatric leukemia that can also occur in young adults. When I sought a second opinion, I was admitted on the spot.Only months earlier I had graduated from Fordham University\u2019s Lincoln Center campus, having majored in directing and acting. I even forfeited a winter break to study in Russia at the Moscow Art Theater. Now, at 22, I had never been so happy with my life \u2014 going to auditions and rehearsals, applying for jobs, and seeing Rachel in between.I told her I had cancer over dinner at Whole Foods.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stick around for this,\u201d I said.I thought we would end things there, but she showed up at Sloan Kettering days later, finding me in pediatrics with greasy hair and wearing size 14 pink sweatpants, provided by the unit. And she kept showing up.The morning of the carolers, my body tensed as a team of doctors, nurses and students stopped by on their rounds. They frowned at my chart, seeing I hadn\u2019t gained any weight. At 5 feet 6 inches, I weighed only 93 pounds.\u201cWhen can I get this feeding tube out?\u201d I asked.\u201cNot today.\u201dWhen they asked how I was feeling, I said, \u201cI think I\u2019m a little anxious?\u201d And Ativan was added to the long list of prescriptions brought to me in tiny plastic cups.Lying in bed, I could easily imagine the carolers\u2019 lives. They were probably unemployed musical theater actors hired to sing basic harmonies while wearing velvet costumes. Later they would go to a Christmas party with other actor friends, and if someone asked, \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d they would say, \u201cOh, nothing right now. But I\u2019ve got this day job singing Christmas carols for children with cancer. It\u2019s so rewarding.\u201dIn high school, I spent nights and weekends during the holiday season in medieval garb, going to Christmas parties that hired our choir to sing carols for their guests, something I used to joke about in the dorm. It wasn\u2019t until hearing the carolers that I realized how much I had loved singing our jazzed-up version of \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201dDuring one of the performances of \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d that day, I had tried to hum along, but my vocal cords produced only a strained rasp. Losing my voice meant sacrificing yet another anchor of my identity, a new loss added to the long list I didn\u2019t want to say out loud. If I were to talk about my inability to sing, or how my leggings no longer fit snugly over my hipbones, it would make those losses feel more real.As predicted, a volunteer appeared in the doorway and said, \u201cDo you want to hear the carolers?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I said.\u201cNo,\u201d my roommate said. I liked her already.Allison was 20. She had started her sophomore year of college in September but left a month later because of \u201ca cold that wouldn\u2019t go away.\u201d She had a blog and often posted about her treatment on social media.Meanwhile, my Facebook feed had just a few photos of me with a shaved head, enough to make an acquaintance think I was going through a rebellious phase. Although I envied Allison\u2019s online presence, I realized that my disengagement was more about shame than self-preservation.\u201cHow long is your treatment?\u201d I asked.\u201cSix months.\u201dHer answer staggered me. By the time she finished, I would be only a quarter of the way done.\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow long is yours?\u201d\u201cTwo years.\u201d\u201cWhy so long?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d I said, embarrassed.Unlike Allison, I hadn\u2019t asked questions. Ignorance was my survival technique.That night, long after the carolers had left, there was a quiet knock on the door.\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d I thought, and a moment later Rachel walked in with her signature lightness. Her positivity was stubborn but welcome in that room, where my parents and I didn\u2019t even notice that the sun had gone down. We were still stunned to even be there. We had thought I would be an outpatient. No one knew the side effects would be so extreme.Rachel came bearing gifts, one in a cookie tin and the other in a wrapped cardboard box.Opening the tin for my parents, Rachel said, \u201cI made these for you.\u201d Inside were blueberry muffins.\u201cWow, thank you,\u201d my father said.\u201cYes, thank you, Rachel,\u201d my mother said, her tone softer than the polite tolerance from when they first met at the hospital weeks ago.My parents left so Rachel and I could be alone (well, almost alone \u2014 a curtain separated us from Allison). After they stepped out, I felt nervous and relieved because it was the first time Rachel had seen me this sick. I couldn\u2019t pretend I was anything other than how I appeared \u2014 skinny, balding, a tube stuffed up my nose and taped to my face.I patted the side of my bed, gesturing her to come closer.She handed me my gift and squeezed in beside me \u2014 another twin bed. Unwrapping my present, I felt my dry hospital skin against her soft, warm clothes.\u201cIt\u2019s silly,\u201d she said nervously.That she would feel nervous struck me as ridiculous. Making those blueberry muffins had instantly made her part of the family.\u201cIt\u2019s a Russian stacking doll,\u201d she said, \u201cbut a tree.\u201dI held the wooden Christmas tree, which was painted black with gold, green and red ornaments and a glittery gold top. I opened it to find a series of round, smiling Santas stacked inside, each smaller and more thoughtfully painted than the previous one.\u201cIt reminded me of you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unique and pretty, and because you went to Russia, so \u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI love it,\u201d I said, placing the gift prominently on my nightstand.Now, six years later, I have neither leukemia nor Rachel. Still, her gift sits on my coffee table every December, a reminder of when I was so sick, but so grateful. That gift meant I had a person, one who not only made baked goods for my family, but also gave me a silly stacking doll just because it had made her think of me. It meant I existed outside of the hospital, carried along in someone\u2019s thoughts as she walked through a Christmas fair.In the bed, Rachel held me close, and I folded easily into her arms.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so small,\u201d I said, letting her in on my fearful inner monologue.\u201cShh,\u201d she said.In the quiet that followed, I knew I loved her. Loving her wasn\u2019t a choice or something I needed to say yet, but it became my one untouchable thing. As my body disappeared, I still had a person to care about. Unable to sing, speak normally, walk without help, look at a screen or read a book, I existed because I loved.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: the Agrarian Kitchen Eatery & Store in New Norfolk, Tasmania", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Sculptural light fixtures, which look like geometric antlers with glowing tips, stand out dramatically. Sunlight streams in through the tall, antique windows, illuminating the farm equipment hanging on the wall. These \u201cartisan garden tools\u201d are for sale, along with a few other well-chosen kitchen and decorative objects. The spade costs $225; the hoe is $113.The food here is focused on simplicity and seasonality, the kind of pleasure one might derive from a thick piece of dense and springy sourdough bread served with fresh cultured butter. Many things are pickled or otherwise fermented. Fresh farmer\u2019s cheese arrives on your polished wooden table sprinkled with tiny, purple garlic flowers alongside chewy pretzels encrusted in caraway seeds.At one end of the room you can glimpse through to a gleaming kitchen, where hunks of meat are cooked over an open fire, giving the whole dining room a slight scent of wood smoke. Behind the long bar, Adi Ruiz, one of Australia\u2019s most accomplished bartenders, shakes and stirs drinks using garden-fresh ingredients.But there\u2019s a stark, almost shocking contrast between Agrarian Kitchen and its surroundings. That room\u2019s high ceilings and striking windows are linked to its history, as the infirmary for the women\u2019s wing of Tasmania\u2019s largest mental hospital. The restaurant is smack in the midst of the ruins of that asylum, a hulking sprawl of old brick and stone buildings that rise ominously from the side of the road as you enter New Norfolk, the town where Agrarian Kitchen makes its home.The word \u201cagrarian\u201d conjures the kind of fantasy that wealthy urbanites like to indulge, centering on a relationship with nature and food that is full of beauty and wholesomeness. Romantic notions of country life are an important part of Tasmania\u2019s, and indeed Australia\u2019s, self-image. But despite its stunning natural beauty, the economic and social reality in much of the state is fraught.Inside that beautiful room, all seems well. The head chef, Ali Currey-Voumard, is from Tasmania, but honed her skills in some of Melbourne\u2019s best-known kitchens. Now that she is back in her home state, Ms. Currey-Voumard is helping to invent a regional Tasmanian variant of new Australian cooking, with produce leading the way.At the height of spring, the most astonishing thing on the menu was a pile of fresh asparagus, blanched and shocked, and set over kefir cream sprinkled with chives and crumbled bresaola. The accompaniments were nice enough, but the revelation came with the lush green flavor of the asparagus itself. A few weeks later, as spring leaked into summer, the dish was still lovely but not quite as thrilling, the vegetable having lost some of its adolescent charm.A lot of what is on offer at Agrarian Kitchen resembles wholesome farmers\u2019 market-driven home cooking, but with slight cheffy twists. A fat pork chop, cooked just a tiny bit past juiciness, sat in a pool of dark green sauce made from lovage and anchovy. There is always one shareable large-format hunk of wood-fire-cooked meat on the menu, served with a flurry of sides. A Berkshire pork shoulder came with tongs for pulling apart its tender meat and crackling crispy skin, accompanied by boiled pink eye potatoes with bay leaf butter. It made for the kind of meal that felt communal and hearty and nourishing, almost humble. Like getting back to the land, to something that is true and pure.Despite all this, the contrast between the restaurant\u2019s feel-good aura and the surrounding landscape made it hard for me to feel particularly pure about the experience. The dark history of the Royal Derwent hospital, and the dark present of New Norfolk, give the entire operation a haunted quality.The hope, of course, is that New Norfolk will eventually match the bucolic story that Agrarian Kitchen is selling. Many see it as a beacon of hope, a use for these vast historic buildings, a lure for other like-minded businesses and a way to bring tourists and jobs to New Norfolk. (A significant percentage of the business\u2019 employees are from New Norfolk and Lachlan; many of them work at both the restaurant and the farm.)If Agrarian Kitchen represents the future of Tasmania \u2014 its potential tourist economy, its charm, the deliciousness of its food \u2014 it also hints at the problematic stories that the moneyed creative class tells itself about the value of its own consumption. Agrarian Kitchen is a lovely restaurant. It is also a bourgeois fantasy, one that trades on some dubious strengths: the sugarcoated romantic charms of rural life; our blas\u00e9 slavishness to all things artisan; and the precarious thrill of eating a $200 lunch on land that\u2019s stained by human misery.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Get Me to a Nunnery", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionThree years ago this week, I was a guest at a cloistered Catholic abbey in rural Connecticut. I spent my days in near-silence, waking before dawn for Mass, working the farm alongside nuns in full habit. When bells rang at regular intervals, all work ceased so that the nuns could chant in Latin.In the past 12 months, I\u2019ve found myself returning again and again in my mind. I long for the quiet, the natural beauty, the sense of timelessness there.At a time when the country is painfully divided, it\u2019s a comfort to cast myself back to the abbey, to the cozy guesthouse where I stayed with a handful of women from all walks of life. We bonded as we sat chatting and reading in the lamp-lit living room. We were expected to be in for the night after 7:30 prayers and to avoid the distractions of cellphones and the internet. No typing was allowed. I found myself writing in a journal by hand for the first time in years.My younger self would never have believed I was there by choice. Raised Catholic in the 1980s, I was a skeptic from the start. At age 4, when my parents explained the concept of heaven, I told them I wasn\u2019t buying it. Years later, a budding adolescent feminist, I railed against Catholicism as sexist, hypocritical, shame-obsessed. When my mother found out I was skipping confirmation class to stay home and watch \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d she invited the parish priest to dinner to talk sense into me. As he passed the potatoes, I horrified everyone by asking him why God, with all that was wrong in the world, would possibly care about birth control.I married a fellow lapsed Catholic. In him, I see certain positive traits that I attribute to a Catholic upbringing: goodness; service; a sense of moral clarity. Catholicism stays with you whether you like it or not. The Hail Mary is a muscle memory that comes to me in times of trouble. I say it reflexively when I\u2019m scared, or late, or when I hear an ambulance siren. But my feelings about the church have remained over time, only intensified by the sexual abuse crisis.And yet, seven years ago, I found myself glued to an episode of \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d about young women joining a cloister in Ann Arbor, Mich. In a world full of options, they had chosen to take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, relinquishing both their free will and their iPhones.I was reminded then of a story I had heard in my own family, about a woman who, in the 1970s, joined the cloistered Abbey of Regina Laudis. Her name is Mother Lucia. She\u2019s the sister of my aunt\u2019s best friend. For years, my aunt had been telling me that the two of us should meet, that we\u2019d really hit it off.I couldn\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d have in common with someone who had spent the past four decades in a convent. But I kept thinking about nuns, and reading about them. In 2012, as working nuns were becoming the quiet heroes of a crumbling church \u2014 advocating same-sex marriage and contraception, even as the Vatican continued to dismiss both as sinful \u2014 I wrote to Mother Lucia.She invited me to come for a parlor, a conversation held through a wooden grille. We talked for two hours. I learned that she was a lover of Shakespeare with a Ph.D. in English literature from Yale, who had first visited the abbey seeking peace, community, social justice. I liked her instantly and admired her. Before we parted ways, she invited me to return for several nights.During my stay, we followed the Benedictine motto \u201cOra et labora,\u201d pray and work. Because the nuns are meant to be silent for most of the day, they can\u2019t always communicate with visitors directly, but they find their ways, slipping guests notes after Mass. Often the plan for the particular work of the day is communicated to a guest by a tiny note slipped into her hand.When you work with the nuns, they talk. I gardened with an older nun as we discussed the fate of bees and the films of Judi Dench. I rode around on a John Deere Gator with a nun in her early 30s who wore a novice\u2019s white veil, as well as a nose ring. She wanted to join the abbey as soon as she graduated from college, but hers was a modern hindrance \u2014 a cloistered nun cannot have debt, and she had student loans to repay.The abbey\u2019s inhabitants include a former movie star, politicians, businesswomen, artists of all kinds. Some came in reaction to a moment in time that defied understanding \u2014 the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, the acquittal of the police officers who killed Amadou Diallo.Right now feels like one of those moments to me. And so I sometimes dream of throwing off the trappings of our troubled world and joining them. The fantasy is not strictly female. With each horrifying news story lately, my husband has taken to asking, \u201cIs it time for the abbey?\u201d We talk about living in the (nonexistent) caretaker\u2019s cottage, raising our son up in fresh air, far from the evils of corrupt politicians and Pornhub.It\u2019s Christmastime again, and I feel the longing most acutely now. At the abbey, even the smallest act is considered an act of devotion, so that every dish washed or loaf of bread baked takes on heightened importance. I couldn\u2019t have understood this as a kid, arguing with the parish priest. But I see it now. There is something powerful about being in the presence of faith when you yourself are doubting.Advertisement"}

What if Minnesota\u2019s former governor Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, won Mr. Franken\u2019s seat in an election next year against some lesser-known opponent? What if the seat went to Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor especially primed for the current moment, given that her sexual harassment suit against the network brought down Roger Ailes?

Had Roy Moore, with his own history, won the Alabama senate race this week, Ms. Gillibrand might have had a harder time climbing back so quickly, but as it stands a woman, Minnesota\u2019s well-liked lieutenant governor, Tina Smith, was named to replace Mr. Franken until his seat comes up for re-election. Beyond that, younger women, who have a greater disposition toward zero-tolerance policies for sexual harassment and abuse, might consider the brigade she led against the senator a reason to get behind whatever presidential ambitions she might have.How political leaders respond to accusations of sexual misconduct that come up around their colleagues in public life is bound to be a litmus test of their viability in the coming weeks and months. Ms. Gillibrand, despite the perception that she has exploited the issues of sexual harassment and abuse to her own advantage, has the moral authority to take on these subjects, given how much she has fought for the rights of assault victims in the military and on campuses. As she ascends, she might use that authority to push for due process, to ensure that those accused are not summarily expunged from civic life without proper review. Zero tolerance shouldn\u2019t mean zero chance of a fair hearing or no possibility of redemption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Puerto Rico Disaster, Hospital Ship Admitted Just 6 Patients a Day", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 For an overburdened pediatrician trying to care for a child who was in pain, needed hip surgery, and was displaced from his home in the wake of Hurricane Maria, it seemed a godsend \u2014 a modern military hospital ship sent from its berth in Virginia to help with medical care in Puerto Rico.But after days calling phone numbers that did not work and trying to navigate the admissions process for the ship, the 894-foot U.S.N.S. Comfort, Dr. Jorge Gabriel Rosado finally gave up. The boy is still awaiting surgery, which had been scheduled for the day before the storm hit more than two months ago.\u201cIt was rough because there were a lot of people that could have taken advantage of all the resources the Comfort had,\u201d Dr. Rosado said. \u201cBut there were so many steps to it. Most physicians on the island, even us, decided it was too many steps.\u201dThe Comfort\u2019s mission has ended, but it leaves behind questions about whether it was adequately used during a time of desperate medical need. The ship was prepared to support 250 hospital beds, but over its 53-day deployment, which included travel to and from the island, it admitted an average of only six patients a day, or 290 in total. An additional 1,625 people were treated aboard the ship as outpatients, all at no cost.In many ways, the Comfort\u2019s story is that of the wobbly recovery effort in Puerto Rico, in which attempts to bolster vital services have often fallen flat or become entangled in bureaucracy and politics.Following public debate over the Trump administration\u2019s initial reluctance to deploy it, the Comfort arrived two weeks into the disaster, after some of the medical urgency had abated. Its mission and capabilities were opaque to many doctors on the island. It lacked the ability to treat some important areas of need, and the complex referral procedures made little sense on a battered island with scant power or telephone service.The result, combined with the reluctance of some hospitals to lose their own patients, fell far short of what the Comfort could have provided, medical experts said.Staffed with 800 personnel and costing $180,000 a day, the ship received an average of 36 people a day as outpatients or inpatients. (A New York Times reporter was one of them, given an X-ray and medicine for an asthmatic cough). And that number swelled only after a public furor erupted over the ship\u2019s empty beds.\u201cThat\u2019s not the right question,\u201d said Capt. Kevin Buckley, the commander of the ship\u2019s medical facility, when asked how many patients were admitted. The right question, he said, was: \u201cWhat kind of patients do you have?\u201dThe patients who arrived in the early weeks \u201cwere as sick as the sickest patient in any I.C.U. where I\u2019ve worked,\u201d said Capt. Jos\u00e9 A. Acosta, the United States Third Fleet surgeon, a Puerto Rican-trained physician who served as a liaison with the Comfort.In all, 191 operations, including 25 major orthopedic cases, were performed aboard the ship. Doctors delivered two babies and diagnosed cancer in seven people. One woman had a double mastectomy, and the ship filled the oxygen tanks for dozens of patients who needed help breathing. It took in some patients from hospitals where generators had failed. It treated 98 critically ill patients, eleven of whom died.The Comfort\u2019s deployment was not the only federal health care initiative after Maria hit. Federal field hospitals, clinics and medical shelters saw more than 30,000 patients, and more than 1,400 uninsured people filled their prescriptions at pharmacies for free thanks to a federal reimbursement program.A mid-November visit to the ship found dozens of people waiting to see doctors in the tents set up outside, but inside most of the beds were empty. Only a handful of patients were on board, and most of the doctors were milling about.But those who were getting treatment appeared satisfied. Olga Quezada\u2019s knee had swollen up as if someone had pumped air into it. She had been turned away by her local hospital, and she worried about the pain, the bill and finding care.Ship doctors stuck a frighteningly long needle into her knee to drain the fluid, for free. \u201cAt first, I went to hospital in Bayam\u00f3n, and they told me to come back,\u201d Ms. Quezada said. She added, \u201cI really like the doctors here.\u201dThe Comfort is used on relief missions about every two years. It served off the coast of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991 and provided aid during the rescue of Cuban and Haitian migrants in 1994. The Comfort was deployed in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.Doctors in Puerto Rico said the Comfort could have been of enormous help directly after the storm, because at first many hospitals were damaged or shuttered.Without air-conditioning, temperatures soared dangerously, and operating rooms were closed as generators failed. Emergency room staff sewed wounds, lanced boils and examined patients by the light of cellphones and flashlights. They lacked access to CT scans. In the 10 days after the Sept. 20 storm, the number of deaths in Puerto Rico jumped to an average of 118 a day, 36 more than usual.But the ship did not leave Virginia until Sept. 29, arriving in Puerto Rico on Oct. 3.Problems quickly emerged. For starters, the Comfort lacked critical capacities, including the ability to treat premature babies and patients with common antibiotic-resistant infections, head trauma and strokes requiring neurosurgery, or heart conditions needing bypass surgery. One doctor was heard complaining about receiving so-called \u201csocial cases\u201d\u2014 patients who would be difficult to discharge because they lost their homes or lacked caregivers.When the ship docked in San Juan, residents were thrilled. \u201cPeople saw the big, white ship and came running,\u201d said Murad Raheem, a regional emergency coordinator for the Department of Health and Human Services who oversaw the federal government\u2019s health response to the disaster.The Comfort cared for 67 patients in its first two days, but wasn\u2019t set up to receive unscreened patients, Mr. Raheem said.Soon after the ship\u2019s arrival, Puerto Rican and federal officials and local medical professionals met on the Comfort. They decided the ship should move around the island to assist \u201cwherever the needs were at the time,\u201d Mr. Raheem said.But they agreed that doctors around the island would need to vet potential patient transfers through the Puerto Rico Medical Services Administration, the large and overburdened public hospital in San Juan that normally served as a referral center. Only if the hospital was full would a case be reviewed for possible referral to the Comfort.Patient flow slowed to a trickle. According to the Navy, only 137 patients were delivered over a period of three weeks.The first phone numbers provided by the public hospital did not work, and others had to be established. Callers overwhelmed the cellphone of the emergency department director after his number was posted on Facebook.In areas without working cellphones, land lines or satellite phones, and with only ambulance radios to communicate, \u201creferring patients to the Comfort was impossible,\u201d said Dr. Rene Purcell-Jordan, an emergency room physician in Yauco, in southwest Puerto Rico.Dr. Purcell and other doctors said they also had little information about what type of patients the Comfort could or would treat.Some problems were beyond the Comfort\u2019s control. Poor weather grounded helicopters. Some local hospital administrators were reluctant to give up their patients, and sometimes patients themselves wanted to stay near home, even when conditions at their hospitals appeared dangerous.Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 petitioned for changes. He said the ship\u2019s roving mission was appropriate immediately after the storm when roads were impassable, but that as time passed it made more sense to allow seven hub hospitals to refer patients directly and ultimately for patients to refer themselves.The Comfort returned to the port in Old San Juan. This time, federal Disaster Medical Assistance Teams set up in tents outside the ship, and thousands of people went for prescriptions and care. Those who needed something the tents could not provide, like surgery or X-rays, were taken on to the ship.\u201cNo one who walked up to the ship has been denied care,\u201d Captain Buckley said.Officials at the public hospital defended the Comfort\u2019s operation.\u201cThe Comfort was not a party boat,\u201d said Dr. Carlos A. G\u00f3mez, the head of the hospital\u2019s emergency room. \u201cYou need criteria to go to a hospital, whether it\u2019s at sea or on land.\u201dStill, the mission to the end remained murky. On Nov. 15 the Comfort left the dock, with a spokesman saying the ship planned to restock at sea and then resume treating patients. On Nov. 17, the ship was ordered home, for good, without warning.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Blake Farenthold, Texas Congressman Accused of Sexual Harassment, Will Not Run Again", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Blake Farenthold, a Texas Republican who settled a lurid sexual harassment claim with his former communications director for $84,000 and faced accusations from other aides that he ran a hostile workplace, announced Thursday that he will not run for re-election, saying the allegations have become \u201ca political distraction.\u201dHe is the fourth lawmaker in two weeks to announce his eventual departure from Congress amid the swirl of sexual allegations and the sixth this year.\u201cI\u2019d never served in public office before. I had no idea how to run a congressional office, and as a result I allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional,\u201d Mr. Farenthold said.\u201cIt accommodated destructive gossip, offhand comments, off-color jokes,\u201d he went on, adding, \u201cand I allowed the personal stress of the job to manifest itself in angry outbursts and too often a failure to treat people with the respect that they deserved. That was wrong.\u201dMr. Farenthold is currently the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation, and in addition to Ms. Greene, two of his former press secretaries have come forward in recent days to describe a workplace culture that was more like a college fraternity house than a congressional office.Both said Mr. Farenthold had an explosive temper, berated them repeatedly, made sexually explicit jokes and engaged in casual sexual banter that set a tone followed by his underlings.Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters that he had spoken twice with Mr. Farenthold on Wednesday, and praised the congressman for agreeing to step aside.\u201cI think he\u2019s making the right decision to retire,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere are new stories that are very disconcerting.\u201dMr. Farenthold\u2019s announcement is only the latest. Last week, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, left amid claims he sexually harassed his aides. Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, was pushed out by Mr. Ryan after an aide complained that he had offered to pay $5 million to carry his child as a surrogate. And Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, will quit over accusations of forcibly kissing one woman and of groping others during photo opportunities.Before them, Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, resigned after his mistress said he had pressured her to have an abortion, and Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, announced his retirement after lewd photos of him appeared on the internet.Mr. Farenthold, alone among them, appeared to be a survivor. He insisted he had done nothing wrong, and promised to repay the $84,000 to the Treasury. Mr. Ryan had pointedly not called for his resignation, noting that the nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics had investigated the allegations against him, and declined to forward them to the Ethics Committee.A list of men who have resigned, been fired or otherwise lost power since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.But as accusations against him piled up, it appeared untenable for him to continue.\u201cCongress must work harder to hold ourselves to a higher standard,\u201d said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThere is still more work to be done.\u201dThe former press secretaries to Mr. Farenthold \u2014 Elizabeth Peace and Michael Rekola \u2014 came forward this week with their own accounts. In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Peace said women would discuss which male lobbyists had texted them pictures of their genitals, and both men and women would talk about strip clubs and whether certain Fox News anchors had breast implants.Mr. Farenthold, first elected in 2010, has long had a whiff of notoriety about him. During his first campaign, he was photographed wearing duck-print pajamas and standing next to a scantily clad woman. In 2014, the same year that Ms. Greene sued him, he announced that he was giving up an internet domain name \u2014 one that described a sexually explicit act \u2014 that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation.In the video released Thursday, Mr. Farenthold, who turned 56 this week, said that he and his family discussed his political future over the Thanksgiving break, and that all agreed he should \u201crun for another term because there is still work to be done.\u201d He said he expected a tough primary challenge but was looking forward to the campaign.\u201cI welcomed it, so I could address some of the concerns and discuss ways I hope we could make America better for everyone,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI did not create the broken system we\u2019re working in, and I want to change it.\u201dBut the \u201crenewed focus\u201d on his personal conduct made him reconsider, he said.\u201cI understand fully that this has become a political distraction and that I would be forced to engage in a monthlong campaign for personal vindication,\u201d Mr. Farenthold added, concluding, \u201cThat\u2019s not why I came to Congress. Quite simply my constituents deserve better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Media Driving Americans Apart?", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsBut we risk giving too much weight to the newest and most frightening media technologies. If any media platform is to blame, it is not the web. It is more likely television, which is a more important source of political information. Growing polarization may also result from structural economic changes, like rising inequality, that have occurred in recent decades.Social media are likely to grow in importance over time, and none of these facts rule out its having important effects today. We should be concerned about the effects it has on its users, even if these users do not account for the bulk of overall polarization. Young voters who use social media may share polarized views with older voters who do not, and inflammatory content on social media can be picked up and amplified by more mainstream outlets. Nevertheless, we believe these and other data suggest social media are unlikely to be a main cause of rising polarization in America. We think it is important not to lose sight of other factors that may play a more important role.The social-media-as-villain narrative is gripping because it plays vividly to our fears. But that is not the only reason it holds such sway. It also lets us collectively off the hook. Why are half of Americans thinking and acting in ways the other half cannot comprehend? Why did one of those halves choose Donald Trump to be their president? Easy, the social media narrative would say: They were brainwashed. They were duped by the bad guys \u2014 fake news or Russian robots or big-data-driven algorithmically targeted psi-ops propaganda.At some fundamental level, they don\u2019t really mean what they are saying, and if only they weren\u2019t so gullible or so vulnerable they would see things our way. To find solutions we don\u2019t need to look at our own behavior, or values, or consumption patterns \u2014 we just need to beat the bad guys at the gate.As tempting as that story is, it is at best incomplete. Like many inflection points in history, this one was probably not caused by any single change, but by the fact that many important changes happened to converge at the same time. The factors that likely matter the most are those that have caused the real experiences of Americans to diverge.Levi Boxell is a Ph.D. student in economics at Stanford, where Matthew Gentzkow is an economist.

{"Headline": "For Tea Devotees, This Little Shop Is the Place to Be Right Now", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt age 15, Sophia Huang regularly drinks vintage teas that are older than she is. And she is always happy to share. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my friends and teachers here, and once they try it, they get it,\u201d she said the other day. \u201cTea can leave you feeling so happy from the inside out.\u201dFor the expo, which began in 2009 and runs this year from Dec. 9 through Jan. 7, the normally serene shop bustles as the staff trots out limited releases of Chinese and Taiwanese teas and teaware that draw drinkers from as far as California. Tastings cost as little as $5, but one-of-a-kind teapots, cups and other ceramics can sell for several thousand dollars.The costly teas and pottery are often unobtainable anywhere else in the United States, even for seasoned drinkers with connections of their own.This year, a fermented liu bao tea believed to date back to the 1890s has been brought out of storage just for the expo. A tasting is $180 a person; it requires an appointment, and a commitment that a group of three or four will devote two consecutive days to drinking and appreciating the tea\u2019s complexity as it is steeped again and again. Only with repeated brewing \u2014 as many as 60 infusions for the liu bao \u2014 can tasters fully experience the tea\u2019s flavor and texture, which change with each new pot.Mr. Su, 48, is the director of tea at Fang, which sells an impressive roster of tea and teaware year-round, and offers tastings and occasional classes. Although he has studied the subject for 25 years and traveled regularly to tea fields across China and Taiwan, he still considers himself a student of the leaf.For him, the expo is more about education and community than about profit. The shop is not a big moneymaker, he said; it is financially supported by jewelry and real estate businesses overseen by Sophia Huang\u2019s mother, Mancsi Litang Huang, the widow of Rong Fang Huang, a Taiwanese immigrant who founded the shop.What brings drinkers back year after year is the promise of exceptional teas and conversation with kindred spirits.\u201cYesterday I texted these two to tell them, \u2018The tasting event is tomorrow,\u2019\u201d said Stella Wei, of Flushing, gesturing to the other women at her table. \u201cWe have to be first in line!\u201dLike her friends, whom she met at the expo years ago, Ms. Wei, 53, grew up in Taiwan, where tea was part of nearly every social gathering at home. Now a customs broker, she brings business associates to the shop as a special treat and icebreaker. \u201cYou can\u2019t get these kinds of tea elsewhere,\u201d she said, \u201cbut sharing them with others \u2014 that\u2019s the most important part.\u201dHer friend Elizabeth Yang, also 53, added: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain to people. But when you come here, you feel honored. You\u2019re drinking with such kind and patient people who share their knowledge.\u201dMs. Yang said that each type of tea, from vegetal green tea to brassy roasted oolong, has its own character to explore. Before she immigrated to New York in 1979, her main exposure to tea was her grandfather\u2019s daily pots of jasmine. When she attended her first expo, she was grateful for the chance to revisit a touchstone of her childhood, but also delighted to learn about tea varieties she\u2019d never encountered before.Newcomers to the expo who are seeking a place to start are often steered toward Fang\u2019s floral and creamy high-mountain oolongs. More-experienced visitors head for the lao cha, aged tea, which Sophia Huang describes as \u201cearthier, with a deeper flavor and feeling.\u201dWhile some teas, like snappy green teas and early season Darjeelings, are tastiest within months of picking, others benefit from years and even decades of aging, much like vintage wine, to mellow out their rougher elements and produce thick, velvety textures in the mouth.For Ms. Wei, 30- to 50-year-old teas are the sweet spot. At this year\u2019s expo, intrepid drinkers looking to dig deeper can taste five vintages of celebrated pu-erh tea, from 2016 back to 1976.It pays to visit the expo early. On its inaugural morning, Lucy Ma, who comes from nearby Forest Hills every year, snatched up a Taiwanese teapot that had just hit the shelf. Made by the master potter Deng Ding Sou, whose renowned ceramics fill galleries on that island and in China, it\u2019s one of a few pieces from his \u201crock mineral\u201d series, made from clay unearthed during a catastrophic quake in 1999. The clay glimmers as if studded with silver and gold.Fang Gourmet Tea is the exclusive American seller for Mr. Deng, who every year ships a new selection of eagerly anticipated pieces to the expo.As she left the shop with her prize, Ms. Ma turned to the room and announced, \u201cI\u2019ll be back to see Mr. Su soon, to see what other goods I can wring out of him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Bezos to Walton, Big Investors Back Fund for \u2018Flyover\u2019 Start-Ups", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhen Steve Case, the billionaire co-founder of AOL, first met J. D. Vance, author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d the best-selling book about the industrial decline of the Midwest, Mr. Case told him, \u201cI really love the book but there is a part of it I don\u2019t love.\u201dMr. Vance listened patiently.\u201cIt helped frame the problem but it didn\u2019t really offer up a solution,\u201d Mr. Case told him.\u201cWell, it is interesting you say that,\u201d Mr. Vance replied, \u201cbecause that\u2019s really what my next chapter is going to be.\u201dBut until now, at least to some skeptics, it seemed like a do-gooder vanity project.How could these two men significantly change the dynamic among serious investors on the coasts to reorient their focus on cities, many of them suffering from the erosion of manufacturing, in the Rust Belt and elsewhere?It turns out that while they were publicly crisscrossing America, they were also privately holding meetings with some of the wealthiest individuals and families in the country, urging them to not only invest in a new fund but become partners with some of the companies that will benefit from it.On Tuesday, the fund, called Rise of the Rest, will disclose its investors, which has turned into a Who\u2019s Who of American business. Among them are:All told, it may be the greatest concentration of American wealth and power in one investment fund.The idea \u2014 far grander than the money itself, which is only $150 million to start, pocket money for most of the investors \u2014 was to assemble a dream team and create a network effect for entrepreneurs in the middle of the country to align with the biggest names in business.The fund, said Mr. Vance, was meant to construct an ecosystem like the one in Silicon Valley that will provide support and connections to entrepreneurs in small towns.\u201cPeople tend to follow their networks,\u201d said Mr. Vance, who was recruited to the effort by Mr. Case. \u201cWhile the network in Silicon Valley is obviously something that is great, it can also have an exclusionary effect that prevents investors from looking at and finding opportunities that exist outside of their networks and outside of their geographies.\u201dMr. Case and Mr. Vance hope to seed investments in start-ups in underserved cities and then bring in some of their big names to invest even more money in them. \u201cWe\u2019ll be curating interesting companies,\u201d Mr. Case said.In other words, if they discover a nascent but promising e-commerce company in Allentown, Pa., they will not only invest in it, but they might also help it establish a relationship with one of the fund\u2019s investors \u2014 Mr. Bezos, for example \u2014 who might invest even more.Mr. Case was quick to say that the new enterprise should not be considered a social impact fund, which has become the hot nomenclature for investors seeking to do good. Some consider social impact investing a sort of pseudophilanthropy because the returns aren\u2019t always the main goal.Mr. Case said he would only succeed in changing the way investors think about the rest of the country if he can produce significant financial success stories.\u201cWe\u2019re fans of impact investing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we actually didn\u2019t position this as an impact fund. First and foremost, our goal was to generate top returns.\u201dMr. Schmidt of Alphabet said he was sold on the idea from the moment he first heard about it. \u201cI felt it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a large selection of relatively undervalued businesses in the heartland between the coasts, some of which can scale quickly.\u201dAnd while it isn\u2019t an altruistic investment, he said he hoped the effort creates \u201cmore jobs, more wealth, better products and helps our society deal with a lot of jarring employment changes.\u201dOne of the great questions about American capitalism is why big investors, who are always looking for opportunities and are often willing to fly halfway around the world to find them in places like China and India, put so little effort into finding investment in the middle of the country. California, New York and Massachusetts attract 76 percent of all venture capital money, according to the National Venture Capital Association.One answer may be that the nation\u2019s top talent is drawn to the coasts, but Mr. Breyer said he has seen that changing.\u201cEntrepreneurs are now creating start-ups in lots of places,\u201d he said. \u201cThe confluence of social networking technologies and cloud services makes it easier and less costly than ever before to develop and bring new technologies to market\u201d for entrepreneurs outside of centers like Silicon Valley.One example of a company that could be a model for the fund is one that Mr. Case has already invested in: 75f in Burnsville, Minn., which works to make commercial buildings more comfortable and energy-efficient.Critics may argue that the fund is a marketing exercise for elites trying to fix a problem of their own making. And there may be some truth to that. But like most great entrepreneurs, these investors have a genuine interest in finding the next Facebook or Google, and they get excited about the prospect of discovering a needle in the start-up haystack.And they recognize that the next big idea may come from someplace totally unexpected \u2014 somewhere not on either coast or in one of the other pockets of entrepreneurship.\u201cThere\u2019s still more talent (engineers, execs) \u2014 and resources (funding), but the costs and competition for talent and housing are extreme\u201d in Silicon Valley, Mr. Doerr wrote in an email, suggesting perhaps that it may be a less attractive location than before.\u201cIn the end, don\u2019t think of \u2018the Valley\u2019 as some ZIP codes in California,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a state of mind that can be anywhere, for everyone. Increasingly, for all of the rest of us.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the city where the company 75f is based.

{"Headline": "What if You Couldn\u2019t See This Page?", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 To taste a future without net neutrality, try browsing the web in Beijing. China\u2019s internet, provided through telecom giants aligned with the Communist Party, is a digital dystopia, filtered by the vast censorship apparatus known as China\u2019s Great Firewall. Some sites load with soul-withering slowness, or not at all. Others appear instantly. Content vanishes without warning or explanation. The culprit is rarely knowable. A faulty Wi-Fi router? A neighborhood power failure? Commercial sabotage? A clampdown on political dissent? To most Chinese netizens, the reason matters little. They simply gravitate to the few sites that aren\u2019t slowed or blocked entirely: the Chinese counterparts of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But these Chinese platforms come with heavy government surveillance and censorship by corporate and party apparatchiks. For the Communist Party and its commercial allies, this is win-win, cementing respective monopolies on political markets and consumer power.The Trump administration\u2019s plan to dismantle net neutrality regulations has brought this nightmare scenario to America\u2019s digital doorstep. With the Federal Communications Commission scheduled to vote on the issue today, the threatened rollback not only imperils fair play and free speech; it will also empower foreign entities with substantial market-making power, like China\u2019s government, to meddle in American public discourse on a scale dwarfing Russia\u2019s recent cyber-chicanery. Worse, abolishing net neutrality gives American corporations the means, motive and opportunity to become accomplices in selling out our freedom of speech.As the incentives and opportunities to self-censor accumulate, content providers will gravitate to producing and promoting whatever reaches the most customers worldwide, even if that means pleasing Chinese cyber-commissars who control access to a billion of them. Content providers \u2014 companies like Facebook and LinkedIn \u2014 are not, after all, common carriers. They do not control the pipes, or carry a unique public trust in the eyes of the government. As private businesses, they are not bound by the First Amendment. Self-censorship is simply good business.For those telecom conglomerates that have current or potential business before the Chinese government, the temptation to take behind-the-scenes guidance on content \u201cmanagement\u201d as a quid pro quo for market access may prove irresistible. China already exports its cutting-edge internet censorship technologies, honed in the world\u2019s largest natural laboratory for \u201copinion guidance,\u201d to authoritarian countries around the world. These technologies are masterpieces of subtlety and sophistication, offering a world-class censorship experience amenable to consumers and commissars alike. They rarely resort to the \u201chard\u201d censorship of crude deletion, but rather give a suite of \u201csofter\u201d monitoring and management tools to steer public discourse and discourage all but the most dogged netizens from accessing undesirable content. For those who stick to domestic and approved Chinese sites, the browsing experience is speedy and seamless, the sutures where unwanted content has been excised barely visible.In the future, if the article you\u2019re reading loads slowly, or not at all, you might not know the reason.

{"Headline": "How Can I Possibly Believe That Faith Is Better Than Doubt?", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy take a leap of faith, given all that? Insisting on a little more empirical evidence before you make the leap seems pretty reasonable.The apostle Thomas clearly thought so. According to the Gospel of John, the other disciples told Thomas that they had seen the risen Lord, to which Thomas replied he wouldn\u2019t believe until he put his fingers in the nail marks in Jesus\u2019 hands and put his hand into Jesus\u2019 side.Fast-forward a week, when Thomas encounters Jesus, who tells him, \u201cPut your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\u201d Thomas does, to which Jesus replies, \u201cBecause you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u201dNot seeing and still believing is held up by Jesus as a greater thing than seeing and believing. But I\u2019m not sure I have ever fully grasped what it is about faith that makes it precious in the eyes of God. Recently, with the help of friends \u2014 pastors, theologians, authors, fellow believers \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to deepen my understanding on that subject.To start out, it\u2019s worth noting that treating Christian faith as different from proof doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s antithetical to evidence and reason. Christianity is a faith that claims to be rooted in history, not abstract philosophy. St. Paul wrote that if Jesus was not resurrected from the dead, the Christian faith is \u201cfutile\u201d and followers of Jesus are \u201cof all people most to be pitied.\u201dChristians would say, in fact, that reason is affirmed in Scripture \u2014 \u201cCome now, and let us reason together,\u201d is how the prophet Isaiah puts it \u2014 and that faith properly understood is consistent with and deepens our understanding of reality. \u201cReason purifies faith,\u201d George Weigel, my colleague at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told me. \u201cFaith without reason risks descending into superstition; reason without faith builds a world without windows, doors or skylights.\u201dBut faith itself, while not the converse of reason, is still distinct from it. If it seems like that\u2019s asking too much \u2014 if you think leaps of faith are for children rather than adults \u2014 consider this: Materialists, rationalists and atheists ultimately place their trust in certain propositions that require faith. To say that truth is only intelligible through reason is itself a statement of faith. Denying the existence of God is as much a leap of faith as asserting it. As the pastor Tim Keller told me, \u201cMost of the things we most deeply believe in \u2014 for example, human rights and human equality \u2014 are not empirically provable.\u201d\u201cThe supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason,\u201d is how Blaise Pascal put it. Something would not require faith if the proof of it was absolute. According to Philip Yancey, the author of \u201cThe Jesus I Never Knew,\u201d \u201cFaith requires the possibility of rejection, or it is not faith.\u201dPerhaps the key to understanding why faith is prized within the Christian tradition is that it involves trust that would not be needed if the existence of God were subject to a mathematical proof. What God is seeking is not our intellectual assent so much as a relationship with us. That is, after all, one of the purposes of the incarnation of God in Jesus.Every meaningful relationship \u2014 parent-child, spouse to spouse, friend to friend \u2014 involves some degree of trust. It is better and more vivifying to be the object of someone\u2019s trust rather than the last person standing after a series of logical deductions. That\u2019s true for us as individuals, and it can be true for God as well.Faith demonstrates human trust in him \u2014 and, according to James Forsyth, pastor at McLean Presbyterian Church in Virginia, which my family attends, it demonstrates that we accept God\u2019s love for us. \u201cThere is a force within love that longs to be received,\u201d he says.Craig Barnes, the president of Princeton Theological Seminary, told me, \u201cFaith is a greater blessing than proof because it gives us a relationship with Jesus. All good relationships are bound together by love. And love is always an expression of faith.\u201d He also pointed out that proofs don\u2019t necessarily inspire belief. Toward the end of his Gospel, Matthew mentions that some still doubted after they looked right at the risen Christ. (\u201cWhen they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.\u201d)Some of those who witnessed the miracles of Jesus eventually sought to kill him. And Judas, one of Jesus\u2019 original disciples, betrayed him with a kiss. So sensory experience isn\u2019t enough to compel belief and allegiance.\u201cFaith,\u201d Ms. Harder added, \u201cis tied to love in a way that logical deduction and reason are not. We are changed by what we love more than what we think.\u201dThere\u2019s one other difference between faith and reason. The latter can analyze things like quantum physics and modern cosmology. But what faith can do is to put our lives in an unfolding narrative in ways reason cannot. It gives us a role in a gripping drama, of which the Christmas story is one defining scene. It\u2019s a drama that includes sin and betrayal, redemption and grace; and ultimately it gives purpose to our lives despite the brokenness and pain we experience. This may mean nothing to you, but to people of faith, it can mean everything. If God is real, perhaps it should.It\u2019s notable that when Thomas makes his request to Jesus, he\u2019s not condemned. Rather, Jesus gives Thomas what he needed \u2014 in his case, proof \u2014 and in doing so makes it clear that Jesus is willing to meet us where we are. Some need proof, at least as a start; for others, faith alone is enough.According to Christian tradition, Thomas would eventually go on to serve as a missionary in India, where he was martyred. I imagine his faithfulness had less to do with putting his hand in the side of Jesus than what transpired within his heart. His intellectual doubts gave way to calm trust. In my experience, at least, that journey hasn\u2019t always been an easy one. For many of us, shadows of doubt coexist with faith.To emphasize faith is not to cast out doubt. In fact, it is precisely to take doubt seriously, but also to understand the doubter more completely \u2014 not just as a reasoning mind but as a full person, possessed of a divine spark that lets us see, now and then, right through the walls we have built between faith and reason.Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Korea, the Virtual Currency Boom Hits Home", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Choi Whal-soo has been through the wringer of speculative bubbles.After selling his real estate agency near Seoul, he invested in South Korean stocks and then watched them plummet in value after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. He tried to recover, continuing to play the stock market and lotteries, but lost yet more money.Last week, Mr. Choi visited the physical location of one of South Korea\u2019s many new virtual currency exchanges, with a plan to put about a quarter of his remaining $18,000 in savings into virtual currencies.\u201cI may have missed the Bitcoin boat but new boats are coming and I want to hop on those,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that some might be scams but even with those, the prices will rise at least in the middle of their life cycles so that there will be a chance to make money from trading them.\u201dAround the world, ordinary people, with no prior experience in virtual currencies, have been lured into the virtual currency markets in recent weeks by the soaring prices of Bitcoin and its competitors.In Japan, small-time speculators have swarmed to Bitcoin since the government there essentially legalized the virtual currency earlier this year and gave licenses to several exchanges.But nowhere has the public frenzy been more feverish than in South Korea. It was on South Korean exchanges that the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 last Monday, hours before traders in the United States reached the same level of exuberance.These volumes are all the more remarkable because just a year ago virtual currency markets barely existed in Korea, unlike in the United States and China, where virtual currency trading has grown over a number of years.\u201cThis can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,\u201d he said in a statement after a cabinet meeting.Mr. Lee called on the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to take a closer look. South Korean regulators have already announced a ban on so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies.But the exchanges where existing virtual currencies are traded come under essentially no regulatory oversight in South Korea, unlike in the United States and Japan.Mr. Lee said he was particularly worried about young people who have gotten caught up in the markets.\u201cThere are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multilevel marketing for frauds,\u201d he said.Virtual currencies are not the first speculative markets to take off among ordinary investors in South Korea. The country has some of the most active foreign currency markets for small-time investors, allowing people to trade between the won, dollar, euro and smaller currencies.Ha Tae-hyeong, a professor of economics at the University of Suwon, said that South Koreans have been drawn to speculative trading because of the lack of other high-yield investment options.\u201cPeople were looking for anything that would bring them higher return on investment,\u201d Mr. Ha said.Chung Gong-jin, a 16-year-old high school student, said he had been drawn to Bitcoin because it has gone up so quickly, and doesn\u2019t require the same amount of knowledge as stock investing.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to study so much to invest in Bitcoin \u2014 about the market or the economy, for example \u2014 that I need to do to invest in stocks,\u201d said Mr. Chung, who lives in a suburb of Seoul.Mr. Chung is part of a 100-person group that meets to talk about investments and attend virtual currency conferences.Even virtual currency enthusiasts in South Korea are concerned about the sudden rush into Bitcoin and Ether. They say investors are often getting in with little grasp of how virtual currencies work, like the decentralized network where all the transaction records are kept, or why they may be valuable over the long term.\u201cI do feel sorry to see so many people being shortsighted about Bitcoin, just trying to predict its price changes over short term to make quick money,\u201d said Kim Joon-young, a 28-year-old who runs a popular virtual currency Facebook group, Plan B.For now, the South Korean Bitcoin exchanges that have sprung up over the past year have done their best to stoke the excitement.Unlike in the United States and Japan, where exchanges are entirely online, a number of South Korean operations have set up store fronts where investors can come to buy in and learn more.Coinone, the second largest exchange in the country, opened a location in September in the financial district of Seoul, Yeouido, with an area for meetings, a help desk and virtual currency ATMs.One day last week, around lunch time, a group of about 35 students from Konyang University were visiting the Coinone office for an introductory class on virtual currency investing.Lee Jeong-min, a 39-year old social worker and author, was there to buy Ripple, a virtual currency that has been popular for cross-border bank transfers.Ms. Lee said she saw some of her conservative friends, including teachers and pharmacists, getting rich on Bitcoin and she didn\u2019t want to miss the next wave.\u201cI realized that I missed a bus, the Bitcoin bus, so that I can\u2019t hop on that bus anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t miss the next bus coming, can I?\u201dMs. Lee said she spent around 300,000 won, or around $275, on 900 Ripple.Mr. Choi, the 77-year-old former real estate agent, was also at Coinone, getting advice from the help desk on how to log in and invest from his home computer. He didn\u2019t trust his cellphone with the transactions.Like Ms. Lee, Mr. Choi felt it was too late to get in on Bitcoin. He is placing his big bet on the Ethereum network, and its Ether currency, which was designed to allow for a wider variety of transactions than Bitcoin.He said he knows he might lose money, but he was holding out hope.\u201cI might die tomorrow. I am an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that hope keeps people going. Without dreams, there is nothing for a man. Hoping that things would get at least a little better is important.\u201dSu-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea and Nathaniel Popper reported in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Zimbabwean Family Lingers in Limbo at Thai Airport for 2 Months", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 A family of eight from Zimbabwe, including four children, has been stuck at a Bangkok airport for most of the past two months, unwilling to return home because of political uncertainty there and unable to secure visas to a third country.Thai immigration officials said the family members had applied to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the hope of obtaining refugee status. They are being allowed to remain at the airport, rather than a detention center, while their case is considered.On Friday, the travelers were settled into a quiet corner of a large waiting area, where they occupied three sofas. Their luggage was piled on airport trolleys, and the children watched a video on a small portable device while the adults talked with reporters and airport personnel who stopped by.The Zimbabwean travelers declined to give their names, or to explain how they ended up in their predicament. They also did not say what danger they would face if they were to return to Zimbabwe.Police Col. Cherngron Rimpadee, a spokesman for Thailand\u2019s Immigration Bureau, said the family first tried to leave Thailand on Oct. 23.But they did not have a valid visa for Spain, their destination, so were not allowed to board their flight. And because they had overstayed their Thai visas by five months, they were fined and banned from re-entering the country for a year, meaning they could not leave Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport.In November, they succeeded in getting on a flight to Kiev, Ukraine, in the hope of continuing on to a third country. But on arrival in Kiev, they were denied permission to travel on. After they refused to fly to Zimbabwe, they were sent back to Bangkok.Now, unable to enter Thailand, or to board a flight bound for a country of their own choosing, they spend their time near the G departure gates, waiting for permission to leave.\u201cWe are stuck here,\u201d said one of the Zimbabwean men, who did not want to be identified and would not comment further or offer details about their situation, seemingly ill at ease with the growing attention.He also wrote that airport staff had been bringing the family food and gifts over the holidays as they remained stranded in the airport.Colonel Cherngron said it was not unusual for passengers to get stuck at an airport for a period of time. \u201cThis happens at every airport in the world, not only in Thailand,\u201d he said.Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said she was aware of the case but could not provide details because of confidentiality requirements.\u201cWe are currently exploring potential solutions,\u201d she said.Colonel Cherngron said that sending the family to a detention center was still an option.\u201cIf we feel that the U.N. process is taking too long, we might consider moving them to our center, where we have a complete child-care center,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any deadline because we know this is a complicated issue that involves different countries who also have laws and procedures.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It spends billions of dollars a year and has seen subscriptions soar, especially internationally, with the critical and popular success of shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at some of the leading streaming services.And it still has the rights to old episodes of big TV shows, including some from 21st Century Fox. The first season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d about the O. J. Simpson murder trial that was a ratings smash for FX and a big award winner? Netflix will continue to hold onto that.On the other hand, Hulu remains a relatively small business that bleeds money. The last time it disclosed the number of people who subscribe to the service (a year and a half ago) it was a relatively teeny 12 million. As a comparison, Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. And there are plenty of indications that Hulu\u2019s growth has only inched a bit in the time since.Still, Disney will assume Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu, and will now own more than 50 percent of the streaming service. Whether that means Disney can simply merge Hulu\u2019s enormous array of content into its forthcoming service is unclear. Some analysts are skeptical that NBC Universal\u2019s parent company, Comcast, will allow Disney to simply buy it out.\u201cWe see no reason why Comcast would want to enable Disney to have a more successful streaming service that hampers the legacy bundle that is vital to Comcast,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, at analyst at BTIG.Plus, even with leadership changes, Amazon sits on a mountain of cash. That has many Hollywood executives convinced that Amazon could become a real rival to Netflix if it deploys its resources in the right way.Facebook and YouTube are still looking for a signature hit.Meanwhile, there are live TV services for people who are just looking to shed an expensive cable package. Hulu and YouTube have offerings with a suite of cable channels, and so do services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Boy, His Mother and the Human Being Behind the Camera", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRADCLIFF, Ky. \u2014 A purring air-conditioner and the distant warble of a television acted as a sonata on a stifling May afternoon in 2012. Regina Hensley, 45, initiated a dance with her son, Andrew Holland, 15.\u201cO.K., let loose a little,\u201d Andrew said, quickly taking the lead. Regina sent a shake from her shoulders down to her knees and Andrew began to count.\u201cOne, two, three; one, two, three,\u201d he said, switching directions each time they reached the third step. After three strides back-and-forth across the kitchen, Regina dipped him and Andrew sent a high-pitched laugh up to the ceiling.It was one of the last easy moments I filmed before things got bad.I met Andrew and Regina earlier that year at Kosair Children\u2019s Hospital (now Norton Children\u2019s Hospital).The inspiration for the story came the summer before, while I was interning at The Minneapolis Star Tribune. Two of my colleagues at the newspaper had a sick daughter.Gracie\u2019s prognosis was certain: soon death. Like Andrew, she was awe-inspiring to witness. I remember her beyond-her-years understanding coupled with childlike wonder, hope and joy. I also remember seeing her mom and dad as I came in and out of the office from assignments and wondering every time: How are they managing all this?When I got back to journalism classes at Western Kentucky University that spring I came across a story in a local newspaper about a young boy who was battling a rare form of cancer called Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. The town had named him \u201cMayor for a Day.\u201d I reached out through Facebook Messenger: \u201cI know this might seem strange but \u2026\u201dHe was 14 and just off a major scare in which an infection had raged against his chemo-weakened immune system. You would never have known it.Regina was a recovering alcoholic who never seemed fully settled.\u201cYou know how they say God won\u2019t put more on you than you can handle?\u201d she said one day. \u201cWell God needs to back off of me.\u201dAlways pivoting between Andrew and other patients in the hospital, Regina was a natural caretaker. She operated daily with the nervous energy of a person who, if she stopped treading water, would sink.At home she multitasked: washing dishes, vacuuming and cleaning the bathrooms while waiting for the washing machine to finish. She juggled a variety of odd jobs: cleaning, cooking, cashiering, anything she could do to make money.There was no time to focus on sobriety, but also no time to relapse. She was wedged between a precarious rock and a hard spot that somehow kept her upright.Andrew was in his own teenage world, making plans for the future \u2014 obsessing over school, which college he would go to and which new girl he was crushing on. Everything about him was magnetic \u2014 his sarcasm, his bubbling-up laughter like a geyser ready to explode at the most inappropriate times, his spontaneous arrhythmic dancing.He brought the weird out in you, too. And whatever he chose to feel, you soaked it up.Months went by when he was in and out of the hospital constantly. His identity got wrapped up in cancer in a way that makes childhood illness worse than it already is.He\u2019d lost a lot of friends when he got the diagnosis. He assumed they didn\u2019t know what to say or that their parents were spooked by the thought of a sick kid.\u201cI get it,\u201d he would say with a purse-lipped shrug.Over time, he made new friends via the hospital and found a network of support. He studied Japanese, played basketball and flirted shamelessly with every female nurse he came into contact with at Kosair.He could crack the surly, the serious, the exhausted.That semester, I spent nearly all my free time either with Andrew or with footage of him, pulling late nights alone in the lab trying to figure out how his narrative went together. I was also trying to figure out how to be a journalist.We celebrated his 15th birthday and had a simultaneous end of chemo party. Regina made a speech and thanked everyone for coming to celebrate her son and the \u201cend to a long journey.\u201dFor a few weeks, Andrew and Regina returned to normal life. There were no more treatments or hospitals. They waited for follow-up scans to see if Andrew was in remission.I finished my project at school, and my relationship with the family transformed from documentation into friendship. Drew was better and the short doc about them had a hopeful, inspired ending.We still spent a lot of time together \u2014 shooting up Coke cans in the backyard with BB guns, going to the movies and indulging in junk food when his appetite started coming back. We talked about college and what he wanted to become. He got a camera and a bootleg version of Adobe After Effects and started making short films. His hair regrew in a dirty blond swath over his pale skull. He still wanted to pursue his \u201cbucket list\u201d full force even though he was going to \u201clive a normal life now.\u201dA few weeks later, scans showed the tumors had taken root in his spine. The cancer was back more aggressively than before.That May, after Regina and Andrew glided across the linoleum in a moment of joy, I graduated and prepared to move to New York for a summer internship at The Times. The day I went to Drew\u2019s house to say goodbye was the first time I saw him cry. We both broke down and I promised him I\u2019d still be there.Alongside treatments, Drew got a job, went back to school and eventually fell in love. She was a smart, kind, generous girl who was in and out of the hospital, too, battling Lupus.When it ended, he suffered a more gut-wrenching pain from heartbreak than anything the cancer had ever inflicted. I worried about him most on those nights when he called crying about that break up. It was such a regular teenage experience but every bit as serious to him as the cancer.As a mother of a sick child, Regina faced brutal scrutiny from people for her erratic behavior. She received criticism for almost anything that took up her time that wasn\u2019t Drew. People made comments when she got a boyfriend, whenever she started working a new job and even when she took too many smoke breaks.Watching Regina stand firm in the midst of it all gave me a deep respect for her. It also helped me to empathize with my own mom, who raised my sister and me alone, and shed light on the painstaking work of maintaining selfhood when all your time is spent on another person.I started shooting again, forging an agreement with Drew that I\u2019d document only as much as he wanted me to. But now I wasn\u2019t just a student or a friend. I was a professional journalist. And figuring out the new dynamic was a struggle.I can say firsthand that when you don\u2019t focus, the story you\u2019re trying to convey suffers. But the access that a true emotional connection and foundation of trust affords you is worth more than any amount of camera expertise.There were moments with Drew when I felt the relentless pull to just be a human. When people who barely knew him were commenting on social media, implying that he was about to die while he was very much still alive, terrified and reading those comments in horror, it was a struggle not to intervene.Often I just wanted to hang out with him in the living room and play video games instead of filming the conversation happening in the next room. But to do that would mean missing Regina telling the hospital nurse that she felt on the verge of relapsing.By 2014, tumors were growing in Drew\u2019s brain. Regina knew the severity and dealt with it the best way she could. She didn\u2019t tell Drew that there was a chance he could lose his motor functions, his ability to talk and even his vision before he died. When he turned 18 and the doctors had to tell him, he didn\u2019t believe it anyway. He begged for every treatment available: the painful and the experimental.He was a man now. His appointments and hospital stays were moved out of the children\u2019s hospital, away from the nurses and friends with whom he was familiar.In 2015, a few months after his birthday, Drew was at the theater (one of his favorite places) when violent pain surged through his body and erupted into screams. By the time they got him to the hospital he was pleading, \u201cJust kill me, just kill me.\u201d They sedated him with pain medicine that would be pumped through his frail body until the day he died.I flew down to Kentucky to be with him and Regina, and to document the monthslong hospice dying process. Regina slept on the floor beside him and, with the help of some miraculously supportive friends, administered his pain medication every couple of hours.Though I had to leave to film other projects, Drew was never far from my mind. Regina called when it was time for me to come back to say goodbye.Inside his room, Drew was lying on the bed unconscious, sedated with an unbelievable amount of pain medicine. Someone at the hospital had drawn angel wings on his frail back.His breathing set a labored pace of air exchange for the whole room. It was shallow and sounded painful, even as he slept. In order to hug him you had to lie in the bed beside him, so I did. I told him how much I loved him and cried more than I wish I had in a room full of devastated friends and family who were all fighting to keep it together.My friend Danny Guy, who helped with the last days of filming, took this picture of us with his cellphone and sent it to me later that night.At first I hoped no one would ever see it. The human side of me had taken over in that moment, and that was at odds with my career. It felt terrible to wrestle with ethical and professional questions when all I wanted to do was be with my friend.It has taken these two and a half years for me to process Drew\u2019s death.Regina knew throughout Drew\u2019s illness that she was bound to fall apart when he died. In the years since, she has struggled to keep the promises she made to him.She promised him she wouldn\u2019t relapse, but she did. She also promised she wouldn\u2019t try to kill herself, but she did. After several alcohol-related arrests, she was incarcerated for six months and then released. A few months ago, she was arrested again for driving with a suspended license.Last month, she called me from the jail and sounded better than she had in years. She said a part of her had wanted to be incarcerated because it gives her a sense of purpose \u2014 to help the young women at the jail try to turn their lives around. It also forces her to stay sober.When her boyfriend, Sam, visited her recently she asked him to wear the locket with Drew\u2019s picture in it that she normally wears. \u201cAll the girls wanted to see what he looked like,\u201d Sam said.On the phone, Regina uttered a phrase she must have said to me a hundred times over the past five years: \u201cIt\u2019s just like Andrew always told me \u2014 you have to look for something positive out of everything negative.\u201dAndrew and Regina\u2019s story turned out so differently from the triumphant one about facing death with optimism and humor that I thought I was filming. It wasn\u2019t even a beautiful, inspired slipping away. Like reality, at the end the film is profoundly sad and very hard to watch.But in spite of the inevitable outcome, Drew showed that it\u2019s worth living life like he did for as long as you can \u2014 with stubborn, na\u00efve optimism that the odds remain in your favor.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ajit Pai Nears His Biggest Win With Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Small tech companies, consumer groups and many celebrities have been up in arms for weeks about a proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle landmark rules that guarantee an open internet.But in one speech, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the agency, called the complaints \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201chot air.\u201d In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding of companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies.\u201cHow do you choose,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween a longtime love and a newfound crush?\u201dThe agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners.Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai\u2019s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers.\u201cAjit Pai has the potential to be one of most consequential commissioners in the agency\u2019s history,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, who is an expert in telecom policy and who supports Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.Even Mr. Pai\u2019s detractors acknowledge that Mr. Pai has been efficient at moving his agenda. Mark Cooper, a staff member of Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Pai has far outpaced his recent predecessors, even if Mr. Cooper does not agree with those efforts.\u201cIn every way,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201chis decisions are bad for consumers and good for big corporations.\u201dMr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement, the F.C.C. said that he \u201chas been focused on making the agency more transparent, closing the digital divide, and updating the Commission\u2019s rules to reflect the modern communications marketplace.\u201dThe agency added that \u201cthe F.C.C. has modernized its rules across a wide range of areas to encourage more competition and innovation.\u201dMr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory fervor began well before the presidential election and his nomination by President Trump.The child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai was lauded by Republicans and Democrats when he was appointed in 2011 by President Obama to the F.C.C. Lawmakers and public interest groups hoped the young nominee would bring a greater appreciation for how communications was shifting online than past commissioners.But for five years as a minority member of the F.C.C., Mr. Pai consistently voted against regulations such as those limiting business broadband prices and a broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. He complained that the agency\u2019s Democratic leaders, including Tom Wheeler, were too heavy-handed with companies.The biggest offense, in his opinion, were the 2015 net neutrality rules, which included the declaration that broadband would be subject to more utility-style rules. He said the regulations would burden the fast-growing high-speed internet market. In dissenting comments during the debate over the rules, he echoed the arguments of telecom companies that the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules made it hard for telecoms to expand their networks, leading to less innovation in business plans and would eventually harm the economy.He also accused the White House of presidential interference in the activities of the F.C.C., an independent agency. Mr. Pai said that the agency had taken its direction only after President Obama posted a video in favor of the net neutrality rules.Mr. Pai\u2019s consistent opposition attracted supporters from free-market think tanks and conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who recently praised the proposal to scrap net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media and was praised in the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.Supporters of net neutrality argue that telecom companies want to become the gatekeepers of the internet, deciding whether sites have access to fast or slow connections. But Mr. Pai has responded by saying the bigger threat is from the big tech companies. Google, Twitter and Facebook, he argues, can deprive consumers of free expression.He says Twitter, for example, sometimes wrongly suspends users just because they do not share the same views as the company.\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d Mr. Pai said last month at an event sponsored by the R Street Institute, a free markets think tank. \u201cWhen it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When the Richest U.S. Cities Turn to the World?", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy has changed, so have the relationships between places, to the disadvantage of smaller cities and rural areas.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Well before anyone thought of this place as the center of the tech economy, the Bay Area built ships. And it did so with the help of many parts of the country.A changing economy has been good to the region, and to a number of other predominantly coastal metros like New York, Boston and Seattle. But economists and geographers are now questioning what the nature of their success means for the rest of the country. What happens to America\u2019s manufacturing heartland when Silicon Valley turns to China? Where do former mill and mining towns fit in when big cities shift to digital work? How does upstate New York benefit when New York City increases business with Tokyo?The answers have social and political implications at a time when broad swaths of the country feel alienated from and resentful of \u201celite\u201d cities that appear from a distance to have gone unscathed by the forces hollowing out smaller communities. To the extent that many Americans believe they\u2019re disconnected from the prosperity in these major metros \u2014 even as they use the apps and services created there \u2014 perhaps they\u2019re right. Such a picture, Ms. Sassen said, \u201cbreaks a past pattern where a range of smaller, more provincial cities actually fed the rise of the major cities.\u201d Now major cities are feeding one another, and doing so across the globe.\u201cThese links have been broken,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. Of course, some remain. And antipathy toward prosperous big cities is not a new theme in history. \u201cBut this is different: This is deeper,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. \u201cIt is also, as far as we can see, permanent, simply because the economy that supported the earlier relationships has gone away and shows no sign of coming back.\u201dThe Rise of Global Cities\u201cBig changes have been happening over the last 30 years,\u201d Ms. Giannone said. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually seeing the impact of them.\u201dThose changes have come from multiple directions \u2014 from globalization, from computerization, from the shift in the United States away from manufacturing toward a knowledge and service economy. These trends have buffeted many smaller cities and nonurban areas. The uncomfortable political truth is that they\u2019ve also benefited places like San Francisco and New York.For all of the talk of how globalization has cost America manufacturing jobs, it has created American jobs, too \u2014 but the high-paying ones have tended to go to such cities.Ms. Sassen argues that a global economy has created new kinds of needs for companies: accountants specializing in Asian tax law, lawyers expert in European Union regulation, marketers who understand Latin America. Global cities must connect to other global cities to tap these resources, which have become more valuable to them than lumber and steel.Inventors in these global cities are also increasingly connecting to one another. Using the addresses of patent co-inventors, Mr. Mudambi has traced a steep rise starting in the early 1990s of global connections from a few American metro areas, which are today among the most prosperous in the country.Inventing \u2018New Stuff\u2019 Before Anyone Can Catch UpBut these kinds of ties aren\u2019t truly spreading the Bay Area\u2019s prosperity. Server farms don\u2019t create mass middle-class employment. Using Google isn\u2019t the same as having a hand in engineering it.To put it more harshly, when global cities need other communities today, Ms. Sassen said, it\u2019s often to extract value out of them. New York bankers need Middle America\u2019s mortgages to construct securities. San Francisco start-ups need idle cars everywhere to amass billion-dollar valuations. Online retail giants need cheap land for their warehouses. The rest of the country may receive the innovations that flow out of global cities, and the benefits to consumers are real. \u201cBut by the time that\u2019s done, the cities have already invented something new and made themselves richer again,\u201d Mr. Storper said. \u201cBefore anywhere else can catch up, San Francisco has already leapt ahead again with new stuff they\u2019ve invented.\u201d\u201cThe Torontos, Ottawas and Waterloos in countries like Canada and the U.S., they will link with Shenzhen in China, they will link with Munich and Stockholm in Europe,\u201d Mr. Bathelt said. \u201cAnd other places will be kind of left out.\u201dIn the international network that emerges, global cities stand out. Other places connect to the global economy by going through them.An earlier version of this article misstated a type of ship that was assembled in the Bay Area during World War II. Military ships were built there during that period, but battleships were not among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Winklevoss Twins Found Vindication in a Bitcoin Fortune", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Winklevoss twins have carved an unorthodox path toward fame in the American business world.They went to Harvard University and then on to the Olympics as rowers. Along the way, they fought a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the ownership of Facebook. In the Oscar-nominated movie \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d they were portrayed as uptight gentry, outwitted by Mr. Zuckerberg, the brilliant, budding tech mogul.More than a few people in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street saw the towering twins as the na\u00efve \u2014 if chiseled \u2014 faces of the latest tulip bulb mania. Many still do.But the soaring value of Bitcoin in recent months is giving the brothers a moment of vindication, and quite a bit more than that: Their Bitcoin stockpile was worth around $1.3 billion on Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019ve turned that laughter and ridicule into oxygen and wind at our back,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said in an interview last week.\u201cWe still think it is probably one of the best investments in the world and will be for the decades to come,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not, we\u2019d rather live with disappointment than regret.\u201dThey have collected an additional $350 million or so of other virtual currencies, most of it in the Bitcoin alternative called Ethereum. The brothers are also majority owners of the virtual currency exchange they founded, Gemini, which most likely takes their joint holdings to a value well over $2 billion, or enough to make each of them a billionaire.They have sold almost none of their original holdings. While they both have apartments in downtown Manhattan, they say they live relatively spartan lives with few luxuries. Cameron drives an old S.U.V.; Tyler doesn\u2019t have a car at all.The Winklevoss twins\u2019 financial rise began during their settlement with Mr. Zuckerberg in 2008. Their lawyers urged them to take the $45 million (after lawyers\u2019 fees) in cash. But they wanted to be paid in shares of Facebook.\u201cThe lawyers thought we were crazy,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss said last week. \u201cWe thought they were crazy for taking cash.\u201dBy the time Facebook went public in 2012, their stock was worth around $300 million, their rowing careers were over, and they were looking for something new.When they began buying Bitcoin in late 2012, the price of an individual coin was below $10. Few people in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street had publicly expressed interest in the virtual currency.Over a few months, the brothers bought 1 percent of all the outstanding Bitcoin at the time \u2014 some 120,000 tokens. As they did, the price soared, making their Bitcoin portfolio worth around $11 million by the time they went public with it in April 2013.Their buying spree was mocked at the time, and a few of their early decisions fueled that derision. They also invested in Bitinstant, one of the first companies to trade Bitcoins online. Bitinstant\u2019s executives, in fact, had tutored the brothers in the basics of Bitcoin.The chief executive of Bitinstant, Charlie Shrem, was arrested in 2014, accused of helping to supply Bitcoins to users of online drug markets. Mr. Shrem pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was sentenced to a year in jail. The Winklevosses were never implicated in the wrongdoing, which happened before they became investors.On top of all that, until last year the price of Bitcoin was sliding and the virtual currency concept was looking wobbly. But the Winklevosses, who once bet that years of punishing rowing practices would take them to the Olympics, held their ground.\u201cWe are very comfortable in very high-risk environments with absolutely no guarantee of success,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean existing in that environment for days, weeks or months. I mean year after year.\u201dEvery Bitcoin sits in an address that can be accessed only with the corresponding password, or private key. The problem with this system is that anyone who gets hold of a private key can easily take the Bitcoin. And unlike money taken from a bank account, stolen Bitcoin are essentially impossible to retrieve. A number of virtual currency exchanges and wallets have collectively lost billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin to thieves.The Winklevosses came up with an elaborate system to store and secure their own private keys. They cut up printouts of their private keys into pieces and then distributed them in envelopes to safe deposit boxes around the country, so if one envelope were stolen the thief would not have the entire key.With Gemini, they have created a high-tech version of this process to hold customer money. Getting into the company\u2019s wallets requires multiple signatures from cryptographically sealed devices that were never linked to the internet.Gemini got a license from New York State regulators that allows them to hold Bitcoins for regulated banks and asset managers \u2014 something essentially no other virtual currency companies can do. That has turned Gemini into one of the most trusted destinations for sophisticated investors.\u201cGemini is an underappreciated exchange, one of the few exchanges I trust as a custodian,\u201d said Ari Paul, a managing partner at the virtual currency hedge fund BlockTower Capital.Gemini is now expanding from its old 5,000-square-foot offices to new, 35,000-square-foot facilities in Midtown Manhattan.This doesn\u2019t mean Gemini or the Winklevosses have ironed out all the kinks. Like many other exchanges, Gemini has struggled to stay online in the deluge of new customers in recent weeks.These growing pains are part of the reason the brothers say they are holding on to their Bitcoin. They believe virtual currencies are still a long way from real mainstream adoption.They said they might look at selling when the value of all the Bitcoin in circulation approaches the value of all gold in the world \u2014 some $7 trillion or $8 trillion compared with the $310 billion value of all Bitcoin on Tuesday \u2014 given that they think Bitcoin is set to replace gold as a rare commodity.

Others, perhaps more sympathetic to the plight of the athletes, said that Russians should compete whether they carried the flag or not.Most Muscovites hurrying through a pelting snowstorm said they considered the ban yet another politicized decision meant to punish Russia.\u201cIn their place I would not go to the Olympics,\u201d said Nadezhda Lazereva, a middle-aged women clutching shopping bags and burying her head inside a large, furry hood. \u201cIt is a political decision, 100 percent.\u201dMaria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, struck a common theme with a post on her Facebook page saying there was a constant onslaught from the West aimed at destroying Russia \u2014 world wars, the collapse of the Soviet Union and, lately, economic sanctions.\u201cThey are always trying to put us down in everything \u2014 our way of life, our culture, our history, and now sport as well,\u201d she wrote.State television, which often receives Kremlin guidelines for its reporting, was notably muted, even conciliatory, even before Mr. Putin had spoken. It noted that the committee had acknowledged that Russia has tried to improve matters; that the country could appeal the decision; and that the entire affair might turn out fine. There was a marked lack of the usual jingoism, although one main state broadcaster announced within minutes of the ban that it would not show the Games.In Moscow, Vladimir Yakovchuk, a man in his 50s in a red jacket and walking down the street with his wife, groused that Russian athletes were being singled out for punishment while doping was clearly an international problem. He also hated the idea of competing under the Olympic flag.\u201cIt will be humiliating!\u201d he said in Russian. \u201cThey\u2019ll be like refugees.\u201dBut an occasional voice did mention the cause of the ban and suggest that Russia address the doping problem.\u201cIt seems like a fair decision \u2014 there are problems in our sports with doping,\u201d said Nikolai Lorkin, a young man with short hair and trendy eyeglasses, who blamed the Ministry of Sport in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do something on such a large scale without government support.\u201dNevertheless, the athletes should go ahead and compete under a neutral flag, he said. \u201cThis opportunity should not be taken away.\u201dThose athletes who were expected to be allowed to compete in the Games will convene on Dec. 12 to decide whether to attend, Mikhail Degtyarev, the head of the Russian Parliament\u2019s culture and sports committee, told reporters.The athletes themselves seemed divided. Some announced that they wanted to compete. Others demurred, especially in the face of earlier calls to label any who competed \u201ctraitors\u201d and to strip them of their citizenship.Various famous Russian sports figures also weighed in.To make it to the Olympics, not to mention fighting your way to the medal podium, required enduring \u201ca huge, backbreaking path,\u201d she wrote.\u201cMany athletes have already proven that they are the best on the planet, and not to give them the opportunity to win an Olympic medal, to get what they have sought their entire lives, is tantamount to murder.\u201dMr. Putin, prone to ascribing all the ills that befall Russia as the product of an American-led plot rather than the result of any domestic, Kremlin-lead chicanery, had also described the Olympics scandal as a possible attempt to tarnish his campaign for re-election in the presidential vote in March.\u201cWhat concerns me?\u201d he said during a factory tour last month. \u201cWhen will the Olympics take place? February, isn\u2019t it? And when is the presidential election? March.

{"Headline": "Top New York Restaurants of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "Advertisement\nThe trouble is that my weekly column is far from a scientific survey. And my year-end list is boxed in by self-imposed rules. (Restaurants that opened late in 2016 but got reviewed this year were eligible, while very new places that I haven\u2019t written about yet weren\u2019t.) So any patterns I might discern\u00a0are unlikely to have statistical significance.Still, I look for meaning. Does it say anything, for instance, that women are the chefs at four of the 10 new restaurants I\u2019m most excited about?This is why peering into the crystal ball makes me cross-eyed. What I do know is that the best restaurants I reviewed this year, ranked below in order of my enthusiasm for them, are an interesting and diverse crop, with something for adventure-seekers and traditionalists, chile-heads and more cautious palates. Best of all, there are a lot of fresh voices in this list. I\u2019ll give up on prognostication now; it\u2019s time instead for celebration.New York hardly suffers from a scarcity of good mapo tofu and Chongqing chicken. But the depth, complexity and finesse of the cooking at Guan Fu stand out. It\u2019s probably the most cheffy Sichuan place in town, although that claim would be easier to support if Guan Fu\u2019s owners didn\u2019t refuse to name the chef in question. Whoever is in charge has some skills. The boiled fish with pickled vegetables, the \u201chomemade\u201d roasted fish, and the mapo tofu hold your attention with layer after layer of flavor, and only some of those layers come from chiles. Capsaicin freaks will want to test their strength against the cuttlefish in a charred green chile sauce that only looks harmless. The service, while not quite seamless, is gracious and solicitous, and the d\u00e9cor \u2014 wood paneling, gilded ceilings, padded seats wide enough for two \u2014 point to the new money trickling into Flushing.\u00a0Occasionally I suspect that I and everyone else involved in the local restaurant scene have lost our minds. The next time that feeling takes hold, I\u2019ll go to King. Everything there makes sense. The cocktails are straightforward little stress-reducers, just complicated enough to get your attention. The little square dining room looks exactly like a place to eat. The chefs, Clare de Boer and Jess Shadbolt, make a compelling case for bringing back the kind of refined-rustic seasonal cooking drawn from southern France and northern Italy that many young chefs have turned their backs on. Their cooking is a marvel of attentiveness and balance.Victoria Blamey lasted just over a year as chef, but by the time she left early this month she had established herself as a chef worth following. And she did it at Chumley\u2019s, the revivified speakeasy where just about everybody drank at one time or another in the past, and where just about nobody remembered eating. Ms. Blamey cooked tavern food never before seen in any tavern on this planet, like a double cheeseburger basted in bone marrow, or a warm pretzel and trout roe with onion dip so well-made it seemed like a hallucination. And then there were uncategorizable inventions like the Dungeness crab potpie, loosely inspired by an abalone dish from Chile, where Ms. Blamey grew up. The interior was brand new, its nostalgia carefully stage-managed and somewhat cloying, but with food like that and a cocktail or two, it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0Raised in Seoul, Junghyun Park has a knack for drawing out Korean cuisine\u2019s less extroverted flavors and giving them a little twist. Sea-bass tartare might appear under a soft green layer of kiwi dressed with pickled garlic and fresh mint; coins of octopus dotted with parsley oil may be surrounded by a ring of chopped kimchi and chorizo. Three dishes along those lines plus a bowl of rice will cost $39, not at all bad for such original cooking. Mr. Park\u2019s wife, Ellia, oversees the dining room, setting a gracious and unfussy tone that puts you in the mood to relax and explore.\u00a0One dish, a dry curry from southern Thailand in which chiles are permanently fused with beef, is marked \u201cbrutally spicy\u201d on the menu. Another, a northern Thai duck larb, isn\u2019t, but should be. The rest of the food at Ugly Baby is more forgiving, but none of it is compromising: the chef, Sirichai Sreparplarn, is intent on giving Brooklyn an accurate taste of his native country\u2019s cooking. Servers aren\u2019t always reliable guides to what\u2019s hot and what\u2019s not. The best strategy is to order as much as possible, then go on a tour of the table.\u00a0Produced by Mark JosephsonOur critic counts down his favorites among the new places he reviewed this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond the Drag Event Horizon", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFilthy scary alien monster cyborg goth drag is in the club.In six-inch platform stiletto boots, corset and Elizabethan collar, a tall and thin figure towered over the crowd like an alien monarch.The music began \u2014 R\u00f6yksopp and Robyn\u2019s dark synth ballad \u201cMonument\u201d \u2014 and the figure began to move long sleeves of pink fabric, folded into teardrop-shaped cavities, as if puppeteered, her gestures alternating between robotic and languid. As she raised her head, her face revealed pure black eyes, twice the size of a normal human\u2019s, that extended down her cheeks and pointed toward a buglike mouth. It was 2 a.m. in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. The beat dropped \u2014 \u201cMake a cast of my body, pull back out so that I can see\u201d \u2014 and she pulled away the mask that was her face. Beneath the mask? Identically inhuman features. Some gasped, others cheered. The performance bore no sign of drag\u2019s defining camp. It was somber, with no touch of melodrama. But it was undeniably drag: weird and apocalyptic, drag as seen through a cracked mirror. The performer, who goes by the stage name Hungry (and who prefers female pronouns when referring to her drag persona), is the creation of a 24-year-old Berliner, Johannes Jaruraak. Over the past year, Hungry\u2019s fame has grown, from a modest social media presence and devoted local followings in Berlin and London to international performances, high-profile editorial makeup assignments and 171,000 Instagram followers. She is known for looks that showcase a manipulated anatomy: dropped eyes, foreshortened noses, lips airbrushed to appear ephemeral. A designer with couture experience, Mr. Jaruraak sews each constricting costume himself. On the October Saturday that she performed in Gowanus, Hungry wore two looks. She arrived in a sea-punk blue construction complete with moth-shaped fabric nose piece and fitted cap, and changed into a pale peach shell for her performance.Hungry wasn\u2019t the only attendee whose look invoked the post-human. Be Cute, a monthly drag night hosted by the Brooklyn-based queen Matty Mendoza, known as Horrorchata, bills itself as \u201ca Dance Party for Homos and Aliens from Outer Space that like to shake it on the dance floor.\u201d Amid the crowd, a lethal-looking goth kept company with a queen wearing angular makeup who defined her look as \u201cdarkness in a dream that you don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d Others wore arachnid-looking headpieces or unnaturally hued contact lenses.Horrorchata, who is a founder of Bushwig, an annual alternative drag festival, said: \u201cI would say in the last three years, a lot of people are going toward the creative side of drag. It used to be all about glamour and pageant and stuff like that, and now it\u2019s like, it\u2019s cool to be punk rock.\u201d Ryan Burke, a New York-based photographer and \u201clook queen\u201d (he doesn\u2019t perform, and defines himself as a self-portrait artist rather than a drag performer), spearheaded the style in the United States around 2010, when he began to experiment with paper cutouts to exaggerate his eyebrows and lips. He\u2019d document his own looks, and those put together by his friends, religiously. \u201cInstagram wasn\u2019t anything,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cBut I started putting them on Facebook first, and it became a whole thing.\u201d\u201cAfter a year or two, people had been trying different things that I had been doing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cAll of these new club kids started popping up as all kinds of different alien-looking things.\u201d Though Mr. Burke grew up watching \u201cStar Wars\u201d and liking sci-fi, he arrived at his unique manner of distortion because he had little reference for drag. \u201cI had no background in what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know makeup, so I had to glue stuff on a lot,\u201d he said. He has since learned makeup. He has 130,000 Instagram followers and a second career as an editorial makeup artist. Since 2010, he has garnered fans and imitators, especially in Europe, where his science-fictional stripe of drag is particularly popular. Other influential drag artists who work in parallel styles include Sad Salvia, a Britain-based artist with 102,000 Instagram followers, whose minimalist looks feature an extended lip and subtle horns, and Davide Zingarelli, known as DShock, whose faces are highly bejeweled and pierced (28,000 followers.) The Parisian D.I.Y. design duo Fecal Matter, while not explicitly drag performers, work in an analogous style. What unites these artists is not only the shock value of their look, or their sizable roles as social media influencers in the drag scene, but that they represent a new moment in alternative drag, and express a gravely beautiful vision of what it means to be queer. The look that Hungry had termed \u201cdistorted drag\u201d is outside any number of binaries: gender, culture and human as opposed to machine, animal or alien. The looks are somber but not sober. They invoke a sense of elegantly constrained chaos, a descent into dream logic. Their style is suited to the end of the world, or else the beginning of a new one. Joe E. Jeffreys, a drag historian and videographer who teaches a course on drag performance history at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, traces the look\u2019s history straight to Leigh Bowery and the club kids of the 1980s, and to East Village drag performers like Flloyd. Performers including Hungry have taken that thread and \u201celevated it, burnished it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think society is coming around to the idea that it\u2019s not a gender binary, that it is not one or the other, that it can be anything in between,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even necessarily have to be all human, and that technology isn\u2019t necessarily the other alternative \u2014 that it can be species and creatures that we haven\u2019t even fantasized before.\u201dHungry said, \u201cWith the gender aspect of it, it\u2019s not as bound to anything anymore. It is very free. It is now just about the expression of gender without needing to specify what you identify as.\u201d In performance, Hungry didn\u2019t connote man or woman, or even human. \u201cI don\u2019t see many boundaries anymore,\u201d Hungry said. \u201cI have a lot of friends, especially in London, who are female identifying and who do drag. They do it well, they perform well. It has the same value.\u201d As she moved, she appeared to exiting an invisible cocoon. Her \u201creveal\u201d \u2014 still a trope in drag \u2014 was less a revelation than an admission that whoever Hungry is, and whatever the myth of Hungry means, she is not skin deep. Her look isn\u2019t meant to imitate something foisted on her by the indecencies of society. Hungry\u2019s distorted drag is interested in the deep wells of the self, a dream sequence that expresses the alien within.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a drag historian. He is Joe E. Jeffreys, not Jeffries.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The F.C.C. Wants to Let Telecoms Cash In on the Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission wants to let Comcast, Verizon and other broadband companies turn the internet into a latter-day version of cable TV, in which they decide what customers can watch and how much they pay for that content.Net neutrality prevents those companies from having companies like Amazon pay a fee to get their content delivered more quickly than their rivals\u2019, and from having the firms throttle other services and websites, even blocking customer access to, say, Netflix or an online newspaper.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, telecom companies would effectively be allowed to sell you a basic internet plan that might include only limited access to Google and email. For Facebook and Twitter you might need a slightly more expensive deluxe plan. The premium plan might include access to Netflix and Amazon. Oh, and by the way, media businesses eager to gain more users could pay broadband companies to be included in their enhanced basic or deluxe plans.That might sound like a far-fetched scenario. But there is reason to fear that some version of that awful vision could become a reality, because most Americans have just one or two choices for broadband access at home. People have access to four national wireless companies, but those connections tend to be slower and less useful for data-intensive applications than wired service provided by cable and telephone companies.Instead of making sure that broadband companies can\u2019t take advantage of their gatekeeping power over the internet, Mr. Pai wants to let them do whatever they want. All they would be required to do is be \u201ctransparent\u201d about what they are doing. In other words, they could simply tell customers what to expect in endless contracts filled with legalese and printed in tiny type. Mr. Pai further argues that the Federal Trade Commission would then make sure that companies were living up to their promises, essentially abdicating any responsibility the Federal Communications Commission has for the most important communications system in the country.Broadband companies are delighted by Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, which the three-vote Republican majority on the commission is expected to adopt at its meeting on Dec. 14. And they are quick to say that customers have nothing to fear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acting Studios Are Struggling. Does It Matter?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "Schools that trained actors like Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange are facing rising costs, competition from colleges, and shifting cultural attitudes.Supported byThe three friends would all go on to win Academy Awards, helping to establish the classic blueprint for pursuing an acting career in New York: Move here, hone your craft at a gritty acting studio, do a handful of plays, conquer Hollywood.Things have changed since the heyday of theater-trained movie stars and the independent acting schools that shaped them. Many small studios, threatened by rising rents, decrepit buildings, well-funded university programs, and instant internet stardom, are now struggling.Just ask Mary Boyer, who moved to the city from the Midwest in 1973 to pursue an acting career. She eventually became a teacher and a director, opening her own school in 2003. But by 2008, Boyer\u2019s 150 students had dwindled to about 50.\u201cThe economy changed,\u201d Ms. Boyer said, \u201cand what actors and audiences wanted sort of changed all at the same time.\u201d She noticed more students expecting \u201cinstant gratification.\u201d Her \u201ccraft of acting\u201d courses, what she felt most passionate about, were not filling up. Auditioning classes became her new staple.\u201cI just could not keep doing it,\u201d Ms. Boyer said. The lease for her school was up for renewal, and she had realized two things: her rent would continue to increase, and the only way to survive would be to teach more audition classes. \u201cMy creative soul was crumbling,\u201d she said.A symbolic example of the neighborhood\u2019s changing priorities is the fact that the tech giant Google, now the Atlantic\u2019s landlord, has plans to raise the school\u2019s rent to market rate next year when the school\u2019s 12-year lease expires.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved around Chelsea all this time, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking for the school to have to leave the neighborhood,\u201d said Mary McCann, the Atlantic\u2019s executive director.A successful alumni network will no doubt help the Playhouse face the daunting task of maintaining the 1920s-era property it owns.\u201cIt\u2019s like driving a 1947 Chevy,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman of the Playhouse, which has been on East 54th Street since Irene and Alice Lewisohn, its founders, bought the two adjacent buildings in Midtown in 1947. The Playhouse has five floors, including a light-filled dance studio designed by Martha Graham, as well as a 99-seat theater.\u201cWe are all afraid of the roof caving in,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman, who had to pay $20,000 to fix the building\u2019s out-of-commission elevator when she was first hired. \u201cThe elevator guys said we don\u2019t even have parts for this anymore,\u201d she recalled.\u201cWhen Herbert Berghof died in \u201990, I think it was still $5 a class,\u201d said Edith Meeks, HB\u2019s current artistic and executive director. But even by 2004, when Ms. Hagen died, HB had only marginally increased tuition. Modest, incremental fee hikes were just not \u201cenough to catch us up to the real expense of running a nonprofit and managing three buildings in the 21st century,\u201d said Ms. Meeks.So in 2013, for the first time in its history, HB streamlined its curriculum and significantly raised its bargain-basement prices as part of a \u201cone-time adjustment-to-market,\u201d said Ms. Meeks, who confirmed that enrollment is stable but nowhere near the numbers it had in the 1960s. \u201cWe were super affordable, and now we are affordable.\u201dThe change was made with a heavy heart, said Ms. Meeks, who admitted that young actors are affected by New York\u2019s real estate and job market just as much as the institutions training them. \u201cThey commute from farther and farther away to study with us at HB; many of them have crushing college debt and they struggle to stay employed and to have enough flexibility to continue their creative work,\u201d she said.For acting schools that pay rent, the situation is even more tenuous.The Atlantic Acting School moved into the Chelsea neighborhood 26 years ago, when \u201cno one wanted to be there\u201d and \u201crent was cheap,\u201d said Ms. McCann. With a pedigree that includes the playwright David Mamet and the actor/director William H. Macy \u2014 not to mention a thriving children\u2019s program, a connection to a professional theater with 12 Tony Awards, and even a coveted affiliation with N.Y.U. \u2014 it would seem that the school would have a rosy outlook.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford market rate,\u201d said Ms. McCann, the school\u2019s executive director.So, over the last two years, Mr. Lawson and his team have been looking for an affordable space, but the specifics for what the school needs \u2014 at least 20,000 square feet of office and open studio space at an affordable price \u2014 have proved to be a daunting challenge.And yet the Atlantic hopes to have a deal in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen area, according to Mr. Lawson, who reported that his team is currently considering two options. The rent, he said, will be difficult but doable, something between what the Atlantic is currently paying and \u201cChelsea market rate.\u201d Google, meanwhile, has offered the Atlantic a new lease for its theater, housed in the basement of 111 8th Avenue, for reduced rent.The T. Schreiber Studio, also in Chelsea, has survived by keeping its classrooms and administrative areas but letting go of its theater.In the mid-90s, Schreiber was riding high on the success of at least two former students, Edward Norton and Peter Sarsgaard. Around the same time, the school was offered the opportunity to buy its East 4th Street building, which was located across the street from the experimental theater La MaMa, next door to New York Theater Workshop, and included a theater space, offices, dressing rooms and a downstairs class area, for $90,000. But the money simply wasn\u2019t there, said Sally Dunn, its managing director.Instead, the now-49-year-old acting school moved to Chelsea right when it was becoming hot, said Peter Jensen, its artistic director. \u201cYou could just see all the hotels going up,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, student interest in the traditional scene-study class \u2014 what Mr. Norton and Mr. Sarsgaard cut their teeth on at Schreiber \u2014 was leaning more toward on-camera, commercial and casting classes, said Mr. Jensen. The whole nature of pursuing acting in New York was evolving, while the costs of teaching the trade were rising.But that might not be as easy or as affordable as hoped. Over the last decade, the city has also lost approximately 50 small performance venues, and according to Ms. Dunch, the arts fundraising expert, this \u201cspace crunch\u201d affects the entire nonprofit theater industry, including acting studios.Main stage productions at Barrow are happening again, some to critical acclaim. That said, the school\u2019s revenue is beginning to plateau and there\u2019s no more space for expansion. The annual rent is around $300,000, with 3.5 percent increases each year, and the booming Hudson Yards development nearby threatens to raise market rates even more. \u201cWith the rising cost of everything, it\u2019s scary,\u201d said Mr. Serrell. \u201cWe\u2019re a $2.1 million company; we\u2019re still scratching our heads. It\u2019s terrifically challenging, but we\u2019re determined to figure it out.\u201dPerhaps the answer is to leave Manhattan. The Atlantic looked in Brooklyn, but \u201cit\u2019s not any less expensive,\u201d said Ms. McCann. Even the actor and Renaissance man James Franco, who in 2014 opened a branch of his acting and film school, Studio4, in Fort Greene, couldn\u2019t work his magic: the studio announced it was closing on Oct. 1.\u201cI knew I wanted to be in Brooklyn \u2014 three-fourths of my students live here,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, who opened his school in 2015.\u201cI had this restless itch to make something of my own,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, a high-profile acting coach whose clients include Sam Rockwell and Emmy Rossum. \u201cI have that corny thing from \u2018Field of Dreams,\u2019 if you build it, they will come.\u201dSo far, they have come. After taking out a home equity line of credit and some money from his retirement account (\u201ccompletely against the advice of my lawyers and accountants\u201d), he has about 100 students. Mr. Knickerbocker \u201cwanted to have a studio that would be an affordable alternative to an M.F.A. program,\u201d he said. The two-year conservatory, with an optional third year, costs about $8,000 annually.Although students are treated to regular Facebook Live events with movie stars and solo performance workshops, the focus remains on traditional stagecraft and acting technique. And the students are into it. Caleb Lane, 35, in his second year, was a working actor in Los Angeles who \u201cleft the business\u201d to train in New York. \u201cI have a lot of famous friends who couldn\u2019t name one Tennessee Williams play,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople here are more interested in the long game.\u201dThe Knickerbocker invites casting directors and agents to a performance featuring its graduating conservatory actors, as do the T. Schreiber Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. But the Knickerbocker showcase does not take place on a stage. In a sign of the times, it is virtual. \u201cWe write and produce three- to four-minute films with these people, and put them online for casting directors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe write it to their sweet spots, shoot it with two cameras, edit it and score it.\u201dMeanwhile, in Toledo, Ms. Boyer is embracing, somewhat, the changing tides of the acting school business. While she is establishing her theater there, she is continuing to coach her most loyal New York students through Skype.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Betoota Advocate, a Fake News Site Australians Really Love", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The theme was fake news, and the crowd of young Australians at a pub in Sydney was eager to hear more. At the front of the room, two of Australia\u2019s most popular (fake) reporters grilled a panel of (real) journalists from some of the country\u2019s most established news outlets.The fake reporters, known by their pen names Clancy Overell and Errol Parker, called a popular right-leaning newspaper \u201cone of the last great bastions of news satire.\u201d A progressive journalist on the panel, they joked, probably owned 18 Guy Fawkes masks, associated with anarchists.It was a joke that the crowd, and a growing audience of Australians, was in on. Australia\u2019s \u201coldest and favorite newspaper,\u201d The Betoota Advocate is increasingly one of its most widely read. It is also completely made up.For three years Mr. Overell and Mr. Parker have remained steadfastly in character as proprietors of a rural newspaper. Often compared to the satirical news site The Onion, The Betoota Advocate has become the sardonic voice of disenchanted millennial Australians.\u201cEveryone is extremely jealous of Betoota because they get to write funny stuff and everyone clicks on their stuff,\u201d said Osman Faruqi, a panelist at the pub and an editor at Junkee, a pop culture website.But as The Betoota Advocate, which receives more than a million page views a month, has become increasingly popular, it has also risked losing its outsider status.The site\u2019s founders are tight-lipped about just how profitable their business has become, but said it became their primary source of income three months after bringing it online. Their Facebook page has close to 500,000 members, a majority of whom are between the ages of 18 and 30, a coveted advertising demographic.To their fans\u2019 delight, Mr. Overell and Mr. Parker insist on staying in character for public appearances and refuse to acknowledge that their journalism is really just comedy.\u201cWe\u2019d just like to point out we\u2019re independent regional news; we don\u2019t go by the term satire, Mr. Prime Minister.\u201d Mr. Overell told the country\u2019s leader in October.On one hand The Betoota Advocate purports to be written in the voice of the rural working class, or what the men call \u201cconservative.\u201d But Mr. Overell and Mr. Parker concede that their real mission is to make content that is inclusive and accessible to all sorts of people from all across Australia. In the past, they said, journalism was an exclusive club, limited to graduates from the country\u2019s elite universities.While Australia\u2019s spiritual heart is in the Outback, more than 70 percent of the population lives in cities. If urban elites are the butt of many of the site\u2019s jokes, they do not seem to mind.\u201cThe comedy is very disarming,\u201d said Liam Brown, 19, a student at the University of New South Wales who attended the pub panel. \u201cThey get to the heart of the issue surprisingly effectively.\u201dMr. Brown said he would prefer to read The Betoota Advocate than Sydney\u2019s main newspaper, The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cNo one trusts the media anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially after the American election.\u201dClancy Overell and Errol Parker are as fake as the stories they write. Two former journalists from Queensland, their real names are Archer Hamilton and Charles Single.Their unwavering commitment to staying in character makes for good watching, but it means learning about the men\u2019s origins is difficult.A reluctant conversation about their real ages, for example, revealed only that each was about 27.The men, who were friends before they were business partners, started with a print version of the paper. In 2014, with the help of Piers Grove, who is their publisher, they brought the operation online. Three years \u2014 and several side businesses \u2014 later, the men were drinking beers with the prime minister.Though a few freelancers now contribute, the men still run the business and write the bulk of the articles, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s quite daunting in a way, how you have to focus so much building up the organizations,\u201d Mr. Parker said, adding that he had to learn what to do when he received emails for accounts payable. \u201cYou\u2019re just like, Jesus Christ, well what does that mean?\u201dAs the site achieves mainstream success, questions about whether they can preserve their outsider status have inevitably risen. The writers now team up with politicians like Mr. Turnbull and billionaires like Richard Branson.But the men reject the idea that they have become insiders.\u201cThey\u2019ve all had the laser put on at some point,\u201d Mr. Overell said of the politicians the site frequently lambastes. \u201cThere\u2019s been no favors.\u201dThe only real thing about The Betoota Advocate is Betoota itself. A genuine town in a remote part of western Queensland, Betoota has been uninhabited for years.People who live close to Betoota seem amused by the new attention. Lorraine Kath, 40, who runs a cattle station near the town, said she often saw tourists in the area wearing Betoota Advocate T-shirts.\u201cI think the stories that the boys put out there are just a good laugh,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 What\u2019s at stake in Alabama\u2022 Will Republicans enact their tax plan by year\u2019s end?\u2022 What does Apple spend its cash on? Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future.

{"Headline": "Eccentric, Sure. But a Violent Criminal? Staten Island Puzzles Over the Case of Richard Luthmann", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the tightknit circles of the Staten Island courts, the lawyer Richard Luthmann has always been a kind of local oddity, styling himself as the borough\u2019s version of a Nixonian dirty trickster.Volatile, perennially bow-tied and working from an office in a strip mall upstairs from a vape shop, Mr. Luthmann, 38, has a reputation for being somewhat strange, but at least until recently, his colleagues in the Staten Island bar said, he was considered to be harmless. That, however, changed last week when federal prosecutors accused him of a raft of bizarre and violent crimes, saying that he once tried to assassinate a top official in the borough\u2019s Democratic Party and later sought to pay a stripper to claim that she was raped by a candidate running for district attorney.Over the weekend, the accusations against Mr. Luthmann ricocheted across Staten Island, where lawyers and politicos tried to make sense of the allegations and figure out if the lawyer whom they had merely thought of as eccentric could have employed what the government described as \u201cMafia-style tactics.\u201d\u201cI never thought of Richard as a violent person before,\u201d said Mario Galluci, a lawyer who has known Mr. Luthmann for 15 years. \u201cWas he flamboyant? Was he a little eccentric? Absolutely. Did I always agree with his politics? Absolutely not. But what I\u2019ve been reading doesn\u2019t fit the profile. It almost sounds like he lost touch with reality.\u201dThe broad allegations against Mr. Luthmann were contained in court papers charging him with running an outlandish criminal scheme from his office on Victory Boulevard, a few blocks from the Staten Island Expressway. In an indictment issued on Friday, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors said that Mr. Luthmann joined forces with a blind man and two reputed mobsters to pack shipping containers with \u201ccheap filler material\u201d and fraudulently sell them to a group of local businesses as scrap metal. In the midst of the plot, prosecutors claim, Mr. Luthmann turned on one of his partners and had him held at gunpoint to collect a $7,000 debt.But according to the government, the scrap-metal operation was only the tip of Mr. Luthmann\u2019s iceberg of misconduct. In a detailed memorandum that describes conduct not charged in the indictment, prosecutors said that for the past several years, Mr. Luthmann has wielded lawsuits, social media attacks and threats of physical violence to wage a series of \u201cbullying campaigns\u201d that furthered his \u201cvendettas against his perceived enemies.\u201dBeing scorned by Staten Island\u2019s political establishment so enraged Mr. Luthmann, prosecutors said, that he undertook an aggressive social media campaign against John Gulino, the chairman of the borough\u2019s Democratic Party committee. According to court papers, Mr. Luthmann posted images of Mr. Gulino on the internet with hostile hash tags like \u201c#targetpractice\u201d and \u201c#hunting season.\u201d Not long after, prosecutors said, he asked one of his partners in the scrap-metal plot \u2014 a man alleged by the government to have Mafia connections \u2014 to \u201cbeat up\u201d Mr. Gulino. The prosecutors also said that Mr. Luthmann asked the man to murder Kevin Elkins, the party committee\u2019s former executive director.While neither politician was harmed, Mr. Elkins said in an interview this week that Mr. Luthmann was a \u201cloose cannon\u201d who was spurred to revenge by his unsuccessful race. \u201cI guess it hurt his ego and manifested whatever insecurities he had,\u201d Mr. Elkins added. \u201cEver since, he\u2019s had this bizarre obsession with making my life a living hell. Even though he\u2019s a clown, there was always a deep kind of menace underneath it.\u201dIn a statement on Monday, Mr. McMahon condemned Mr. Luthmann\u2019s \u201cvicious attacks on my wife and me,\u201d adding that they seemed \u201cto be rooted in my rejecting campaign contributions and other overtures from Luthmann during my campaign.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cWe are hopeful that truth and justice will now finally prevail allowing my wife, myself and the many other victims of Luthmann and Pulizotto\u2019s mayhem, peace of mind and a return to normalcy.\u201dAt his arraignment last week, Mr. Luthmann was jailed in lieu of bail, but his lawyer, Joseph Sorrentino, said he hoped to free his client soon. Mr. Sorrentino, a veteran of the Staten Island courts, denied the charges against Mr. Luthmann \u201cin a general sense,\u201d adding that he could not \u201cspeak to specifics at the moment.\u201d\u201cAll I can say right now,\u201d Mr. Sorrentino said, \u201cis that Richard Luthmann is not a risk of flight or a danger to the public.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But public support for clemency for the former leader, who is credited with reforms that put Peru on a path of sustained growth, has inched up in recent months.\u201cI am aware that the results during my government on one side were well received,\u201d Mr. Fujimori said in the video. \u201cOn the other hand, I recognize that I have also disappointed other fellow Peruvians. I ask them to forgive me with all my heart.\u201d\u201cI feel deceived by a president who has lied once again,\u201d said Carolina Huaman Oyague, one of thousands of protesters who took to the streets in Lima, the capital, on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue on the streets and will fight so that the judicial process under which he was tried is respected.\u201dHer cousin Dora Oyague Fierro was one of several students at La Cantuta University who were abducted and killed in 1992 by a military death squad tied to Mr. Fujimori. She said that Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s office had ignored repeated requests for meetings with a group of the victims\u2019 relatives.In a televised address on Monday, Mr. Kuczynski called the pardon \u201cperhaps the most difficult decision in my life,\u201d but defended it as a gesture of clemency. He urged protesters to \u201cturn the page,\u201d saying the move was part of an \u201ceffort at reconciliation\u201d in a polarized nation. \u201cThose of us who feel democratic should not allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison,\u201d the president said. \u201cJustice is not revenge.\u201dHuman rights experts and political analysts in the region rebuked Mr. Kuczynski for pardoning one of the few Latin American strongmen who has been held accountable in a judicial proceeding for grave abuses committed while in office.Marta Lagos, the founder of Latinobar\u00f3metro, a polling and research organization based in Santiago, Chile, called Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s decision a seminal moment. \u201cHis legacy will be having held on to power at all cost, having sold himself out for the support of his fiercest opposition,\u201d she said.The pardon has already cost Mr. Kuczynski the support of at least three allies in Congress who resigned in protest, leaving him with only 15 allied lawmakers.\u201cI respect the president\u2019s prerogative to grant a humanitarian pardon, but I do not share the way it has been exercised,\u201d said Gino Costa, formerly a fervent supporter and one of those who resigned.Peru\u2019s Justice Ministry insists that the pardon was legally and procedurally sound, but at least three senior civil servants have resigned in protest.Petitioners for medical pardons must show that they suffer from an \u201cirreversible and degenerative\u201d ailment. Mr. Fujimori\u2019s doctors have said he suffers from cardiac dysrhythmia, a common condition, and tongue cancer, which was originally discovered more than a decade ago.Cesar Nakazaki, a former lawyer for Alberto Fujimori, said the ex-president easily met the criteria. \u201cHe\u2019s not the most severe case, but also not the least severe,\u201d Mr. Nakazaki said.Jos\u00e9 Basilio, 39, a computer technician in Lima, said Tuesday that he was overjoyed to see the ailing leader freed.\u201cI lived through the years of terror, during the times when our electricity was constantly cut off and the bombs were dropped on our doorsteps,\u201d said Mr. Basilio, whose father was a military officer. \u201cHis administration may have used excessive force and I know there were people caught in the crossfire, but he wore the pants and did what needed to be done.\u201dMr. Fujimori, for his part, said the pardon had surprised him, prompting \u201cfeelings of extreme joy and of sorrow mixed together.\u201dAndrea Zarate reported from Lima, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.

{"Headline": "Ex-Leader of Georgia Confronts Ukraine Agents in Rooftop Standoff", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 As president of Georgia, he survived a disastrous war with Russia. As a regional governor in Ukraine committed to fighting corruption, he clashed with just about everybody, including his estranged former ally, Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko.On Tuesday Mikheil Saakashvili, a onetime darling of the West, took his high-wire political career to bizarre new heights when he climbed onto the roof of his five-story apartment building in the center of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with law enforcement officers in hot pursuit. As a crowd of hundreds of supporters gathered below, he shouted insults at Ukraine\u2019s leaders and, according to several local news outlets, threatened to jump if security agents tried to grab him.Dragged from the roof after denouncing Mr. Poroshenko as a traitor and a thief, the former Georgian leader was detained but then freed by his supporters, who, amid raucous scenes on the street, blocked a security service van before it could take Mr. Saakashvili to a Kiev detention center and allowed him to escape.With a Ukrainian flag draped across his shoulders and a pair of handcuffs still attached to one of his wrists, Mr. Saakashvili then led hundreds of supporters in a march across Kiev toward Parliament. Speaking through a bullhorn, he called for \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d to remove Mr. Poroshenko from office, just as protests had toppled the former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, in February 2014.Russia reveled in a spectacle that only buttressed its view that Ukraine is a chaotic shambles incapable of running its own affairs. State television repeatedly broadcast footage of Mr. Saakashvili screaming from the rooftop and of the melee on the street below. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, took delight in mocking Mr. Saakashvili, telling journalists in Moscow, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not used to reacting to statements made by people who are sitting on roofs.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are observing events overall with interest. Of course, this is Ukraine\u2019s headache. This is something you wouldn\u2019t wish even on an enemy, that\u2019s how I\u2019d put it.\u201dThe United States Embassy in Kiev issued a statement calling \u201con all sides to de-escalate tension and avoid violence. We are monitoring the situation closely and expect any investigation will be conducted expeditiously and in accordance with Ukrainian law.\u201dThe European Union mission in Kiev also called for a fair inquiry in accordance with the law and asked that Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s rights be respected.The scenes outside Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s apartment on Kostelnaya Street left some aghast, with Mustafa Nayyem, a reform-minded member of Parliament and a key figure in the 2013-14 protests against Mr. Yanukovych, describing them as \u201cidiotism\u201d on Facebook.\u201cWhatever your opinion of Saakashvili, the government\u2019s actions now concern all of us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis could happen to anybody who doesn\u2019t cut a deal with them.\u201dSeeking to explain why Ukraine\u2019s security agency, the S.B.U., had tried to grab the former Georgian leader, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, accused Mr. Saakashvili of assisting a criminal organization led by Mr. Yanukovych, the ousted pro-Russian president, and receiving $500,000 to fund his political activities from a fugitive Ukrainian businessman, Serhiy Kurchenko.The prosecutor\u2019s office released an audio recording featuring what it said was a conversation between Mr. Saakashvili and Mr. Kurchenko and their aides about the organization of protests aimed at toppling Mr. Poroshenko.The move to arrest Mr. Saakashvili, Mr. Lutsenko told journalists in Kiev, \u201cbroke the plan of revenge by pro-Kremlin forces.\u201dUkrainian political rivals routinely accuse each other of working in cahoots with the Kremlin, whatever the reality of their affiliations. The prosecutor\u2019s accusation that Mr. Saakashvili was collaborating with Mr. Yanukovych seemed to be largely aimed at discrediting the former Georgian leader, who has attracted support in Ukraine by positioning himself as an uncompromising enemy of Russia, corruption and Mr. Poroshenko.The day\u2019s dizzying events suggested that the feud between Mr. Saakashvili and his former sponsor, Mr. Poroshenko, has escalated to a dangerous new level. They also marked a surprising twist in the tumultuous career of a former leader who has burned so many bridges over the years that, stripped of his citizenship by both Georgia and Ukraine, he is now stateless and effectively a refugee.But Mr. Lutsenko, the prosecutor general, said that Ukraine had no immediate plans to return Mr. Saakashvili to Georgia, which has demanded his extradition to face corruption charges.Mr. Saakashvili took to the roof in protest after Ukrainian prosecutors came to his apartment early Tuesday morning and demanded to search it. As a flash mob of supporters gathered on the street below, he gave a rambling speech from the rooftop, urging \u201call Ukrainians to take to the streets and drive out the thieves.\u201d\u201cThey want to kidnap me, because I rallied to the Ukrainian people\u2019s defense. They wanted to kidnap me unnoticed, but they failed to do this,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili proclaimed. He pleaded with police officers not to carry out what he called criminal orders to arrest him.As president of Georgia for nearly a decade, Mr. Saakashvili initially won plaudits in Washington and other Western capitals for rooting out corruption and turning his small nation into a rare success story among former Soviet lands. But his image as a heroic reformer lost much of its sheen after a 2008 war with Russia and waves of arrests that targeted not only the corrupt but also his political enemies.He left Georgia in 2013 and, after the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych in 2014, was appointed governor of Ukraine\u2019s Odessa region, a notorious swamp of corruption, by the country\u2019s new president, Mr. Poroshenko.Mr. Saakashvili quit the Odessa job in 2016, complaining that Mr. Poroshenko and other senior officials were blocking his efforts to fight graft. He was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship last year while out of the country and ordered not to come back.Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s return to Ukraine infuriated the government, raising political temperature as Mr. Poroshenko struggled with a Russian-backed armed rebellion in the eastern part of the country and mounting criticism from political opponents that, like Mr. Yanukovych, he was tolerating and benefiting from rampant corruption.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine, and Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Antidote to Digital Dehumanization? Live Theater", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "An award-winning playwright argues that the in-the-moment interplay between actors and audience can help us cope with an increasingly virtual world.Supported byThe living presence of the audience is what strikes me as so singular about the theater, why I love working in the theater so much and why I believe in the particular importance of our beloved form right now.But first, let me say: I am not hopeful about where we are as a nation \u2014 as a species (if I can be so presumptuous). I\u2019m not hopeful, because I am increasingly of the mind that even my hope is being monetized. That which is most enduring, most noble, most human about me \u2014 my urge for something brighter, more vivid, more loving, more alive \u2014 all of this is being used against me.The attention-finance complex has given us devices to which we are tethered by more than compulsion. Our pleasure principle \u2014 long prey to the manipulations of capitalism \u2014 has been turned against us, irretrievably yoked to ends that are not ours, ends we cannot fully comprehend.Transformed into economic subjects, our humanity is being redefined; we are valuable only insofar as our economic behavior can be predicted and monetized. Indeed, the technology has enabled the very movements of our mind to become a steady stream of revenue to someone, somewhere.Somehow we are sold the story that this narrowing of the world into streams of monetized information is actually about liberation. That it represents a new era in human communication. The triumph of democracy. A victory over centralized power. All of these strike me as little more than hopeful memes sold over the very platforms they are intended to legitimize.Indeed, the great fracture begun in earnest more than 30 years ago \u2014 the collapse of a vision of collective well-being \u2014 this fracture has finally been completed. We are little more than data points in a society that isn\u2019t really that anymore. It\u2019s a marketplace, nothing more than the sum of its sold and purchased parts.A bleak vision, yes. And yet, this bleakness must also be something of a defense. My defense against the financed colonization of my desire and, yes, of my hope. A way to defend, to preserve the stirrings of the real hope inside me, what to work for, what to work toward.Which brings me to the other side of the live performance equation \u2014 the actor\u2019s body.A living being before a living audience. Relationship unmediated by the contemporary disembodying screen. Not the appearance of a person, but the reality of one. Not a simulacrum of relationship, but a form of actual relationship.The theater is an art form scaled to the human, and stubbornly so, relying on the absolute necessity of physical audience, a large part of why theater is so difficult to monetize. It only happens when and where it happens. Once it starts, you can\u2019t stop it. It doesn\u2019t exist to be paused or pulled out at the consumer\u2019s whim. It can\u2019t be copied and sold. In a world increasingly lost to virtuality and unreality \u2014 the theater points to an antidote.A living actor before a living audience. The situation of all theater, a situation that can awaken in us a recollection of something more primordial, religious ritual \u2014 the site of our earliest collective negotiations with our tremendous vulnerability to existence. The act of gathering to witness the myths of our alleged origins enacted \u2014 this is the root of the theater\u2019s timeless magic.Because whether we like to admit it or not, we herding social animals are programmed at some very profound level to think and feel as one. To me, this is why the great lie of American individualism \u2014 that my experience is the most important thing, and should be protected and enabled at all costs \u2014 why this thinking is so pernicious. It isn\u2019t really true to what we really are.But the theater is \u2014 in its essence.Indeed, at its best, it\u2019s the experience of us as one mind, one heart, one body. That live performance can synchronize the heartbeats of an audience is no surprise to any of us who ply our trade in the theater. Certainly not to any writer or director or designer who has lived through four weeks of previews trying to get those heartbeats to sync up.This sense of oneness with an audience, of losing all sense of time, of absorption in the travails and triumphs of the living actors \u2014 this is the daily antidote. For which I write. About which I dream. And from which so much of my truest hope is mined.Ayad Akhtar is the author of \u201cDisgraced,\u201d which won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and \u201cJunk,\u201d playing on Broadway through Jan. 7.

{"Headline": "The Biggest Tech Failures and Successes of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s face it: Technology this year was one big \u201cfail\u201d after another. And the biggest loser from all of this was you.It\u2019s easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money. So here\u2019s a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.Epic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.Hackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What\u2019s worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax \u2014 if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.Equifax\u2019s top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.Juicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year\u2019s tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.Juicero\u2019s product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).Remember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake. Facebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.On the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.When Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn\u2019t a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous. An initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly. This is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.For the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn\u2019t a Nintendo. The Japanese game company\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, was a flop. People are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console\u2019s first 10 months.Year after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms. That vision is finally becoming a reality. Advertisement"}

Another soldier was imprisoned this year for fatally shooting a Palestinian assailant who already lay bleeding on the ground.\u201cWhen the enemy sends their teenage daughters to smack you around, and you\u2019re too afraid to defend yourself, you are no longer a soldier,\u201d wrote David Zachary Sidman, a Times of Israel blogger. \u201cYou are a frightened robot who prefers freedom over dignity.\u201dIn an interview, the writer Yossi Klein Halevi said he had conflicted feelings about the scuffle. \u201cMy first reaction was I was proud of the soldiers, but I was also ambivalent: Is this going to invite more attacks, and more serious ones?\u201d he said.\u201cIsraelis were worried that this strength of the soldiers would be misperceived in the Arab world as weakness,\u201d Mr. Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, added. \u201cAnd when you see yourself as under permanent siege, your greatest fear is the loss of deterrence.\u201dAmong Palestinians, the soldiers\u2019 poise was problematic for different reasons.\u201cIt gives people the idea that the occupation soldiers are humane in dealing with Palestinians and their children,\u201d Rami Jonny, 32, a Gaza resident, wrote on a Ramallah news site. \u201cImagine if this girl was in an Arab country, and she hit a soldier in his face publicly, in the middle of the street.\u201dBut other Palestinian activists said they hoped Ms. Tamimi\u2019s fearlessness would prompt more West Bank residents to confront the Israeli occupation.\u201cShe represents a generation who are not afraid of soldiers,\u201d said Issa Amro, a Hebron-based opponent of the occupation who preaches nonviolence.The occupation \u201cis trying to make the Palestinians give up,\u201d he said, but Ms. Tamimi\u2019s example argued for the opposite. \u201cThe majority of Palestinians are not active,\u201d Mr. Amro said. \u201cThis shows that they should get over their fears and their weakness \u2014 especially the women.\u201dThough Ms. Tamimi\u2019s arrest \u2014 in a night raid captured on video and publicized by the army \u2014 slaked a thirst for punishment on the Israeli side, the scene of the young woman being hauled away may have given Palestinians the clear-cut propaganda coup they had been denied by the original confrontation. Ms. Tamimi, who remains behind bars, quickly inspired a new social-media campaign: #FreeAhed.\u201cThe people of Palestine and all free peoples in the world salute you, Ahed,\u201d wrote Kathem Nasser on Rai Al-Youm, a news site based in London. \u201cWe kiss your hand in reverence.\u201dNada Homsi and Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bannon Finds New Fight Backing Roy Moore, but Risks Are High", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAIRHOPE, Ala. \u2014 Four months ago, Stephen K. Bannon was plotting a takeover of Washington and the Republican Party from his office in the West Wing as chief strategist to President Trump.On Tuesday, Mr. Bannon the private citizen stood where his latest fight had taken him: the mulch floor of a barn in southern Alabama, where he delivered a passionate plea to elect Roy S. Moore, the former judge who faces numerous accusations that he preyed on young women, some of them teenagers.Railing against Republican leaders in Washington, the mainstream media and Mr. Moore\u2019s many critics inside his own party, Mr. Bannon told the crowd of several hundred who had crammed into the barn: \u201cThey want to destroy Judge Moore. And you know why? They want to take away your voice.\u201d\u201cIf they can destroy Roy Moore, they can destroy you,\u201d he added.When Mr. Moore took to the stage, where an American flag the size of a billboard served as the backdrop, he worked his way through a speech that touched on everything from Common Core, to the value of military service, to bathrooms for transgender people. \u201cThey don\u2019t want me up there. I know that,\u201d Mr. Moore said softly, referring to his would-be colleagues in the Senate. \u201cThey don\u2019t want somebody up there with an independent mind.\u201dIt was not quite the fight Mr. Bannon envisioned leading. But it will have to do.The stakes for Mr. Moore, the Republican Senate nominee who next Tuesday faces off against the Democrat Doug Jones, are indeed high. The race has become a closely watched referendum on the Republican Party leadership in Washington, the credibility of the national news media and the country\u2019s tolerance for political spectacle.But the only person who may have more on the line than Mr. Moore is Mr. Bannon, who is risking his own campaign to topple Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, as well as other incumbent Republican senators across the country.Mr. Bannon, who never publicly questioned Mr. Moore after the allegations first surfaced last month, has seen a fortuitous turn of events ahead of the rally here. Mr. McConnell, who had urged Mr. Moore to get out of the race after The Washington Post reported that a woman had accused the former judge of touching her sexually when she was 14, softened his insistence over the weekend and said that he was \u201cgoing to let the people of Alabama make the call.\u201dLess than 12 hours later, the Republican National Committee reversed course and said it was reinstating the support it had pulled from Mr. Moore, lending his struggling campaign a crucial lifeline of manpower and financial support as the race enters its final week.The Republican Party now finds itself in a situation remarkably similar to the one it was in last year with Mr. Trump: grudging acceptance of a nominee facing repeated allegations of inappropriate conduct with women because the conservative electorate shows no inclinations of walking away.Mr. Bannon has been building a larger footprint for himself and the website he leads, Breitbart News, which seemed to have as many people working the rally in Fairhope as the Moore campaign itself. Breitbart streamed the event on its website and its Facebook Live account and hosted three hours of programming from the venue on Sirius XM\u2019s Patriot Channel.Mr. Bannon added another media outlet to his broadening portfolio on Tuesday when he began hosting his old Sirius XM show, which he plans to return to more regularly now as he steps up his attacks on Mr. McConnell.Matt Boyle, the Washington political editor for Breitbart, who was at the rally, said that the Moore story was tailor-made for the hard-right website. \u201cWe believe that this story really captures the war that we\u2019re seeing between the deplorables, the voters of the Republican Party, and the establishment,\u201d he said, using Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous insult of Trump supporters.All signs, including the most recent polling, have pointed to a race that could swing either way.Before the rally on Tuesday, Dean Young, a senior adviser to the Moore campaign, was helping set up. Wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, he scoffed at the notion that Mr. Moore was feeling the heat of a close race.\u201cJudge Moore doesn\u2019t scare,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep fighting for what he believes in the end. And that would be his God \u2014 and that\u2019s the Christian God, let\u2019s make this clear \u2014 and the country.\u201d\u201cAnd he will continue to do that,\u201d Mr. Young added, \u201conce he gets to Washington.\u201dKevin Spriggs, who owns three convenience stores in nearby Daphne, said that the election came down to a simple choice. \u201cI don\u2019t like the allegations; it made me uncomfortable,\u201d he said as he waited for the speeches to begin. \u201cBut with Doug Jones you\u2019re getting a real live Democrat.\u201dMr. McConnell\u2019s opposition to Mr. Moore, he added, was only strengthening the resolve of voters like him. \u201cI consider myself a Republican activist. Yet I feel like my own leadership is shooting me in the back.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The More the Merrier, and the Messier", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesThere\u2019s a fire, and a dozen of us are piled on couches, ottomans and random chairs pulled in from the next room, hot tea or cold beers in our hands. Four conversations are going at once. The kids have all run upstairs with their cousins, leaving a litter of torn paper and unwrapped Christmas gifts behind.My parents and my four siblings and their families have driven in from Vermont, New Jersey and Maryland, and more than 25 of us are sleeping in my Ohio house at the moment. Every bedroom \u2014 as well as the office, the playroom, and any other nook we can find \u2014 is furnished with a happy mess of air mattresses, crumpled sleeping bags and yawning suitcases.I had never wanted a big house. I wanted a reasonably modest house that I would keep reasonably tidy and uncluttered. But then: children. Our snug little colonial began to feel cramped as three kids came along.The babies entered the world naked, but their advance team of doting relatives and friends had already been there with armfuls of stuff. Closets held tiny clothes, sheets and blankets, and boxes and boxes of diapers. Barren bedrooms blossomed with crib and dressers and rocking chairs. And, of course, the stuff just kept coming. We were lucky, but I was overwhelmed. I wanted order and simplicity.I devoured decluttering books and articles and ferried carloads of stuff to the thrift store. Yet we kept tripping over our stuff and each other. And I began to long for a bit of space not covered in Lego bits and ride-on toys and inside-out socks. Perhaps it was time to upsize.We found the perfect street just across town \u2014 quieter than our old street, around the corner from parks, and a pleasant half-mile walk to the elementary school. The house, though, was simply too big. No family of five needs a six-bedroom house, especially a 92-year-old one with a leaky roof and a beehive in the porch floor.But we fell in love. It had the arched doorways and crown moldings and leaded glass of our dreams. It also had dated wallpaper and a 1980s kitchen and never-remodeled 1920s bathrooms. Modern it was not. But it was charming and surprisingly cozy in its tired, grand way and, after years on the market, the price finally fell into our range.I once read about a family of five that decided to keep only five dishes, five mugs, five bowls, and so on. In the name of simplicity and tidiness, they\u2019d wash each dish immediately after using it and place it back on the shelf.Just think, though: No one could come over.Despite my infatuation with minimalism, mine is not that minimalist house. This is a house for gathering, and particularly so at Christmas. From the outside, electric candles in every window say \u201cwelcome\u201d \u2014 and inside, our ancient wiring and a maze of extension cords and power strips probably say \u201cfire hazard.\u201d The big living room window begs for the fattest tree possible, and we oblige. The spacious dining room risks feeling lonely without extra chairs (and guests) pulled up to the table.I still crave simplicity and the contentment that apparently comes with decluttering. But there are some belongings I cling to: the tools of hospitality. I finally had to admit that some chaos \u2014 especially the chaos of bringing far-flung family members together \u2014 is worth it.And so we have rafts of sheets, towels, comforters, pillows and air mattresses, along with dozens of mismatched plates and bowls and glasses. At Christmas, we use them all. There\u2019s an easy comfort to being under one roof with the people I love, especially at the holidays. I like my family putting their noses in the refrigerator and their boots in a giant pile by the door. I like the kids running together through the house, and the lazy all-day time with my siblings.Of course, having so many people in one house is not exactly compatible with Instagram-perfect holiday scenes. Just as with homes, not every family can be simple, small and tidy, and mine is no exception. In the family room, where we set up a long kids\u2019 table, I try to avert my eyes from the inevitable spills and stains where a dozen unsupervised children leave their mark. I\u2019m still finding pink spots from a particularly exuberant nail-polishing session among a crowd of cousins \u2026 a year ago.Once, water began pouring from the living room ceiling, a casualty of a sink left on upstairs by a kid who didn\u2019t know its quirks. And there was the year my brother came down with a stomach bug, and we had to quarantine him in the only isolated space available: the concrete-floored basement.It\u2019s messy. But so are we. We don\u2019t all agree on religion or politics \u2014 some of my family members have unfriended others on Facebook after particularly heated exchanges. As in all families, spouses and children bicker. People get sick, sometimes seriously. And, of course, time ticks on, and we are all getting older.Somehow \u2014 and sometimes I\u2019m not sure how \u2014 we manage to put all this aside at Christmas. Politics and religion are off the table. The children, maybe because there are so many of them, mostly find ways to play without retreading sibling rivalries.I thought this house would bring me order, a chance to escape everyday chaos.But a big house is an open place. Especially one like ours, built almost 100 years ago. Not all the windows shut tightly, and there are more (drafty) doors than strictly necessary. The winter wind \u2014 and mice \u2014 sneak in through invisible fissures. \u201cBring your sweaters and slippers,\u201d I warn my visiting family. We are still chilly, but we do the jigsaw puzzles, we play the games, we eat, we open the gifts, we laugh.As it turns out, this drafty old house is more open and welcoming than it is perfect. But home, and family, were never about perfection. And so, for as long as we have the chance, we\u2019ll tumble messily into this space, and savor the holidays. Together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama Says No to Trump\u2019s Tribalism", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are so many things I could say right now after watching Doug Jones defeat Roy Moore in the Senate race in Alabama, but for me it comes down to just two words: \u201cThank you.\u201dThank you to the majority of Alabamians for loving our country more than you hated Democrats. Thank you for voting as citizens, not as members of a tribe. Thank you for understanding that sending a credibly accused child molester to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate would not only have denigrated your state, it would have denigrated that whole legislative body. Thank you for seeing the decency of Doug Jones, even though he is a Democrat, and seeing the indecency of Roy Moore.God bless every one of you. Yours was a deeply patriotic act.It\u2019s too soon to say for sure, of course, whether this is a national trend, but when the majority in a deep-red state like Alabama \u2014 where anti-abortion sentiments run so high, making it nearly impossible for a pro-choice Democrat to be elected \u2014 repudiates the effort by Trump and Bannon to turn us from citizens into tribes, there is hope for the country after all. It is a real sign of health.I speak from some experience, because I have peered into this tribal abyss. Back in the late 1970s, when I was covering the Lebanese civil war, a story made the rounds in Beirut that the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia had come up with a novel way of discovering a Palestinian trying to pass through one of its checkpoints. The Phalangists would show the driver a tomato and ask: What\u2019s this? If the driver used the standard Lebanese pronunciation, \u201cbanadurra,\u201d he was allowed to pass. If he used the Palestinian pronunciation, \u201cbandora,\u201d he could be pulled out of his car and shot on the spot.That is tribal politics at its raw essence: It doesn\u2019t matter how you live your life or what you aspire to for your society. All that matters is your sectarian or tribal identity, revealed by how you pronounce the word for tomato.Middle Easterners have a saying for this kind of thinking: \u201cMe and my brother against my cousin. Me, my brother and my cousin against the outsider.\u201dThe Alabama Senate race reminded me of that story \u2014 not the shooting part, of course, but the way Alabamians were being told to let someone babysit our precious country, someone they wouldn\u2019t let babysit their own kids \u2014 just because he was supposedly from their tribe.We\u2019ve confronted such thinking before in our history. But in the past moments of raw, tribal/cultural divisions, our system was always able to produce leaders able to summon our better angels and pull us together to rise to the challenges of the day.But even with Jones\u2019s victory in Alabama I worry that technology \u2014 social networks in particular \u2014 and archaic laws that prevent new players from entering politics work against the emergence of such national leaders. I worry that irreversible damage is being done to our norms and institutions by this poisonous cocktail of Trump, Twitter and tribalism.I was not surprised to hear former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya tell CNBC on Tuesday that social media is creating a society that confuses \u201cpopularity\u201d with \u201ctruth.\u201d The tools we\u2019ve created, he explained, \u201care starting to erode the social fabric of how society works.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to forget, in this age of Twitter, how much a daring leader who can pull people together can accomplish \u2014 even in the most difficult of times.We are going through a similar period of rapid change today. The pace of destructive weather events is quickening; the world is going from interconnected to interdependent; and machines and software are devouring ever more middle- and even high-skill jobs. The country needs a plan for investing in more resilient cities, in lifelong learning systems for every worker and in a safety net of mobile/universal health care. And what do we have instead? A highly tribal Republican tax bill that targets none of those issues.But maybe, maybe just maybe, the narrow majority in Alabama has sent both Trump and the country a message. We are fed up with your cynicism, we are fed up with your effort to break us into tribes, we want a president who is a uniter not a divider, because we have big hard work to do as a country right now \u2014 and it can only be done together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hearty Salad for a Month of Healthy Eating", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteEverywhere you look, you\u2019ll see recipes for satisfying salads for dinner, portable salads for lunch \u2014 even breakfast salads to start the day, if your need for bodily atonement runs that deep.This is all good in theory, but in terms of seasonality, it can be challenging. What\u2019s the best way to eat salad in winter when lettuces and other greens are at their wilting worst?The solution is to cut back on the fragile leafy greens in your salad bowl, and ramp up vegetables of a more robust order.Roots and squashes; mushrooms; and sturdy stalks and bulbs like celery, fennel and onions are viable, easy-to-find options. Roasting not only makes them sweet and wonderfully tender, it also gives you the perfect excuse to crank up the oven, something you\u2019d be hard pressed to do for your average bowl of arugula.In this dinner-worthy salad, a combination of roasted golden beets, radishes and winter squash does the heavy lifting, while the green matter \u2014 herbs, scallions and fris\u00e9e (or whatever decent-looking lettuce you can find) \u2014 acts more as a bright, refreshing garnish. This is all rounded out by a sprinkling of toasted pumpkin seeds for crunch, and pecorino cheese for a salty tang.Although in general I adore the sweetness of roasted red beets, golden ones are better for this particular salad. Earthy and savory, golden beets are a more sympathetic partner to winter squash, which becomes deeply caramelized and velvety in the oven\u2019s high heat. Red beets can be almost cloying here, but if they\u2019re all you have, squeeze on some extra lime juice to offset the added sweetness.No matter which beets you use, the dressing \u2014 an assertive mix of lime juice, anchovies and garlic \u2014 adds just the right pungency to perk up all the honeyed flavors, especially those of the squash. And note that if you can\u2019t find delicata squash, other winter varieties such as honey nut, acorn, butternut or sweet dumpling make fine substitutes.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the name of a squash. It is sweet dumpling, not delicata.cookingAdvertisement"}

For instance, Mr. Tambor was widely believed to be leaving \u201cTransparent\u201d after he issued a statement saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see how I can return.\u201d Yet a representative for the actor disclosed to The Times recently that, in fact, Mr. Tambor had no plans to quit.In interviews, several cast and crew members said that the socially progressive values of \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 with its embrace of transgender characters and its commitment to workplace inclusivity \u2014 made the accusations of sexual harassment all the harder to process.\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a former writer and producer who is still in touch with many of the show\u2019s staff members. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly sad that that happened in the midst of something that felt so revolutionary.\u201d\u201cEven in the safest of sets, where there were people who were really thinking constantly about how do we make sure we\u2019re heart-connected at work, things happened, or things may have happened,\u201d the show\u2019s creator, Jill Soloway, said on a panel a few days after the second of three women, the \u201cTransparent\u201d actress Trace Lysette, came forward with accusations about Mr. Tambor.Mx. Soloway dotted the set with at least 60 transgender and gender nonconforming writers, actors and crew members, as well as many more extras, through what Mx. Soloway called the show\u2019s \u201ctransfirmative action\u201d program. A pair of transgender artists-turned-producers vetted the story lines to ensure authenticity. There were sessions to teach set decorators, drivers and other staff members how to speak and write sensitively about transgender issues.\u201cWe all feel like we\u2019re part of a greater good,\u201d Andrea Sperling, an executive producer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to entertain, but it\u2019s part of something bigger than all of us.\u201dWriters referred to Mx. Soloway\u2019s writers\u2019 room, with joking affection, as the \u201cwriters\u2019 womb,\u201d a nurturing yet unpasteurized space where the intimate details of their own lives \u2014 including sexual proclivities, extramarital affairs and more quotidian memories \u2014 were discussed and then stirred into the show.Their willingness to explore any personal experience, no matter how graphic or private, gave the story lines some of their emotional rawness and sexual frankness, and the set its warm, freewheeling atmosphere.Yet the absence of boundaries could also create uncomfortable moments for anyone less willing to share; one former writer, speaking anonymously to discuss private work sessions, recalled texting a friend out of unease when the writers were asked about their masturbation habits. (Mx. Soloway said in a written response to questions that sex was just one of many things the writers talked about, and that it was common practice among television writers to mine personal experiences for content.)In interviews with writers, producers and an actress arranged by Mx. Soloway\u2019s personal publicist, Mr. Fitzerman-Blue was one of the few to say he believed the women\u2019s allegations against Mr. Tambor; most others would not discuss them.The first accusations surfaced last month when Mr. Tambor\u2019s former assistant on the show, Van Barnes, wrote in a private Facebook post that the actor had sexually harassed and groped her.Two of Ms. Lysette\u2019s friends \u2014 Rain Valdez, an actress who worked as a producer on \u201cTransparent,\u201d and Mindy Jones, a singer \u2014 said in interviews that Ms. Lysette had confided in them about Mr. Tambor\u2019s actions at the time. Another actress, Alexandra Billings, said in a statement to The Times that she had overheard Mr. Tambor tell Ms. Lysette, \u201cMy God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually.\u201dIn an interview with The Times, Ms. Lysette said she hoped the show would evolve to focus on transgender experiences beyond those of Mr. Tambor\u2019s character. \u201cLike, come on,\u201d said Ms. Lysette, who is transgender. \u201cWe have a lot to share, and the world wants to see it, and I just think that it sucks that so much rides on these leading men.\u201dMr. Tambor, too, produced a supporting account. In a statement provided by the actor\u2019s publicist, Allan Mayer, a hairstylist on the show, Terry Baliel, said that he had never witnessed the actor doing anything of an \u201cinappropriate sexual\u201d nature.A few days later, in a new statement provided to The Times, Mr. Mayer expanded on Mr. Tambor\u2019s position: \u201cWhat he said was that given the toxic atmosphere and the politicization on the set, it\u2019s very hard for him to see how he can possibly return. But no final decision for next year has been made, either by Jeffrey or by Amazon.\u201d He declined to elaborate on what Mr. Tambor meant by toxic atmosphere and politicization of the set.Responding to questions, Mx.

{"Headline": "What Facebook Taught Me About Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMy first glimpse of a world without strong protections for net neutrality was in 2004, when I was part of the team that created Facebook. Though it\u2019s hard to imagine now, TheFacebook (as it was called at the time) was just a fledgling college social network, growing school by school. Some colleges didn\u2019t like Facebook, and because they functioned as their students\u2019 internet providers, they would simply block the site.While those blocks were always rolled back \u2014 often after sustained student outcry \u2014 they acutely demonstrated the power of providers to limit the freedom and openness of the internet at whim. It is not too far-fetched to suggest that had schools been more aggressive and unrelenting in blocking Facebook in those early days, the company might not exist today.Today I run a start-up called Philo that recently introduced a streaming live TV service. Because live video requires more bandwidth, a reliable connection and low \u201clatency\u201d (how long it takes information to travel through a system), services like ours are particularly prone to \u201cthrottling\u201d and unfair prioritization by internet providers \u2014 tactics that will no longer be prohibited if net neutrality protections are rolled back, as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has announced as his intent. Even worse, because Philo directly competes with all of the largest internet providers, which offer their own live TV services, these providers have a strong incentive to put their thumbs on the scale.The internet has spurred innovation precisely because it has been an open, level playing field, where barriers to offering new products and services have continually come down over time. In the 1990s, creating a website required first figuring out to how to build and set up a web server \u2014 no small feat. In 2004, we started Facebook on a server we rented for $85 per month. Today, basic hosting in the cloud can be free for a year or longer, meaning that anyone with an idea has the ability to get it out into the world. However, if we allow internet providers to erect barriers to reaching customers, we risk reversing this trend.Strong net neutrality rules don\u2019t just protect companies \u2014 they also protect you as a consumer and ensure that you\u2019re getting the full services you\u2019re paying for. If an internet provider slows or blocks a site that you want to look at, it is denying you the right to freely choose the content that\u2019s important to you. To see this more clearly, it\u2019s crucial to understand that net neutrality concerns the delivery of data only once it reaches your internet provider\u2019s network, which is only a small part of the internet as a whole. To create an invisible \u201cfast lane\u201d for someone else, your provider is slowing your connection to the internet.Opponents of net neutrality argue that prioritization, blocking and throttling will actually increase innovation. Certain services, they say, require a special channel that can be shielded from congestion. What they fail to mention is that it\u2019s already possible to create dedicated internet links that guarantee a highly reliable connection, and that this is commonplace today within the framework of a neutral internet. In fact, we do it at Philo to ensure uninterrupted delivery of television feeds from content providers to our servers.The truth is that these arguments are a cover \u2014 what internet providers opposed to net neutrality really want is the ability to extract payments from companies that simply want their consumers to have equal access to their services.The repeal seems all but assured. Despite more than three-quarters of Americans supporting the current rules, Mr. Pai and many of the other commissioners of the F.C.C., which is to vote on the proposal on Thursday, seem intent on listening only to Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and other large internet providers.But we shouldn\u2019t stop fighting to make our voices heard. If Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal is adopted, we must take the fight to Congress and the courts until we regain a neutral internet that ensures consumer choice without constraint and innovation without barriers. It is a fight we should never concede \u2014 the importance of a free and open internet is too great.Andrew McCollum is the chief executive of Philo, an internet television company.Advertisement"}

Real estate developers and technology companies could see big tax cuts, while low-income households and people buying health insurance could lose out.With the bill finally headed to a vote this coming week, taxpayers are scrambling to determine whether the legislation renders them winners or losers.Under current law, that income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Under the bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent, subject to some limitations. Real estate also avoided new limits on interest deductions and retained its ability to defer taxes on the exchange of similar kinds of properties. The benefits of lower rates on pass-through income will extend to Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner\u2019s partners at real estate investment trusts as well. At the last minute, lawmakers added language to make it easier for real estate owners to avoid some of the pass-through provision\u2019s restrictions and maximize the tax benefits even more.Want to know how the tax bill will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Plus, American companies will no longer owe full corporate taxes on future profits they say they earn abroad, providing more incentive to push income into tax haven subsidiaries. The law even includes provisions that could encourage companies to move workers abroad, despite pledges to do the opposite.Plus, the top rate applying to wages and interest income would be cut to 37 percent from 39.6 percent.Patricia Mazzei, Thomas Kaplan and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.C.C. Repeals Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.\u201cWe are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have more incentive to build networks, especially to underserved areas.\u201dHis plan for the net neutrality rules, first outlined early this year, set off a flurry of opposition. The issue has bubbled up occasionally for more than a decade, with the debate getting more intense over the years as digital services have become more ingrained in everyday life.Critics of the changes say that consumers will have more difficulty accessing content online and that start-ups will have to pay to reach consumers. In the past week, there have been hundreds of protests across the country, and many websites have encouraged users to speak up against the repeal.In front of a room packed with reporters and television cameras from the major networks, the two Democratic commissioners warned of consumer harms to come from the changes.Mignon Clyburn, one of the Democratic commissioners, presented two accordion folders full of letters protesting the changes, and accused the three Republican commissioners of defying the wishes of millions of Americans by ceding their oversight authority.\u201cI dissent, because I am among the millions outraged,\u201d said Ms. Clyburn. \u201cOutraged, because the F.C.C. pulls its own teeth, abdicating responsibility to protect the nation\u2019s broadband consumers.\u201dBrendan Carr, a Republican commissioner, said it was a \u201cgreat day\u201d and dismissed critics\u2019 \u201capocalyptic\u201d warnings.\u201cI\u2019m proud to end this two-year experiment with heavy-handed regulation,\u201d Mr. Carr said.During Mr. Pai\u2019s speech before the vote, security guards entered the meeting room at the F.C.C. headquarters and told everyone to evacuate. The commissioners were ushered out a back door. The agency did not say what had caused the evacuation, other than Mr. Pai saying it had been done \u201con advice of security.\u201d The hearing restarted a short time later.Despite all the uproar, it is unclear how much will eventually change for internet users. Major telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast, as well as two of the industry\u2019s major trade groups, have promised consumers that their experiences online would not change.Mr. Pai and his Republican colleagues have echoed the comments of the telecom companies, which have told regulators that because of the limits to their business imposed by the rules, they weren\u2019t expanding and upgrading their networks as quickly as they wanted.\u201cThere is a lot of misinformation that this is the \u2018end of the world as we know it\u2019 for the internet,\u201d Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, David Cohen, wrote in a blog post this week. \u201cOur internet service is not going to change.\u201dBut with the F.C.C. making clear that it will no longer oversee the behavior of broadband providers, telecom experts said, the companies could feel freer to come up with new offerings, such as faster tiers of service for online businesses willing and able to pay for it. Some of those costs could be passed on to consumers.Those experts also said that such prioritization could stifle certain political voices or give the telecom conglomerates with media assets an edge over their rivals.These critics of Mr. Pai, who was nominated by President Trump, said there isn\u2019t enough competition in the broadband market to trust that the companies will try to offer the best services. The rule changes, they believe, give providers incentive to begin charging websites to reach consumers.\u201cLet\u2019s remember why we have these rules in the first place,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, the trade group. \u201cThere is little competition in the broadband service market.\u201dDozens of Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have pushed for Congress to pass a law on the issue.One Republican commissioner, Mike O\u2019Reilly, said he supported a law created by Congress for net neutrality. But he said any law should be less restrictive than the 2015 rules, protecting the ability of companies to charge for faster lanes, a practice known as \u201cpaid prioritization.\u201dAny legislative action appears to be far off, however, and numerous online companies warned that the changes approved on Thursday should be taken seriously.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have net neutrality protections that enforce tenets of fairness online, you give internet service providers the ability to choose winners and losers,\u201d Steve Huffman, chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. \u201cThis is not hyperbole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Women in Jazz, a Year of Reckoning and Recognition", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byViewers watched \u2014 usually a few thousand at a time \u2014 as Ms. Spalding demonstrated complex parts to her pianist, or decided whether to keep or ditch each take. \u201cExposure\u201d showed that it was possible to turn the technical, obsessive process of recording jazz into a public spectacle. This could have fascinating implications.That recording studios are among the most male-dominated spaces in the music industry and Ms. Spalding was often the only woman in the room felt like an afterthought at best.Maybe it bears mentioning, though, that \u201cExposure\u201d was one of many arresting statements made by female jazz instrumentalists this year. It has been a period of painful revelation and reckoning for women in the workplace across the country, and the same was true for jazz. But 2017 also felt like a moment of progress.Possibly for the first time, festival presenters could no longer get away with booking one or two female musicians next to a heap of men. \u201cThe awareness of it not being equitable for men and women in jazz has really come to a bit of a head,\u201d said Terri Lyne Carrington, 52, an esteemed drummer who has long spoken out about sexism in the music industry. \u201cAs far as it resulting in more female instrumentalists becoming recognized \u2014 whether it\u2019s albums or festivals or gigs \u2014 that\u2019s steadily getting better.\u201dPerhaps the most startling debut albums in jazz this year were \u201cFly or Die,\u201d by the trumpeter Jaimie Branch, and \u201cMannequins,\u201d by the drummer Kate Gentile. Ms. Gentile plays original compositions that are at once grimy and resonant, tightly layered and charged with momentum. Ms. Branch uses extended technique and blustery abstraction to a dizzying effect.A mentor to Ms. Branch, the flutist Nicole Mitchell, 50, had a banner year herself. The highlight was \u201cMandorla Awakening II: Emerging Worlds,\u201d an album recorded with her Black Earth Ensemble, an eight-piece band playing percussion, strings and reeds from traditions across the globe. The suite bears the markings of communal expression, with a sound that\u2019s grounded and raw.\u201cI really feel like I had a unique experience because I came up under Nicole and Dee Alexander,\u201d Ms. Reid said. \u201cWhen I was just getting into improvised music, I saw women leaders, women composers. I saw women putting projects together.\u201dIn October, the Spanish-born pianist Marta S\u00e1nchez celebrated the release of a fine new album, \u201cDanza Imposible,\u201d with a performance at the Jazz Gallery, her quartet playing deft, loosely spooled originals and passing the melodies between instruments. Simona Premazzi also released a remarkable album this year, \u201cOutspoken,\u201d replete with tilting melodies and craftily idiosyncratic piano playing.Ms. Thurman almost didn\u2019t pursue a career in music. At New York\u2019s prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, she endured sabotage from male classmates and a shrugging response from teachers. \u201cA few of them really made it difficult for us females in the band,\u201d she said of her classmates, remembering that some girls quit playing altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s implemented at an early age, these concepts of what gender is and what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed it happen to a lot of my female peers, who are very young, and that\u2019s discouraged them,\u201d Ms. Berliner said in an interview.In Montclair, N.J., the nonprofit Jazz House Kids brings jazz education to a diverse grade school population. Its president and founder, Melissa Walker, has spent the past five years beefing up her female faculty and developing a residency for girls called Chica Power.\u201cThe young girls would ask questions and talk about how they\u2019re in their high school jazz band and they\u2019re not invited to solo, or their teacher will say young girls in jazz don\u2019t play as well as boys,\u201d Ms. Walker said. \u201cThese sessions began to really reveal that a little \u2018chica power\u2019 is needed.\u201dLooking again at Mr. Glasper\u2019s comments, he was verging toward a critical point. Contemporary jazz hasn\u2019t figured out how to relate to its audience. Crowds often seem to wonder, Are we here to share an improvisational ritual or to quietly consume a luxury item? This fall I saw two bright moments when artists offered novel responses to this question, reframing the act of performance and pulling the audience in close.Two weeks later, the alto saxophonist Matana Roberts was performing at the BRIC Jazzfest in Downtown Brooklyn when she asked the crowd to hum a single note as she improvised. She cued our voices with one hand and played with the other. Periodically, she would take the saxophone from her mouth and blurt out an observation or a quip, typically something personal, mostly about how she was coping with life in the Trump era. Other times, she invited listeners to ask her questions. Then she would resume playing, and the audience would again start to sing. By the end of this show, the entire room was smiling, making eye contact, moved.There\u2019s nothing to suggest that these two musicians expressed themselves in any particular way because of their gender. But what we know is that until recently they might not have been in a position to stand up onstage alone, addressing the audience with generosity and informality, empowering the room, imagining the music as a space of open unity.Advertisement"}

The best, worst, stupidest and funniest of those jokes become memes, and either you get them or you don\u2019t.But if you don\u2019t and, like me, you\u2019re a sad nerd desperate to understand the gags you\u2019re missing, there\u2019s a site dedicated to helping.The site has a home page but, like Wikipedia, it is chiefly useful when looking up specific entries. It is amazingly comprehensive, given that it is run by a skeleton team of six writers and one developer out of a small office in Brooklyn, near the Williamsburg Bridge. But much of the work of the site is done by a group of 38 volunteer moderators.They\u2019re known as the meme council. These are some of their stories.Mr. Johnson grew up on a farm in Oklahoma with a spotty internet connection. That meant that unlike many other council members, the first internet communities he was a part of were not on networks like 4chan, Reddit, Twitter or even Facebook, which could take longer to load.Much of what Mr. Johnson does for the site may seem like busy work: He makes sure images are properly tagged, and edited.Mr. Johnson is an outdoorsman, and he has worked for the United States Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. But online, he said, he has found people who share some of his more esoteric interests, such as Japanese video games like Touhou, which he knows a great deal about despite never having played it.Those shared interests have made the meme council a comfortable place for Mr. Johnson, who feels close with several other moderators.\u201cSome mods I would be more open to telling certain things about my life than my family or real-life friends,\u201d he said.A younger moderator, Mr. Tieu was introduced to KnowYourMeme in a little more standard way than Mr. Johnson was. He said that he was an outsider growing up and that social media platforms \u2014 first Facebook and YouTube and eventually Twitter and Reddit \u2014 allowed him to make connections more easily.Mr. Tieu found himself gravitating to memes early, hoping to ensure that people understood their source material. He said he was drawn to KnowYourMeme for its value as a database.\u201cYeah, I just kind of took stuff pretty seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I just kind of mellowed out.\u201dDespite Mr. Tieu\u2019s change in attitude, he continues as a prolific member of the meme council. He has helped write and edit dozens of pages on the site and created entries for the cartoons \u201cLolirock\u201d and \u201cMiraculous Ladybug,\u201d a French-Korean cartoon that he remains passionate about.Ms. Brennan is not on the meme council. A former staff member at Know Your Meme, she now works at Tumblr, where she works with various fan communities.But Ms. Brennan said she thought a moderator\u2019s age was as big an influence on on-site behavior as gender. And she praises moderators\u2019 passion and thoroughness.\u201cI was the one always pushing them to cite their sources, and they\u2019re like, \u2018I already did,\u2019\u201d she said.Mr. Turnage began to interact with internet communities when a college friend showed him 4chan, a sprawling web forum where much of internet culture is spawned.He was asked to join the meme council in 2014, after writing about 50 articles for the site.One of Mr. Turnage\u2019s main interests is the brony fandom, a community of adult fans of \u201cMy Little Pony.\u201d When pushed, he said it would be fair to call him one of the world\u2019s foremost brony historians.\u201cThat\u2019s actually what brought me to the site and started me editing articles,\u201d he said.Bronies, he said, are \u201cjust a real friendly personal community, kind of lighthearted and fun to be around. I had known what had gone on in the fandom and was able to expand on that.\u201dLike many of his peers on the meme council, Mr. Turnage moved frequently as a child and often had to fend for himself socially. One way he found to occupy himself led directly to the work he does for KnowYourMeme today.\u201cI like research,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to track down the source and kind of have it all there and kind of know the story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Sees Little Evidence of Russian Meddling in \u2018Brexit\u2019 Vote", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an emailed statement, Facebook said the Russian agency that had spent $100,000 advertising on its platform to influence the United States presidential election last year had spent only 97 cents on advertisements that were delivered to British users during the two months before the referendum, on June 23, 2016.Those 97 cents bought three ads, all centered on immigration and aimed at American users, Facebook said. The ads were viewed just 200 times by British users over four days in May 2016, the company said.Damian Collins, the Conservative chairman of the committee, questioned Facebook\u2019s findings, saying the company did not conduct a thorough search, something the company denied.Facebook executives said a search for potential foreign interference in the two months before the British vote had not turned up any Russian advertising spending other than the three ads from the Russian entity. That company, known as the Internet Research Agency, has been identified by American intelligence agencies as the troll farm the Russian government used to influence the United States election.Facebook did not disclose what steps it had taken in its internal review, and the British lawmaker who had requested the information accused the company of searching too narrowly. It remained possible that Russia found other ways to use Facebook or other social media to influence the referendum, known as Brexit.Laura Cram, a political scientist at the University of Edinburgh who studies the internet, said the extent of Russian interference was impossible to assess without the public disclosure of a list of Kremlin-linked accounts active in Britain. \u201cWe don\u2019t either have the evidence yet to say that there was no set of users that targeted Brexit or indeed the U.K. general election,\u201d she said in an email.\u201cOver all, I think the Russian activity during Brexit seems to have been minimal,\u201d said an author of the study, Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies at Oxford University and director of the institute, which studies online propaganda. \u201cThe real source of misinformation about the Brexit debate was homegrown.\u201dIf confirmed, the Facebook statement and the Oxford study would upend the widespread presumptions of scholars and analysts that Russia must have meddled in the Brexit vote. Russia has long perceived the European Union as a regional rival, and its English-language propaganda outlets like Sputnik and RT pushed hard for the \u201cleave\u201d side in the referendum.So Russia\u2019s apparent lack of interest in a covert social media campaign for Brexit like those it was simultaneously applying in the United States and elsewhere would be a puzzle.Mr. Collins, the Conservative lawmaker, remained unconvinced by Facebook\u2019s answer. He said in an email that he had asked Facebook for details about \u201cany adverts and pages paid for or set up by Russian-linked accounts.\u201d Mr. Collins said Facebook had looked at only about 470 accounts and pages run by the Internet Research Agency, which had already been identified as active in the American election.\u201cIt would appear that no work has been done by Facebook to look for Russian activity around the E.U. referendum, other than from funded advertisements from those accounts that had already been identified as part of the U.S. Senate\u2019s investigation,\u201d he said.Facebook disputed that characterization of its search, which it said had been more extensive.The Russian company posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that were shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017, and those posts were liked, shared and followed by others \u2014 reaching tens of millions more people, Facebook said.Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app, Instagram, that had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content.Facebook is by far the most widely used social media platform in Britain. But because the content of its pages is not publicly accessible, researchers seeking evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit vote have focused mainly on Twitter.Twitter, in its own responses to congressional investigators, has identified 2,752 accounts linked to the Kremlin that were active around the American election.A study reported last month by professors at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, found that 419 of those accounts had posted 3,500 times using Brexit hash tags. Although more than 70 percent of those posts took place after the vote, and thus too late to influence it, 38 of the accounts tweeted about Brexit a total of 400 times on the day of the vote.A separate study, from the Swansea University, in Wales, found that more than 150,000 Russian-language Twitter accounts had posted tens of thousands of messages about Brexit in the days before the referendum. Upon closer inspection, however, most of those messages appear to be links to news articles.The scholars who conducted both studies said that neither constituted conclusive evidence of a Kremlin campaign.Advertisement"}

We\u2019re all right!\u2019\u201d Ms. Reilly wrote. \u201c\u2018No, we\u2019re not!\u2019 I screamed back at him.\u201dHere\u2019s how to avoid moments of white-knuckle panic like that one.It forms during rain when the air temperature is at or below 32 degrees at the surface of the road.It can also form when the temperature of the pavement or a bridge deck is the same as the dew point, said Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Transportation.\u201cAt freezing temperatures, dew will freeze, causing black ice,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThis can happen any time, but seems to be more prevalent at night, when there\u2019s no solar heating.\u201dPavement with black ice will be slightly darker and duller than the rest of the road surface.If the road is glistening and the tires of the car in front of you are spraying water, you have little to fear, but if the road looks wet and there\u2019s no spray, beware, said Robert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman for AAA Northeast in Garden City, N.Y.Drivers should pay close attention to the thermometer on their car, which measures the ambient temperature of the air, said Sam Schwartz, who was the traffic commissioner for New York City from 1982-86.Vehicle thermometers, which were once subject to inaccurate readings depending on the placement of sensors, have improved over the years, he added.Roads in heavily populated and traveled areas are less likely to have black ice compared with those in rural or suburban areas, Mr. Schwartz said.Black ice can also form at the bottoms of hills and in areas that are heavily shaded.The State Department of Transportation relies on roadway sensors to help monitor conditions, Ms. Post wrote. Anti-icing materials, such as salt brine or salt, can be used to treat trouble spots in advance.\u201cYou hit a patch of ice on a turn, that\u2019s it,\u201d Mr. Sinclair said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some very capable driving skills, high-tech vehicular performance and nifty tires to avoid something bad happening.\u201dMr. Schwartz warned against trying to pass a poky driver ahead of you.

Fill it out, and the items can be delivered that day \u2014 along with, say, palmiers and croissants from Ms. Rose\u2019s adjoining bakery.Blackbarn\u2019s co-founder, Mark Zeff, says immersive shopping like this is the future of brick-and-mortar retail, which he believes is being clobbered by online shopping in part because \u201cpeople are sick of walking down the street and seeing these homogeneous big brands, one next to the other.\u201d\u201cWe just wanted to do something that was that comprehensive that we had real ownership and authorship of,\u201d Ms. Standefer said. When designing other people\u2019s restaurants, she said, \u201cwe could only control so much.\u201dNow they run the entire show, weighing in on Ms. Rose\u2019s menu and, of course, how \u2014 and on what \u2014 it is served. In keeping with its \u201csimple but refined\u201d style, Ms. Rose\u2019s food will be plated on a high-low, intentionally mismatched combination of ceramics sourced from Japan, Sweden, Australia and Denmark, eaten with vintage French silverware and dabbed away by linens made in Sweden. A light soup might arrive in a substantial Japanese clay donabe; a homey ch\u00e8vre cheesecake on a delicate plate (also Japanese).The cultural, and textural, misappropriations are intentional. While Mr. Alesch says that he and Ms. Standefer are seasoned business professionals, \u201cwe really try to take a chill pill when it comes to all the rules and regulations of interiors.\u201dAs for food, Mr. Alesch, an avid home cook and host, said: \u201cAt home, we\u2019re pretty wild.

{"Headline": "An Alabama Sheriff, a Mystery Check and a Blogger Who Cried Foul", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDECATUR, Ala. \u2014 One evening last fall, an informant for the Morgan County sheriff entered the office of a small construction business near this old river town and, he said, secretly installed spyware on a company computer. He had no warrant.The sheriff, Ana Franklin, wanted to know who was leaking information about her to a blogger known as the Morgan County Whistleblower.The blogger had been zeroing in on the sheriff\u2019s finances, specifically $150,000 that by law should have gone toward feeding inmates in the county jail. Instead it had been invested in a now-bankrupt used-car dealership run by a convicted bank swindler.What, if anything, investigators have uncovered is not known. But The New York Times found that since taking office in 2011, Sheriff Franklin has failed to comply with court orders, has threatened critics with legal action and has not publicly accounted for tens of thousands of dollars raised through charity events.\u201cIn certain jurisdictions there is a feeling by sheriffs that this is my fiefdom \u2014 I am in charge, my way or the highway,\u201d said Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer at the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, which has filed lawsuits against a number of sheriffs. \u201cSometimes that kind of culture can lead to sort of a sheriffs-gone-wild kind of behavior.\u201d\u201cMostly we protect people from criminals, but sometimes we protect them from an overreaching government,\u201d said Brad Rogers, the sheriff of Elkhart County, Ind. He added: \u201cI\u2019m answerable to the people. I have a face and a name. Try asking the federal government for a face and a name.\u201dIn two interviews with The Times, the sheriff said she had done nothing illegal and had not violated anyone\u2019s civil rights. \u201cI have worked my tail off to try to do the right thing and make the best decisions that I can make,\u201d she said.She said she had tried to make her agency more accountable, and added, \u201cSince I have taken office, I have attempted to train these deputies, to equip them, to manage them in the piddly little budget that I\u2019ve been given.\u201d As for the federal inquiry, the sheriff said, \u201cThe F.B.I. has not informed me of any such investigation.\u201dThe sheriff makes no apologies for her belief that voters and the state constitution allow her to carry out her own vision of law enforcement. \u201cI run it based on what the public wants or likes,\u201d she said.While some see that attitude as a defense of liberty, others worry that it is simply license for sheriffs to act as if they are above the law.\u201cThere\u2019s a glorified notion of local sovereignty that flies in the face of 200 years of constitutional progress in the United States,\u201d said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit focusing on issues of democracy and equal rights. \u201cSheriffs have an important role, but the fact that they\u2019re elected does not mean they\u2019re not required to operate within the law and the Constitution.\u201dThe deputies had no warrant or other authority to conduct the search, the suit charged. No drugs were found.Soraya Kawucha, a former deputy sheriff who teaches criminal justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Tex., called sheriffs the rarely studied \u201cbastard son\u201d of law enforcement. \u201cResearchers either ignored sheriffs or made erroneous conclusions that we were no different than police departments,\u201d Ms. Kawucha said.Because sheriffs have no direct supervision, criminal prosecution or lawsuits may be the only checks against those who abuse their power. The Georgia sheriff was recently indicted in connection with the mass search and has pleaded not guilty. The lawsuit resulted in a $3 million settlement.In Florida, a federal appeals court ruled in 2014 that detectives from the St. Johns County sheriff\u2019s office had violated the constitutional rights of a defendant during what his lawyer had assumed was a privileged and private meeting in a closed interview room at the sheriff\u2019s office. Unbeknown to the lawyer, Anne Marie Gennusa, detectives were secretly monitoring the conversation. When the client handed Ms. Gennusa a written statement, detectives rushed in, \u201cforcibly grabbed\u201d it and arrested him, attaching the statement to his arrest report, court records show.County governments have budgetary control over sheriffs, but little else. They can threaten to withhold money, but they open themselves up to criticism that they are endangering law and order.It took a defamation lawsuit for Sheriff Smith to finally admit this year that he had lied; the suit was settled with $125,000 in public funds. \u201cTechnically, he answers to voters, but I would say he really answered to no one,\u201d said Michael Sussman, a lawyer for Mr. Levy. In November, voters finally had enough and tossed him from office.Sheriffs can submit to voluntary state or national accreditation surveys, but their agencies rarely have their credentials taken from them for rule violations.Some sheriffs have been in office so long that evicting them is almost unthinkable, regardless of their records.It later emerged that the officers had pressured a key witness into lying about Mr. McMillian. Lending haunting resonance to the case was its venue: Monroeville, home of Harper Lee, whose novel \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d told a strikingly similar story. Mr. McMillian was eventually freed.How do voters feel about Sheriff Tate? He has been elected seven times and is in his third decade in office.Ana Franklin, the state\u2019s only female sheriff, did not follow a traditional path into law enforcement. Raised in this working-class city a short distance across the Tennessee River from Huntsville and the Army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal, she ran a bridal shop, posed as a nightclub \u201ccalendar girl\u201d in miniskirt and fishnets, trained German shepherds and ran a fitness center.She was elected in 2010, defeating an unpopular incumbent. But she had another advantage, at least according to Glenda Lockhart, otherwise known as the Morgan County Whistleblower: She comes across as \u201cjust the most sweet, innocent, hard-working person you could ever imagine,\u201d Ms. Lockhart said.Now in her second term with plans to run for a third, Sheriff Franklin, 53, broke into police work in neighboring Limestone County, under the tutelage of its longtime sheriff, Mike Blakely.It was there that she learned the importance of annual rodeos for fund-raising and publicity. No one in the state did it bigger or better than Sheriff Blakely. With a skybox selling for $650, the events have raised close to a million dollars for law enforcement and for reinvestment in rodeo operations, he estimated. Voters must take him at his word, because rodeo money is not among the nine revenue streams audited by the state, records show.The Morgan County rodeo had been a smaller affair until Sheriff Franklin took office. She installed an A.T.M. just outside the gate, allowing people to pay cash not only for admission but for concessions. And she asked employees and volunteers to sell advertisements to local businesses. Before long, the ad book more than tripled in size.Rick Sherman, a former deputy, said he sold ads while on duty. \u201cI\u2019m an armed law enforcement officer asking for money, and that\u2019s never a good thing,\u201d said Mr. Sherman, who left his job nearly two years ago after a falling-out with Sheriff Franklin. He said he had also been asked to work without pay at the rodeo. The sheriff said she did not force anyone to sell ads or work without pay.Sheriff Franklin said the rodeo brought in about $20,000 a year in profit, but she has never publicly accounted for all the money, except to say that it went to local charities and law enforcement. She promised to produce financial records for her rodeo, but a month later gave only names of charities and no amounts. The rodeo\u2019s financial records, she said, were \u201creviewed by a C.P.A. firm.\u201dIn interviews, the sheriff gave differing accounts about who processed the rodeo cash. First she said the money went through a tax-exempt organization set up a couple of years ago called Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Rodeo. Before that, the money was kept in a regular account, she said.After The Times could find no group by that name registered with the Internal Revenue Service, Sheriff Franklin corrected herself, saying rodeo proceeds had actually gone to a different nonprofit: Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Mounted Posse, founded in 1963.Normally, tax-exempt organizations must file annual financial reports for public inspection. But Sheriff Franklin\u2019s is exempt from public disclosure because of an I.R.S. loophole for charities affiliated with government agencies. \u201cThe I.R.S. assumes organizations controlled by governmental entities will be good tax citizens,\u201d said Marc Owens, former director of the I.R.S. division of exempt organizations.The Times identified 19 such organizations \u2014 not all of them related to rodeos \u2014 affiliated with Alabama sheriffs. The sheriff in Etowah County has three.Asked to explain how their rodeo profits were managed, three sheriffs gave names of nonprofit groups that they said held the money, but a search of government records could find no such entities. One sheriff said his rodeo was a tax-exempt nonprofit, even though it is incorporated as a for-profit business.The fact that sheriffs\u2019 offices are handling large, unaudited sums of money has drawn the attention of government investigators.The fourth item \u2014 a major drug arrest.The mere mention of Ms. Lockhart is enough to shear off Sheriff Franklin\u2019s folksy veneer. A liar, a fabricator, a crazy woman: That is how she describes Ms. Lockhart. \u201cI have never in my life heard of anything like this or been through anything like this,\u201d the sheriff said.Ms. Lockhart stands by her postings. The diminutive grandmother became a whistle-blower after retiring as a security manager at the Redstone Arsenal, using her military research skills to shadow the sheriff and her allies.Ms. Lockhart first took an interest in the sheriff after deputies came to her rural home in July 2011 to investigate a supposed disturbance. What happened next is in dispute, but she and her husband, Harold Lockhart, say the officers found nothing but refused to leave when asked.Deputies arrested the couple after Mr. Lockhart, a retired military police officer, said he had had enough and was calling his lawyer. The Lockharts successfully sued the sheriff for false arrest. And while the sheriff was not present for the arrest and later said she knew nothing about it, Ms. Lockhart did not forget.\u201cI decided then I was not going to sit back and take it,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people can\u2019t afford to fight it, so I started watching.\u201dWith a profitable construction business, Ms. Lockhart had the resources to pursue complaints big and small. \u201cI waited until employees were fired \u2014 then I would tell them I was the Morgan County Whistleblower,\u201d she said.This year she even went so far as to hire a pilot to fly her over southern Alabama, where she videotaped a stretch of land that she believed the sheriff had secretly obtained for her horses. That suspicion, Sheriff Franklin says, is not backed by a scintilla of evidence.There was, however, more than enough evidence to link the sheriff to Priceville Partners L.L.C., a get-rich-quick scheme that spread a toxic cloud over the business community.A used-car dealership offering title loans, Priceville Partners had begun opening branches around the county, and investors were welcome. Ordinarily, law officers might investigate rather than invest in a business co-owned by the likes of Greg Steenson, who had done prison time for a multimillion-dollar check-kiting scheme. But several officers from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, along with Morgan County deputies, became financially involved, records show. One agent texted another asking if he wanted a one-month $7,000 profit on a $10,000 investment. Sheriff Franklin\u2019s father worked there; her daughter did the bookkeeping.The sheriff invested $150,000. She would later say that she had not known Mr. Steenson was a co-owner, even though her daughter said that was clear from her first day on the job.Ms. Lockhart had begun blogging about the dealership in 2015, after noticing the proximity of the lawbreaker and the law enforcers. She was not the only one watching. So was the F.B.I. in Huntsville, which soon became a popular destination for those with stories to tell about the sheriff or the dealership. In local lingo, they \u201cwent across the river.\u201dIn January, after Ms. Lockhart published a copy of Sheriff Franklin\u2019s $150,000 cashier\u2019s check \u2014 signed over to Priceville Partners \u2014 the sheriff\u2019s lawyer, Barnes F. Lovelace Jr., accused the blogger of obtaining it illegally. \u201cA criminal investigation has been initiated,\u201d he wrote to Ms. Lockhart. No charges have been filed.The sheriff had once even threatened legal action against the creators of a Facebook page seeking \u201cJustice for Aubie,\u201d a golden retriever shot to death by deputies during a drug raid. She said that the dog had lunged at the officers, and that the page was intended to \u201cinflame the public.\u201d A petition with 1,600 signatures was sent to the Alabama Sheriffs Association, asking that officers be taught how to handle pets with nonlethal force. Amid fears of a lawsuit, the Facebook page came down.Sheriff Franklin\u2019s mystery check was not so easily dismissed. According to The Decatur Daily, she said that the money had come from her savings and retirement accounts. Her lawyer later said it was invested in a \u201clegitimate business,\u201d a strange description for an enterprise whose co-owner, the felon Mr. Steenson, had recently been arrested on new charges \u2014 of theft and forgery involving the dealership. The district attorney said Mr. Steenson sold vehicles for which he had no title and then forged people\u2019s names. (Priceville Partners filed for bankruptcy last year.)Sheriff Franklin eventually admitted the money had been withdrawn from an account earmarked for feeding inmates. For some Alabama sheriffs, that wouldn\u2019t have posed a problem. But Morgan County was different.Ana Franklin had her eyes on inmate food money even before she took office.In preparing for her new job, she asked the county attorney if surplus food money would be hers to keep. His answer, according to press reports at the time, was no.That sheriffs would be able to profit from inmate food money comes down to an unusual provision of Alabama law: In most counties \u2014 Morgan included \u2014 food money is deposited not into government accounts, but into sheriffs\u2019 personal accounts. Nearly a decade ago, when inmates\u2019 lawyers demanded to know how much of this money Alabama sheriffs were keeping for personal use, the state sheriffs\u2019 association instructed them not to answer.But while other sheriffs have legally kept the surplus money, Sheriff Franklin was bound by a federal consent decree that all her inmate food money be used for just that \u2014 food.That court order stems from a legal action that the Southern Center brought against Sheriff Franklin\u2019s predecessor, Greg Bartlett, who had been underfeeding inmates while taking $212,000 in food money for his personal use. In a signature moment as sheriff, Mr. Bartlett paid half-price for a truckload of unsold corn dogs and for three months fed them to inmates for breakfast, lunch and dinner, earning himself the sobriquet \u201cSheriff Corn Dog.\u201dAfter the source of the $150,000 came to light, Sheriff Franklin said that because of bad legal advice, she had not realized she was violating the court order. Besides, she said, she had returned the money, and her prisoners received nutritious meals.Ms. Geraghty, the Southern Center lawyer, disagreed. She sent the sheriff a letter this year reporting inmate complaints of \u201creduced or watered-down portions,\u201d and food that was frozen, had mold or contained rocks or, in one case, a nail. \u201cDuring a recent meal at which chicken was served,\u201d Ms. Geraghty wrote, \u201cmany inmates reportedly received cooking liquid from the pan in place of meat because the kitchen ran out of chicken.\u201dThose complaints, the sheriff\u2019s lawyer said, amounted to a tiny fraction of all meals served \u2014 a record any restaurant would be pleased with. Ms. Geraghty did not press her case, citing the \u201cexceedingly low constitutional bar\u201d required to satisfy the consent decree\u2019s mandate for improved food. The food order was ultimately lifted, but not before a federal judge found Sheriff Franklin in contempt of court and fined her $1,000.The sheriff\u2019s office also did not comply with a judge\u2019s order that an inmate not be allowed to work outside the jail because he posed a danger to the community. Sheriff Franklin said she had since changed jail policy to prevent that from happening again.Sheriffs have found other ways to squeeze money out of inmates. Some take a percentage of service contracts, including commissary sales and telephone charges. In Morgan County, a company that just won the jail phone contract pays the county a 90 percent commission on all its revenue from prisoners\u2019 calls. In St. Johns County, Fla., the sheriff brings in tens of thousands of dollars a year by charging inmates \u201cprocessing fees.\u201dIn Morgan County, the sheriff oversees 19 different income streams and collects 25 percent of inmate wages. None of this money is supposed to personally benefit the sheriff.Sheriff Franklin said she stayed within her budget, economizing, for example, by hanging inmate clothes on the line to dry. \u201cIt saved me $63,000,\u201d she said.In October last year, armed with a warrant, the sheriff\u2019s drug task force seized Ms. Lockhart\u2019s computers and electronic devices, court records show. In preparing for the raid, the sheriff hired an unusual spy \u2014 Ms. Lockhart\u2019s 19-year-old grandson, Daniel Lockhart, who aspired to work in law enforcement.Mr. Lockhart said the sheriff\u2019s technology expert had instructed him on how to plant spyware. The raid took place about a week after he said he installed the software.Mr. Lockhart had been living with his grandparents and working in their business. He gained access to the office after hours, he said, by telling Ms. Lockhart that his girlfriend needed an office computer for homework. Ms. Lockhart said she later discovered the spyware on her home computer as well and took it to the F.B.I., which has retained it.The sheriff denied that the seizure was retaliatory, telling the news media, \u201cNot until her personal agenda, her hatefulness and her vengeance to try and tear this office down, to take this office and myself down, and prepare for another election, did she cross the line of criminal activity.\u201dBut over a year later, Ms. Lockhart has yet to be charged, and says she broke no laws. The investigation continues, the sheriff said, though she was unsure who was directing it. \u201cIt\u2019s not my investigation,\u201d she said.Sheriff Franklin admits to hiring the grandson, but denies that she or anyone in her office asked him to install spyware. \u201cWe have absolute proof, \u201d Mr. Lovelace, the sheriff\u2019s lawyer, wrote to The Times. He produced an analysis of Ms. Lockhart\u2019s business computers by a firm he hired that, he said, found no spyware. Several parts of that report were omitted, he said, because of a continuing criminal investigation that he was not at liberty to describe.The sheriff\u2019s denial is undercut by four people who told The Times separately that they had knowledge that the sheriff\u2019s office taught Mr. Lockhart how to install the spyware. Among them was Ricky Brewer, the sheriff\u2019s former technology officer, who said he told the F.B.I. that his replacement acknowledged giving the grandson the software.Mr. Lockhart said in a sworn statement that he had been paid several hundred dollars and participated only because he had been told that the investigation focused on the county jail warden, not his grandmother, and that she would not get in trouble.Two months before the raid, a similar operation against another critical blogger had occurred in Terrebonne Parish, La. The sheriff there, Jerry Larpenter, accused the blogger of \u201ccriminal defamation.\u201dA federal judge, Lance Africk, found the raid unconstitutional, explaining the danger this way: \u201cIf you speak ill of the sheriff of your parish, then the sheriff will direct his law enforcement resources toward forcibly entering your home and taking your belongings under the guise of a criminal investigation.\u201dHere in Morgan County, Ms. Lockhart has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Sheriff Franklin of violating her right to free speech, invading her privacy and slandering her, charges the sheriff denies. Ms. Lockhart\u2019s computers, containing vital company records, were returned only after a court hearing.All the while, the Morgan County Whistleblower continues to fire away. \u201cThere is no way of stating how terrified Sheriff Ana Franklin is right now,\u201d Ms. Lockhart wrote last month. And she added, \u201cShe is scared to death that some of her loyalists will cross the river and roll.\u201dRebecca R. Ruiz and Ellen Gabler contributed reporting. Agustin Almendariz and Susan C.

We\u2019ve curtailed our water selection. But this is totally outside that whole realm.\u201dHere on the West Coast and in other pockets around the country, many people are looking to get off the water grid.And Liquid Eden, a water store that opened in San Diego three years ago, offers a variety of options, including fluoride-free, chlorine-free and a \u201cmineral electrolyte alkaline\u201d drinking water that goes for $2.50 a gallon.Trisha Kuhlmey, the owner, said the shop sells about 900 gallons of water a day, and sales have doubled every year as the \u201cwater consciousness movement\u201d grows.The quest for pure water is hardly new; people have been drinking from natural springs and collecting rainwater from time immemorial. The crusade against adding fluoride to public water began in the 1950s among Americans who saw danger in the protective measures that had been adopted over decades to protect the populace from disease and contamination.But the off-grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was, with sophisticated marketing, cultural cachet, millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters from Silicon Valley.One recent morning in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., Cody Friesen, the founder and chief executive of Zero Mass Water, was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor Skip Battle, a longtime tech leader who now sits on the boards of LinkedIn, Netflix and OpenTable.The system \u2014 called Source, which retails for $4,500, including installation \u2014 draws moisture from the air (the way rice does in a saltshaker) and filters it, producing about 10 liters of water a day and storing about 60 liters. The goal, Mr. Friesen said, is to make water \u201cthat\u2019s ultra high quality and secure, totally disconnected from all infrastructure.\u201d\u201cJust take a breath of air,\u201d said Mr. Friesen, a professor of materials science at Arizona State University. \u201cTake a deep breath. No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you can take a breath and own that air that you breathe. And yet water \u2014 the government brings it to you.\u201dMr. Battle\u2019s system runs on power from its own small solar panel. It feeds into a tap set up in his stone garden, where he goes to drink. He said he\u2019s been making all his meals and drinks with it.Mr. Battle poured himself a glass. \u201cThe water from the tap just doesn\u2019t taste quite as refreshing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is that because I saw it come off the roof, and anything from the roof feels special? Maybe.\u201dBefore he could order raw water on demand, Mr. Evans went \u201cspring hunting\u201d with friends. This has become more challenging lately: The closest spring around San Francisco has recently been cut off by landslides, so reaching it means crossing private property, which he does under cover of night.\u201cYou have to be agile and tactile, and be available to experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally, you have to carry bottles of water through the dark.\u201dThe founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show Mr. Singh (n\u00e9 Christopher Sanborn) sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest.Pure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter, the gold standard of home water treatment, but for Mr. Singh, the goal is not pristine water, per se. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get 99 percent of the bad stuff out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now you have dead water.\u201dHe said \u201creal water\u201d should expire after a few months. His does. \u201cIt stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it sits around too long, it\u2019ll turn green. People don\u2019t even realize that because all their water\u2019s dead, so they never see it turn green.\u201dMr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. \u201cTap water? You\u2019re drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,\u201d he said. \u201cChloramine, and on top of that they\u2019re putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it\u2019s a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.\u201d (There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.)\u201cWithout water treatment, there\u2019s acute and then chronic risks,\u201d Dr. Hensrud said, including E. coli bacteria, viruses, parasites and carcinogenic compounds that can be present in untreated water. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence all over the world of this, and the reason we don\u2019t have those conditions is because of our very efficient water treatment.\u201dDr. Hensrud said he has noticed more interest in alternative water sources; a patient recently asked questions about a raw water he had been drinking. \u201cThere are people, just like with immunizations, that don\u2019t accept the status quo,\u201d Dr. Hensrud said.The rules for selling bottled water are imposed by states and the Food and Drug Administration, which does not specify how water be treated but sets acceptable amounts of chemicals and bacteria at a low level. State and federal inspectors make unannounced visits to bottling plants to test for harmful contaminants.Seth Pruzansky, the chief executive of Tourmaline Spring (whose website touts its \u201csacred living\u201d water), got an exemption from the State of Maine in 2009 to sell his water untreated. \u201cThe natural food industry has been in the dark ages when it comes to water,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is a renaissance.\u201d\u201cFluoride? It\u2019s a deathly toxic chemical,\u201d said Vanessa Kuemmerle of Emeryville, Calif., who does landscape design for large tech companies. She said she was an early adopter of raw water, and has noticed many of her clients following suit.The health benefits she reported include better skin and the need to drink less water. \u201cMy skin\u2019s plumper,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019m getting better nutrition from the food I eat.\u201dIn the community of tap-water skeptics, many talk about water the way others might about fine wine.\u201cMy friends who drink spring water, when they come over now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh yeah, give me the good stuff,\u2019\u201d said Amanda Thompson, a writer in San Francisco. \u201cThe consciousness around water is changing.\u201dNot everyone has been receptive. Many San Franciscans are proud of their tap water, which comes from Hetch Hetchy, a reservoir in Yosemite National Park.\u201cMy landlord lives across the street and thinks I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Ms. Thompson said. \u201cHe gave me a big rant around Hetch Hetchy water and how the water\u2019s so good. I always hope he\u2019s not around when there\u2019s a delivery.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like \u2018raw water\u2019 because it sort of makes people think of raw sewage,\u201d Mr. Vitalis said. \u201cWhen you say \u2018live water,\u2019 that\u2019s going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology. Is it alive?\u201dAn earlier version of a caption misstated the connection between the Crooked River in Oregon and the aquifer tapped by Opal Springs Water Company. The aquifer feeds the river, not vice versa.Advertisement"}

He pounces on an older Muslim man, attacking him from behind and striking him over and over.\u201cBabu, save my life! Save my life!\u201d the Muslim man screams. He crumples to the ground, and a few seconds later, after several more blows from the pickax, he cries, \u201cI\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead.\u201d He soon is.The killing was captured on video \u2014 at the attacker\u2019s request. He had his nephew film the entire episode with a phone and proudly posted it on social media, bragging that he had killed the man to protect his Hindu community from Muslim jihadists.Fears are now rising again. Extra police officers were deployed Friday in Rajasthan to discourage possible copycat killings by Hindus or revenge attacks by Muslims.The killer\u2019s videos have continued to circulate \u2014 he made several. And in his rants on video and to journalists he said he had killed the Muslim man for \u201croaming around\u201d with a Hindu girl.Police officials have identified the killer as Shambhu Lal Raigar, an on-again, off-again marble trader in his mid-30s. He was arrested on Thursday morning hiding at a relative\u2019s house. According to police officials, Mr. Raigar confessed to the crime. He says as much on video, appearing in front of a statue of a Hindu god. \u201cIt may be good or bad, but I\u2019ve done it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I have to die, then why not kill and die?\u201dThe victim, seen in the video as a blurry image wearing a white Muslim prayer cap, was identified as Afrajul, a 50-year-old migrant laborer from the eastern state of West Bengal. Activists in the area said they did not know how much truth there was to the accusation that Mr. Afrajul, who was married with three children, was having an affair with a Hindu woman.There is no doubt, however, that the subject of relations between Muslim men and Hindu women is a flash point.Across India, Hindu supremacists have accused Muslim men of carrying out what they call \u201clove jihad.\u201d Hindu activists have urged young Hindu women to be on the lookout for Muslim men trying to lure them into marriage in order to convert them. Some politicians have turned \u201clove jihad\u201d into a rallying cry, using it to win votes \u2014 and polarize communities.Little is known about Mr. Raigar, the killer in the video, who comes across on camera as educated and calculated. He speaks at length about how black-clad jihadists want to destroy his community. He refers to the mosque demolition that happened in 1992.He first posted his videos on a WhatsApp group, Rajasthan activists said, and people in his community began forwarding it. According to the activists, Mr. Raigar lured Mr. Afrajul to a thinly populated area outside of Rajsamand, a midsize city, by promising him work as a day laborer.At the end of the killing video, Mr. Raigar sprinkles kerosene on Mr. Afrajul\u2019s body, sets it on fire and calmly walks away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All the New Gestures You\u2019re About to Learn on the iPhone X", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo swipe or not to swipe? That\u2019s the question on every iPhone X user\u2019s mind now that the home button is gone. While life without a home button takes some time getting used to, you\u2019ll get the hang of it after learning (and trying!) these 11 gestures on the iPhone X.The first gesture you\u2019ll need to learn is the most important one: how to get to the home screen after unlocking your phone with Face ID, Apple\u2019s new way of unlocking your iPhone with your face. Once your Face ID unlocks your phone, you\u2019ll need to swipe up from the bottom to get to the home screen. You don\u2019t need to memorize this tidbit; thankfully, you\u2019ll see a \u201cSwipe up to open\u201d message reminding you how to get to the home screen. You can also use this gesture when you\u2019re in an app or in control center.You\u2019re in! Now, to switch between apps gets a bit tricky. Back on regular iPhones, you used to do this by double-clicking on the home button and swiping left and right between apps. This feature, called the \u201capp switcher,\u201d works similarly on the iPhone X; swipe up from the bottom and then \u201cpause.\u201d All your open apps will appear (and you\u2019ll feel some haptic feedback to let you know this worked).To switch between apps, you can swipe left and right. However, let\u2019s say you spend a lot of time on a certain app like Facebook. Your iPhone will now make that the most recent app and you won\u2019t be able to swipe right anymore. If you\u2019re in an app, you\u2019ll see a small white bar at the bottom that you can use to navigate between apps, by swiping left and right.You now have two options to close an app as well. You can either use the app switcher to open all your apps and swipe up on a particular app to close it (keep in mind, however, that it will stay running in the background). Or, when you\u2019re using the app switcher, you can long-press on an app until you see red minus signs at the top of each app. Tap on the minus sign and the app will be forced close.And if you love your widgets, that customizable side panel where you can add the weather, see the latest top stories from Apple News and gain access to other tidbits of information from apps, no need to learn a new gesture. Just swipe right from the left side of the home screen as you used to and you\u2019ll see it all appear.You might be wondering right about now what happened to control center, the panel where you could turn on Wi-Fi, adjust your phone\u2019s brightness, and find a number of other settings. If you swipe up from the bottom now, you\u2019ll just go back to the home screen. The good news: control center is still around. The bad news: You need to swipe down from the right side of the iPhone X notch to get to it. Some more good news: You can still use 3D Touch to home in on some particular settings in control center. When you do this, however, you won\u2019t see that familiar white bar at the bottom of your screen to get back home. Instead, you\u2019ll need to tap twice in the empty gray space to get out of control center completely.Similar to control center, your notifications are also reached by swiping down from the top left corner of the iPhone. And while the iPhone X isn\u2019t as big as the iPhone 7 or 8 Plus, Apple has still made \u201creachability\u201d an accessible feature. To use it, first you must go to your Settings, head to General, find Accessibility, see Reachability and swipe right to turn it on. This gesture might be the hardest one to figure out and use. You need to swipe down on the bottom edge of the screen to activate it. It\u2019s frustrating, and I made it happen by accident more often than on purpose. So here\u2019s my pro tip: Start your swipe down in the area where your favorite apps are (the three to four apps at the bottom of the screen) \u2014 this should help immensely.You\u2019re welcome \u2014 I saved the best for last: how to activate Siri and Apple Pay. For these two features, you don\u2019t need to memorize a single new gesture. Instead, to turn on Siri, Apple\u2019s smart assistant, press and hold the side button and Siri should pop up. (Alternatively, you can also turn on \u201cHey Siri\u201d to activate the smart assistant with your voice.) You\u2019ll press on this same button twice to start Apple Pay, the company\u2019s answer to a contactless payment service.Sit back, take a minute and breathe. I know, it\u2019s a lot to learn and process, but sooner than later it\u2019ll become muscle memory and you\u2019ll be teaching iPhone X newbies how to navigate their phones. Now, just be careful and don\u2019t drop that precious thousand-dollar piece of hardware.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention. This inquiry from you about whether I am doing this is a good example of why we need one.\u201dThe question is whether any of usual suspects among Wall Street\u2019s crisis management world will take this on? Here are some of the firms:Joele FrankBrunswick GroupAbernathy MacGregorSard VerbinnenGladstone Place PartnersRubensteinAnd it seems they got it.Mr. Rubio, in a tweet on Friday, called it \u201ca solid step\u201d and suggested he would now vote for the bill.Here are the details from The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.The change intended to shore up Mr. Rubio\u2019s support would allow 70 percent of the $2,000 per-child tax credit to be refundable, up from 55 percent in the original draft of the bill, according to lawmakers and those briefed on the change. The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren. For that reason, the index has been particularly sensitive to the likelihood the tax bill will pass.With Disney\u2019s bid for a large portion of 21st Century Fox, four of the five biggest deals have been announced in the past three years. The pursuit of scale has driven the deal making. Telecom, cable and media companies all want to get bigger to better compete with the likes of Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix.That dynamic got us to wondering: How has the competitive landscape of media change during the past decade? To help answer that question, at least partially, we asked Thomson Reuters for the 100 biggest companies by market value at the start of 2007 and today. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest telecom, cable, and media companies then and now as well as the tech firms they are up against.Here\u2019s what Mr. Murdoch told analysts on a call yesterday:I know a lot of you are wondering, \u201cWhy did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u201d Are we retreating?

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Stifling Pay Raises Is Also Curbing Economic Growth", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHow is it that in this age of technological marvels, from mind-controlled prosthetics to instant machine translation, the American economy is limping through an interminable era of stagnant productivity, tepid economic growth and a sour political mood? Our menu of policy options \u2014 including the Republican plan to slash corporate tax rates \u2014 is unlikely to help.Instead, it may be time to rethink how productivity growth works. Nothing would do more to raise future living standards than jump-starting the productivity engine.Productivity goes up when we find ways to do more with less. Take a factory full of workers, rearrange them and add a powered assembly line, and suddenly you can build vastly more cars a day at far lower cost per car than you could before.Why is productivity growth so important? It paves the way for higher incomes: You can\u2019t give raises indefinitely unless the value generated by your workers is going up as well. Higher wages are not a foolproof safeguard against destructive politics, but it does become harder to scapegoat various boogeymen, from job-stealing immigrants to the idle poor, when living standards are rising rapidly.Inconveniently, we lack a clear understanding of how to jump-start productivity growth. As best we can tell, productivity rises when economies generate new ideas, and when those new ideas are then transformed by companies into new, growth-boosting ways of doing things. For that reason, our productivity doldrums are increasingly blamed on a failure of genius. As the economist Robert Gordon puts it, our iPhones and our Facebooks, while thoroughly addictive, are not nearly as transformative as electricity or automobiles or flushing toilets.And yet as time goes on, and advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and bioengineering grow more magical, the notion that unimpressive technology is keeping the digital era from being economically revolutionary becomes ever harder to maintain.A new story is therefore needed. Perhaps the problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re out of ideas. Perhaps the problem is that most companies seem happier doing things the old way than taking a risk and trying something new. Perhaps they haven\u2019t been pushed enough to do more with less.As with oil, the way an economy employs its workers depends in part on what they cost. A company building a warehouse must choose how much of the work done within it should be handled by robots and how much by people. When low-wage jobs attract lots of potential hires, it makes sense to delay the upfront investment needed to automate the warehouse and use regular old humans instead. In the same way, carmakers with factories all over the world use many more robots in Japanese plants than in Indian ones.History also suggests the price of workers plays an important role in the process of innovation. The Industrial Revolution could not have taken place without the invention of the steam engine, but it took the relatively high cost of labor in Britain to nudge business owners to find clever ways to use steam to cut their labor costs. A century later America, rich in land and resources but short of labor, developed its own style of manufacturing, even more productive than Britain\u2019s, which helped make the United States the world\u2019s richest big economy. Just as expensive oil encourages us to wring more utility out of each gallon of gas, high wages encourage companies to make the most of their work forces \u2014 and to make full use of whatever new technologies promise to economize on payroll. It is not the technology which is at fault, but the incentives firms face to use it that are letting us down.Many cutting-edge innovations remain buggy or more prone to failure than human workers. That is why the lack of wage pressure has been a problem; employers need to be fairly desperate to tinker with raw technologies, and to fail and learn, until new techniques are reliable enough and cheap enough to be adopted widely. Early steam engines were clunky and wildly inefficient, and few people had a good idea how to harness them to boats or looms in a profitable way. But in Britain, the incentives created by expensive labor and cheap coal made it worth the trouble to find out. Tinkering in Britain led to steady improvements, until steam was ready to conquer the world.If low wages are indeed inhibiting productivity, what can we do about it? A large corporate tax cut is unlikely to help. In an economy in which large firms enjoy market power while workers have none, such cuts will raise stock prices and dividends rather than wages and investment. Big increases in the minimum wage would certainly give companies an incentive to automate, but at the cost of jobs for the most vulnerable workers.A better strategy would be to shift power from companies to workers, to allow workers to bargain for a bigger share of the gains from growth. Keeping companies from getting too big and too dominant would make a difference by increasing the number of companies competing for workers and the competitive pressure they face to maximize worker output.Making it easier for workers to unionize would improve productivity, too. A strong labor movement, were one magically to appear, could bargain for higher pay, potentially pushing firms to invest in workers and new technology.Perhaps most important, we should not allow a low unemployment rate to fool us into thinking that labor is scarce. The Fed should wait for much faster wage growth before taking steps to slow the economy. Governments at all levels should make sure that schools and agencies are fully staffed with qualified workers. And Congress should turn its attention to public investments, rather than counting on tax cuts to motivate private ones. Large-scale infrastructure spending would increase the economy\u2019s growth potential while creating good jobs. So would concerted efforts to make postsecondary education as accessible and affordable as possible.Big companies would no doubt argue that unions only gum up the works, resist change and eat into the profits that motivate firms to innovate in the first place.

{"Headline": "Fingerprints of Russian Disinformation: From AIDS to Fake News", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The spurious story line alarmed Americans. It spread like wildfire, distorting facts into outlandish fictions, despite being attributed only to obscure sources. And it inflamed already divisive politics before the United States government concluded \u2014 perhaps too late \u2014 that it was a Russian disinformation campaign.\u201cWe would take any misinformation like that very seriously,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters at a briefing on Monday.It is rooted in a Cold War plot that fanned a conspiracy theory about the origins of AIDS, earning a rebuke from the Reagan administration, and now serves as a lesson about Russian disinformation and the subversion of weighty issues worldwide.\u201cToday, the fingerprints of Russian disinformation campaigns have been left on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Mark R. Jacobson, a professor at Georgetown University and former Pentagon adviser, told a congressional hearing in November.\u201cWhether it is \u2018Brexit\u2019 or the American election, Russian propaganda still infects U.S. social media networks,\u201d Dr. Jacobson said. \u201cAnd we see the same sort of divisive propaganda that we saw during the Cold War.\u201dCalled Operation Infektion by the East German foreign intelligence service, the 1980s disinformation campaign seeded a conspiracy theory that the virus that causes AIDS was the product of biological weapons experiments conducted by the United States. The disease disproportionately impacts gay men, and the Reagan administration\u2019s slow response had escalated into suspicions in the gay community that the United States government was responsible for its origins.\u201cThe K.G.B. picked up on that, and added a new twist with a specific location: Fort Detrick, Md.,\u201d where military scientists conducted biological weapons experiments in the 1950s and 1960s, said Douglas Selvage, the project director at the Office of the Federal Commissioner for Stasi Records in Berlin.The K.G.B. campaign began with an anonymous letter in Patriot, a small newspaper published in New Delhi that was later revealed to have received Soviet funding. It ran in July 1983, under the headline \u201cAIDS May Invade India: Mystery Disease Caused by U.S. Experiments\u201d and pinned the origin of the disease to Fort Detrick.\u201cThe Soviets intuitively understood how the human psyche works,\u201d Dr. Boghardt said. He said the playbook was simple but effective: Identify internal strife, point to inconsistencies and ambiguities in the news, fill them with meaning and \u201crepeat, repeat, repeat.\u201dA September 1985 memo to Bulgarian intelligence from the East German secret police served as a conduit. The disinformation campaign aimed, according to the Stasi, \u201cto generate, for us, a beneficial view by other countries that this disease is the result of out-of-control secret experiments by U.S. intelligence agencies and the Pentagon involving new types of biological weapons.\u201dA month later, the Soviet journal Literaturnaya Gazeta published a paper titled \u201cPanic in the West or What Is Hiding Behind the Sensation Surrounding AIDS.\u201d It included accurate information about the disease and Fort Detrick but cited the Patriot letter to connect the dots.The paper received international attention and its allegations were repeated around the world including in Kuwait, Finland and Peru. CBS News, black newspapers, the gay press, niche publications critical of the C.I.A. and the right-wing presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche all promoted the conspiracy theory. (Mr. LaRouche flipped the claim on its head, accusing the Soviets of using AIDS as a weapon.)The same tactics have shown up in recent years.Mr. Selvage said those conspiracy theories would have thrived on their own, even without Russian agitation. He said foreign information warriors simply exploited optimal \u201coperational environments.\u201d\u201cHad U.S. politics not already been polarized, these sort of efforts would have not gotten any traction,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be whistling in the dark.\u201dThe Twitter bots that helped spread viral fake news during the election last year have now morphed into cyborgs, or accounts that blend automation with human curation, said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher on the Computational Propaganda Project at Oxford University. They are more difficult to identify, but still latch onto divisive issues and seek to deepen the wedge.\u201cThe point is not to just tell a lie, but to tell a lie in increments,\u201d Ms. Bradshaw said. \u201cThey get a little bit more absurd as you start release more and more stories.\u201d\u201cThis was not to convince people about the World War II battalion but telling them to distrust the media because they can\u2019t get the story right in the first place,\u201d Ms. Bradshaw said.In the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, a similar argument about uncertainty over the disease\u2019s origins proved beneficial for conspiracy theorists.Jakob Segal, an East German biologist who promoted the Soviet campaign, seized on growing doubts from a theory that the virus had jumped from African green monkeys to humans. He called it \u201cludicrous\u201d in an 1986 interview with the London Sunday Express and accused the American government of playing it up as a cover-up.By 1987, the Soviets began to sour on the campaign as Moscow\u2019s scientific establishment rebuked it.\u201cThese active measures may be tactically successful, but strategically they fail,\u201d Dr. Selvage said.\u201cIn the case of the AIDS disinformation campaign, they were forced to give up on it,\u201d he said. And of election meddling, \u201cif the goal of the Russian government was to get a U.S. government that was favorable to lifting sanctions, it essentially backfired.\u201dDr. Boghardt had a slightly different take. The approach of disinformation is basic, but \u201cit works,\u201d he said.\u201cThrow enough dirt, and some will stick,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what they\u2019ve internalized. It didn\u2019t win them the Cold War, but it did undermine the credibility of the West and American institutions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last-Ditch Effort to Sway Senator on Tax Bill Involves Personal Pleas", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a group of progressive activists and constituents prepared for a 15-minute meeting on Wednesday with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, they sat in the lobby of her office and developed a last-ditch strategy to persuade her to vote against the $1.5 trillion tax bill barreling through Congress: tears.\u201cIf Senator Collins actually saw you as a human, saw me as a human, then she wouldn\u2019t pass any of this,\u201d said Ady Barkan, a member of the Center for Popular Democracy, who recently learned he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., and uses a wheelchair.Ms. Collins, after weeks of wavering, cut several deals with Republican leaders in exchange for going along with the tax overhaul that passed the Senate this month and is on track to be sent to President Trump by Christmas. Among other things, the Senate version of the bill would repeal the Affordable Care Act requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty.Among the provisions she secured was support for bipartisan health care legislation to stabilize the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance markets, whose prices could increase if the mandate repeal is enacted. She also claims to have a commitment from Republican leaders to prevent automatic Medicare spending cuts that could occur as a result of arcane budget rules that would kick in after the tax cut is passed.Those trade-offs still seem to to be in place as far as Ms. Collins is concerned. But because Ms. Collins is one of the few Republican senators who sometimes votes against her party, the pressure from opponents of the tax plan to flip her vote is rising as the bill inches closer to final passage, possibly as early as next week.On Wednesday, a group of activists and Maine residents, led by Mr. Barkan, met with Ms. Collins to express their concerns about the bill. They said they feared it would destabilize the health care system that many Americans rely on and would lead to spending cuts to social safety net programs that poor and sick people could not survive without.Most of all, they say, they worry that Ms. Collins, despite her good intentions, is getting duped by Republican leaders eager to notch their first major legislative victory since assuming control of Congress and the White House.\u201cYou have to protect us before you vote yes,\u201d Mr. Barkan said to Ms. Collins during the meeting. (Last week, Mr. Barkan confronted Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, about the tax bill on an airplane.) \u201cThey\u2019re lying to you.\u201dMs. Collins remained respectful and strained to convince the room of about a dozen skeptics that the promises that had been made to her were ironclad.She defended her decision in the face of the group\u2019s challenges that previous Republican promises for the tax bill had been broken, including a commitment to not add to the deficit and to not benefit the rich, and that written agreements are not law.\u201cI do not believe that I\u2019ve given up leverage,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI\u2019ve used my leverage to negotiate agreements that are promises to me.\u201dRepublicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.She added, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t believe in the agreements.\u201dThe deals that Ms. Collins struck that extend beyond the tax bill have been the subject of much speculation and doubt in Washington, because they would require the backing of House Republicans and some Democrats.But around the halls of the Capitol on Wednesday, Ms. Collins appeared to be increasingly comfortable with voting for the tax cuts.She said that she had a positive discussion on Tuesday with Vice President Mike Pence about her health care concerns and that she was generally supportive of the shape that the final tax bill was taking.Ms. Collins also was not biting on Democrats calls to delay the vote. She rejected the suggestions that the tax vote should be put off so that Doug Jones, the Alabama Democrat who was elected to the Senate on Tuesday night after a special election, could be seated first and cast a vote.\u201cI see no need to wait for Doug Jones to become a senator,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe vote all the time in lame-duck sessions with retired and defeated members casting votes.\u201dAfter her meeting at her office, it did not appear that Ms. Collins was ready to change her vote.But Ms. Collins said she appreciated the chance to hear her critics out and explain herself.Asked whether she was moved by the meeting, she replied, simply, \u201cOf course.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I didn\u2019t have much to propose. I had just heard an announcement from the nearby mosque calling on people to go to the center of town at noon. There we could gather to denounce the American decision. I suggested to my nephew that we go together and see what was happening.On the way over, the taxi driver told me that he felt let down by the Palestinian response to the news. I asked him about the call of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniya, for another intifada. \u201cWhat intifada, when we are all burdened by loans?\u201d he answered. \u201cThirty years ago I never thought twice about taking part in every strike that was announced, but now if I don\u2019t make money I will not be able to pay back the bank loan on this car. How then will I survive without it?\u201dWhen I met my nephew, he told me he was pleased that the Bethlehem city government had decided to turn off the lights of the Christmas tree in Manger Square in protest of Washington\u2019s decision. A few days earlier he had gone to the tree-lighting ceremony, which he found impressive. Now, he was praising the lights gone dark.At the center of Ramallah, we found scores of people milling around. No one knew what was expected, and the police had not made any preparations to divert the traffic. Drivers were forcing their way through the crowds, causing havoc.I asked around to see if anyone knew the plan for the day. I\u2019m a stranger to social media and thought I could have missed an announcement. Ramzi, a musician I have known for many years, had also come intending to take part in a demonstration. He said he kept obsessively checking Facebook and found nothing.\u201cThere were no mobile phones during the first intifada when I was a boy of 10 in the Amari refugee camp, yet I remember that people knew when to assemble and what to do,\u201d he said.He noted the scarcity of young participants at the gathering. \u201cSome people,\u201d he said, \u201cfeel they can stay home and yet consider that they\u2019re taking part; they think they can have virtual participation.\u201d He concluded by saying: \u201cSpirits are low. The leadership has abandoned Jerusalem.\u201dI didn\u2019t say anything. But I thought the city had been abandoned by Palestinian leaders long ago. The Palestinians in Jerusalem have been on their own, without effective leadership, for years, enduring heavy taxation and overcrowding that makes their lives miserable, while suffering the Israeli discrimination that leaves the Palestinian side of the city underdeveloped.There had been a moment of hope among Palestinians after the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993, when our leaders believed that the status of Jerusalem would soon be negotiated. They began developing their political presence in the city, which we thought would lead to an improvement in daily life.But Israel\u2019s right wing fought hard against the Oslo Accords, and the mood eventually deflated. Right-wing Israelis lobbied the United States Congress, which in 1995 passed a bill calling for the American Embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The act was disregarded by American presidents until President Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday.Ramzi told me that he hadn\u2019t been able to get a permit to visit Jerusalem in 15 years. I realized that he was not aware of the cultural revival that has been taking place in East Jerusalem. An old movie theater has been renovated and a music academy has been established. Book stores and cafes are popping up, along with dance and drama festivals. Despite the hardships, Palestinian Jerusalemites have been determined to revive their city.Crowds began to swell and an hour later a demonstration came together. We roamed the Ramallah streets, where businesses had closed up shop as a sign of protest. At the exit of the city, where the Israeli army still has a presence, it wasn\u2019t so calm. Young men and women were attempting to break through the barriers that prevented Palestinians from reaching Jerusalem, but they were being rebuffed by the Israelis.That evening I went home feeling dismayed that Washington\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital was made with no consideration of the discrimination and underdevelopment of the past 50 years designed to drive Palestinians out of the city. The United States not only has confirmed its bias in favor of Israel but also has given approval to the kind of relations between Israel and Palestine that cannot possibly be the basis for peace and coexistence.What I witnessed on Thursday was a mild beginning to what may develop into a sustained violent expression of the pent-up anger felt by most Palestinians \u2014 whether they live in Jerusalem or outside. On Friday, thousands of protesters in Jerusalem, Gaza and here in the West Bank took to the streets. At least two Palestinians were killed and 100 wounded. President Trump might have unwittingly lit a fuse that Israel may have great difficulty putting out.Raja Shehadeh is a lawyer and the author of \u201cWhere the Line Is Drawn: A Tale of Crossings, Friendships and Fifty Years of Occupation in Israel-Palestine.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though they weren\u2019t kosher kitchens, at least they didn\u2019t mix milk and meat, which is forbidden to observant Jews. (Somehow, the presence of pork and shellfish on the menu was O.K., at least for a day.) Fast-forward a hundred years and the tradition is now deeply entrenched, not just in New York, but throughout the United States.If you feel like staying in, even if it\u2019s not Christmas, this recipe for Chinese sizzled shrimp is rather festive, and, obviously, you don\u2019t have to be Jewish to enjoy it. You don\u2019t even have to own a wok.What you do need is the best shrimp available. For me, that means wild shrimp, the tastiest. It is a bit of a splurge, so I consider it an occasional treat. Look for wild shrimp from the Eastern Atlantic Coast, the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska. Many fishmongers carry fresh wild shrimp; frozen is the next best choice. If frozen farmed shrimp is the only option, make sure to buy it from a sustainable source. Much of the imported farmed shrimp available is of poor quality and doused in preservatives.You\u2019ll be sprinkling the shrimp with aromatic five-spice powder, a mixture of Sichuan pepper, fennel seed, clove, star anise and cinnamon, available in Asian food stores or easily mixed up at home. For heat, the recipe calls for strips of red, ripe Fresno chiles, available in the produce section of most supermarkets. Use red bell pepper instead if you want to tame the heat, but add at least a little cayenne or rings of another fresh red chile to keep the dish lively.A little ginger, garlic and sesame complete the seasoning for this quick-cooking and easy but very impressive dinner, festooned with scallions and sprigs of cilantro.cookingAdvertisement"}

Rump, living atop the beanstalk in Rump Towers.\u201cKids these days are as obsessed with politics as their parents are,\u201d Ms. Muz said, \u201cand to have this be a lightly political, secular holiday spectacular is just a blast.\u201dBut the cast itself \u2014 a representation of the residents of New York City \u2014 was responsible for driving the most poignant message.\u201cWe have two visibly disabled people in the cast and it\u2019s accepted by everybody,\u201d Ms. Muz said. \u201cWe have a mixed-race cast, a mixed-gender identity cast, a mixed cast in age, a mixed cast in everything, and everyone\u2019s respectful. That, in itself, is a great lesson.\u201dJack, the male lead, was played by a woman. Dame Delancey, the female lead, was played by a man. The good fairy was a burlesque dancer, and Fibi, a strong-willed character and role model, was an adult actress under 4 feet tall. Mr. Fraser, who played drums for the show, has chest-length arms. (He and Ms. Muz met while working in a sideshow on Coney Island.)\u201cMy safe space is a place where nobody is going to be singled out for being different; nobody is going to have any attention made of them because of what they are, but what they do,\u201d Mr. Fraser said, referencing a quote from Mr. Rogers. \u201cIt speaks to me as a bullied kid, it speaks to me as a stared-at disabled person.\u201dAs some politicians use people\u2019s differences to divide them, Mr. Fraser said, he was hoping to show how strong a community can be when everyone comes together.\u201cLet\u2019s get schoolkids in, let\u2019s have them watching disabled people, people of all colors and genders getting on with each other in a pretend society where they collectively sort a problem out against the Man,\u201d he said.The youngest cast members, part of the \u201cBabe Chorus,\u201d took that cue.\u201cIf they have a different condition or a syndrome or something that you don\u2019t have, something that\u2019s different from you, you should always be a community and be a friend to everyone that you know,\u201d said Briseis Mendez, 9.Dylan Cox, 11, quoted a favorite line from the show: \u201cWhen we get together, we\u2019re stronger.\u201dOn opening night, a stranger from the audience, who was crying, approached Ms. Muz. She was a gay woman, whose partner was transgender, and had been struggling to tell her child how he could explain the relationship to his peers at school.\u201cShe was so grateful for the casting choices because her sons were able to see a drag queen, and a girl playing a guy, and have it be normalized and fun and not talked about,\u201d Ms. Muz said.Mr. Fraser added, \u201cWe\u2019re outsiders with inclusivity at the heart of what we do.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:So.

{"Headline": "Review: Sendok Garpu in Indooroopilly, Queensland", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare8 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.INDOOROOPILLY, Queensland \u2014 \u201cStinky bean\u201d is a good nickname for a jolly baby, but it is also the colloquial name for petai, a plant whose vibrantly green seeds look much like fava beans. Unlike the polite fava, petai has an irrepressibly subversive personality that unleashes an umami bomb of funk, with a flavor like a shiitake mushroom but more extreme.In 2010, when her first child was about to enter kindergarten, Ms. Martino was looking to get into the food business, but lacked the funds to rent a traditional restaurant space. She came across a listing for a snack bar in the middle of an industrial park in Coopers Plains, an outer suburb of Brisbane. The original plan for the business was to sell small bites and lunch \u2014 meat pies, sandwiches \u2014 during the week to workers in the warehouses that surround the stall.Before long, word got out, and the Sunday lunch crowd became larger (and more lucrative) than the trickle of weekday business. The Sunday meals also became a focal point for the social life of Brisbane\u2019s Indonesian community. Eventually, Ms. Martino opened on Saturdays and shut down the weekday operation completely.The Coopers Plains location of Sendok Garpu is still in operation, and it is one of those food discoveries that is so unexpected it feels like pure magic. To find it, you drive down a suburban side street and turn into an unmarked collection of buildings. The industrial park has rebounded somewhat since the floods, but on the weekend the area is deserted except for the white tents of Ms. Martino\u2019s food stall in the center of the block. There, families gather at plastic tables to eat plates of West Sumatran-style mixed rice with cabbage, searingly spicy beef rendang, and green beans cooked in fragrant yellow curry.In 2014, after attracting a cult following through the weekend stall and appearances at food festivals, Ms. Martino opened the full-time dinner operation in Indooroopilly. The food in Coopers Plains is homey and comforting, but the Indooroopilly restaurant serves specialties from all over Indonesia \u2014 dishes more likely to be found at festivals and celebrations. The menu is six pages, but if you have only ever eaten in Bali, one of the most popular tourist destinations for Australians, there will be much that is unfamiliar. The island is the only part of Indonesia with a majority Hindu population. (The nation is predominantly Muslim.) There is no pork on this menu, and no booze \u2014 though you are welcome to bring your own.To start, there are impossibly light and crisp corn cakes, served with peanut dipping sauce, like those sold from street stalls in North Sulawesi. Martabak telur presents beef with egg and shallot, wrapped in crepes and fried to a shattery crisp. On the \u201cwok station\u201d section of the menu you can find multiple iterations of nasi goreng \u2014 the fried rice considered by many to be Indonesia\u2019s national dish \u2014 including versions made with wide, sticky egg noodles or vermicelli. The kitchen does not hold back, and there is a hefty dose of funk and spice in each version. Most tables have a bowl of cooling peanut-dressed gado gado salad on hand as salve for the heat.Even if the spice and pungency thrill you, there are things at Sendok Garpu that might be less appealing to a non-Indonesian palate. Fried items are fried hard \u2014 catfish is so crispy it is difficult to pry from its skeleton. Some short-rib dishes are cooked to a meaty stew, while others are fried to a suspended state of hot oily crackle, like beef chicharr\u00f3n with bones.Many dishes come with one of three house-made sambals: one sweet with green chile, one pungent with fermented shrimp, the last bright with garlic \u2014 all of them intensely spicy. It is worth ordering a side of each with your meal, to add to rice and stir-fry dishes. They showcase the same deft complexity that appears in the restaurant\u2019s curries. The lamb curry in particular (Ms. Martino attributes the recipe to her father) is musky and rich and irresistibly sweat-inducing.At both locations, Ms. Martino is telling the story of her country. The cultural exchange between Australia and Indonesia has mainly gone one way: Australian tourists vacation in Bali. Sendok Garpu offers a wonderful taste of what is possible when that exchange goes the other way, when an expat community\u2019s yearning for a taste of home makes all of our lives more delicious.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ikea Is Focus of European Inquiry Over Possible Skirting of Tax Bills", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIngvar Kamprad, the founder of the global furniture retailer Ikea, is known for buying his clothes at flea markets, driving an old Volvo and flying only economy class. Although he is a billionaire many times over, he revels in his reputation for saving money.Now, European regulators are accusing Mr. Kamprad\u2019s company of pushing the concept of thriftiness beyond the limits of the law by maneuvering to reduce its tax bill in the countries where it operates.Although Ikea is Swedish \u2014 the acronym combines Mr. Kamprad\u2019s initials with those representing the bucolic area of the country where he grew up \u2014 the company is effectively owned by a Dutch trust controlled by the Kamprad family, with various holding companies handling its franchising, manufacturing and distribution operations.The arrangement is designed to ensure maximum financial independence for Ikea, Mr. Kamprad has said.On Monday, in a separate statement issued in response to the regulators\u2019 accusations, Ikea said it was \u201ccommitted to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate.\u201d It said it had operated \u201cin accordance with E.U. rules\u201d and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry.Mr. Kamprad established the parent company, now called Inter Ikea, in the 1980s in the Netherlands, a country with attractive tax structures that have attracted Apple, Starbucks and many of the world\u2019s biggest multinational companies. Using a Dutch subsidiary, Inter Ikea Systems, Inter Ikea collects fees from Ikea\u2019s franchise businesses around the world equal to 3 percent of the revenue from all Ikea stores.European regulators say that Ikea received a favorable ruling from Dutch tax authorities in 2006 that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of those franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to another company that Ikea created in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Investigators are also examining how Ikea got a second favorable ruling from the Dutch authorities in 2011, after European regulators deemed the Luxembourg tax structure illegal under the European Union\u2019s rules prohibiting companies from receiving state aid. That ruling endorsed a model that let Inter Ikea send a substantial portion of its franchise profit, via interest paid under an intercompany loan, to a company based in Liechtenstein.The case is similar to one that Ms. Vestager brought against Starbucks in 2015. At issue were tax rulings, also issued by Dutch authorities, that she said helped the company artificially reduce its tax burden, an arrangement that ran afoul of the bloc\u2019s state aid rules.In addition to targeting companies like Ikea and Starbucks directly, Ms. Vestager has focused on employing a separate legal tactic to pursue countries that may be providing state aid to companies through special tax rulings. The rulings, known as comfort letters, often help the companies find the most favorable tax jurisdiction.The Ikea inquiry is the latest investigation by European regulators since 2013 into the tax structures of multinational companies operating in Europe and how local tax authorities treat them.The European Commission has ordered several members of the 28-nation bloc to collect billions of euros in back taxes from companies such as Amazon, Apple, Fiat and Starbucks.The commission is also investigating Luxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019s and Engie, the French power utility formerly known as GDF Suez, and a British tax program for multinational companies.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Month in Live Jazz: 5 Standout Shows", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe true way to experience improvised music is live. More than in most other art forms, jazz\u2019s big discoveries and developments have historically happened onstage: The music\u2019s creation depends on an engaged, participating audience. With that in mind, we\u2019re starting this column, recapping the most outstanding live jazz performances I\u2019ve seen over the past month. I\u2019m hoping that it will offer some clues as to where jazz is headed these days \u2014 and maybe even encourage you to go out and hear it for yourself.On the first evening of a two-night run at the Jazz Gallery, they played a series of long immersions, guided by Mr. McPherson\u2019s steadily locomotive drumming and the oozing agility of Mr. Crump\u2019s bass. At one point, Mr. McPherson, using brushes, carried the trio into a big, circular groove \u2014 something evoking passage and duration. Mr. Crump found his way into a minor pattern that climbed high before falling hard on the root note; Ms. Davis played the role of disrupter, hammering one broken-glass chord in double and triple and quadruple hits. The whole thing had the illusion of a pattern or a stream, but it resisted symmetry: If they were tracing some borderline, it was running through wild and uncharted terrain.Halfway through his set on a blustery Sunday night at this Brooklyn bar-cum-performance parlor, the bassist Harish Raghavan paused to identify his band mates \u2014 but not the compositions he\u2019d just played. \u201cMost of these songs don\u2019t have names,\u201d he told the small, packed room. Then, with a wry smile, he added that he wasn\u2019t really looking for suggestions. If anyone had a particularly great idea, he said, \u201cFind me on Facebook.\u201d Then he explained the joke: He doesn\u2019t use social media.To those in the know, Mr. Raghavan is one of the most exciting young bassists in jazz, but he\u2019s also one of the most private. That made his performance at the Owl all the more intriguing. He played six original compositions with a sturdy, quicksilver quintet: Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Joel Ross on vibraphone, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums. The tunes mostly pivoted on cycles of major harmony and intertwined polyrhythms, in which everyone played a part. The low-key M.V.P. was Mr. Ross, a slight player in his early 20s whose vibraphone was sometimes like a spray of confetti, erupting in brilliant bursts; elsewhere he took solos that had the slightest tug of swing, leaning against the locked-in syncopation of the rhythm section.Throughout the set, Mr. Raghavan fed his own chancy energy into the mix, playing lines of lacing beauty and impelling the others to put their weight forward, onto the balls of their feet. Only on his own unaccompanied improvisations, typically wedged between tunes, did he pull the focus off Mr. Ross and Mr. Wilkins \u2014 who often took solos away from each other, wrangling in a friendly repartee.Mr. Morgan doesn\u2019t usually perform as a bandleader, but at iBeam, he played a solo set that lasted close to an hour before joining the Emi Makabe Quartet for the night\u2019s latter portion. His solo show was the public debut of material he\u2019s been privately honing for a while; throughout the performance, he ran a series of programmed algorithms and patterns through his laptop, accompanying them with upright bass.The digital sounds were a scattered, tinkling miscellany: cymbals, synthesizer tones and plucks on the samisen (a three-stringed Japanese instrument loosely resembling a banjo). They weren\u2019t all percussive, exactly, but together they became a kind of nondefined rhythm to which Mr. Morgan\u2019s bass gave form, like stars outlined in a constellation.Speaking after the set, he revealed that he\u2019d used a number of systems and formulas to create the computer\u2019s feed. For one piece, he assigned a given sound sample to each letter in the nursery rhyme \u201cHumpty Dumpty,\u201d then let them all play out in succession. The music was promising, even if it did not answer all of its own questions. Mr. Morgan\u2019s great power as a bassist comes from his ability to impart surety and clear framing, if not tranquillity, in an otherwise dicey situation. As he develops the project, he is likely to grow more comfortable and grounded in the aleatory digital space he\u2019s created.The young trumpeter Peter Evans joined the band for a final song, then played a set alone, putting his virtuoso talents in plain view. Using circular breathing for over half an hour, he hardly took a moment for respite or meditation. Mr. Evans played statements in what started to sound like concentric circles, but then he unfastened them, opening them up and letting them drift away like waves dissipating. He often responded to the sounds coming through his horn by smacking his lips and growling lightly, an outward reminder of his labors.Finally, the metal-jazz guitarist Ava Mendoza closed the night with her trio, Unnatural Ways, playing loose and charging originals that started with a drone of guitar effects and gently draped cymbal sounds, then lurched into slashing power chords. On \u201cAlien Goo,\u201d Ms. Mendoza sang in a startled, soaring alto, stepping away from the mike occasionally to do some two-handed, corkscrew shredding toward the top of the guitar\u2019s neck.\u201cTry not to spill the grief into the gravy,\u201d the poet Ghail Rhodes Benjamin intoned. \u201cDisagree bravely.\u201d As she spoke, a series of long, low tones came from Nioka Workman\u2019s bowed cello, and Michael Wimberly issued a gargle of percussion from the clay pot perched in his lap.After Ms. Rhodes Benjamin finished her first poem, and the instruments hushed, Mr. Wimberly got up and walked across the room to two large bells hanging in a corner. They were part of a sound sculpture created by Jackson Krall, who\u2019s a percussionist himself, and whose works were hung all about this one-room gallery at the Clemente Soto V\u00e9lez Cultural and Educational Center. With a quick tug, Mr. Wimberly got a loud, clacking announcement out of them. Ms. Workman activated a prerecorded bass line, and Mr. Wimberly took his seat again, then started rattling and rumbling his way through a heap of shakers and hand drums as Ms. Workman drew a whisper out of her cello.Advertisement"}

Flaked crab claw meat lends sweetness to a musky nam ya curry, commonly made with minced fish, alongside skinny rice noodles. In a bracing salad of watercress strewn with meaty cashews and toasted coconut, grapefruit supplants pomelo for a clean, bitter rinse of the tongue.Moo ping, pork skewers, are more straightforward, the meat sculpted around flat sticks like chubby Popsicles and tasting of candied smoke. For the street snack called mataba, ground lamb warmed by yellow curry hides inside a fold of flaky roti ready to start shedding its buttery skins.Some experiments are more intriguing than successful. Laab is reimagined as fried chicken (Ms. Redding credits a KFC in Bangkok for the inspiration), with nubs of chicken first steeped in fish sauce, palm sugar, garlic and a crush of cilantro roots, then dredged in flour, panko and khao khua, sticky rice grains roasted and pulverized. Once fried, they\u2019re dark and rugged, all the juices sealed in, and a thrill to eat \u2014 but too big to properly take on the sting, crackle and funk of the dressing, which fades to a backdrop.Khao man gai (literally, chicken fat rice) is a unifying dish found across Southeast Asia, known in Singapore and Malaysia as Hainanese chicken and in Vietnam as com ga. Traditionally the chicken is poached in a mob of ginger, and might land at the table accompanied by sides of its gizzards and coagulated blood.Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer tried poaching, but early diners didn\u2019t care for it, so they put whole chickens on the rotisserie instead. The result is fine enough, but it throws off the balance of the dish, whose true focus is the rice, steamed in chicken stock until it preens.For dessert, a cone of coconut gelato comes lacquered with a \u201cmagic shell\u201d of coconut oil and white chocolate, dipped into broken peanuts, coconut shreds and salt, and wrapped in plastic like a bouquet.

No, Really.", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftFor much of Silicon Valley, 2017 felt like a nonstop parade of scandal and sin.But tech wasn\u2019t all bad this year. As many of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies were wreaking havoc, numerous people and organizations used technology to advance important causes and address large-scale problems.These projects do not always make headlines, but they show what\u2019s possible when technologists use their powers for good. So I\u2019m presenting the first-ever Actually Good Tech Awards, to highlight a handful of tech efforts that produced real societal benefits this year.Let\u2019s have more of these in 2018, and fewer behemoths behaving badly.An estimated 10 million Americans are blind or visually impaired, and until recently, tech companies did not have much to offer them. But that\u2019s changing, thanks to start-ups like eSight and Aira, two companies that are taking advantage of recent advances in mobile and imaging technology to help visually impaired people navigate the world.Three years ago, Tiffani Ashley Bell, a computer programmer and Code for America fellow, learned that thousands of low-income residents of Detroit were having their running water shut off because of unpaid bills. So she and another tech worker, Kristy Tillman, set up the Detroit Water Project, an online platform that matched willing donors with Detroit households with unpaid water bills.It\u2019s hard to argue that the Bitcoin boom of late 2017, which dominated the tech conversation and created riches for a handful of early adopters and lucky speculators, was beneficial for society at large. But two projects stood out for trying to turn the cryptocurrency craze into a positive force.Artificial intelligence garnered lots of hype in 2017, but too little attention was paid to algorithmic bias \u2014 the tendency of algorithms to mirror the prejudices of the programmers who created them.The results of these games are analyzed with algorithms that compare an applicant\u2019s skills with those of existing employees. The algorithm\u2019s results are then analyzed and tweaked to make sure they are not giving an advantage to applicants of any gender, race or educational background. It\u2019s a way to make the hiring process fairer, and to put applicants from nontraditional backgrounds on more equal footing.With a controversial travel ban and new questions around immigration\u2019s future under President Trump, 2017 made life harder for many immigrants and their families. Luckily, a handful of start-ups are trying to help.Ms. Fowler, who is turning her experiences into a book and a movie, could not possibly have known what she was setting in motion when she sat down to write those 2,900 words.

{"Headline": "In Fire-Scarred Bronx Neighborhood, a World of New Arrivals, Children and Community", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven on a nose-numbingly cold morning, families were out on the sidewalks around Prospect Avenue. A mother tugged a beanie over her squiggling son\u2019s ears, and girls ran down the block. They were trailed by a boy towing a wagon filled from a trip to the store, his younger brother wedged in with produce and paper towels.For as long as brick apartment buildings have loomed over Prospect Avenue, this pocket of the Bronx called Belmont has been dominated by working-class families, many of them drawn from around the world to the promise of New York City.A century ago, they came from Italy \u2014 Belmont was where chandelier makers, tailors and the workers who built the Bronx Zoo, just a block over, raised their children. These days, more of the young people zipping by on scooters or walking to class at the public school around the corner have families with roots in Puerto Rico, Jamaica or West Africa.The inferno, the deadliest in New York in more than 25 years, roared through the brown five-story building at 2363 Prospect Avenue as neighbors cooked dinner and shopkeepers around the corner closed up at the end of the day. Some said they smelled the smoke before they knew anything was wrong, and others said they were tormented by the sight of a firefighter carrying the lifeless body of a child.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Bernadette Miles from her stoop on Friday. She had feared the young victims would be children she saw every day playing on the street or wheeling by in strollers. \u201cThose images are burned in my head.\u201dAnd when the fire was out, it left a soot-black scar on the heart of a certain type of New York neighborhood, one rarely in the news. This stretch of Prospect Avenue, where there is almost no grass and the buildings vary almost solely by shade of brick, sits between the zoo and the Bronx campus of Fordham University. It is a place known neither for luxuries nor high crime, although a measure of crime and violence persists, and residents complain about landlords who are stingy with heat.Yet it has manageable rents in a borough, and city, that has become increasingly difficult to afford. The building itself was well kept, records shows, if hardly fancy. For long-term residents, the incentive to stay in Belmont has been a sense of community. They describe finding their own small town within a buzzing metropolis, where neighbors keep an eye on one another\u2019s children or, in a moment of devastation like this one, try to figure out some way to help.\u201cIf you need a dollar, a plate of food,\u201d Maria Pacheco said of her neighbors, \u201cthat\u2019s how we are around here: We take care of each other.\u201dOn Saturday night, the authorities released the names of the previously unidentified victims: Gabriel Yaw Sarkookie, 48; Justice Opoku, 54; Solomon Donkor, 49; Hannah Donkor, 17; and William Donkor, whose age was not provided. At least two people remain hospitalized in critical condition, officials said.A Little Italy sign hangs over a nearby intersection, and just a few blocks over, Arthur Avenue draws crowds with its trattorias, delis and bakeries. But there are just as many signs of newness, of a New York neighborhood regenerating itself, fueled by the constant churn of culture and values imported by recent arrivals.Even so, the day was anything but normal, as police officers cordoned off the avenue and residents displaced by the fire wandered around with Red Cross blankets draped over their shoulders. A few people made the sign of the cross as they hustled by. One man could not figure out where to leave a small bouquet of flowers, pacing around before setting them down at the end of the block and walking off.Fernando Batiz stood outside a bodega on the corner, dabbing his eyes.His sister, Maria Batiz, had lived in the building for about 25 years \u2014 likely longer than most of her neighbors, he figured. He described her as a caretaker. She tended to their mother, and let him live with her for months in her tiny apartment when he was at a particularly low point. \u201cShe took me off the street,\u201d he said. And on Thursday, she was watching her granddaughter when they were both killed in the fire.He had just answered a battery of questions from television reporters in English and in Spanish. He stepped aside to catch his breath.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he said softly on the sidewalk. \u201cI just saw a picture of her on Facebook and lost it.\u201dThe facade of the building showed few scars of the fire, but the rear was blackened and its windows were blown out.The 26-unit building was not regarded by city inspectors as problematic; in a statement, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development described it as having a \u201crelatively low history of repair violations.\u201d At the time of the fire, the building had six open violations, a level that did not appear to alarm officials. One fifth-floor apartment had a leaky or defective bathtub faucet and a damaged floor. The building had also failed to post a notice regarding the procedures to be followed for a gas leak. Inspectors examining a broken shower found a first-floor apartment had a faulty smoke and carbon monoxide detector; the fire did not start in that apartment, officials said.The building has long been owned by a company called D & A Equities. \u201cWe are shocked and saddened at the loss of life and injuries which occurred,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cOur prayers and thoughts are with the families affected.\u201dThe company has owned more than two dozen buildings, and at other properties close by, tenants described the landlord as mostly responsible and responsive. \u201cThey answer when you call,\u201d said Maribel Aquino, a receptionist who has lived for nine years in a building a short walk from Prospect Avenue.Bernardo Nelson, a porter, described a neighborhood that was now in many ways different from the one he had grown up in. \u201cAlways drug dealing,\u201d he said, recalling what he saw as a younger man, \u201ca lot of hanging out, a lot of police activity.\u201d But he remembered that 2363 Prospect had been \u201ca clean building in comparison.\u201dThe violence has diminished considerably over the past three decades. The 48th Precinct, which includes Belmont but also neighborhoods heavier with crime, recorded at least eight murders in 2017, according to police statistics. In 2000, by comparison, there were 17.LaShawn Solomon had reservations when she moved into her apartment on Prospect Avenue about five years ago. She had preconceived ideas about the Bronx, and they were anything but favorable. She encountered something surprisingly different. \u201cYou get your, \u2018Good mornings,\u2019 your, \u2018Hey, how you doings?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a small village.\u201dMs. Solomon walked up to Ms. Miles on her stoop on Friday afternoon.\u201cThose babies just celebrated Christmas,\u201d Ms. Miles told her. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make it to the New Year.\u201dMs. Solomon has a 1-year-old grandson and an 8-year-old granddaughter. She said she had to explain what happened to her granddaughter. \u201cEverybody lives to die, but sometimes tragedy happens,\u201d she said she told her.Ms. Miles had been in her apartment cooking when she heard the sirens. She hurried outside without even putting on her coat on a frigid evening. She saw the chaos. She especially remembered the medical examiner vehicles parked on the street.A day later, she said she had heard that names were released by the authorities or were being shared around the neighborhood. She resisted learning them.\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is,\u201d Ms. Miles said before stepping back inside. \u201cI\u2019m not even ready to look.\u201dJoseph Goldstein, Jeffery C.

{"Headline": "Tracking Dolphins With Algorithms You Might Find on Facebook", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesKeeping track of dolphins is a slippery, patchy process. First, you must procure time on a ship or aircraft, which is expensive. After that, what you see depends on uncontrollable factors like weather, ocean conditions and whether the creatures happen to be hanging out at the sea\u2019s surface.As an alternative, researchers have tried deploying underwater sensors to eavesdrop on the clicks dolphins use for echolocation, which can give clues about the aquatic mammals\u2019 numbers, distributions and behaviors. Sifting through all these data, however, becomes a new headache.\u201cI tried for many years to really wrap my head around patterns in the dolphin signals,\u201d said Dr. Frasier, who is now an assistant project scientist at Scripps. \u201cI could get somewhere, but it took a long time and was kind of subjective.\u201dShe wondered if she could leverage the machine learning techniques used by Google and Facebook \u2014 \u201ctools literally designed for big data,\u201d she said \u2014 to improve on the painstaking process.Next, the program grouped together five-minute chunks with similar average click rates and frequency profiles. It worked much like the online algorithms that recommend social media contacts, music or advertisements to us, though in a much simpler way, Dr. Frasier said.While it previously took her three weeks to analyze a year\u2019s worth of recordings from a single site, the algorithm took about four days to sort through two years of data from five sites.Through an \u201cunsupervised\u201d process \u2014 meaning the authors did not train the algorithm to recognize any particular categories beforehand \u2014 the program came up with seven discrete click clusters.They surrounded the divers and started clicking \u2014 they seemed to be saying hello. Read and then take a swim with whales in a virtual reality feature.She and her collaborators also speculated that two of the other click types possibly belonged to short-finned pilot whales and false killer whales, both members of the oceanic dolphin family that live in the Gulf of Mexico.For now, the researchers can\u2019t rule out the possibility that their click types come from other factors, such as dolphins altering the sounds they make based on context, or signals being captured differently at varying distances and angles from the sensors, Dr. Frasier acknowledged.But she\u2019s passionate about this technology\u2019s future. Improving scientists\u2019 ability to track dolphin populations is not just a matter of helping dolphins, she said. Along with other marine mammals, dolphins reflect overall ocean health, meaning researchers can use them as a window into understanding changing ocean conditions.\u201cMy goal is that we free ourselves up to ask more interesting questions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can spend less time manually picking through data and assigning labels, we can start looking at the bigger picture.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin May Be Re-Election Shoo-in, but He\u2019s Taking No Chances", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Aleksei A. Navalny, a Russian anticorruption activist, would have no real chance of defeating President Vladimir V. Putin in an election. The authorities have cast him as an utterly irrelevant showboat.But on Monday the Kremlin barred him from running for president in March. Then on Tuesday, threatening legal action, it warned him against organizing a boycott of the election.In one surreal turn after another, the Russian authorities have dismissed Mr. Navalny, a charismatic and canny street politician, as a nonentity \u2014 and then have done everything in their power to make sure that is the case.The boycott warning came from Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, and was issued the same day the president, who has been in power for almost 18 years, was formally nominated to seek a fourth term.In barring Mr. Navalny from running, the Central Election Commission cited his suspended prison sentence in a fraud case. The activist, backed by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, has denounced the prosecution as politically motivated.Mr. Navalny\u2019s exclusion from the March election \u201ccasts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year,\u201d the European Union\u2019s foreign service said in a statement on Tuesday.It also risks pushing politics in exactly the direction the Kremlin wants to avoid \u2014 onto the street. Mr. Navalny, who has set up offices in 84 cities across Russia, called on Wednesday for nationwide protests on Jan. 28 to rally support for a boycott of the March election, which he has ridiculed as a farce.\u201cWe won\u2019t have an election because Vladimir Putin is horribly afraid \u2014 he sees a threat in competing with me,\u201d Mr. Navalny, 41, said in a video that, anticipating the decision to bar him, he recorded before the ban was announced. \u201cThe process in which we are called to participate is not a real election. It will feature only Putin and the candidates which he has personally selected.\u201dThat the Kremlin is afraid of Mr. Navalny is in no doubt. His name is taboo on state-controlled television, unless he is being found guilty of fraud, organizing illegal protests or other alleged crimes. Polling organizations linked to the state don\u2019t include his name when they ask people what they think of leading political figures.What\u2019s confusing, however, is exactly what the Kremlin has to fear.Allowing Mr. Navalny to compete in March might help Mr. Putin solve one of his biggest problems: how to turn an election that promises to be little more than a tedious coronation into a contest with a frisson of excitement. A low turnout is something the Kremlin desperately wants to avoid.Opinion polls conducted by the independent Levada Center show Mr. Putin\u2019s approval rating at around 80 percent and indicate that he would crush Mr. Navalny in a race. A Levada poll in early December found that 66 percent of respondents who said they planned to vote would choose Mr. Putin, with only 2 percent favoring Mr. Navalny. That is far below the 27 percent of the vote that Mr. Navalny received when he ran for mayor of Moscow in 2013.Mr. Putin\u2019s old friend and handpicked prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, recently dismissed Mr. Navalny, without mentioning his name, as a \u201crogue\u201d trusted by nobody. But the state media apparatus has still gone to great lengths to airbrush him out of Russia\u2019s otherwise somnolent political landscape, seemingly reluctant even to utter his name.But Mr. Putin, having watched last year\u2019s presidential election in the United States, appears to worry that polls cannot be trusted and that a long-shot rival could, if not win, at least perform much better than expected.Both President Trump and Mr. Putin, Mr. Taubman said, \u201cwant not only to be winners, but big winners. In Putin\u2019s case, even if Navalny can\u2019t win, if the effect of his running were to reduce Putin\u2019s margin of victory as compared to past elections, that would be \u2014 or would seem to Putin \u2014 as humiliating.\u201dHaving excluded Mr. Navalny from the ballot, the Kremlin worries that he could still cause Mr. Putin headaches by urging voters to stay at home. That might undercut efforts to gin up enthusiasm for an election that was meant to showcase public excitement at the prospect of Mr. Putin becoming the longest-serving leader in the Kremlin since Stalin.Dmitri Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman and a target of Mr. Navalny\u2019s investigations into the curious wealth of senior officials and their family members, said on Tuesday that Mr. Navalny\u2019s calls for an election boycott \u201cwill require scrupulous study to see whether or not they comply with the law.\u201d The statement opened the way for an investigation by law enforcement agencies and possible criminal prosecution against Mr. Navalny and his aides.One of those aides, Leonid Volkov, his campaign manager, received a 30-day jail sentence this month for organizing a rally in Nizhny Novgorod, the city where Mr. Putin last month announced his own candidacy for the presidency to uproarious applause and cheering from workers in a local auto factory.In Soviet-era elections, winners got nearly 100 percent of the vote. While Mr. Putin may not expect to match that, he would like to win his fourth and probably last presidential election with more than the 63 percent he secured in 2012.Something else may also be weighing on Mr. Putin\u2019s mind: the memory of the mass street protests that broke out in Moscow in the winter of 2011-12 and, even more upsetting, the protests in Ukraine four years ago that forced the country\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, from office and into self-imposed exile in Russia.\u201cPutin is afraid of letting Navalny into public politics because Navalny has a great potential to mobilize: people will go out for him\u201d onto the streets, said Aleksandr Morozov, a Moscow political analyst.Mr. Navalny has repeatedly proved his ability to mobilize people, particularly young, well-educated Russians, by organizing a series of nationwide protests in defiance of official bans.Mr. Navalny is unlike most other nominally opposition Russian politicians, who rely on Kremlin support, never criticize Mr. Putin and make little effort to connect with voters. He has crisscrossed the country, rallying crowds with a message that Mr. Putin and his lieutenants are irredeemably corrupt and neglectful of ordinary people\u2019s interests.At his year-end news conference this month, Mr. Putin, asked if the government was \u201cliterally afraid of genuine competition,\u201d gave vent to his contempt for the protests that, in a series of so-called color revolutions, toppled seemingly immovable leaders across the former Soviet Union.\u201cIt is important to not just make noise out there on public squares or behind the scenes, and talk about a regime that is against the people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important to offer something, some improvement.\u201dMr. Putin, while not uttering Mr. Navalny\u2019s name, compared him to Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia who came to power after street demonstrations and who now, as an opposition politician in Ukraine, has rallied protesters against President Petro O. Poroshenko.\u201cThe people you mention are Saakashvilis,\u201d Mr. Putin said when asked about Mr. Navalny. \u201cYou want them to destabilize the situation in the country?\u201dMr. Navalny, by acting like an ordinary politician who seeks to win over voters rather than just relying on money and media support from the state, stands in open opposition to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to create what it calls \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d \u2014 an increasingly authoritarian system in which criticism is tolerated but only if it avoids challenging the czar-like president.Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian scholar at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw, said Mr. Putin wanted not only to win but do so in a manner befitting his self-image as an almost mystical figure who commands the trust of all his people. Letting Mr. Navalny compete would mean letting him appear on television and forcing Mr. Putin to mention his name, breaking the spell.\u201cMr. Putin, being Russia\u2019s leader \u2014 or rather, as he believes, the country\u2019s patron \u2014 for close to 20 years, sees his position not as a function as most Western leaders do, but rather as a sacred mission. He deeply believes in his predestination, in his role in the history of Holy Russia,\u201d Mr. Inozemtsev said.When Mr. Navalny\u2019s supporters met to nominate him over the weekend, they gathered in a tent on the banks of the Moscow River because, as is usually the case when they want to meet, nobody would rent them a room indoors.Mr. Putin\u2019s nomination on Tuesday, in contrast, was held in a well-heated pavilion at a Stalin-era park and exhibition center. The president, unlike Mr. Navalny, did not show up for his own nomination event, held in hall decorated with a giant map of Russia emblazoned with the words \u201cStrong President, Strong Russia.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And by the time our readers read this newsletter, I can\u2019t even fathom what the price is going to be.I\u2019m not a fortune teller, but even though the market is very volatile, Bitcoin has achieved a level of stickiness in the culture that will keep its price fairly high.

There are lots of people and technologies around the world now hooked into it, and they are slowly coming up with uses for it, giving it a kind of built-in momentum.In other words, even though it may crash in the short run, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s near its ultimate price.I do wonder, though, what it will take to bring Bitcoin truly mainstream.

It\u2019s an Unholy Mess.", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf you\u2019ve lost sleep worrying about the growing power of the alt-right \u2014 that shadowy coalition that includes white nationalists, anti-feminists, far-right reactionaries and meme-sharing trolls \u2014 I may have found a cure for your anxiety.Just try using its websites.More than a dozen \u201calt-tech\u201d companies have now emerged, each promising a refuge from political correctness and censorship. There is Gab, a kind of alt-Twitter social network that began last year, whose early adopters included prominent figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website. There is WrongThink (alt-Facebook), PewTube (alt-YouTube), Voat (alt-Reddit), Infogalactic (alt-Wikipedia) and GoyFundMe (alt-Kickstarter). There is even WASP.love, a dating site for white nationalists and others \u201cwishing to preserve their heritage.\u201dRecently, I spent several days testing a number of these alt-tech services. I created accounts, explored their features and interfaces, and interviewed users of each site about their experiences. (With my wife\u2019s permission, I even created a WASP.love profile and advertised myself as a New York journalist looking to interview lovelorn white supremacists. Oddly, I got no takers.)What I found on these sites was more pitiful than fear-inspiring. Sure, some alt-tech platforms were filled with upsetting examples of Nazi imagery and bigoted garbage. But most were ghost towns, with few active users and no obvious supervision. As technology products, many are second- or third-rate, with long load times, broken links and frequent error messages. A few had been taken offline altogether.If the alt-right\u2019s ideology harks back to 1940s Germany, its web design might transport you to 1990s GeoCities. Even the movement\u2019s own adherents have grown frustrated. One Gab user, who claimed to be using the site while temporarily suspended from Twitter, complained in a public post about the site\u2019s technical inferiority.\u201cI\u2019m an investor in Gab,\u201d wrote the user, who goes by the username @AnewThomasPaine. \u201cI believe in the idea, but I\u2019m disappointed in the platform.\u201d In another message, he wrote: \u201cI barely use it as there are few active users, and few essential features even after a year.\u201dGab\u2019s founder, Andrew Torba, declined to comment on the site\u2019s progress, telling me in a Gab message that \u201cI don\u2019t do interviews with fake news outlets.\u201dInstead, I spoke with Cody Wilson, a developer in Texas who is behind another alt-tech service. Mr. Wilson\u2019s product, a crowdfunding site called Hatreon, was meant to give alt-right personalities and others a way to raise money for projects deemed too risqu\u00e9 for mainstream crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon and Kickstarter.Hatreon got off to a fast start, with more than 400 creators raising about $25,000 per month on the platform. But lately, it has fallen into disrepair. According to Mr. Wilson, a major credit card company, which he declined to name, kicked Hatreon off its network last month, preventing many users from funding projects on the site and all but killing the company\u2019s prospects for growth. Today, visitors to Hatreon are greeted by a message saying that \u201cpledging is currently disabled while we upgrade our systems.\u201dMr. Wilson, who does not describe himself as alt-right, said he has accepted that building a viable alt-tech business might be impossible, given the practical constraints.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how any of them plan to be profitable,\u201d he said.Far-right activists have been trying to build alternative tech platforms for years, with little success. A decade ago, white nationalist websites with names like New Saxon and PodBlanc sprang up to compete with Myspace, Friendster, and the other social giants of the era. But most of those sites fizzled when their creators ran out of money or got into legal trouble. And none came close to reaching a large mainstream audience.But Mark Pitcavage, who studies right-wing extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, told me that alt-tech companies face several structural barriers. Not only do they have to build a compelling product and attract users \u2014 a steep challenge even in the best of circumstances \u2014 but they must do it without access to mainstream funding sources, such as venture capital firms and angel investors, which provide much of the fuel for other tech start-ups. They also rely on finding companies that are willing to host their services and process their payments.\u201cBeing on the internet is a group venture,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said. \u201cYou rely on an internet service provider, a domain name service, a credit card processor. It\u2019s a very common thing for one or more of these entities not to want to do business with a white supremacist group.\u201dThere is also a talent shortage among alt-tech companies, many of which rely on volunteers, and few of which can afford to pay the kinds of salaries demanded by top-tier programmers.\u201cSpeaking frankly, you\u2019re not getting 10x engineer talent with these people,\u201d said Mr. Wilson of Hatreon, using a popular Silicon Valley term for a star employee. \u201cNo one\u2019s lining up for this.\u201dAlt-tech is also a victim of the same market forces that have held back other small tech start-ups. Much of the internet\u2019s basic architecture is controlled by a handful of gatekeepers \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon among them. Those companies run back-end services that allow developers to build reliable products, the app stores that allow them to reach a mass audience, and the advertising platforms that allow them to make money. Without the support of Silicon Valley\u2019s giants, it\u2019s nearly impossible to compete, no matter what your political views are.\u201cIf someone with sufficient money and determination magically materialized, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, but even then it wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Mr. Pitcavage said.The good news for the alt-right\u2019s detractors, then, is that the movement\u2019s vision of a flourishing parallel internet seems doomed to fail.The bad news is that, without a functional alternate ecosystem, it may be harder to quarantine the views of neo-Nazis and other noxious ideologues to little-used corners of the internet, far from the vast majority of users. Facebook, Twitter, and other mainstream services will continue to be the dominant venue for ideological battles, and keeping these platforms free of hate and misinformation will remain those companies\u2019 responsibility. Let\u2019s hope they\u2019re up to the challenge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pumping New Life into Israel\u2019s Labor Party, From the Right", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileHAIFA, Israel \u2014 He was a nobody from Israel\u2019s center-right just a few months ago, a onetime minor minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was best known, if at all, for having quit the government in a huff.Now, suddenly, Mr. Gabbay is everywhere: kibitzing on talk shows, fulminating on Facebook, drawing crowds on college campuses and even in right-wing backwaters where Labor politicians have long feared to tread. Even more improbably, he is forcing rivals to address whether they would serve alongside him if he were elected prime minister.If he accomplishes nothing else, Mr. Gabbay, 50, has quickly pulled off what seemed to be next to impossible: Giving hopeless, powerless and feckless Israeli liberals permission to at least imagine a post-Netanyahu restoration, to daydream again about being given a fresh chance to lead.And he dusted off an old Netanyahu insult about how \u201cthe left has forgotten what it means to be Jewish.\u201dMr. Gabbay now insists he was merely making a point about how to woo the more traditional Israelis who want to feel that they share the same values, not just policy views, with their leaders. \u201cI respect everybody, whether they believe or don\u2019t believe,\u201d he said while campaigning last month in Haifa. \u201cBut I believe that we have to talk about our Jewish identity. That\u2019s the main thing that unites us all.\u201dThe remark was a dog whistle for the right-of-center voters that Mr. Gabbay hopes to peel away from Mr. Netanyahu, said Yehuda Ben-Meir, a veteran of right-wing governments who now tracks public opinion for the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\u201cThe left went crazy,\u201d Mr. Ben-Meir said, \u201cbut the right paid attention.\u201dMr. Gabbay seems pleased by the attention he is getting, critical or not, though he welcomes it nonchalantly, as if it were a matter of simple math.Indeed, there is a directness to him, from the coolheaded way he fields questions from voters \u2014 listening to them all, to gauge the room, before patiently answering each \u2014 to how he decided to run in the first place.His unlikely path began in the executive suite at Bezeq, Israel\u2019s state-owned telecommunications company, where his father had been a technician. Named its chief executive in 2007, Mr. Gabbay led the company through six years of deregulation, privatization and profit, firing a whole layer of managers so gently, according to one account, that they left his office smiling.After trying to buy El Al, the national airline, Mr. Gabbay, by now a multimillionaire, helped found the center-right Kulanu party in 2015 and then, when it joined Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, became environmental minister.He had some successes, but he got no help from Mr. Netanyahu in cutting regulation, he complained, and was the lone vote in the cabinet against a big natural gas deal, which he said would cost consumers far too much.All the while, he said, he watched Mr. Netanyahu sowing division and hatred at his Sunday cabinet meetings. \u201cEvery week it\u2019s like something against somebody,\u201d Mr. Gabbay said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s against the left, it\u2019s against the media, against Arabs, and against, against, against.\u201d\u201cYou have to know something about\u201d defense, Mr. Gabbay said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not like being a minister of environmental protection.\u201dSo in May 2016, Mr. Gabbay quit.After retreating to Mykonos in Greece, toting biographies of the former prime ministers David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin, Mr. Gabbay said he decided to run for prime minister himself to change the political culture in Israel, something that he says can only be achieved from the very top.He chose Labor as his vehicle like a motorhead snapping up a wreck to restore: Its poll ratings were at record lows, and it was projected to win only eight of 120 Knesset seats. \u201cPeople told me, \u2018You are crazy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018You are going to join this corpse? Seriously?\u2019\u201dThey may not have appreciated his endurance. A veteran of eight marathons, with a tattoo of a runner under his suit, he barely caught his breath after the primary before beginning his campaign for prime minister, even though an election could be a year or two away.To Mr. Gabbay, the biggest problem with Mr. Netanyahu, and what will make it difficult to topple him, is his exploitation of identity politics, all too easy in Israel\u2019s fractured society. \u201cThe mission of a prime minister is to be a prime minister of all the people in the country \u2014 not your camp, your side,\u201d he said.That said, Mr. Gabbay, a son of Moroccan immigrants who spent his early years in a transit camp, can hope for support from other Mizrahi Jews, whose resentments have been a powerful force in the past. \u201cI am coming from the people, I am not from the elite,\u201d he said. His wife is a teacher; a brother drives a taxi. He would doubtless be the first prime minister who once waited tables in the Knesset cafeteria.A self-declared social democrat, he assails dog-eat-dog capitalism and pledges to repair the safety net and solve the country\u2019s critical shortage of affordable housing. \u201cWe have to change Israel from a country where people just survive,\u201d he said, \u201cto one where people actually live.\u201dHe promises to tackle corruption, and wants to give preferential treatment to military veterans, and not press ultrareligious men into service. \u201cI am coming from a position of \u2018in favor of,\u2019 not \u2018against,\u2019\u201d he said, comparing himself with rivals who \u201care against the Arabs and Haredim. I am in favor of my kids.\u201dThe distinction, he added, was not lost on the Orthodox: \u201cThey like it very much.\u201dWhile he supports a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Gabbay refuses to say what he\u2019d give up for peace, only discussing what he wants to get \u2014 a demurral that is likely to be tested in the coming week in meetings in the United States, including a high-profile turn at the Saban Forum in Washington.But between them, Mr. Gabbay and Mr. Lapid could possibly steal enough support from the right to deny it an automatic majority. And Mr. Gabbay, while insisting he would win, also concedes he would be willing to serve under Mr. Lapid.For younger Laborites, who barely remember the party\u2019s most recent victory, in 1999, the excitement surrounding Labor is intoxicating.\u201cHe\u2019s not like the old left wing,\u201d said Oren Idel, 23, a student at the Technion university in Haifa. \u201cHe\u2019s a new Labor. I think he will bring a lot of voters back to us. He gives me a strong feeling that he\u2019s someone we can trust.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bitcoin Futures Set Scene for More Gambling", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsBitcoin action is now available without the Bitcoin. The Chicago Board Options Exchange started offering futures on the cryptocurrency late on Sunday. The new contracts open fresh avenues for trading, but for now they have little utility beyond speculation.Futures have real-world value, allowing producers or consumers of a commodity to insure themselves against price movements, or helping investors to hedge their positions. In the Bitcoin world, there are so-called miners with investments in processing power and hefty costs like electricity who could use the contracts this way, but that\u2019s about it. And with Bitcoin soaring more than 15-fold in 2017 to well over $16,000 early Monday, selling Bitcoin futures short is likely to be prohibitively expensive.Most market players will be cautious until the contracts settle down. There are, though, other reasons for concern. Bitcoin futures aren\u2019t perfect proxies for the real thing, partly because they will be settled in dollars, not the cryptocurrency, which trades at different dollar prices in different places. Chicago Board Options Exchange settlements, for example, will be based on Bitcoin\u2019s value on the Gemini Exchange, established by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss of Facebook fame.CME Group\u2019s Bitcoin futures, starting next weekend, will settle at a reference price drawn from multiple exchanges. One opportunity could be arbitrage, exploiting the pricing discrepancies. But it will take time for any patterns to emerge.Proponents reckon that the entry of two big, regulated United States exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of Bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring Bitcoin exposure to retail investors.Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearinghouses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges \u2014 and their customers \u2014 can now ride the Bitcoin bandwagon without touching the cryptocurrency at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Conceded It Might Make You Feel Bad. Here\u2019s How to Interpret That.", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYes, I should have warned you to sit down first.This is one of those stories where what\u2019s being said isn\u2019t as surprising as who\u2019s saying it. Facebook\u2019s using a corporate blog post to point to independent research that shows its product can sometimes lead to lower measures of physical and mental well-being should be regarded as a big deal. The post stands as a direct affront to the company\u2019s reason for being; it\u2019s as if Nike asked whether just doing it may not be the wisest life goal after all, or if Snapple conceded it wasn\u2019t quite positive that it really was the best stuff on earth.Consider Facebook\u2019s place in the social-media firmament. Facebook \u2014 which also owns Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 is the world\u2019s largest and most profitable social media company. Its business model and its more airy social mission depend on the idea that social media is a new and permanently dominant force in the human condition.So far, that idea has proved unwavering. Facebook\u2019s leap into the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable companies less than 14 years after its founding can be attributed to this simple truth: Humans have shown no limit, so far, in their appetite for more Facebook.But what if all that Facebook is not good for us? For several years, people have asked whether social media, on an individual level and globally, might be altering society and psychology in negative ways. Until about a year or so ago, Facebook\u2019s public posture about its product had been overwhelmingly positive, as you\u2019d expect. Facebook, Facebook insisted, was clearly good for the world.Then came 2017. The concerns over social-media-born misinformation and propaganda during last year\u2019s presidential race were one flavor of this worry. Another is what Facebook might be doing to our psychology and social relationships \u2014 whether it has addicted us to \u201cshort-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops\u201d that \u201care destroying how society works,\u201d to quote Chamath Palihapitiya, one of several former Facebook executives who have expressed some version of this concern over the last few months.This gets to why an otherwise in-the-weeds blog post from Facebook\u2019s research team is so interesting. Though it is quite abstruse, the post, by David Ginsberg and Moira Burke, two company researchers, takes readers through a tour of the nuances on whether Facebook can be bad for you.It\u2019s possible to read the post either cynically or optimistically. The cynical take is that Facebook is conceding the most obvious downsides of its product in order to convince us it really does care.\u201cSimply broadcasting status updates wasn\u2019t enough; people had to interact one-on-one with others in their network\u201d to gain great personal benefits from the service, the post stated.The post pointed out several recent and coming changes to Facebook that the company said encouraged active interactions on the service. That\u2019s the real message: Once you discover how much more you can get out of Facebook with this new stuff, you\u2019ll feel super.O.K., sure, the post can be read this way. But I\u2019m more optimistic about it, because it\u2019s in line with an evolving corporate posture from the company.To be sure, Facebook is putting its own favorable spin on these studies. Yet its willingness to shine a light on critical research, and its pledge to take the findings into account when it designs its products, has to be welcomed as something new.If you think Facebook is ruining the world, you should be a little glad that even Facebook agrees that we need a better Facebook \u2014 and that it is pledging to build one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Pull-Apart Bread Worth Sharing (Even if You Don\u2019t Want to)", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecipe LabSince no one ever seems to invite me to a pig pull or a crab boil, I miss eating communally. I don\u2019t mean sitting at a communal table in a restaurant, staring down strangers while we all nibble at our seasonal small plates. I mean everyone digging into the same dish at the same time. I mean the warm feeling I get sharing French fondue or Korean barbecue.That effect is what makes monkey bread perfect for a family or holiday brunch: People have to congregate around it (in fact, they want to). They get to pull out the piece with the most sauce, or the fewest nuts, or whatever they like best. They have to stay at the table instead of wandering off to their screens. And they have to get sticky.It quickly picked up sugar and cinnamon, possibly from a Hungarian coffee cake that many bakeries made at the time. This was back before matcha and a\u00e7a\u00ed, when Americans regularly \u2014 even daily \u2014 sat down for coffee and cake.The pastry chef Claudia Fleming, who runs an inn on the North Fork of Long Island, said that monkey bread was now decidedly in the breakfast pastry category, and that she occasionally tries to put one on the buffet.\u201cPeople are too shy to go for it in public,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the things that really is better at home.\u201dJudging by social media, American home cooks are enamored of monkey bread, having come up with pepperoni and peanut butter, banana and bourbon versions. Ms. Fleming\u2019s favorite has a maple-bacon glaze.The recipe I like best is a modern classic. It has the sandy-sweet filling of a cinnamon roll, the crunchy pecans and rich caramel of a sticky bun, and the plump majesty of a Bundt cake. With all those sweet extras and toppings, you might think it doesn\u2019t matter what the bread component tastes like. But it does. So I\u2019ll get this out of the way: There\u2019s no store-bought refrigerated dough in this recipe. All the things that are lovable about it \u2014 the cheerful pop, the whoosh of air, the instant results \u2014 are absent. Also not here: the salty flavor, the preservatives and the chemical aftertaste of commercial dough.That aftertaste comes from the baking powder used to make the dough rise. There\u2019s nothing wrong with baking powder, per se, but manufacturers use a lot of it to replicate the slow-rising effect of yeast. So the minerals it\u2019s made of push their way forward.If you already like monkey bread, and you\u2019ve had only the kind made with supermarket dough, this one will make your hair stand on end (in a good way).cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "10 Cultural Battles That Ruled 2017", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe phrase \u201cculture war\u201d first crashed into the national discourse in the late 1980s, as a catchall term for battles over values, ideals and national identity. The battlegrounds were college campuses, Hollywood, the bedroom \u2014 anywhere that moral relativism, secularism and the general \u201cculture of depravity,\u201d as dedicated warriors like Rush Limbaugh put it, held sway.Today\u2019s culture wars, like war itself, have moved beyond the old, clearly defined fields of contention and are just as likely to rage among old allies as traditional right-left antagonists.Here\u2019s a selective, not-so-nostalgic look back at some of the fiercest fights from a year when just about every cultural event and artifact became an arena for asking not just \u201cWhich side are you on?\u201d but \u201cDo you really have my back?\u201dIf there was any lingering hope that President Trump was going to cede the stage to a more restrained character, it was laid to rest at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, when Hollywood served up the making of a classic culture wars set piece.If you come at the king, you best not miss \u2014 or, if you\u2019re joking, at least get ready for the inevitable guerrilla warfare over the limits of art, free speech and satire.Ms. Johansson defended herself by arguing that the character \u201chas a human brain in an entirely machinate body,\u201d and said, \u201cI would never attempt to play a person of a different race, obviously.\u201d\u201cI accepted the role unaware that the character in the original comics was of mixed Asian heritage,\u201d Mr. Skrein said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear,\u201d he added, \u201cthat representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people, and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voice in the arts.\u201d\u201cConfederate\u201d had a few defenders, like Judd Apatow, who said on Twitter that criticizing a show before it even existed amounted to \u201ccensorship,\u201d but then backed away from that word. A month later, tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists rallied in Charlottesville, Va., to protest the slated removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Mr. Trump reacted to the violent clashes there, during which one counterprotester was killed by a white supremacist, by praising the \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Not a single scene of \u201cConfederate\u201d had been shot, but maybe we were watching it already?Then in November, after the album \u201cReputation\u201d was released, a blogger for the obscure site Pop Front called for Ms. Swift to explicitly repudiate white nationalism, and suggested that her music might be a gateway drug for Nazi-curious young fans.Mainstream country music generally steers clear of politics, beyond heartwarming tributes to America and the occasional rabble-rousing patriotic song. But after the mass shooting at a festival in Las Vegas in October left 58 fans dead and 500 more wounded, some cracks in the industry\u2019s solidarity with American gun culture began to appear.The show opened with a somber tribute to the victims of the shooting and the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, but no one went full Dixie Chick, or even mildly Meryl Streep. Instead, the hosts, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, who had started out by declaring the show a \u201cpolitics-free zone,\u201d offered up \u201cBefore He Tweets,\u201d a lighthearted parody of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter habits to the tune of Ms. Underwood\u2019s \u201cBefore He Cheats.\u201d\u201cEvery man on Earth is bewildered,\u201d read her redacted version of a statement by Richard Dreyfuss, who was accused of harassing a female writer (he recalled their interactions as part of a \u201cmutual seduction ritual\u201d). \u201cI have to step away from the fun, but I am comfortable and safe,\u201d read Ms. O\u2019Hare\u2019s take on Mario Batali\u2019s apology.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the title of a Carrie Underwood song.

SCHMIDT: You\u2019re O.K. with me recording, right?TRUMP: Yeah. Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. And even these committees that have been set up. If you look at what\u2019s going on \u2014 and in fact, what it\u2019s done is, it\u2019s really angered the base and made the base stronger. My base is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. Great congressmen, in particular, some of the congressmen have been unbelievable in pointing out what a witch hunt the whole thing is. So, I think it\u2019s been proven that there is no collusion.And it\u2019s different. It\u2019s in golf. If you have a tournament and you have match play or stroke play, you prepare differently, believe it or not. It\u2019s different. Match play is very different than stroke play. And you prepare. So I went to Maine five times, I went to [inaudible], the genius of the Electoral College is that you go to places you might not go to.And that\u2019s exactly what [inaudible]. Otherwise, I would have gone to New York, California, Texas and Florida.SCHMIDT: You would have run completely differently.TRUMP: It would have been a whole different thing.

There was no collusion. None whatsoever._________TRUMP: Three and a half months. [Inaudible] So, that\u2019s that. Let\u2019s just say \u2014 I think that Bob Mueller will be fair, and everybody knows that there was no collusion. I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion. She\u2019s the head of the committee. The Republicans, in terms of the House committees, they come out, they\u2019re so angry because there is no collusion. So, I actually think that it\u2019s turning out \u2014 I actually think it\u2019s turning to the Democrats because there was collusion on behalf of the Democrats. There was collusion with the Russians and the Democrats. A lot of collusion.SCHMIDT: Dossier?_________SCHMIDT: That\u2019s true. But in terms of, the lawyers said it would be done by, your guys said, it would be done by Thanksgiving, it would be done by Christmas. What are they telling you now? What are they telling you?TRUMP: [Inaudible.] There was tremendous collusion on behalf of the Russians and the Democrats. There was no collusion with respect to my campaign. I think I\u2019ll be treated fairly. Timingwise, I can\u2019t tell you. I just don\u2019t know. But I think we\u2019ll be treated fairly.SCHMIDT: But you\u2019re not worked up about the timing?TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s bad for the country. The only thing that bothers me about timing, I think it\u2019s a very bad thing for the country. Because it makes the country look bad, it makes the country look very bad, and it puts the country in a very bad position. So the sooner it\u2019s worked out, the better it is for the country.__________________TRUMP: For purposes of the Justice Department, I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day, who by the way, says I, says this is a ridiculous \u2014TRUMP: He\u2019s been amazing. And he\u2019s a liberal Democrat. I don\u2019t know him. He\u2019s a liberal Democrat. I watched Alan Dershowitz the other day, he said, No. 1, there is no collusion, No. 2, collusion is not a crime, but even if it was a crime, there was no collusion. And he said that very strongly. He said there was no collusion. And he has studied this thing very closely. I\u2019ve seen him a number of times. There is no collusion, and even if there was, it\u2019s not a crime. But there\u2019s no collusion. I don\u2019t even say [inaudible]. I don\u2019t even go that far._________TRUMP: So for the purposes of what\u2019s going on with this phony Russian deal, which, by the way, you\u2019ve heard me say it, is only an excuse for losing an election that they should have won, because it\u2019s very hard for a Republican to win the Electoral College. O.K.? You start off with New York, California and Illinois against you. That means you have to run the East Coast, which I did, and everything else. Which I did and then won Wisconsin and Michigan. [Inaudible.] So the Democrats. \u2026 [Inaudible.] \u2026 They thought there was no way for a Republican, not me, a Republican, to win the Electoral College. Well, they\u2019re [inaudible]. They made the Russian story up as a hoax, as a ruse, as an excuse for losing an election that in theory Democrats should always win with the Electoral College. The Electoral College is so much better suited to the Democrats [inaudible]. But it didn\u2019t work out that way. And I will tell you they cannot believe that this became a story.SCHMIDT: So they had to do this to come after you, to undercut you?TRUMP: No, no, they thought it would be a one-day story, an excuse, and it just kept going and going and going. It\u2019s too bad Jeff recused himself. I like Jeff, but it\u2019s too bad he recused himself. I thought. \u2026 Many people will tell you that something is [inaudible].SCHMIDT: Do you think Holder was more loyal to. \u2026SCHMIDT: Tell me about what you were saying that the Democrats. \u2026 [Inaudible.] \u2026 Tell me about the Democrats on the tax bill, which you were telling me about. Explain that to me, I thought that was interesting.TRUMP: So. \u2026 We started taxes. And we don\u2019t hear from the Democrats. You know, we hear bullshit from the Democrats. Like Joe Manchin. Joe\u2019s a nice guy.SCHMIDT: He is a very nice guy.TRUMP: Well, I. \u2026 Look. \u2026 Let him do whatever he wants to do. I was for Strange, and I brought Strange up 20 points. Just so you understand. When I endorsed him, he was in fifth place. He went way up. Almost 20 points. But he fell a little short. But I knew what I was doing. Because I thought that. \u2026 If you look at my rhetoric, I said the problem with Roy Moore is that he will lose the election. I called it. But as the head of the party, I have a choice: Do I endorse him or not? I don\u2019t know. Um. \u2026SCHMIDT: Was it a mistake?TRUMP: And by the way, when I endorsed him, he went up. It was a much closer race.SCHMIDT: Was it a mistake to endorse him?TRUMP: I feel that I have to endorse Republicans as the head of the party. So, I endorsed him. It became a much closer race because of my endorsement. People don\u2019t say that. They say, Oh, Donald Trump lost. I didn\u2019t lose, I brought him up a lot. He was not the candidate that I thought was going to win. If you look at my statements, you\u2019ve seen them, I said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m for Luther Strange because I like him, but I\u2019m also for Luther Strange because he\u2019s going to win the election.\u201d There wouldn\u2019t have been an election. He would have won by 25 points.SCHMIDT: He would have won big?O.K., let\u2019s get onto your final question, your other question. Had the Democrats come through. \u2026SCHMIDT: Tell me about that, yeah.TRUMP: Had they asked, \u201cLet\u2019s do a bipartisan,\u201d Michael, I would have done bipartisan. I would absolutely have done bipartisan.SCHMIDT: But they didn\u2019t. \u2026 They didn\u2019t \u2026SCHMIDT: What are you willing to do on infrastructure? How far are you willing to go? How much money?TRUMP: I actually think we can get as many Democrat votes as we have Republican. Republicans want to see infrastructure. Michael, we have spent, as of about a month ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East. And the Middle East is worse than it was 17 years ago. \u2026 [Inaudible.] $7 trillion. And if you want $12 to fix up a road or a highway, you can\u2019t get it. I want to do a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, at least. We want to fix our roads, our highways, our bridges, which are in bad shape. And you know some of them are actually, they\u2019re x-ed out, they have, you know, possibilities of collapse under bad circumstances. And in 10 years they will collapse. So, I want a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. I think it can be bipartisan. I believe we can do health care in a bipartisan way, because now we\u2019ve essentially gutted and ended Obamacare.[Cross talk.]SCHMIDT: But what\u2019s the goal? What\u2019s the goal?TRUMP: Wait, wait, let me just tell you. \u2026 Also, beyond the individual mandate, but also [inaudible] associations. You understand what the associations are. \u2026[Cross talk.]TRUMP: So now I have associations, I have private insurance companies coming and will sell private health care plans to people through associations. That\u2019s gonna be millions and millions of people. People have no idea how big that is. And by the way, and for that, we\u2019ve ended across state lines. So we have competition. You know for that I\u2019m allowed to [inaudible] state lines. So that\u2019s all done.Now I\u2019ve ended the individual mandate. And the other thing I wish you\u2019d tell people. So when I do this, and we\u2019ve got health care, you know, McCain did his vote. \u2026 But what we have. I had a hundred congressmen that said no and I was able to talk them into it. They\u2019re great people.Two things: No. 1, I have unbelievably great relationships with 97 percent of the Republican congressmen and senators. I love them and they love me. That\u2019s No. 1. And No. 2, I know more about the big bills. \u2026 [Inaudible.] \u2026 Than any president that\u2019s ever been in office. Whether it\u2019s health care and taxes. Especially taxes. And if I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t have persuaded a hundred. \u2026 You ask Mark Meadows [inaudible]. \u2026 I couldn\u2019t have persuaded a hundred congressmen to go along with the bill. The first bill, you know, that was ultimately, shockingly rejected.I\u2019ll tell you something [inaudible]. \u2026 Put me on the defense, I was a great student and all this stuff. Oh, he doesn\u2019t know the details, these are sick people.So, the taxes. \u2026 [Inaudible.] \u2026 The tax cut will be, the tax bill, prediction, will be far bigger than anyone imagines. Expensing will be perhaps the greatest of all provisions. Where you can do something, you can buy something. \u2026 Piece of equipment. \u2026 You can do lots of different things, and you can write it off and expense it in one year. That will be one of the great stimuli in history. You watch. That\u2019ll be one of the big. \u2026 People don\u2019t even talk about expensing, what\u2019s the word \u201cexpensing.\u201d [Inaudible.] One year expensing. Watch the money coming back into the country, it\u2019ll be more money than people anticipate.But Michael, I know the details of taxes better than anybody. Better than the greatest C.P.A. I know the details of health care better than most, better than most. And if I didn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t have talked all these people into doing ultimately only to be rejected.Now here\u2019s the good news. We\u2019ve created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn\u2019t have insurance. Or didn\u2019t have health care. Millions of people. That\u2019s gonna be a big bill, you watch. It could be as high as 50 percent of the people. You watch. So that\u2019s a big thing. And the individual mandate. So now you have associations, and people don\u2019t even talk about the associations. That could be half the people are going to be joining up. \u2026 With private [inaudible]. So now you have associations and the individual mandate.I believe that because of the individual mandate and the associations, the Democrats will and certainly should come to me and see if they can do a really great health care plan for the remaining people. [Inaudible.]SCHMIDT: And you think you can do it?TRUMP: Well, we\u2019re perfectly set up to do it. See, it was hard for them to do it as long as the individual mandate existed. But now that the individual mandate is officially killed, people have no idea how big a deal that was. It\u2019s the most unpopular part of Obamacare. But now, Obamacare is essentially. \u2026 You know, you saw this. \u2026 It\u2019s basically dead over a period of time.SCHMIDT: Yeah.TRUMP: But the Democrats should come to a bipartisan bill. And we can fix it. We can fix it. We can make a great health care plan. Not Obamacare, which was a bad plan. We can make a great health care plan through bipartisanship. We can do a great infrastructure plan through bipartisanship. And we can do on immigration, and DACA in particular, we can do something that\u2019s terrific through bipartisanship.SCHMIDT: It sounds like you\u2019re tacking to the center in a way you didn\u2019t before.SCHMIDT: So you\u2019re not moving. You\u2019re saying I\u2019m more likely to do deals, but I\u2019m not moving.TRUMP: I\u2019m always moving. I\u2019m moving in both directions. We have to get rid of chainlike immigration, we have to get rid of the chain. The chain is the last guy that killed. \u2026 [Talking with guests.] \u2026 The last guy that killed the eight people. \u2026 [Inaudible.] \u2026 So badly wounded people. \u2026 Twenty-two people came in through chain migration. Chain migration and the lottery system. They have a lottery in these countries.They take the worst people in the country, they put \u2018em into the lottery, then they have a handful of bad, worse ones, and they put them out. \u2018Oh, these are the people the United States. \u2026\u201d \u2026 We\u2019re gonna get rid of the lottery, and by the way, the Democrats agree with me on that. On chain migration, they pretty much agree with me.[Cross talk with guests.]CHRISTOPHER RUDDY, the president and chief executive of Newsmax: Canada, U.K., Australia. \u2026 All do best and brightest. \u2026TRUMP: Yeah, they have a merit system, we\u2019ll eventually go to a merit-based system. When we bring people in. \u2026 That No. 1, don\u2019t need our resources and No. 2, have great capabilities.SCHMIDT: Do you think I\u2019m wrong to think next year could be the year of you being a real deal maker, in a way you maybe weren\u2019t in the past year?TRUMP: I was. I make deals with the Republicans. I had nobody to make a deal with the Democrats. The Democrats could have made a much better tax deal for Democrats if they came to see us, but they didn\u2019t come. They never thought I\u2019d be able to get this over the line. And especially when McCain, when John McCain left and went to Arizona, they thought they had it made._________TRUMP: Which one?SCHMIDT: You said about the oil, that China. \u2026[Cross talk.]SCHMIDT: What\u2019s going on there. Tell me about that.TRUMP: Yeah, China. \u2026 China\u2019s been. \u2026 I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody\u2019s ever been treated in the history of China. You know that. The presentations. \u2026 One of the great two days of anybody\u2019s life and memory having to do with China. He\u2019s a friend of mine, he likes me, I like him, we have a great chemistry together. He\u2019s [inaudible] of the United States. \u2026[Inaudible.] China\u2019s hurting us very badly on trade, but I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war. O.K.?[Cross talk with guests.]_________SCHMIDT: Can you finish your thought on North Korea. What\u2019s going on with China?TRUMP: I\u2019m disappointed. You know that they found oil going into. \u2026SCHMIDT: But how recently?TRUMP: It was very recently. In fact, I hate to say, it was reported this morning, and it was reported on Fox. Oil is going into North Korea. That wasn\u2019t my deal!SCHMIDT: What was the deal?TRUMP: My deal was that, we\u2019ve got to treat them rough. They\u2019re a nuclear menace so we have to be very tough.RUDDY: Mr. President, was that a picture from recent or was that months ago? I don\u2019t know. \u2026TRUMP: Oil is going into North Korea, I know. Oil is going into North Korea. So I\u2019m not happy about it.SCHMIDT: So what are you going to do?TRUMP: We\u2019ll see. That I can\u2019t tell you, Michael. But we\u2019ll see. I can tell you one thing: This is a problem that should have been handled for the last 25 years. This is a problem, North Korea. That should have been handled for 25, 30 years, not by me. This should have been handled long before me. Long before this guy has whatever he has.So, China on trade has ripped off this country more than any other element of the world in history has ripped off anything. But I can be different if they\u2019re helping us with North Korea. If they don\u2019t help us with North Korea, then I do what I\u2019ve always said I want to do. China can help us much more, and they have to help us much more. And they have to help us much more. We have a nuclear menace out there, which is no good for China, and it\u2019s not good for Russia. It\u2019s no good for anybody. Does that make sense?SCHMIDT: Yeah, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.TRUMP: The only thing that supersedes trade to me \u2014 because I\u2019m the big trade guy, I got elected to a certain extent on trade. You see, I\u2019m renegotiating Nafta, or I\u2019ll terminate it. If I don\u2019t make the right deal, I\u2019ll terminate Nafta in two seconds. But we\u2019re doing pretty good. You know, it\u2019s easier to renegotiate it if we make it a fair deal because Nafta was a terrible deal for us. We lost $71 billion a year with Mexico, can you believe it? $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don\u2019t include lumber and they don\u2019t include oil. Oh, that\u2019s not. \u2026 [Inaudible,] \u2026 My friend Justin he says, \u201cNo, no, we break even.\u201d I said, \u2018Yeah, but you\u2019re not including oil, and you\u2019re not including lumber.\u201d When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we\u2019re losing $71 billion. So the only thing that supersedes trade to me is war. If we can solve the North Korea problem. China cannot. \u2026SCHMIDT: You still think there\u2019s a diplomatic solution?TRUMP: China has a tremendous power over North Korea. Far greater than anyone knows.SCHMIDT: Why haven\u2019t they stood up?TRUMP: I hope they do, but as of this moment, they haven\u2019t. They could be much stronger.SCHMIDT: But why not?TRUMP: China can solve the North Korea problem, and they\u2019re helping us, and they\u2019re even helping us a lot, but they\u2019re not helping us enough._________TRUMP: We\u2019re going to win another four years for a lot of reasons, most importantly because our country is starting to do well again and we\u2019re being respected again. But another reason that I\u2019m going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I\u2019m not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes. Without me, The New York Times will indeed be not the failing New York Times, but the failed New York Times. So they basically have to let me win. And eventually, probably six months before the election, they\u2019ll be loving me because they\u2019re saying, \u201cPlease, please, don\u2019t lose Donald Trump.\u201d O.K.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Missed Out on China. Can It Flourish in India?", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJODHPUR, India \u2014 Every month, about four million more Indians get online. They include people like Manju, a 35-year-old seamstress in this city of ancient palaces, who got her first internet phone last week.\u201cIt\u2019s all finished,\u201d she complained on Monday when a Google researcher came to visit to ask about her online habits.Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make the same mistake in India. It has marshaled some of its best developers, designers and researchers to figure out how to adapt or completely rethink products like YouTube to serve the needs of mobile internet users with smaller budgets but big aspirations.\u201cWe have to figure out how to build the right products for them,\u201d said Caesar Sengupta, the Google vice president who oversees Next Billion Users, its unit dedicated to creating products for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. \u201cThis is a very high priority for Google.\u201dMany of the new Indian users have basic phones, which make it difficult for them to run certain apps or to store big files like videos. Data plans are limited, and despite a telecom price war that has cut the price of a megabyte of data by as much as 97 percent, some customers are unable to afford more data when they run out.Google\u2019s Android software and apps like the Chrome browser, Maps and YouTube are often included with smartphones. But Facebook also makes products that vie for the attention of Indian consumers and advertisers.In fact, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram \u2014 all Facebook products \u2014 occupied three of the top six spots this year when the research firm App Annie measured how Indians spent their time online.Arjun Vishwanathan, associate director of emerging technologies at IDC India, said that search, Google\u2019s core expertise, was \u201cculturally not that important to Indians.\u201d\u201cWhere Google scores is its ability to keep it simple and keep it convenient while letting the consumer decide what she wants to do without being in her face,\u201d he said. Google also has vast amounts of data about its users that can be valuable in developing new products and targeting ads, he said.All of the work is backed by an extensive research effort by Google in India and other developing countries to examine how people really use their phones, what needs are unmet and how the company\u2019s apps are received.Datally was a product of such research. When a user opens it, a big screen pops up and shows how much mobile data the person has used, measurable by day, week or month. It also shows which apps are using the data and allows users to block some or all of them. A recent tweak added a feature for finding nearby Wi-Fi hot spots.Ted McCarthy, a Google user experience researcher, was in Jodhpur on Sunday and Monday to gather feedback on Datally and another app, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that is made to work on a $23 feature phone. He quizzed Indians about their internet use, their habits, even how they commuted to work, collecting information to take back to the team.One of the interview subjects, Deepika Panwar, 22, works in a bookkeeping job while trying to start a clothing and jewelry business. Most of her salary, Ms. Panwar said, goes to her parents to help support her younger brother and sister. She spends 179 rupees a month, or about $2.77, for a cellphone line with one gigabyte of data.She said her monthly data pack was often gone in 15 days as she browsed YouTube for fashion videos, used WhatsApp or surfed the web.When Mr. McCarthy showed her Datally, Ms. Panwar quickly grasped what it was about. \u201cIt is showing me what each application is doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be a great help to me.\u201dThe interviews confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that Datally\u2019s fundamental premise was sound: The tool would be useful to people with data constraints. But they also revealed a couple of problems. The app\u2019s Wi-Fi finder had few public hot spots to suggest. And the technical language on the sign-up screen \u2014 with a warning that the app was creating a virtual private network to monitor network traffic \u2014 stymied potential users.On Monday, Mr. McCarthy visited Manju and showed her the Google Assistant on her new Reliance Jio feature phone. The app allows her to speak commands to the phone in Hindi or English.Language has been a particular barrier for internet adoption in India. The voice-driven assistant has been very popular in India, with 28 percent of all Google searches conducted by voice.At first, the app had trouble understanding her. But before long, she had it answering her questions.\u201cI just say it, and it\u2019s there,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Pakistan, Yoga Rises Above Its Indian Origins", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorKARACHI, Pakistan \u2014 I first heard of yoga while I was growing up in Pakistan in the 1980s, with the arrival on the Karachi scene of a colorful personality called Professor Moiz Hussain. He had trained at the Yoga Institute in Mumbai, then branched out into alternative stress-reduction and healing techniques like reiki from Japan, NLP (neurolinguistic programming) from California and qigong, with roots in China. His Institute of Mind Sciences and Classical Yoga attracted a certain type of Karachi woman \u2014 affluent and well traveled \u2014 who was interested in developing her mind and body. Slowly at first, one teacher after another emerged to offer classes. Still, they had to be careful: The 1980s was a time of rigorous Islamization in Pakistan and cold hostility to India, and anything remotely associated with India or Hinduism was discouraged if not outlawed.This particularly affected the arts, namely classical Indian dance; government officials banned public performances as both \u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d; Pakistani students of the art could not obtain visas to study under gurus in India, and local teachers had to immigrate to other countries because classical dance became so unpopular they could not attract students. (Only Kathak, with its Mughal origins in northwestern India before partition, was looked upon with a less jaundiced eye than the unabashedly Hindu-flavored Odissi or Bharatanatyam schools of dance.)The way around this was to introduce yoga as a practice less spiritual than physical, but yoga classes in Karachi remained small, private and for a select few. Then, in the 1990s, when state-run television gave way to a profusion of private television channels, yoga found another outlet: breakfast and morning shows in which a physical activity segment aimed at housewives often included a 20-minute or half-hour yoga session. Sandwiched in between advice on the best foods for a baby and how to cook enticing meals for the household, a nonthreatening form of yoga \u2014 no extreme physical poses, just one that could be performed in modest clothing \u2014 was available to women in Pakistan with access to cable channels.Viewers were encouraged to stretch and breathe to cultivate healthy bodies and minds, a goal not incompatible with the moderately conservative form of Islam practiced by 90 percent of Pakistanis. Yoga even began to come out into the open, with sessions held in public parks, where some teachers made mild comparisons between yogic meditation and Islamic reflection, or the poses in a simple sun salutation and the positions taken in salat, a ritual Islamic prayer. This opened up yoga to middle-class, conservative Pakistanis who might have remained hostile to the practice had it been presented as a purely Hindu or Indian ascetic discipline.Today, yoga is immensely popular in all cities of Pakistan; a yoga teacher named Shamshad Haider claims to run 50 yoga clubs in Punjab, and International Yoga Day has been celebrated in Pakistan for three years in a row. Yoga is practiced all the way from Chitral in the north to Karachi in the south. There\u2019s a whole crop of younger teachers now equipped with training from India, Thailand and Bali, as well as from yoga schools in North America and Britain. Teachers at swank studios in Karachi attract students through Facebook pages and affiliations with the International Yoga Alliance.Their classes incorporate styles from hatha, vinyasa flow, ashtanga, even power yoga and Bikram yoga. They use the Sanskrit names for the poses interchangeably with the English ones, and both women-only and mixed classes are popular. Meanwhile, yoga still appears on television, in schools and in park sessions, with women meditating while wearing shalwar kameezes, or full abayas and hijabs, and men with long beards and shalwar kameezes performing sun salutations next to men in track pants and T-shirts.Yoga purists would probably bristle at the attempt to dissociate yoga from Hinduism or India, but it\u2019s not that different from what\u2019s happening to yoga in the West, with its hot yoga studios and aerial yoga and Yoga Asana championships. It also reminds me of what has been happening to Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. In the West, Sufism has been disconnected from its Muslim roots and presented as a universal movement of peace and tolerance, the 13th-century Persian mystic Rumi portrayed as a lovelorn poet singing of love rather than a conservative Islamic cleric bent on forging a fierce connection with his creator. A necessary sacrifice, perhaps, to spread the universal message of peace, tolerance and love.Pakistan, which was amputated from India in 1947, then lured by the promise of power and richness coming from the Middle East, has never been able to decide whether its identity is Arab or South Asian. After decades of trying to identify with a purely Islamic heritage and history, some Pakistanis are finally recognizing that their heritage is unique, informed by strains of tradition and heritage from many geographical areas: Central Asia and Persia, as well as India and the Middle East.Our current challenge is to reconnect with the many sources of our roots and heritage, while forging a new identity that will serve us well into the future. Pakistan recently unveiled a 1,700-year-old sleeping Buddha statue from an ancient Buddhist site in Bhamala, one of many that dot Pakistan\u2019s north and northwest \u2014 a strong testament to its pre-Islamic heritage. Progressive historians \u2014 admittedly in the minority still \u2014 are trying to educate Pakistani students about their country\u2019s ancient history and religions, after years of being told that Pakistan\u2019s history begins only with the invasion of Sindh by the Arab conqueror Muhammed bin Qasim in A.D. 711.As I practice yoga in the crisp air of a mild Karachi winter, gazing out to the Arabian Sea, I can\u2019t help wondering whether some of this reconnection might come from yoga. We move in unison as our teacher calls out the Sanskrit names of the poses called asanas. Then the call to prayer begins to ring out from a nearby mosque and we fall silent, listening to the sound of our own breaths and the time-old Arabic words of the azaan. As soon as the practice is over, I\u2019ll roll up my yoga mat and go find my prayer mat. I\u2019ve never felt so integrated, so connected to my Islamic heritage and my South Asian roots.Bina Shah is the author of several books of fiction, including, most recently, \u201cA Season for Martyrs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Knit a Giant Blanket", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen an unexpectedly cold front from China descended on parts of Southeast Asia this past week, people in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia bundled up in coats to stave off the region\u2019s unusual weather. But what\u2019s an elephant to do?\u201cWe haven\u2019t had weather this cold in 40 years,\u201d she said by phone on Sunday while traveling through northern Thailand.Temperatures fell to 8 degrees Celsius (46 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. But the camp, in the Bago Region of Myanmar, had another secret weapon: giant knitted and crocheted blankets. She said 95 percent are women, \u201cbut we do have a few men and, yes, they even crochet.\u201d \u201cWe make crochet and knitted blankets for a variety of orphaned baby wildlife animals, including but not limited to rhinos, elephants, chimpanzees, baboons, vervet monkeys. We also make crochet and knitted toys that act as a surrogate mother to our primate babies.\u201dWhen the temperatures dipped, Ms. Chailert and Blankets for Baby Rhinos connected on Facebook, and the blankets-for-baby-elephants operation began.But it has been an uphill battle. By the time the elephants arrive at the camps, she said, many are disabled, blind or otherwise sick. In all, 77 elephants are in her care. Ms. Caris said the blankets for the Winga Baw camp were sent to Thailand around the end of October, early November. Ms. Chailert said she traveled there and had them delivered to the Myanmar elephant camp.Young elephants, the natural history museum added, are removed from the wild for entertainment purposes and become orphaned when their mothers die trying to protect them.For the orphans at Winga Baw, the day starts with a blanket to keep them warm. They are tied firmly around the elephants\u2019 midsections. Before the animals have a mud bath, the blankets come off. After a swim, the blankets are restored, Ms. Chailert said.But how do you even begin to knit for a baby elephant? \u201cMostly, members use 100 percent acrylic yarn,\u201d she said by email, \u201cas it\u2019s easy to wash and wears well.\u201d She added, \u201cAs for design, we give our members carte blanche and, believe me, some blankets are nothing short of a masterpiece.\u201dWhen the blankets arrived at the Winga Baw camp, Ms. Chailert said, \u201call seven babies, they loved it.\u201dMs. Chailert said she wished that tourists would be more conscientious about elephant attractions when they travel, investigating the operations before climbing up for a ride.\u201cDon\u2019t accept cruelty to animals,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope that in 2018, people will be more careful and travel with care.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yemen\u2019s War Enters a Dark Stage as Rebels Squeeze the Capital", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The rebels who control Sana, the capital of Yemen, have tightened their grip on the city and its people in recent weeks, shutting off access to the internet, blocking social media sites and sending gunmen to raid the homes of anyone they suspect of opposing them.It also underlines the failure of the Houthis\u2019 foes, who include other Yemeni forces and Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, to turn the rebels\u2019 political isolation into an advantage on the battlefield.The Houthi alliance with Mr. Saleh\u2019s political party, the General People\u2019s Congress, also gave the rebels a wider political base than they otherwise would have had.But in the end, Mr. Saleh denounced the Houthis and said he wanted to turn a \u201cnew page\u201d with Saudi Arabia to end the war. On Dec. 4, the Houthis killed him for it.Saudi Arabia and the Houthis\u2019 other enemies had long sought to split Mr. Saleh and the rebels, believing that the Houthis\u2019 forces would fold easily if Mr. Saleh\u2019s loyalists turned against them. But they were unprepared to capitalize on the situation when it actually happened, and the Houthis have since done all they can to make sure that Mr. Saleh\u2019s remaining loyalists pose no threat.That has led to the crackdown in Sana, and other Houthi-controlled areas, with Houthi fighters arresting hundreds of Mr. Saleh\u2019s loyalists and locking them up, said Adel al-Shoga, a leader of Mr. Saleh\u2019s party who is in Cairo.About 45 of the party\u2019s top 50 leaders are still in Sana, he said, and about 15 of them are under house arrest. The rest are in hiding, looking for ways to sneak themselves and their families out of the city.\u201cThey are living in fear,\u201d Mr. Shoga said of his wife and children, who remain in the city. \u201cThey spend every minute wondering if they will get caught.\u201dMr. Saleh\u2019s killing came after he had established new contacts with Saudi Arabia and its allies, which hoped that he and his loyalists could turn the tide of the war. Even Western nations like the United States had hoped that Mr. Saleh\u2019s party could play a role in negotiations to end the conflict, which began in 2014 when the Houthis and forces loyal to Mr. Saleh seized Sana, later sending the internationally recognized government into exile.A few months later, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia began a punishing bombing campaign that has failed to push the Houthis back while intensifying a humanitarian crisis.But members of Mr. Saleh\u2019s party interviewed recently said that instead of turning the party against the Houthis, Mr. Saleh\u2019s death had shattered it.The General People\u2019s Congress was never really united by a shared vision as much as it was held together by Mr. Saleh\u2019s leadership and his ability to distribute patronage, analysts said. Once he was gone, little held the group together.Even though many members seethed at the Houthis for killing Mr. Saleh, few wanted to change sides and join the Saudi-led coalition that had been bombing them for years. And those who may have wanted to fight the Houthis lacked the ability to do so.\u201cThere is deep depression occupying most of the people after the departure of Saleh, whom they saw as the last solution to get rid of the crisis,\u201d said Asem Alshamiri, a Yemeni journalist in Sana who is close to the party.\u201cThe capital is witnessing the worst days in terms of the humanitarian, psychological, military and political situation, and anxiety is hovering over everyone,\u201d he said.Many Houthis, too, believe they have destroyed Mr. Saleh\u2019s party.\u201cThe party is dead,\u201d said Ahmed Abdel-Wali Dahab, a Houthi commander reached by phone. \u201cThe ones who are under house arrest are obviously not going to reach out to anyone, and they can\u2019t go anywhere. And everyone else is on the run.\u201dTo keep their enemies from conspiring against them, the Houthis have used their control of Yemen\u2019s communications infrastructure to shut off access to the internet for days on end and to block social media sites like Facebook.\u201cIt is not hard,\u201d Mr. Dahab said. \u201cWe have telecommunication companies in Sana full of people who have been educated abroad. We had to stop our enemies from communicating with each other.\u201dSome analysts predict that the political isolation of the Houthis will catch up with them, either because the opposition to their rule will become too hard to manage or because they will run out of money, leaving them unable to provide services in areas where they are the de facto government.The areas under their control already suffer dire electricity shortages, which have contributed to the world\u2019s worst contemporary outbreak of cholera. And many civil servants have not received salaries in more than a year, pushing many families that used to be middle class into poverty.Yemeni tribal officials said an airstrike on Saturday by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 10 people and wounded 25 others in Sana, according to The Associated Press. The officials said the airstrike had targeted a gathering of tribesmen supporting the Houthis.The Saudi-led coalition has sought other ways to increase the pressure on the Houthis.This month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, met with leaders from Islah, the political party long considered the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. consider a terrorist organization.U.A.E. officials said the party had broken ties with the international Muslim Brotherhood, which was apparently enough of a guarantee for the Persian Gulf nations in their search for allies.Abdelwahab al-Anasi, the secretary general of Islah, said by phone from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that the meeting was a \u201cturning point,\u201d and that the party had been asked to reach out to remnants of Mr. Saleh\u2019s party to see about working with them against the Houthis.So far, they have had little luck.\u201cWe are simply having an extremely difficult time reaching them,\u201d Mr. Anasi said. \u201cThese are confusing times. It will take a while for us to get a clear picture of what is actually happening in Sana.\u201dShuaib Almosawa contributed reporting from Amman, Jordan, and Saeed Al-Batati from Al Mukalla, Yemen.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney Makes $52.4 Billion Deal for 21st Century Fox in Big Bet on Streaming", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion.Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video.\u201cThe pace of disruption has only hastened,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. \u201cThis will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.\u201dBut lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content \u2014 namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood.Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal.The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks.There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in theaters on Friday.)\u201cI know a lot of people are wondering, \u2018Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u2019\u201d Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. \u201cAre we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.\u201dMr. Murdoch\u2019s older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman, added that the move was \u201cabout returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand\u201d that would be \u201cfocused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports.\u201dThere has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dThe Murdochs declined an interview request.Mr. Iger is buying 21st Century Fox\u2019s minority stake in Hulu, resulting in majority control of the streaming service by Disney, which previously owned 30 percent. Comcast and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.The Disney-Fox merger is happening as the Justice Department fights AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in court. Mr. Iger acknowledged that antitrust regulators would heavily scrutinize Disney\u2019s purchase but expressed confidence about winning their approval. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that President Trump had spoken with Rupert Murdoch and \u201ccongratulated him\u201d on the deal.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Iger said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dWhen Mr. Iger announced Disney\u2019s streaming strategy in September, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot.\u201d At the time, his comment was viewed in Hollywood as old-fashioned showboating.Not anymore.To augment ESPN Plus, Disney is adding 21st Century Fox\u2019s chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, including the YES Network, which carries New York Yankees games.As part of the deal, Disney will also get the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. That component of the deal would seem to contradict Disney\u2019s push to lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable subscriptions that is now in decline as people turn to streaming services for home entertainment.With the acquisition, \u201cDisney goes from being a juggernaut to being a megajuggernaut,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Cahall and other analysts said the acquisition would likely prompt other entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation immediately surrounded Viacom and CBS, which share common ownership; Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls rights to the James Bond franchise; and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has struggled with low box office market share.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox dwarfs those deals and will create complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney cost-cutting. Disney said it expected the acquisition to yield at least $2 billion in total cost savings.And though Mr. Iger played down any antitrust issues, others in Hollywood have already disagreed.\u201cThe antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant,\u201d the screenwriters\u2019 union, the Writers Guild of America West, said in a statement on Monday, calling media consolidation a \u201crelentless drive to eliminate competition.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Facebook App for Children Ignites Debate Among Families", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Few big technology companies have dared to create online products for boys and girls ages 13 and under.In doing so, Facebook immediately reignited a furious debate about how young is too young for children to use mobile apps and how parents should deal with the steady creep of technology into family life, especially as some fight to reduce the amount of time their sons and daughters spend in front of screens. On one side are parents like Matt Quirion of Washington, who said Facebook\u2019s snaking its way into his children\u2019s lives at an early age would most likely do more harm than good.\u201cI\u2019m an avid social media user, but I don\u2019t feel my kids need more social interaction,\u201d said Mr. Quirion, 39, whose three children are between ages 3 and 9. \u201cThey need their personal time to process all the social interaction and learn to grow into mature people.\u201dJust as vocal are parents like Parker Thompson of Alameda, Calif., who said children\u2019s adoption of technology is an inevitability and who appreciated Facebook\u2019s approach with the new app.\u201cToday, much of the time our options come down to giving kids devices and trusting things will work out, watching them closely at all times, or banning technology,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, 38, a father of three children between 6 months to 8 years old. \u201cTech is going to be something kids adopt. The question is how this will happen.\u201d\u201cRight now for kids, the time they spend on devices is very passive,\u201d said David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a device that helps you connect with others close to them.\u201dMessenger Kids is built so that children do not sign up for new Facebook accounts themselves; Facebook\u2019s terms of service require that users be 13 or older. The app requires an adult with a Facebook account to set up the app for his or her child. After adults enter their Facebook account information into the app, they are asked to create the child\u2019s profile and which friends or relatives he or she will be allowed to connect with on Messenger. Every additional friend request requires approval by the parent.The app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos. As with Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, children can add filters or playful drawings to the photos they send.Loren Cheng, product director for Messenger Kids, said Facebook would not use for marketing purposes the details it collected from children. He also said the company would not automatically convert children\u2019s accounts to adult accounts when they turned 13.The app, which will be in a preview release on Apple\u2019s iOS devices before rolling out to a wider audience in the coming months, is Facebook\u2019s latest effort to increase the number of people who rely on its service to connect with one another regularly. More than two billion people use Facebook every month, while its other apps, like Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, also have billions of users.If Messenger Kids proves popular, Facebook may reap many benefits. The company could see increased messaging activity and more engaged, regularly returning users, not to mention insights and data on how families interact on Messenger.Some children\u2019s and privacy groups commended Facebook for saying that Messenger Kids would give parents control over children\u2019s messaging and not show ads to children. But they also described Messenger Kids as a marketing effort to increase consumer loyalty.Others cautioned that the app raised concerns about children\u2019s privacy.The privacy policy also says that \u201cMessenger Kids is part of Facebook\u201d and that the company may share information collected in the app with other Facebook services. While parents can delete their children\u2019s Messenger Kids accounts, the policy says, the messages and content that a child sent to and received from others \u201cmay remain visible to those users.\u201d\u201cWhy should parents simply trust that Facebook is acting in the best interest of children?\u201d Mr. Steyer asked.Still, the company said that issue was largely separate from Messenger. Facebook said its overall mission remained centered on bringing the world closer together.\u201cWe can\u2019t let the current state of things prevent us from doing our jobs, which is to solve real problems in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Marcus, the head of Messenger at Facebook, said.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grace, a Celebrated Chicago Restaurant, Closes After Its Founders Leave", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chef, Curtis Duffy, and Michael Muser, the general manager, who also ran the wine program, had been in a monthslong conflict with Michael Olszewski, the wealthy Chicago real estate investor who owns the restaurant.Under the guidance of Mr. Duffy and Mr. Muser, Grace became one of only 14 restaurants in the United States to be awarded three Michelin stars, and was one of the jewels in a city whose culinary star has been on the rise.Mr. Duffy and Mr. Muser said in a statement to The New York Times that \u201cit became evident that our evolving goals and aspirations were no longer aligned with the restaurant and its future, making this change necessary. As this chapter ends, another begins. We plan to spend quality time with our families as we develop our next project.\u201dMr. Duffy and Mr. Muser had explored the possibility of a purchase that would give them complete financial and creative control of Grace, their spokeswoman said. But a new investor pulled out and the transaction did not happen.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Olszewski said Wednesday night that there had been other problems with the two men. Mr. Duffy had quit in May, but returned to the restaurant in September. Although Mr. Muser announced his departure on Wednesday, he confirmed through a spokeswoman that he had actually been fired on Dec. 1. Mr. Duffy\u2019s last day at the restaurant was Dec. 18.Later in the evening, Mr. Olszewski issued this statement: \u201cGrace had an incredible run and everyone who had a role in it, from the front of the house and kitchen staff to Curtis and myself, should hold their heads up high, but that run has come to an end. This space will live to see another day with yet another great restaurant headed by a new team that will make Chicago and the restaurant community proud.\u201dMr. Duffy dreamed up Grace as he worked his way through Chicago\u2019s top kitchens, including Charlie Trotter\u2019s and Alinea, the only other Chicago restaurant with three Michelin stars. Alinea\u2019s tasting menu, like Grace\u2019s, tops $200 a person.The harried, pressure-filled days preceding Grace\u2019s opening in 2012 in the West Loop neighborhood of Chicago were examined in \u201cFor Grace,\u201d which also dug deep into the personal life of Mr. Duffy, whose childhood in a central Ohio working-class family was punctuated by domestic violence. His father shot his mother and then himself in a 1994 murder-suicide.Mr. Duffy found solace in a junior high school home-economics class, and his teacher remains a friend and mentor.That the two men would walk away when the restaurant, by all accounts, was at its height would be a shock to the city\u2019s restaurant community akin to the unexpected death of the chef Charlie Trotter in 2013, Mr. Pang said.News of the closing spread quickly on Chicago social media Wednesday night.\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,\u201d Samantha Bomkamp, who writes about the restaurant business for The Chicago Tribune, wrote in a Twitter message.Paul Leddy, who works for a Chicago wine and spirits distributor, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWow ... just wow. This is huge hit to Chicago dining scene.\u201dMr. Duffy is working with a legal team to determine where and when he might be able to open another restaurant, said Janet Isabelli, his spokeswoman. But nothing will likely be what Grace was to him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Duck and Lentils: Deep Flavor for the Depths of Winter", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenI like beans all year round, but I especially appreciate them in winter. A plate of pinto beans studded with hunks of smoky, long-cooked bacon, for me, is a special feast. Or cannellini beans stewed with olive oil and herbs, or a steaming bowl of spicy black bean soup. I\u2019m a lentil fan, too. I like them in nearly any guise, from any of the world\u2019s cuisines.Bright coral-hued red lentils are a favorite of mine; since they have the hulls removed, they cook quickly, so they are perfect for soups and for traditional Indian dal. Ordinary brown lentils, the kind you find in the supermarket, are also good for soup, though a brown lentil soup has a somewhat somber appearance.Lentils from Castelluccio, in Umbria, Italy, are small and extremely tasty, and they keep their shape when cooked, though there are other excellent varieties found in the country\u2019s different regions. Lentils and sausage are a common Italian theme, and, for the New Year, lentils are considered auspicious. Their coin-shaped form, it is said, invites prosperity.In France, you find lentil salad on offer in nearly every charcuterie, to be eaten with slices of garlicky saucisson, perfectly combined for a light supper or an impromptu picnic.These lentils might be the tiny, celebrated ones from Le Puy, in the Auvergne region. Lentilles du Puy, as they are called, are a beautiful mottled gray-green, and one of their virtues is keeping somewhat firm when cooked, and not collapsing into mush. (Of course, their primary virtue is their delicious flavor, verging on nutty.)Lentils really shine in tandem with duck. Duck with lentils (combined in various ways) is considered delicious everyday fare for lunch or dinner in France. There are variations on the theme on restaurant menus and in home kitchens.It might be a roasted duck breast, a braised duck leg or a crisp fried piece of duck confit, snuggled against a mound of juicy lentils cooked with onion, carrot, celery and thyme. The combination is almost magical, a truly serendipitous pairing.For a holiday gathering, I bought small duck legs and braised them with red wine and aromatics, aiming for something similar to coq au vin. I wanted a deep-flavored saucy dish for a chilly winter evening.I could have served a potato pur\u00e9e, a familiar accompaniment to this sort of stew, but, thankfully, I had lentils in the pantry.The combination of tender braised duck, earthy lentils and an assortment of root vegetables was a winning one for a warming winter meal.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Porch Pirates\u2019 Steal Holiday Packages as They Pile Up at Homes", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 It is a season for giving and, according to law enforcement officials in Washington County, Ore., taking as well.Two weeks ago, its Sheriff\u2019s Office ran a sting operation to catch porch pirates, thieves who swipe packages from Amazon and other companies from doorsteps. Detectives from the department\u2019s property crimes unit put several electronics items worth more than $500 in a box, dropped in a tracking device and \u201cbaited\u201d a volunteer\u2019s front porch in the town of Aloha.Sure enough, a pirate struck just after 2 a.m., and deputies traced him to a home two blocks away. In an apparent effort to cover up his deed, the 27-year-old suspect microwaved the tracking device, so he was charged with evidence tampering in addition to theft.Porch pirates have darkened people\u2019s doorsteps for years. Law enforcement agencies say they think the crime is on the rise, along with the growth of online shopping. \u201cThere\u2019s more packages for them to grab,\u201d said Angela Sands, a spokeswoman for the Police Department in Lincoln, Neb.And the rewards are especially attractive during the holiday season. United Parcel Service plans to deliver 750 million packages this season, up from 500 million five years ago.\u201cOne of the outcomes is you\u2019ve got one of the easiest ways to steal something ever,\u201d said Nirav Tolia, chief executive of Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhoods that has become a popular outlet for residents to gripe about stolen boxes.It is yet another sign that the endless capacity of technology to improve lives has led to endless criminal innovation as well.Mike Armstrong, a general contractor in Memphis, has earned a reputation on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor forums as something of a vigilante. By his own estimate, Mr. Armstrong has confronted suspected package thieves more than a dozen times over the last four years, once on his own porch with the aid of his surveillance system.He said his neighbors call him the \u201cstrong arm of the law,\u201d a play on his last name.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like this sick perversion I have, catching thieves,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.Technology is also amplifying awareness of the problem, while serving as a deterrent. Internet surveillance cameras from Google\u2019s Nest and Ring have made it easier for residents to capture video of package thieves in the act. Ring makes internet-connected doorbell cameras that start at $179. Homeowners can speak through the device to visitors \u2014 or bad guys \u2014 at their front doors using a smartphone app, even if they are not home.YouTube, Facebook, Nextdoor and other social media are popular places for frustrated residents to share the footage. Camera companies like Ring have used the videos as marketing.Law enforcement agencies are stepping up their efforts to deter package thieves. On Cyber Monday, postal inspectors and police officers in the Portland, Ore., area put out 21 bait packages. They made four arrests and recovered a stolen vehicle, according to Sgt. Christopher Burley, a spokesman for the Portland Police Department.Steve Gaut, a UPS spokesman, said public perception of the problem was rising, \u201cdriven by the greater use and affordability of home surveillance technology and the pervasiveness of social media and related user-generated social content.\u201d The company does not think there has been a significant increase in the per-capita incidence of package theft, he said, but many victims never report their problems to the company.Amazon, by far the nation\u2019s largest online retailer, said the vast majority of packages made it to customers without being stolen, but declined to provide specifics. The company typically replaces deliveries that are reported stolen.Walmart, the nation\u2019s second-largest online retailer, did not respond to requests for comment.Steven Kenworthy, a graduate student at Ohio State University in Columbus, expected a large box from Amazon with a $400 electric skateboard to arrive at his home in June. Amazon told him its carrier had delivered the item, but there was no trace of it.\u201cSome rascal snagged my package,\u201d Mr. Kenworthy said. He went on his neighborhood\u2019s Nextdoor discussion forums and found reports of missing packages and suspected thieves tailing FedEx trucks through the area.\u201cEverybody\u2019s problems start feeling like your problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were talking about how it was every single day packages would go missing.\u201dAmazon sent him a replacement skateboard at no charge within two days, he said.Mr. Kenworthy said he had no intention of installing a camera outside his home because he thought it would make him feel more violated.\u201cIt\u2019s going to make me mad,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There were moments of goodness and humanity, and they deserve to remembered.\u201cIt is kind of ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in an interview from Busan, South Korea, on Tuesday. \u201cI look there like Mr. Dork, and all of a sudden my kids come in and it\u2019s chaos.

One thing that hasn\u2019t changed: His 4-year-old daughter still won\u2019t wait for him to finish his interviews. Now she\u2019ll just bang on the locked door, since she knows he\u2019s in there.He spoke to The Times on his cellphone as he returned home from dinner, and she was supposed to be asleep as he walked in. But she waited up for him, and this reporter could hear giggling and squealing in the background as she watched her father speak on the phone. Mr. Kelly repeatedly paused the interview to try to bargain with her, but she drove a hard bargain.\u201cPlease just let Daddy talk on the phone for one minute,\u201d he said to her. \u201cPlease, baby, please.\u201dWe weren\u2019t offended.Make sure you have your sound on, then watch this. Maybe watch it a few dozen times.No one was harmed in the making of the video. Jonathan, 5, and the pocketknife he got his hands on were corralled by adults after a brief chase around the pool, said Chelsey Ryan, 22, who threw the party in her Joppa, Md., backyard for her mother\u2019s birthday. Jonathan is her godson, and she had taken the video to send to his godfather, who is stationed with the Navy in Hawaii.\u201cI was terrified, honestly,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why the video was so short. We didn\u2019t know what he had.\u201dThe woman inaccurately known as \u201cKnife Mom\u201d \u2014 the voice of horror \u2014 is April Holsapple, 20, a family friend who had met Jonathan only once before. But her maternal instinct kicked in when she saw him running with something in his hand, she said in an interview.\u201cHe had a look on his face like he was up to no good,\u201d she said.Don\u2019t get confused \u2014 he\u2019s normally a good boy, Ms. Ryan and Ms. Holsapple said. Sure, he\u2019s got a lot of energy and likes to have fun, but he listens when his parents tell him something is wrong, as they did soon after the video ended. Turns out, the clever little sneak had pickpocketed the knife from his uncle.Days later, a friend found the video on Ms. Ryan\u2019s phone and tweeted it out to the world. They find it as funny as everyone else does, and enjoyed seeing their video on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d and Fox News.Jonathan doesn\u2019t understand what it means to go viral on Twitter. But \u201che thought it was pretty cool to see himself on YouTube,\u201d Ms. Ryan said.Ever lay out the perfect plans, only to have a totally unforeseen wrinkle come in at the last second and ruin everything?Since everyone can say yes to that question, it\u2019s hard not to relate to the anguished cameraman in this video.Jason Rudge, a video producer at the Weather Channel, had arrived at a media platform at 4 a.m. on Nov. 20 to live-stream the Georgia Dome\u2019s implosion on the channel\u2019s Facebook page. The implosion wouldn\u2019t happen until 7:33 a.m., so he had plenty of time to set up the shot.Organizers told the news media that the roads would be closed during the implosion, said Katherine Wong, a Weather Channel spokeswoman.\u201cAt the moment of the implosion, all eyes were glued to their camera viewfinder, so nobody really knew the bus was pulling up until it was too late,\u201d she said.In May, Carter Wilkerson, a 16-year-old high school junior in Reno, Nev., asked Wendy\u2019s \u2014 or the fast-food company\u2019s Twitter account \u2014 how many retweets he\u2019d need for them to give him a year\u2019s worth of chicken nuggets.Get 18 million, the company responded, and he\u2019d be flush in nuggets.Before the fateful tweet, he wasn\u2019t one to call attention to himself, he said last week in a phone interview. He would skip his school\u2019s talent shows, worried that he\u2019d embarrass himself.\u201cBut I got used to it, and I grew into it, and it has definitely changed me as a person,\u201d he said.The company did give him \u201cnuggets for a year\u201d in the form of $1,000 in gift cards. He didn\u2019t use them much in the fall because he was a captain on his school\u2019s football team, so he was trying to eat healthy, he said. But he has no such restrictions now and has been going to Wendy\u2019s about every other day, he said.Is he sick of nuggets? Not yet, he said. But the gift cards have given him the option to branch out on the menu.\u201cSometimes if I\u2019m not in the mood for nuggets I can get a Baconator or something else,\u201d he said.Let\u2019s not overthink this. It\u2019s a dancing hot dog.In June, Snapchat allowed users to superimpose an animated hot dog into their videos, and the animated hot dog had some sick moves. It would dance on a desk, on the top of your dog\u2019s head \u2014 wherever a camera pointed, there it was.People loved it. By August, when Snapchat pulled it down to cycle through new \u201clenses,\u201d it had been viewed more than 1.5 billion times, a spokesman said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Video Journalist Wrestles With the Candor of an Egyptian Woman", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe first time I met Esraa, we sat in a coffee shop in downtown Cairo. It\u2019s a part of the city that feels as if it reverberates with the fading chants of revolution.I saw voters go to the ballot box, replacing President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled unchallenged for nearly 30 years, with Mohamed Morsi, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood. And I saw the election change very little.Today, the same streets are eerily quiet. Esraa mostly whispered when she told me her story. A young woman who was tired of living under the thumb of the government, she risked her life by openly rebelling against Egypt\u2019s conservative mores.I have returned to Egypt for at least six reporting trips since 2011. Never was I looking for a story related to the revolution. But every time I landed, I noticed a pronounced change in the mind-sets of the generation whose political consciousness was shaped by the Arab Spring and influenced by social media, where these young people engaged with the world.On the heels of the revolution, a palpable social transformation had begun and continued to advance despite the severe crackdown on political freedoms. Many Muslims, ordinary men and women, started to grapple with the perversion of their religion by extremism, realizing that radical ideas had seeped into the mainstream.Through my reporting, I met women who had removed the veil, Islamic reformists who were challenging conventional sheikhs, groups of outspoken atheists, and young Muslims turning to mystical Sufism as an alternative to the austere Salafi creed. Eventually someone introduced me to Esraa.Esraa was in high school when the revolution started. She took to the streets with her parents, celebrating Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fall and rejoicing over the Brotherhood\u2019s victory in the country\u2019s first democratic election.Her father, who died from cancer a few years after the revolution, was a devoted Brotherhood member. Her mother was less overtly political, but a Brotherhood supporter nonetheless, and devout and traditional. When she circumcised Esraa at the age of 14, she explained that the operation keeps a girl \u201cpure and respectable.\u201dI chose to follow Esraa for this documentary because she was remarkably thoughtful and uncharacteristically open. Because of her candor, a strange familiarity developed between us. I wanted my film to feel intimate, but I also worried that Esraa was revealing too much.Her every act was one of rebellion. Living in a coed space with friends. Showing her affection for a man who was not her husband. Smoking cigarettes in public. Investigating human rights abuses in secret.She was politically cynical and now had her doubts about God. To do so, in her world, was to risk losing her family, her freedom and her life.Like almost every girl she knew, Esraa started wearing a head scarf when she was in middle school. At the time, she thought she had chosen it.But in college, when she joined student movements and led protests fighting to preserve the right of free expression, she started to realize how limited her choices were. \u201cWhen I looked to see what was wrong with me, I saw the veil,\u201d Esraa told me in that first meeting.It was a bold statement in a country where the large majority of women are still veiled and where the veil is loaded with meaning. It is modesty, it is ideology, it is culture, it is tradition, it is sacrifice, it is identity \u2014 ripping it off is akin to changing skins.The first time Esraa and I spoke, she was nervous. But as she relaxed and I began achieving the much-coveted \u201cfly on the wall\u201d status, I grew nervous.We often filmed with our iPhones to avoid drawing attention to Esraa or to our work, especially when we were in public. And I reminded her repeatedly that I was a journalist, that the camera was rolling and that she had a mic attached to her. Esraa laughed because she had stopped caring.Why take the gamble? I asked her on our last day of shooting.\u201cBecause I need to have those safe spaces where I can express myself in an absolute way, without being judged,\u201d she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s sympathy or pity. I need to speak to people who will have respect for me and for my experience.\u201dShe saw in my camera an opportunity to be who she wanted to be. The small stage I offered Esraa, the direct questions I asked her and the interest I took in her personal evolution were everything she craved. She understood the consequences of letting herself be heard.I did, too, but I did not imagine that I would see them play out as soon as they did.The last time I met Esraa was in late November. I had not been able to reach her for days. She had changed her number and deactivated her Facebook account.Her good friend Sarah helped arrange our meeting. When I sat down with Esraa, she told me she was hiding.The story goes like this: In September, Esraa attended a concert for a Lebanese rock band whose lead singer is openly gay. It was in Cairo, she was with her friends, the music was thumping, she was dancing, a friend lifted her up on his shoulders, and before she knew it, she had a rainbow flag in her hand.Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, she waved the flag, high over her head. And her friend snapped a picture. Esraa posted the photo to her Facebook account accompanied with a post where she denounced discrimination.Esraa was not at her mother\u2019s place when the police came for her. And she has not returned to visit since then. She left her job, she moved apartments and she has been living in a state of total paralysis.In early December, there were no official charges, but those who had been arrested were accused of \u201cinciting debauchery\u201d and could face years in prison.I reminded Esraa of her words to me when we were filming: I am not scared of anything.I asked her again if she was afraid.\u201cIt is not fear that is dominating me; it is despair,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have no regrets. I did nothing wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cheo Found Solace in the Mountains of Puerto Rico", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "B. 1930Eighteen hours before Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, Margaret Heredia stood in her kitchen, clutching the phone and looking out over San Francisco Bay. On the other end of the line, thousands of miles away, her aunt Luisa was organizing food and water reserves. She was waiting for an ambulance to pick up Heredia\u2019s father, Cheo, and take him to a facility run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he was supposed to stay during the storm.Many of Heredia\u2019s family members had never set foot outside the village, and with the storm coming, they had no intention of doing so now. Like their native Ta\u00edno ancestors, they were superstitious, so Heredia doodled while speaking to her aunt, as if sketching out the verbal gymnastics that she was performing to keep either of them from speculating about what might happen next. Cheo, whose full name was Jos\u00e9 Heredia Medina, was 87. He needed an oxygen tank to breathe. Heredia could feel Luisa begin to zero in on something that neither of them wanted to hear. \u201cThis storm is going to bring death to us,\u201d Luisa told her.As a young man, Cheo was an adventurer. He was tall, with small almond-shaped eyes under a protruding brow line and hands that were permanently cracked and swollen from the endless heaving and hiking that life in the Puerto Rican mountains requires. While the topography had insinuated itself onto his body, Cheo\u2019s heart and mind were elsewhere, gripped with fascination for Americans, who controlled the island politically, making him an American citizen. He studied hard \u2014 especially in English classes \u2014 and when he was drafted into the Army in 1952 at age 21, he practically leapt off the plot of land that had been in his family since at least the 1850s to explore this unknown part of his identity.But when Cheo began to serve his country, he discovered that his connection to the mainland was not necessarily mutual. He served in a Puerto Rican-only unit in Korea and told his family that they were sent into dangerous areas ahead of white soldiers, and that as a result, more of them were sent home in body bags. Like many veterans of his generation, he later refused to go into detail about his service. For years afterward, he occasionally lost the battle to forget \u2014 springing up, cold and sweating, in the middle of the night, with no idea where he was.After Cheo was discharged in 1954, he moved back to Puerto Rico briefly to marry Esther Gonz\u00e1lez, who was also from Sabana Grande Alta. She was strikingly beautiful, spoke no English and had only a second-grade education, and she was won over by his swashbuckling spirit and vision for their future. They had five children, then set off to try to penetrate American culture. After uncomfortable stints in New York and Florida, they settled in Milwaukee, where, as the only Latinos in their neighborhood, they had few stereotypes to burden them. They each worked multiple jobs to cobble together enough money to buy a house and support eight children. Cheo\u2019s American dream had begun a second time, but it looked much different from what he had imagined.Cheo hated the snow and kept the heat blazing year round. A divide grew between the children born in Puerto Rico, who struggled to make friends and learn English, and their younger siblings, whom they resented for being fully American out of the womb. The friction began to chip away at Cheo\u2019s spirit. His eyes darkened, and he rarely smiled anymore. As his flashbacks to the war became worse, he drank more and became violent.The disillusionment peaked around 1971, Heredia remembers, when Cheo became fed up with the managers at one of his jobs, who said Puerto Ricans were lazy and dirty and passed him over for a series of promotions. He filed a lawsuit against his employer for workplace discrimination, and after losing because of insufficient evidence, he had reached a breaking point. He left his wife and children and moved back to Puerto Rico, retreating into the three-room structure where four generations of his family were raised.He supported himself by selling hand-squeezed juices and spicy vinegars made from the fruits and peppers that grew outside his home. After he left the United States, a few of his children vowed never to speak to him again. Those with whom he kept in touch communicated with him by sending letters because he did not have a phone. Over time, even his English deteriorated.The sting of rejection that he felt in the United States never left him. Besides his children, the only connection that Cheo maintained with the mainland was through the V.A., which provided his health care. He locked up the other reminders of that time \u2014 the lawsuit, his service medal from Korea \u2014 in an old suitcase and shoved it under his bed.After the hurricane, parts of Puerto Rico were unreachable for weeks. In California, Heredia couldn\u2019t sleep, so she lay in bed at night, staring up at the ceiling. She called her Puerto Rican family members over and over, but telephone networks had been wiped out, so she couldn\u2019t get through. On Facebook, she pleaded for anyone with information about conditions to share it. She and her siblings found a hotline for a Puerto Rican government office in Washington, and they reported their family members missing.On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, a cousin contacted the family after trudging through mud for hours and hitchhiking to a working phone. The cousin said Heredia\u2019s aunt Luisa, who had fractured her hip, was alive but too unwell to travel or talk on the phone. Cheo had run out of oxygen and died. His ambulance never came.B. 1936There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for \u201cOrdinary People\u201d in which Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore, takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top, and the only action in the scene is Beth, the cold, bereaved mother, looking at the cake, adjusting the cherries, then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment \u2014 what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness?He shot it once; no good. He shot it again; no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or, Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he\u2019d say: \u201cNo, no, clear your mind. Let\u2019s go again.\u201d Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene, Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it \u201cthe bane of the production.\u201d He shot it over and over, 26 times in total in front of a \u201cmystified\u201d crew, she wrote in her memoir.Read more \u25beB. 1935One cold mountain night in 1971, Royal Shannon Robbins dangled from ropes hundreds of feet up the gigantic Yosemite cliff called El Capitan, clutching a hammer and chisel and worrying that he had made a shameful mistake. The most influential American rock climber of the 20th century, and a serious-minded fellow who disdained vanity, Robbins had spent that whole day chopping steel bolts off El Capitan, obliterating the climbing route called Wall of the Early Morning Light, created by his alcoholic rival, Warren Harding.Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted \u2014 \u201ca game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life,\u201d as he once put it. The sport, in his view, should always be a quest for self-understanding, not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite \u2014 there was only so much cliff \u2014 so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware, like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.Read more \u25beB. 1926John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1932Gregory didn\u2019t want people\u2019s fear to stop them from standing up.

He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall, handsome, fit, his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different \u2014 not the tortured, noirish character who came to life in 1939, in the shadow of totalitarianism, but rather one who was ready for the colorful, splashy 1960s, the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick, Robin, would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they\u2019d be doing it with a wink and a nudge, hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script, West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch.

The items varied, but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project, because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester, the students would draw and redraw them \u2014 in different styles, in different media, in different orders \u2014 until he was satisfied. While each student worked, he circled the room, clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon, peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. \u201cYou\u2019re in college,\u201d he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in.At Connecticut College, a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked, on certain days, not unlike a country club, Hendricks was considered \u201cintense.\u201d (I should know.

Seeing the damage, most of the children hastily packed up and left, but Ratushinskaya and another student, a boy named Seryozha, were in charge of cleaning the classroom after school that day and had to stay. A teacher came in, discovered the broken inkwell and asked them who had done it.

It always amazed him: everything you could see, just by looking \u2014 also, everything the people he was watching didn\u2019t see. \u201cLast observation to make,\u201d he put in his notes in April 1964, watching the authorities in Anchorage scramble after a colossal earthquake. \u201cIt was only on Wednesday that people around the office began to inquire who we were.\u201d He\u2019d been sitting in that office since Sunday.Enrico Quarantelli was always looking; the compulsion to notice everything, and passively accept nothing, defined him as a sociologist and a human being. \u201cI was born Nov. 10, 1924, in New York City,\u201d he says at the start of an oral-history interview, and when he adds, \u201cFor some reason, I remember absolutely nothing of the first five years of my life,\u201d he seems genuinely aggrieved by this lapse in his observational record. The animating moment of his early career came in 1952, after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also, somehow, marauding and clobbering one another for food. (\u201cThe premise was that people were sheep, except when they were wolves,\u201d as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas, Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally, even generously. They protected one another. They rushed to look for survivors. There was no traffic jam to frantically flee the disaster area; the traffic coming in, to help, was worse.

His mother, Ceaya LaFrance Thomas, gave birth to him when she herself was in high school, so he was raised by his grandmother Willie Jane Thomas while Ceaya finished up. Though Ceaya returned to Saginaw after college and was in Thomas\u2019s life, home for him was at Grandma\u2019s. His mother recalls the bond those two had: \u201cAfter football practice, he\u2019d go home, take a shower and get in bed with my mama, and they\u2019d curl up and talk about their day. He\u2019d make her laugh. He made everybody laugh.\u201d If Ceaya wanted to spend more time with her son, Willie Jane would say, \u201cWell, you can just spend the night with us\u201d \u2014 and she often did.Read more \u25beB. 1936B. 1947Shirley Childress Johnson became a professional sign-language interpreter at a time when the number of black sign-language interpreters was vanishingly small. The work was personal: Johnson\u2019s parents were deaf; she learned English and American Sign Language simultaneously. She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture, which demands full face-to-face engagement, as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births, trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people\u2019s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to \u201cventilate her feelings.\u201dShe viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work, until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980, she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock, the internationally acclaimed African-American women\u2019s a cappella ensemble, who perform lush, intricate arrangements of protest songs, wordless chants, spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon, a preacher\u2019s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers, which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany, Ga., did not have a piano, so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied; eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.Read more \u25beB. 1923In an elegant uptown apartment, an unhappy doctor with bushy eyebrows and a formal bearing went to sleep each night feeling like a pretender. In the morning, he knew, another batch of wincing patients desperate for relief would be waiting to see him. And he knew, despite his training and his Ivy League degree, that he had nothing meaningful to offer.John Sarno was a rehabilitation-medicine specialist at N.Y.U., and he was doing what he had been taught \u2014 diagnosing pinched nerves and slipped disks, recommending hot pads and bed rest. But as the months passed, the advice he gave his patients left him feeling increasingly bitter.

Jim Crow was a fact of life \u2014 segregated schools, beaches, train-station waiting rooms \u2014 but by at least one law, West Palm could have been considered progressive: African-Americans were allowed to own their own businesses, as long as they were in the part of town that catered to African-Americans.Read more \u25beB. 1969The \u201cparadox of the heap\u201d seems at first like a trick, a brainteaser that must have some clever catch. But it reveals itself, as it defies easy understanding, to be a philosophical problem. You might approach it as a puzzle, only to end up devising a solution so deep that it would challenge our thinking about language, knowledge and the nature of reality. By the time of her death from brain cancer in July at 48, Delia Graff Fara, a philosopher at Princeton, had done just that.Start with a heap of sand. If you remove a single grain, it remains a heap. Repeat this process enough times, however, and you have a heap of sand that contains, say, one grain. This is absurd: One grain is not a heap. Something has gone wrong, but it is not obvious what. Either there is a precise number of grains at which point a heap becomes a nonheap, or there is no such thing as a heap, or classical logic is flawed (perhaps it is only ever sort of true that something is a heap).

He was searching for a supply of wild discus fishes that would allow him to break a rival dealer\u2019s monopoly. Fishless and out of food, he got off at a small town, where he met a German priest, who happened to be a fish hobbyist.\u201cYes, there are discus fishes near here,\u201d the priest said. \u201cBut we also have neon tetras!\u201d The priest guided Axelrod to a nearby creek and, lifting his cassock, led him into the water, where red-and-blue tetras schooled around their legs. Axelrod returned to New Jersey with \u201cthe largest neons I had ever seen\u201d \u2014 and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian. The curator, the story goes, excitedly called him a few days later: The neons weren\u2019t neons at all.

We were exposed, week after week, to an idealized version of the \u201950s, developing a peculiar longing for a time we never knew.In real life, the grown-ups around us were acting up: Our parents protested or maybe just divorced, and our mothers went off to work and our babysitters got high or found other ways to rebel. But every Tuesday at 8, there were Marion Cunningham, cheery and aproned, and her hard-working provider, Howard Cunningham, reliably dispensing kindly advice to their well-adjusted children. As characters on other prime-time shows wrestled with racism and sexism, the Cunninghams were, for the most part, still oblivious to the revolutions to come, their comforts unchallenged.Read more \u25beB. 1951But when the eldest sister, Maggie Roche, received a diagnosis of breast cancer nearly a decade ago, she kept it from her siblings until only months before her death in January.

But as the day wore on, she loosened up, and the clothes came off. Ren\u2019s shoots could become electrified with the illicitness of being nude, especially when they were in public, where such activity in China guarantees arrest or worse. The atmosphere of adventure created trust, as did the spirit of rebellion. \u201cThere was a sense of being free,\u201d Sui told me. In person, Sui is demure, inconspicuous; in Ren\u2019s photographs, her eyes blaze from her crouch between two upright women, her arms snaking between their thighs. \u201cWe hide the body in our culture,\u201d Ren once said; in China, it is \u201ca demoralization to show what they think should be private.\u201d Ren, Sui said, encouraged everyone around him to shed that conditioning.Ren once described his work as \u201csatisfying a thirst.\u201d He found beauty in almost everything \u2014 a person, a snake, a flower \u2014 and trained his camera on his friends and his boyfriend, Jiaqi, turning their bodies into sculptures. In a 2013 Vice interview, the reporter fixated on a series of photographs of people urinating \u2014 into the air, on each other, into a colorful tropical drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the pee in your photos?\u201d the reporter asked, perhaps hoping for a lurid answer. Ren had none. \u201cI like to portray every organ in a fresh, vivid and emotional way,\u201d he said. In other words, urinating isn\u2019t scandalous or erotic \u2014 it\u2019s a biological reality, at once amusing and a fact.Read more \u25beB. 1930Derek Walcott\u2019s poetry pulsated with every element literature has ever alchemized: nature, the human interior, hardship, joy, tragedy, comedy, the life of the world and the divinity of epic.

The twins were raised, along with an elder sister, by their mother, Alix, a schoolteacher. It was a time of rudimentary medicine on the island. Their father, Warwick, died of an ear infection when his sons were a year old. He had been an amateur artist, and Walcott, who knew his father largely from his belongings still in the house, painted from an early age.Read more \u25beB. 1944John Pilson is a photographer and filmmaker who is currently working on a video project titled \u201cParole Parole Parole.\u201dB. 1936Certain American artists, over long careers, get so locked into a given persona that it becomes hard, at their deaths, to recall what once excited people about them. Like Bob Hope before him, Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s trailing him, the genial, middle-of-the-road version of \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is, to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968, listening to \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors, Cream and the Beatles, here was a young Southern boy singing \u2014 with unaffected honesty \u2014 about something those other groups weren\u2019t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late \u201960s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cAnd I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time\u201d \u2014 were never exactly cool, but they didn\u2019t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel, they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita, Galveston, Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure.But purity, when it arrives in an apple-cheeked, all-American form, often bends, unless fiercely protected, to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969, Campbell began hosting a TV series, \u201cThe Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.\u201d Though there was nothing \u201cgood time\u201d about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs, from \u201cGentle on My Mind\u201d onward, dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked, over network objections, to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard, he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam, early-Watergate years, the nation needed a little cheering up, and it fell to a newly revised version of \u201cthe South\u201d to provide that. The region, unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell, Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, got a 1970s makeover. The vision of \u201cTobacco Road\u201d gave way to the vision of \u201cHee Haw,\u201d the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d and Bo and Luke in \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South, and the \u201cGlen Campbell\u201d who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film \u201cNorwood,\u201d Campbell was saddled with the moniker \u201cGoodtime Glen.\u201dRead more \u25beB. 1947Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn\u2019t take gay for an answer.It was 2012, and Alan Chambers, Nicolosi\u2019s friend and a fellow leader in the ex-gay movement, was causing trouble by telling the truth. During speeches and television appearances, Chambers admitted that he was still attracted to men, that \u201c99.9 percent\u201d of people with unwanted same-sex attractions don\u2019t change and that conversion therapy \u2014 sometimes called reparative therapy \u2014 is often psychologically harmful, particularly for teenagers.Read more \u25beB. 1923The experience of being read to, whether it\u2019s toddlers nodding off to \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d at bedtime or 19th-century families gathering to hear the latest serial installment of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d is a deep-rooted element of a love for books. A reader\u2019s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story, and because listeners have their hands and eyes free, they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes, shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus, a book-lover\u2019s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.Audiobooks are the fastest-growing segment of the publishing industry, and the masterpiece of the form to date may well be Roy Dotrice\u2019s reading of George R.

And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind\u2019s eye, you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.

Eventually only a solitary branch bore leaves. But on Jan. 8, the Pioneer Cabin Tree was finally lost to a storm that pried its roots free of the earth. Photographs of the aftermath show split shards and lengths of rusty timber, scraps of torn foliage upon piles of earth and ice.The Pioneer Cabin Tree may have been the most famous tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park in Northern California.

{"Headline": "Should Australia Treat China as Friend or Foe?", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 38______The politicians were not named and the sources were anonymous, but the tone was clear: Be afraid, China is not your friend.This time, the message \u2014 China is good for Australia \u2014 was just as loud and clear.So which is it? Should Australia treat China as an enemy, or focus on the relationship\u2019s economic benefits? Is the country Australia\u2019s friend, or foe?This, of course, is what Australia is trying to figure out.With China, he told me, Australia is facing \u201csomething that is new in our national experience.\u201d\u201cAustralia has for so long lived in a region \u2014 and to a certain extent a whole world \u2014 shaped by our great and powerful allies, Britain and America, but we\u2019re very not used to dealing with powerful states that are not our allies,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things you\u2019re seeing I think is a certain surprise and bewilderment and dismay that we find ourselves dealing with a country like China in this way.\u201dAnthony Bubalo, deputy director of the Lowy Institute, agreed.\u201cIn the past, our major trading partners were our allies,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness and national security didn\u2019t really intersect. Now they do.\u201dThat creates a need for new habits, for dialogue among stakeholders with very different perspectives, Mr. Bubalo said. And it\u2019s not happening yet, as the separate Australian articles suggest.\u201cThere is a lack of real conversation between the Australian business and national security communities,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither side is really talking to each other, they\u2019re really talking across each other. Neither side really understands each other\u2019s concerns.\u201dThere are other stakeholders in this debate as well, from nonprofits, advocacy groups and universities to the roughly one million ethnic Chinese residents of Australia whose voices are rarely heard in Australian politics and news media.In interviews this week, many people in that community told me they are also watching this debate closely.But there seems to be consensus on one issue: Many Chinese-Australians say Australia\u2019s politicians need to spend more time mingling in their neighborhoods with residents who are not necessarily donors.\u201cI think they should respect Chinese culture more, and maybe attend more Chinese functions and requests,\u201d said Helen Sham-Ho, the first Chinese-Australian to be elected to an Australian parliament, spending 15 years in the New South Wales government. \u201cThe Chinese love to get close to politics and prime ministers.\u201dThat proximity is part of what has suddenly become suspect, but Ms. Sham-Ho warned that it would be a mistake to insist that interaction translates to a desire to interfere.\u201cThere is a misunderstanding of culture,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because the Chinese want to be close to power doesn\u2019t mean they want to influence or change the policy.\u201dHistory, again, can be instructive. Access to politicians of any kind, Ms. Sham-Ho explained, is still a novelty for those who compare Australian democracy to China\u2019s past.\u201cThe traditional Chinese had an emperor, and they could never get close to the emperor,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly in their dreams.\u201dWhat do you think Australia\u2019s politicians need to understand about the relationship with China and this country\u2019s ethnic Chinese community that they might be overlooking? What would you like to see Canberra prioritize in the relationship?__________________Did a story called \u201cCat Person\u201d float into your feed this week?\u201cAs a young gay man, I\u2019ve been \u2018Her\u2019, too, on a \u2018date\u2019 with an older man, more than once, and once or twice finding myself changing my mind (whether they were \u2018somewhat older\u2019 or not) and exploring in my head at high speed in the heat of the moment what were the ways out of this uncomfortable situation, one in which the other guy had done absolutely nothing wrong. And of the rapid turn of face the other man made when confronted with my sudden inexplicable-to-him change of heart.\u201d______And we\u2019re excited to bring you the second edition of our Australia Diary where you, dear reader, can contribute an anecdote, poem or photograph that captures Australia.____________Our new European culture editor, Matt Anderson, has flown back to Australia \u2014 where he spent his teen and university years in Adelaide \u2014 for the ambitious show, which features more than 100 artists from 32 countries over four floors of the gallery.He and I will alternate hosting interviews and conversations with local and international NGV Triennial artists from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day in the Great Hall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese, Studying in America, and Struggling", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In the fall of 2015, as I began my last year of graduate school, I sensed something was wrong. I woke up in the mornings with a pounding heart. In seminar discussions my sentences came out in faltering fragments, while my classmates\u2019 voices reached me as a cacophony of piercing sounds.Until that point, I had enjoyed my time on the Harvard campus, whose maple-shaded Georgian buildings I had first seen in pictures my father took 20 years earlier on his first trip from China to America. On the back of one of the photos, he had inscribed in blue ink, \u201cYou will see it with your own eyes someday.\u201dBut in those days, instead of taking in its beauty, my eyes were fixed on the ground as I slogged from one academic building to the next, counting pavement stones to help tame my racing thoughts.The anxiety attacks took me by surprise. I had spent eight years studying and working in the United States away from my home in Beijing. Over time, the isolation of graduate school, the heavy reading load in a second language and the strain that distance put on relationships with people in Beijing all began to add up.Trying to make sense of what happened, I recalled incidents among fellow Chinese international students that at the time had seemed like only minor slumps in coping with the demands of student life: missed classes, complaints of insomnia, months of sudden absence from group events, lengthy Facebook posts strung with sullen adjectives.The Chinese students acknowledge the usual challenges of living abroad \u2014 like the language barrier and cultural differences \u2014 but cite academic pressure as the most likely cause of stress. Despite all they have heard about a liberal arts education, they are often surprised by the rigor needed to succeed. The results-oriented mind-set with which many Chinese tackle their studies doesn\u2019t fit well in a system that emphasizes the analytical process and critical thinking.As a result, the determination and perseverance that have made Chinese students winners at home can deepen their sense of frustration abroad, when a paper outline does not easily emerge from heaps of painstakingly compiled notecards, or when a history exam asks questions about hypothetical scenarios rather than the chronology they have committed to heart.The feeling is not eased by a frequently cited difficulty in building productive relationships with academic advisers. In a study that interviewed 19 Chinese graduate students at a university in the American Southwest about their sources of stress, many described having trouble establishing trust with their advisers. Some feared that the language barrier might lead advisers to doubt their intelligence. Others confessed to being kept awake at night thinking about communication blunders such as a bungled conversation or a misphrased email to an adviser.Those challenges may seem common enough; many, indeed, are not unfamiliar to American students. But for the Chinese students, who grew up imbibing messages that all but equated their life prospects and self-worth with academic achievements, the setbacks can be profoundly unnerving. The bright promise of intellectual freedom often ends up producing an insecurity so consuming that it leaves them unable to consider failing.The price of failure is more than imaginary for a majority of those students. Chinese international students overwhelmingly pay full tuition. An annual cost of, say, $50,000 to $60,000 is about 10 times the average urban disposable income in China and often requires working-class families to empty bank accounts or sell properties. Although parents have not hesitated to make those sacrifices when it comes to the future of their treasured only child, to the conscientious American-college freshman from Shenzhen or Changsha struggling to keep up with academic requirements, that weight can feel like an avalanche bearing down.A Chinese student in Chicago (using a pseudonym) voiced a popular sentiment when she told The Paper, a popular Chinese online news outlet, of her constant wondering whether her school performance justified the money her working-class parents spent on her education. It made her more anxious than she had been during the \u201cgaokao,\u201d the notoriously cutthroat national college entrance exam.Some of those who have tried the services are often left underwhelmed. In addition to the long wait and limited session time that are common to the increasingly crowded university mental health counseling centers, there are thornier problems. How can Chinese students convey the texture of their thoughts and moods in a foreign language when the language barrier is a cause of their stress and inhibition in the first place? How do they communicate their nostalgia for mouthwatering homemade Chinese dishes when the sympathetic therapist may not have ventured beyond Panda Express?A few institutions, such as Purdue University and Ohio State University, have set up counseling services tailored to Chinese students. More schools need to follow suit. Hiring Chinese-speaking mental health counselors may be the ideal solution, although qualified candidates can be hard to find.Informal counselor-led support groups and outreach programs, which have received positive feedback from Asian-American students, could be extended to Chinese international students. Universities could hire and train well-acclimated Chinese students to become counselors for their communities.Chinese students are the largest international student group on most American campuses, and their tuition is a major source of much-needed revenue. College administrators should work harder to meet their mental health needs \u2014 at least as hard as the students worked to gain admission.Helen Gao is a policy analyst at a research company and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Privacy Complaints Mount Over Phone Searches at U.S. Border Since 2011", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 They spoke of being humiliated and shaken. They described being \u201cmade to feel like a criminal.\u201d And they maintained that their rights had been violated.Grievances over lost privacy run through a trove of roughly 250 complaints by people whose laptops and phones were searched without a warrant as they crossed the United States border. Filed with the Department of Homeland Security since 2011, mostly during the Obama administration, these stories add a personal dimension to a growing debate over rights, security and technology.In January 2016, a Virginia woman wrote of experiencing a \u201cblatant abuse of privacy\u201d after she and her 19-year-old son were pulled aside for extra screening at Newark Liberty International Airport upon returning from Spain.\u201cThey took his laptop and cellphone and proceeded to go through both after getting the passwords from him,\u201d she wrote in her complaint, adding that her phone was taken and browsed through \u201cwithout my consent,\u201d as well. While the officers were cordial, she said, \u201cthe line between security screening and blatant search and seizure without cause or explaining is not.\u201dAmerican courts have long permitted government agents who protect the borders to search, without a warrant or any specific basis for suspicion, the possessions carried by people as they cross. But smartphones and other personal electronics contain vastly more private information than suitcases.\u201cBorder agents shouldn\u2019t be sifting through a traveler\u2019s text messages, emails, photographs and personal files without probable cause,\u201d she said.A Customs and Border Protection spokesman, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment or answer questions, such as how frequently electronics searches uncover something that warrants action. But other current and former agency officials said that the total number of searches remains low considering there are nearly 400 million border crossings annually.Aristides Jim\u00e9nez, who was a deputy special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in San Antonio before retiring this year, said such searches have led to the arrests of drug and human smugglers as well as child pornographers.\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s not something that ICE agents want to abuse,\u201d he said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, another homeland security agency that conducts border searches. \u201cBecause we know in this environment, if you abuse the authority, you\u2019ll lose it.\u201dThe government redacted names from the complaints, but many identified themselves as Muslims or people who were not of European descent, and many appeared to be men. A Kuwaiti man, for instance, wrote that when his plane landed in the United States in September 2016, border agents came on board and asked him to unlock his laptop and phone.\u201cI told them my religion prohibits that other men see my wife without the hijab (the head cover) and in some pics she was partially nude,\u201d he wrote, including the parenthetical explanation. But he was scared that they would \u201cdo something bad\u201d to him and gave the agents the passwords to his devices.A physician born in India and who lived in Tennessee wrote in 2012 of driving from Canada into the United States with his wife and their two school-age children, who are both American citizens, and being detained for five hours, during which agents coerced them into providing the passwords to their cellphones and iPads and looked through their emails and Facebook accounts. At one point, after asking how long it would take, he was put in handcuffs, he said.\u201cWe were quite shaken and disturbed by the whole experience, especially as we are law abiding and tax paying residents, with no criminal records,\u201d he wrote.The complaints showed that people are particularly disturbed when agents not only look through their devices in front of them, but conduct a \u201cforensic search,\u201d in which the agents copy their data for more intrusive examination, such as trying to recover deleted files.The Department of Homeland Security, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, has released several hundred complaints filed since 2011 by people whose phones, laptops or other electronic devices were searched without a warrant at the United States border as they entered the country.In April 2012, a man said his laptop and external hard drive were seized when he arrived at Denver International Airport on a visa. A receipt later showed that eight people had handled them, he wrote in slightly broken English.\u201cI feel it is very unappropriate way of sharing my personal files with 8 different people!\u201d the man wrote. \u201cAt least they could let me know, what is happening with my files. And when those files will be deleted?\u201dThe law surrounding electronics searches is in flux.Although it appears unlikely to be enacted in the present Congress, the bill is designed to reduce feelings of violated rights like those described in a June 2015 complaint.The man described himself as an American citizen, a Muslim, and an education professor in Texas. He described being \u201ctreated like a terrorist\u201d when he, his wife and their toddler daughter arrived at San Francisco International Airport after visiting relatives in Iran.They were detained for nearly four hours while agents searched \u201cmy phone, my university owned laptop, and all electronic devices,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cMy family and I feel belittled, ashamed, humiliated and disgraced.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Net Neutrality Was Repealed and How It Affects You", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules, which required internet service providers to offer equal access to all web content without charging consumers for higher-quality delivery or giving preferential treatment to certain websites.Many consumer advocates have argued that if the rules get scrapped, broadband providers will begin selling the internet in bundles, not unlike how cable television is sold today. Want to access Facebook and Twitter? Under a bundling system, getting on those sites could require paying for a premium social media package.\u201cThe internet, the speed of it, our entire business revolves around that,\u201d David Callicott, who sells paraffin-free candles on his website, GoodLight, said last month.\u201cIt\u2019s basic economics,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a speech at the Newseum in April. \u201cThe more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you\u2019re likely to get.\u201d\u201cDid these fast lanes and slow lanes exist? No,\u201d he said in the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the special interests pushing Title II weren\u2019t trying to solve a real problem but instead looking for an excuse to achieve their longstanding goal of forcing the internet under the federal government\u2019s control.\u201dSeveral internet providers have made public pledges in recent months that they will not block or throttle sites once the rules were repealed. The companies argue that Title II gives the F.C.C. too much control over their business, and that the regulations make it hard to expand their networks.He wrote that the biggest American internet companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 \u201ccontrol much of the online infrastructure, from app stores to operating systems to cloud storage to nearly all of the online ad business.\u201dMeanwhile, most American homes and smartphones connect to the internet through a \u201chandful of broadband companies \u2014 AT&T, Charter, Comcast and Verizon, many of which are also aiming to become content companies, because why not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Menorah Blamed for Brooklyn Fire That Killed Mother and 3 Children", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was the sixth night of Hanukkah, and in a front room of the Azan family\u2019s three-story Brooklyn home was an oil-burning menorah. The family placed it where the Talmud says to: in the window, so a passer-by could see.As the family slept around 2 a.m. on Monday, flames leapt from near the menorah, starting a fire that killed three Azan children and their mother and badly injured their father and other children, the Fire Department said.The menorah, about two feet wide, burned oil held in small glass cups. Fire marshals suspect the glass may have cracked under extended heat exposure, spilling oil and spreading flames, a Fire Department official said.From the first floor, the fire proceeded to rip through the Sheepshead Bay home, hurtling up two sets of staircases and trapping part of the family inside as others fled through a side door or jumped down from a second-floor landing.After firefighters extinguished the blaze, the mother, Aliza Azan, 39, was found dead on the second floor. So too, the police said, were Moshe Azan, 11; Yitzah Azan, 7; and Henrietta Azan, 3. They had all been asleep there.The children\u2019s father, Yosi Azan, ran through the second floor as flames clawed at him, trying to save his family, officials said. He helped a teenage son and teenage daughter out a window and onto the first-floor roof. They hesitated to jump, and so Mr. Azan apparently helped nudge them off the roof to safety, according to an account given to investigators.When Mr. Azan reached the ground himself, he told a fire chief there were four people left inside, but the fire and smoke were too thick for firefighters to push through right away, the fire official said.Both teenagers broke bones, one of them a pelvis. Mr. Azan and the two teenagers were taken to Staten Island University Hospital, where they were in critical condition and \u201cfighting for their lives,\u201d Daniel A. Nigro, the New York City fire commissioner, said. The father was believed to have internal burns from inhaling smoke.Mr. Nigro said of the father, \u201cI believe he acted very courageously and tried desperately, and hopefully it didn\u2019t cost his life, too.\u201dNeighbors across the street called 911, and firefighters arrived two minutes and 40 seconds later. They confronted a home that was engulfed, Mr. Nigro said.Two younger teenagers asleep in a back bedroom on the first floor, one of them a cousin of the Azan children, escaped out a side door with less serious injuries. They heard a smoke detector alarm and yelled to alert other members of their family, Mr. Nigro said. They were taken to Maimonides Medical Center.The teenagers helped lead fire marshals to the cause when they told them that the menorah had been left burning after they went to sleep and that they saw the fire start nearby. Investigators recovered remnants of the broken menorah.Investigators had not found other smoke alarms beyond the one that activated on the first floor. The Fire Department recommends that people install them on every floor of a home.Five or six firefighters were injured, though none seriously, officials said.\u201cOver the last couple days, several other major fires have caused many injuries \u2014 some very serious \u2014 and displaced others from their homes,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cDuring the holiday season, we all need to be cautious with decorations, electric lights, candles, space heaters and other items.\u201d\u201cI know the family,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is beyond comprehension. Three of the children study with my children. 7 children.\u201dIn all, nine people were in the home at 1946 East 14th Street: a mother and father, their six children and a cousin.The Azans are Syrian Jews who immigrated to the United States from Israel about 15 years ago, said Abby, 50, a relative of Ms. Azan who declined to give his last name.Ms. Azan cooked scrumptious Mediterranean meals for her six children, laughed with her husband\u2019s constant jokes and kept the home a welcoming place for a stream of visitors, Abby said. Mr. Azan is a manager at a nearby clothing store called Hat Box, which sells shirts and shoes, and is known for his friendly service and for always giving his customers deals, said Avi Navon, 59.Ms. Azan\u2019s father, Avraham Hamra, is considered the chief rabbi of Syrian Jewry and is said to have helped hundreds of Jews escape to Israel.The four bodies arrived in a procession of police-escorted vehicles shortly after 7 p.m. Monday at Congregation Shevet Achim, a synagogue tucked between homes on a residential block of Sheepshead Bay crowded with mourners, police officers and members of the Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol, a Jewish neighborhood watch group.But a planned service inside the synagogue did not happen, police officers and Shomrim volunteers said, because of the size of the crowd, as well as the timing: During Hanukkah, the types of mourning expressions allowed in certain Jewish traditions are limited.Instead, the vehicles, including a hearse with its rear gate raised, paused for several minutes on the street outside. Mourners, many chanting prayers, surged around the vehicles and then fell in line behind the cort\u00e8ge as it rolled slowly toward Coney Island Avenue, where the crowd dispersed, en route to Kennedy Airport.One mourner who would only identify himself as Sonny, 23, said that as a child in Brooklyn he had attended the same school as the victims. He now lives in New Jersey, but felt it important to be present.\u201cAny time there\u2019s a tragedy in the community, every single person has to feel and be part of what happened,\u201d Sonny said. \u201cWe can\u2019t change the past, but the only thing we could do is try to fill a little of the pain and the hole that the family has, and that\u2019s by coming out and escorting their precious ones.\u201dReporting was contributed by Cormac Gordon and Sean Piccoli in New York and Isabel Kershner in Jerusalem.

The two had a child together. When the affair was disclosed to Google\u2019s human resources department, the woman, a paralegal, was moved into the sales department. She later left the company; Mr. Drummond still works there.Hoo boy. I suspect we\u2019re gonna get a lot more of these stories from Google and the rest of the industry. I mean, of course we will \u2014 we\u2019re talking about a culture that has systematically sidelined women. It\u2019s going to get ugly.But on the other hand, while men may be shocked at the heinous acts being reported, the response I\u2019ve heard from women friends is shock that men are actually being held accountable for these acts. For years this activity has occurred in many industries \u2014 maybe all industries \u2014 and countless women have been caught in power dynamics beyond their control. The fact that a wave of accountability has arrived is surprising, perhaps, but also long, long overdue.This looks very bad! After all, this case is about stealing trade secrets. The judge delayed the trial and harshly rebuked Uber. \u201cI can no longer trust the words of the lawyers for Uber in this case,\u201d he said. \u201cIf even half of what is in that letter is true, it would be an injustice for Waymo to go to trial.\u201dMike, you\u2019re the Uber expert. Is this as terrible as it looks? How does Uber survive this case now?To upset a judge the way Uber has done, by not disclosing particularly damning evidence, has really hurt it. I have to believe that will be hard to come back from. And the trial hasn\u2019t even started yet!Moreover, this really has Uber in a tight spot as it tries to sell secondary shares to new investors, who are pressing the company to have a lower valuation so that they can get in for cheaper. It\u2019s probably the world\u2019s worst timing.So, yeah. Another bad week for Uber. But when has it been different? Not since 2014, perhaps?That said, Snapchat hampered itself and its growth with its seemingly intentional inscrutability for so many years. And the way Snap presented itself on its I.P.O. roadshow seemed to position the company as the next Facebook.Clearly it won\u2019t be the next Facebook.

{"Headline": "An Abomination. A Monster. That\u2019s Me?", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt used to be that when someone called me an abomination, I was in the presence of a homophobe.But a recent opinion column in Texas State University\u2019s main newspaper damned me for a different reason. I\u2019m abominable because I\u2019m white.The column wasn\u2019t aimed at me personally but at my kind, and the Hispanic student who wrote it began by saying that \u201cof all the white people\u201d he had ever encountered, there were a dozen or so who rose to the level of \u201cdecent.\u201dThe allowance that 12 of us passed muster was perhaps the most generous passage in a screed that had an unambiguous message for white people, be they \u201cgood-hearted liberals\u201d or \u201cright-wing extremists.\u201d\u201cI hate you,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbecause you shouldn\u2019t exist. You are both the dominant apparatus on the planet and the void in which all other cultures, upon meeting you, die.\u201dThe headline: \u201cYour DNA Is an Abomination.\u201dYes, this was deliberate provocation. By a college student. And he\u2019s obviously right that people of color have been systematically oppressed.But what college newspaper would have published a column by a white student telling his black peers that they\u2019re a wretched lot? What, beyond catharsis, did the column\u2019s author accomplish?And what has happened to our discourse \u2014 and how we do we make necessary progress \u2014 when hate is answered by hate, prejudice is echoed by prejudice, extremism begets extremism and ostensible liberalism practices abject illiberalism? Isn\u2019t that how Donald Trump wins?This wasn\u2019t just one student or one campus or college campuses in general. This was a manner of thinking and language too prevalent among those who correctly call out racial inequities and social injustices but wrongly fall prey themselves to the bigotry behind those ills.The far right set the tone, but the left shouldn\u2019t adopt it. Doing so won\u2019t get us to the fairer place that we must inhabit, and it plays directly into Trump\u2019s dirty hands.It may seem odd at this fearful juncture to point out any failings other than his and his abettors\u2019. He and they are disgracing our country in ever more galling ways, with support from a fringe of white nationalists whose reprehensible ideology warrants all of the attention that it receives and more.But the threat posed by Trump and his minions only increases the importance of being smart about stopping him, and his strategy for maintaining power includes driving wedges between us and making white Americans feel that they\u2019re under assault. Why cooperate with that? Why be baited?After the \u201cabomination\u201d column, Texas State turned into a furious, distressingly familiar theater of denunciation and counter-denunciation. The president of the university, understandably, condemned what the student had written as racist. So did the president of the student body. Campus groups representing minorities said that these rebukes didn\u2019t take into account the slurs that they routinely endure. They\u2019d been demonized and terrorized, so why such upset and outrage over a reversal of fortunes?It\u2019s a legitimate observation. It\u2019s also a dead end. Turnabout may be fair play, but it\u2019s foul morality. It\u2019s also foolish politics. Mirroring the ugliness of white nationalists and the alt-right just gives them the ammunition that they want and need.It\u2019s what an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware did with a Facebook post saying that Otto Warmbier \u2014 the American student who was imprisoned in North Korea, came home comatose and died soon after \u2014 \u201cgot exactly what he deserved.\u201d The professor wrote that like other \u201cyoung, white, rich, clueless white males\u201d in the United States, Warmbier thought \u201che could get away with whatever he wanted.\u201dMeanwhile a professor at Trinity College in Hartford used his Facebook page to post an incendiary story about the Republican lawmakers who found themselves under gunfire on an Alexandria, Va., baseball field. Its headline included the language \u201clet them die,\u201d a phrase that the professor also folded into a hashtag accompanying a subsequent Facebook post.Thanks in large part to social media, which incentivizes invective and then magnifies it, our conversations coarsen. Our compasses spin out of whack. We descend to the lowest common denominator, becoming what we supposedly abhor. I\u2019m regularly stunned by the cruelty that\u2019s mistaken for cleverness and the inhumanity that\u2019s confused with conviction.A few days ago Neera Tanden, the prominent Democratic operative who presides over the Center for American Progress, took to Twitter to cheer on the incineration of one of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s homes. She linked to the news that the California wildfires had reached his property, and she quipped, \u201cThere\u2019s a God. And she\u2019s unhappy.\u201dA few days before that, a Huffington Post writer, also on Twitter, reacted to Senator John McCain\u2019s 11th-hour support for tax reform by offering \u201ccongratulations\u201d to his wife and children for \u201ctheir upcoming tax-free inheritance.\u201d She seemed to be mocking a man\u2019s brain cancer, and she was actually treading more lightly than the writer who published a commentary on Medium months ago that took issue with McCain\u2019s interventionist politics by saying: \u201cI sincerely, genuinely hope that Arizona Senator John McCain\u2019s heart stops beating.\u201dToo many of us go too far, no doubt incited by Trump, for whom too far is a mere starting point. And there\u2019s a pattern of turning righteous causes into indiscriminate attacks, painting with a destructively broad brush and branding certain actors irredeemable, which doesn\u2019t leave them any room \u2014 or much motivation \u2014 for redemption.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jerusalem Largely Calm as Region Protests Trump Move", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Thousands of Palestinian protesters confronted Israeli soldiers on the Gaza border on Friday, and thousands more clashed at military checkpoints across the West Bank.Protests broke out after Friday Prayers from Beirut, Lebanon, to Istanbul, from Mogadishu, Somalia, to Tehran. In Amman, Jordan, demonstrators held large posters of President Trump bearing the words, \u201cGo to hell.\u201dIn the West Bank, scores of protesters were said to have been wounded, many by rubber-tipped bullets.In Gaza, Palestinian health officials reported two deaths and scores of injuries from Israeli fire along the border.Throwing stones at Israeli forces across the Gaza border fence and masking his face with a Palestinian flag, Mohammed Kharoub, 26, said he was willing to spill his own blood. \u201cI am here for Jerusalem,\u201d he said.But in the holy city itself, the main Friday Prayer at Al Aqsa Mosque was held without incident, according to the Israeli police, and the crowds that gathered afterward dispersed largely peacefully. Three Palestinians were arrested at the Damascus Gate to the Old City in East Jerusalem after scuffling with the police, Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said.Later, at least two rockets were fired out of Gaza. The Israeli military said one was intercepted and another fell in open ground. After retaliatory Israeli airstrikes against Hamas military targets in Gaza, another rocket struck a road in the Israeli border town of Sderot.But by nightfall, the protests had died down. Hamas called for protesters to return to the streets on Saturday.And though Hamas called for an intifada, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, has repeatedly stated that he does not want a third intifada to break out on his watch.Israel carried out more retaliatory strikes in Gaza early Saturday, targeting four Hamas sites, its military said. The strikes killed two people, the Palestinian health ministry said on Facebook.Analysts said the Palestinians may not be eager to embark on a new, sustained intifada because of fatigue, because of a sense that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision probably cannot be reversed and because two previous uprisings did not bring them closer to the goal of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.\u201cThe business community is fatigued, exhausted and angry,\u201d said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of PASSIA, an independent Palestinian research institute in East Jerusalem. \u201cInstitutions are fighting for survival. The youth is not organized, cannot see a plan, leadership or direction.\u201dResistance in the city is \u201cspontaneous and individualistic,\u201d he said.Many of East Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinians in any case feel ambivalent toward the Palestinian Authority and are largely cut off by Israel\u2019s separation barrier from the West Bank.Zakaria al-Qaq, a professor at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem, said the Palestinian Authority had long neglected Jerusalem and its Palestinian inhabitants, allocating a paltry part of its budget to them. With Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Mr. Qaq said, the authority was \u201cpaying a price\u201d for its lack of strategy for the city.Hamas also noted that the Palestinians were marking the 30th anniversary this week of the start of the first intifada, an uprising against Israeli occupation that began in Gaza, quickly spread to the West Bank and led to hundreds of deaths, most of them of Palestinians.\u201cTrump can never change the reality of history, geography and the identity of the holy city,\u201d Ismail Haniya, the leader of Hamas, said on local television.Most of the world considers East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, as occupied territory, its status to be resolved through peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.Despite the highly symbolic recognition, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Friday that it would probably take two years to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because of the logistics involved.Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration also garnered furious responses from leaders throughout the Arab and Muslim world.In Lebanon, thousands rallied in Beirut and residents of Palestinian refugee camps were bused in to join the protest. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever seen Jerusalem in pictures,\u201d said Abdullah Mustafa, a teenager from a refugee family. \u201cBut it\u2019s my life.\u201dIn Cairo, a preacher at Al Azhar Mosque, an ancient bastion of Sunni Muslim scholarship, railed against what he termed Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d decision, which he compared to attacks on Christian churches by the Islamic State militant group. As prayers ended, congregants stood up chanting, \u201cWe sacrifice our souls and blood for you, Aqsa,\u201d in reference to the Jerusalem mosque revered as the third-holiest site in Islam.Thousands demonstrated peacefully in Istanbul\u2019s historic quarter with calls against America and Israel. Despite restrictions against gatherings and protests under the state of emergency that has been in force for 18 months, police who usually break up demonstrations with tear gas allowed this one to go ahead with speeches and music in the park.In Tehran, state-backed rallies were held after Friday Prayer. The hard-line imam Ahmad Khatami said during his sermon that \u201call the world is protesting Trump\u2019s decision,\u201d adding, \u201cSome of the statesmen in America believe he has a mental problem and must receive treatment from doctors.\u201d\u201cWe have missiles, we build missiles and will increase the range of our missiles to 1,000 or 1,500 kilometers to deprive White House residents from a comfortable sleep,\u201d Mr. Khatami continued. \u201cWe will not seek an atomic bomb,\u201d he added, but \u201cif a crazy state named the Zionist regime makes any mistake we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground.\u201dReporting was contributed by Iyad Abuheweila and Ibrahim El-Mughraby from Gaza; Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran; Nada Homsi and Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon; Rana F.
