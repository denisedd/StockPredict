{"Headline": "Can Anita Hill Fix Hollywood\u2019s Harassment Problem?", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerAs a powerhouse producer for Steven Spielberg and now president of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy has for decades tackled some of Hollywood\u2019s most famous monsters: gremlins, poltergeists, T. rexes and the dark side of the Force.Now Ms. Kennedy has set her sights on perhaps the most pernicious industry villain of all: sexual misconduct and abuse. She is spearheading the creation of an anti-harassment commission, backed by more than two dozen of the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest bigwigs, that, in a stroke of marquee casting, will be led by Anita Hill.The hard part will be figuring out what comes next. As Ms. Hill concedes herself, there\u2019s no blueprint for ridding an industry of sexual harassment. At least not yet.\u201cIf there was a template out there, at this point I think it would\u2018ve already been discovered,\u201d Ms. Hill said in a phone chat Monday with the Bagger and Ms. Kennedy.\u201cThere\u2019s something out there, pieces out there that need to come together,\u201d Ms. Hill continued. \u201cBut I think if a model was out there, we\u2019d know, because there\u2019s so much will and desire to end this problem.\u201dIt\u2019s too early to guess if the commission will work, but it already has a few Hollywood must-haves on its side. Backing it is a good look, and it has money.Speaking by phone on Monday, Ms. Kennedy said that despite her initial prescriptive suggestions, she didn\u2019t at the time have a clear idea of what the commission might look like or how it might come about.They were casting about for someone to head the commission when Ms. Kapor suggested Ms. Hill, \u201cand, thank goodness, Anita said yes,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.And indeed in many ways, given the left-leaning world of show business, Ms. Hill was an obvious choice. She is a lawyer and an academic, as well as a household name, which is important in Tinseltown, and has been a figurehead in the fight against sexual harassment since 1991, when she appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Despite Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony that he had assailed her with inappropriate sexual suggestions when they worked together years before, Justice Thomas was confirmed.Yet the sight of Ms. Hill sitting by herself as a bank of white men peppered her with condescending and withering questions became a flash point for many women, both a symbol of what they were up against and an inspiration to push back.\u201cThis has been a 26-year fight,\u201d said Ms. Hill, now a professor of social policy, law and women\u2019s studies at Brandeis University.Ms. Hill said both Washington and Hollywood were plagued by an imbalance and misuse of power. But where she saw a difference, she said, was in Hollywood\u2019s desire \u2014 at least as evidenced by the overt support for the new commission \u2014 to stamp out sexual harassment.\u201cWe have to celebrate that we are coming together for a purpose and that people are saying at this point, \u2018We cannot tolerate this behavior,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cThat\u2019s our starting point from here. There will be lots of work to do.\u201dThe structure of the initiative \u2014 high-profile women backed by the industry\u2019s top brass, most of whom happened to be men \u2014 was deliberate, and borne out of earlier conversations Ms. Kennedy had with men in the business. They were eager for change, she found, but reluctant to lead the charge because they didn\u2019t feel like it was their place to. (Imagine!)\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one of them that didn\u2019t respond very proactively, but I think there\u2019s a hesitancy on the part of some men, and a thinking that this is something women need to step out in front of,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.Ms. Hill said this dovetailed with what she had been hearing as sexual harassment accusations unfolded.\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of men who say, \u2018I\u2019m so embarrassed to be a man,\u2019 and, \u2018What do I tell my daughters?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey want to address this problem. But they\u2019re not sure they are credible to address it on their own. And I would say we now have women who are in leadership positions that can do it. I think that men wouldn\u2019t step out on their own, but will step out in partnership with women.\u201d\u201cWe are going to do this as quickly and effectively as possible,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure out what are the best practices and best policies, and how we think about implementation. All of those things are yet to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Quincy Jones\u2019s Qwest TV Takes Concerts and Films Digital", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of jazz\u2019s history, devotees discovered music over the radio airwaves and in library stacks, rooting out old LPs or videos to borrow and sample. Today, a lot of that exploration happens online \u2014 particularly on YouTube. Most major albums have found their way onto that streaming platform, as have concert bootlegs, studio sessions and old documentaries that were once impossible to track down.\u201cYou remember 10 percent of what you hear and 30 percent of what you see,\u201d Mr. Jones said in an interview, noting that he viewed Qwest as a way to maintain jazz\u2019s staying power in the digital age. \u201cWhen you see it, it hits you twice as hard.\u201dThe idea for Qwest took hold in 2014, when Reza Ackbaraly, 39, a French TV producer, approached Mr. Jones at Jazz \u00e0 Vienne, a French festival for which Mr. Ackbaraly works as a programmer.\u201cI was the biggest fan that he could ever look for,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cHe came to us and said, \u2018Let\u2019s start our own channel.\u2019 I said, \u2018Oh yeah. Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201dMr. Ackbaraly has taken the lead in designing and implementing Qwest, with help from just one other full-time staff member. But Mr. Jones\u2019s imprint is all over it. The service features a section of videos titled \u201cQuincy\u2019s Picks,\u201d and he has helped guide the editorial vision. An irrepressibly contemporary thinker at 84, Mr. Jones has worked with Mr. Ackbaraly to ensure the video offerings accurately represent the breadth and vitality of jazz\u2019s current moment \u2014 with content coming from the music\u2019s contemporary mainstream and its avant-garde \u2014 as well as the annals of history.Mr. Jones is also passionate about forging partnerships with universities and school systems across America. \u201cWe suffer a lot from not having a minister of culture,\u201d Mr. Jones said of the United States, adding that he hoped making Qwest\u2019s films widely available to students could help in \u201cbringing the youth up-to-date\u201d on the history and present-day life of jazz.After the service goes live on Dec. 15, a new video will be posted each day for the rest of the month, with more added on a monthly basis starting in January. Each clip will be accompanied by an editorial description, written by a journalist or historian. And each month a different guest curator will help select a sampling of new videos.\u201cI know that I won\u2019t convert the world to jazz,\u201d Mr. Ackbaraly said. \u201cI\u2019m more like a gastronomic restaurant. If I have 20 tables filled every night, I\u2019m fine. If I serve high quality programs in HD, with good curation, and have a good, close relationship to my audience, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dAn earlier version of this story misstated the year Al Jarreau died.

Knowing the seed didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of solving, though.The paired across entries give you absolutely no information \u2014 right? What could three ways \u201cto make 60-Across\u201d mean? I had no idea, and worked assiduously on the down side of the grid to get all of these, but some of you may be perspicacious enough to notice the presence of three matching symbols at three meaningful points. If you did, you might have been able to jot those answers down in a minute, as they are very, ahem, elementary:21A and 22A are ONE and EIGHT.33A and 34A are FOUR and FIVE.46A and 47A are SEVEN and TWO.If you\u2019re still unaware of 60A when you attack the relevant down entries, they\u2019re similarly vague, although now that I look at them as a series, I bet people sussed some out.2D: \u201cMonth number 60-across\u201d pretty clearly indicates that we need a number, and it\u2019s going to be smaller than 13. It\u2019s SEPT.7D: \u201c60-across, in baseball\u201d, assuming 60A is a number? There\u2019s some misdirection here \u2014 this could have been a baseball player; \u201cBabe\u201d or \u201cRuth\u201d? I was fairly far along before I knew this was TEAM.26D: \u201c___ 60-Across (state of euphoria)\u201d is pretty obvious, if you\u2019re not totally at sea at this point in the puzzle: CLOUD.28D: \u201cA cat is said to have 60-Across of them\u201d is easy too: LIVES.49D: \u201cPrefix meaning 60-Across\u201d is geometry, something I\u2019m rusty and bad with, and a bit trepid even knowing the number in question, but it\u2019s NONA.52D: \u201cGerman homophone of 60-Across\u201d is NEINand 60A, \u201cthis puzzle\u2019s theme,\u201d must be \u2014 all together \u2014 NINE.20A: It\u2019s nice when the puzzle goes to an interesting source for a common word; this quotation from Mother Teresa rang no bells, and I was drawing a blank with most of the down crosses as well, so even though it makes perfect sense I didn\u2019t come up with SMILE for a while.38A: \u201cCarrier of electricity\u201d: This clue misdirected me to the air conditioner company that\u2019s been a political symbol in the news this year. But I couldn\u2019t fathom a four-letter word for this so eventually reached the end of the road at CORD. This is another oft-used puzzle entry where a constructor\u2019s creativity comes out in the cluing.59A: I struggled mightily with the entire southwest corner of this puzzle, even with all confidence in TORNADO at 35D. I wanted the answer to \u201cVoiced\u201d to be \u201cspoken,\u201d and then I wanted 54D (\u201c___ now!\u201d) to be \u201cbuy,\u201d and I had to leave the whole puzzle and go for a walk before I could come back and finish. The answer here is SONANT, a term used in phonetics and the crossword but rarely in ordinary conversation. Oh, and if you want that rotisserie oven that also washes dishes and transmits 500 cable channels to your television free of charge, you need to ACT now, of course.8D: I wasn\u2019t familiar with the form of this answer to \u201cPerson native to an area,\u201d INDIGENE, so I looked it up; I figured it could be a debut. It\u2019s quite rarely used, but it appeared in a Wednesday grid from 1987, clued as the eye-narrowing \u201cAutochthon,\u201d which sounds like it should be a literary horror serial on Netflix.9D: \u201cKind of station\u201d allows for a lot of possibilities; with the F in MOTIFS filled out at the beginning and a definite vibe that I was dealing with an animal lover, I wrote in \u201cfeeding,\u201d which held its own for a while. But eventually I figured out 13A and 20A and corrected the entry to FUELING.Apropos of nothing, I started thinking about winter feeding stations, because I haven\u2019t gotten my birdseed out yet and all the tough birds in Queens, N.Y., are probably plotting to break my door down early one morning. This video is pegged as entertainment for your cat, so if you\u2019ve had to banish your snookums from shredding wrapping paper or indoor conifers, call \u2018em on over.33D: In keeping with my bad luck in this corner, I got stuck on \u201cLeft bereft\u201d and tried to jimmy in something like \u201cforlourn,\u201d \u201cfourlorn\u201d or \u201cforlorne\u201d once I\u2019d gotten the first couple of letters across. It all fell together, and I arrived at FORSAKEN eventually. This corner was a toughie.44D: My favorite clue of the day! I worked this puzzle in the newsroom with football in the background, so I was predisposed to take \u201cGains yardage?\u201d somewhat literally, despite the question mark giveaway. I got a giggle from SODS, which has also historically been clued as \u201clays down the lawn\u201d and \u201cplot cover-ups.\u201dThis is my first published piece! I\u2019m so honored to be counted among the other constructors of the NYT crossword. Though a college graduate (go Ducks!), I work as a barista in an outdoor coffee hut in Oregon. Unbearably hot in summer and unbearably cold in winter. But I get a lot of down time at my post, which was why I was able to finally complete the construction process. The theme being accepted in September 2016, my final draft took me the next eight months! The hitch could probably be blamed on my ego: I wanted my debut to be epic, so nothing less than the 13 theme entries I clung to would do. Eventually, I got there, and now that I\u2019ve surmounted this Goliath of a pursuit, I\u2019ve another mountain in view: Law School. I hope to do a little bit of good in this nation one day.

{"Headline": "Melting Arctic Ice Makes High-Speed Internet a Reality in a Remote Town", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "The receding ice has opened new passageways for high-speed internet cables. Point Hope, a gravel spit in northwest Alaska, is along one of the new routes.Supported byPOINT HOPE, Alaska \u2014 This is one of the most remote towns in the United States, a small gravel spit on the northwest coast of Alaska, more than 3,700 miles from New York City. Icy seas surround it on three sides, leaving only an unpaved path to the mainland.Getting here from Anchorage, about 700 miles away, requires two flights. Roads do not connect the two places. Basics like milk and bread are delivered by air, and gas is brought in by barge during the summer.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people even know that we exist,\u201d said Daisy Sage, the mayor.Needless to say, this is not the sort of place you expect to be a hub of the high-tech digital world.But in a surprising, and bittersweet, side effect of global warming \u2014 and of the global economy \u2014 one of the fastest internet connections in America is arriving in Point Hope, giving the 700 or so residents their first taste of broadband speed.High-speed internet cables snake under the world\u2019s oceans, tying continents together and allowing email and other bits of digital data sent from Japan to arrive quickly in Britain. Until recently, those lines mostly bypassed the Arctic, where the ice blocked access to the ships that lay the cable.But as the ice has receded, new passageways have emerged, creating a more direct path for the cable \u2014 over the earth\u2019s northern end through places like the Chukchi Sea \u2014 and helping those emails move even move quickly. Quintillion is one of the companies laying the new cable, and Point Hope is one of the places along its route.Financial companies would certainly welcome \u2014 and pay for \u2014 a faster connection between London and Toyko. Over the past decade, traders have increasingly relied on powerful computer programs to buy and sell securities at huge volumes and lightning speeds. A millisecond can be the difference between a big profit and a big loss. Quintillion\u2019s faster connection would also appeal to the operators of data stations around the world that store and send information for social media sites, online retailers and the billions of gadgets that now connect to the internet.But it will be years before the full connections between countries are made. For now, Quintillion\u2019s undersea cables are just around the northern part of Alaska, and the company is taking advantage of a nascent business boom in the Arctic. Oil, shipping and mining companies that can benefit from a faster internet are rushing into the more open waters.Quintillion is also teaming up with local telecommunications companies to use the undersea cables to bring faster internet service to some of the nation\u2019s most disconnected communities.In Point Hope, the new connection could mean better health care, as patients in the town and doctors in faraway cities communicate via seamless webcast. It could help improve education, too. Teachers, now used to waiting hours to download course materials, will now be able to do it in minutes.Many of Point Hope\u2019s older residents cringe at the incursion of technology. For the most part, this is still a traditional community of Inupiaq native Alaskans. Until the 1970s, many families lived in sod houses framed with whale bones.People here also have no illusions about the overall effect of global warming. They see the waters rising and worry about sea mammals disappearing. They rely on the sea for food, and their year is built around festivals for berry picking and whaling.\u201cInupiaq people are taught to be patient,\u201d said Steve Oomittuk, a leading local whale hunter whose family has lived in Point Hope for many generations. \u201cWe wait for animals to come to us for our food, our shelter, our medicine, our clothing. The internet makes people impatient for everything. This is not our way of life.\u201dBut interviews with dozens of Point Hope residents suggest that people here see Quintillion\u2019s cable as a way of connecting with an outside world that has long been beyond easy reach \u2014 and something that could change their lives for the better.Leona Snyder, for one, is excited about what the connection could do for her Justice Jones, who turns 16 on Sunday. She wants him to go to college, which would mean leaving the village. Having broadband internet could help him study and research outside opportunities.\u201cInternet means exposure to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want that for Justice. I want him to be a judge. Judge Justice Jones. It has a ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIn June, three ships carrying huge rolls of cable traveled through waters in the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea to lay the final miles of Quintillion\u2019s undersea internet network.The boats unfurled 40 miles of fiber optic cable into the dark, choppy water. An enormous shoveling tool plowed the sea floor and buried the cables for protection. It was the final stretch of a 1,200-mile network connecting six coastal towns, including Kotzebue, Nome and Point Hope.\u201cA project like this has been discussed for 20-plus years but was formidable from a cost and weather standpoint,\u201d said Tim Woolston, a Quintillion spokesman. \u201cThe ice situation has evolved to the point where it\u2019s now physically possible.\u201dAn infusion from Cooper Investment Partners, a private equity firm in New York, has helped Quintillion finance the laying of the cable. The company would not say how much the network had cost to build so far. But it insisted that supplying high-speed internet service to an estimated 20,000 people along the cable\u2019s route would be a good business.Quintillion makes money leasing the bandwidth from its undersea cable network to local telecoms that then bring internet service directly to homes and businesses in Alaska. The company has not announced its business plans for connecting internet service between Asia and Europe, but will probably use a similar model.Although that is a relatively small number of people, Quintillion believes it will increase along with what the company expects to be broader commercial growth in the region driven by oil and mineral exploration. With broadband service available, Quintillion is also betting that more data centers, research centers, hospitals and schools will make the Arctic Circle home.Other broadband-internet providers have the same idea. Cinia, a telecom company owned by the Finnish government, has completed the first stage of a multiyear plan to lay a subsea broadband network between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean. Cinia, which expects the Arctic network to cost about $700 million, just completed the first leg, from Germany to Finland.\u201cThe financial sector wants the shortest route for trading, and we are talking about fractions of milliseconds, but it makes a difference,\u201d Ari-Jussi Knaapila, Cinia\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. Multiplayer video games that connect participants around the world also demand faster internet traffic with less delay, he added.After Alaska, Quintillion plans to bring its undersea cables to Asia. A third stage would extend the network to Europe. The company would not predict how long the project would take to complete.In the meantime, Quintillion is offsetting some of its costs by joining forces with local telecom companies to sell the internet service directly to customers. In Point Hope, several local companies, including the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative, have rushed to prepare homes. Alaska Communications, another telecom, has signed up city offices and businesses at other sites.The fiber network will bring connection speeds of 200 gigabits per second to the village, among the fastest rates in the country. Point Hope will not feel the full effect right away. Residential customers will initially be able get service at 10 megabits per second under plans starting $24.99 a month, while service will be faster for businesses.That is still 10 times faster than the existing phone-line connections here, and good enough for streaming video on a service like Netflix. The companies said they planned to offer faster speeds if demand warrants doing so.People here are already thinking that the new broadband lines could transform the local economy.The one general store, the Native Store, will be able to order new supplies more easily. The phone association has installed computer terminals at City Hall to provide free internet service to the public. Point Hope\u2019s transportation director is building a conference center with Wi-Fi and web video conferencing above a bus garage to host state events. Artists are planning to sell native crafts and jewelry online.Last month, about 25 residents, including the mayor, gathered at City Hall and talked about how internet service could turn Point Hope, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in North America, into a tourist destination with a museum with interactive displays and a website. The village\u2019s small motel with 20 beds would offer Wi-Fi.\u201cThe trigger to all of this is lower-cost broadband that will bring a whole new economy and hope to places like Point Hope,\u201d said Jens Laipenieks, president of the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.Nome, a few hundred miles to the south and with 4,000 residents, offers a glimpse into Point Hope\u2019s future. Climate change, and broadband connections, have already altered education and commerce.With the warming of the Bering Sea, the Crystal Serenity cruise ship, 820 feet long and with a capacity of more than 1,000 passengers, has started to anchor offshore, bringing new tourism. The ship has only recently been able to navigate around the ice.If local politicians have their way, it will be only the beginning. They are lobbying the state to build a deep water port so that even larger cruise ships can dock in Nome. The officials have indicated Quintillion\u2019s broadband service improves its case to state officials, who want to make sure Coast Guard and tourist boats will have access to high-speed internet service.\u201cThe future is here and there is not anything changing that,\u201d said Richard Beneville, Nome\u2019s mayor, who also runs a tour company.Nome has had broadband internet service for years. The arrival of Quintillion\u2019s lines, which were turned on Dec. 1, will make the connections much faster.Like the changes that Point Hope is experiencing, the ones in Nome worry some residents. Austin Ahmasuk, a marine environmentalist who lives along the coast, is among them. He is concerned that the change will dilute some of the local culture and result in harm to the environment.\u201cThe very thing that kept most global development away from the north \u2014 ice \u2014 is disappearing in all its formats,\u201d Mr. Ahmasuk said. \u201cHistory shows that outside people don\u2019t have the same interest in our culture and environment.\u201dBut residents here are mostly embracing having a stronger connection with the rest of the world.Early on a weekday evening, Bryan and Maggie Muktoyuk organized more than a dozen people at the Lutheran Church on Bering Street for a weekly rehearsal of native dance and drums.Seated in a row, men and teenage boys pounded on round drums made of stretched walrus stomach. Women with mittens and ornate mukluk boots swayed their hips to the beat.Ms. Muktoyuk held up her iPhone and, with a Wi-Fi connection, started to stream a video of the rehearsal on Facebook. Mr. Muktoyuk had set up a group page on the social network for other native dancers around the Alaska\u2019s North Slope region.A line of men took to the community room\u2019s floor, pounded their feet and shouted as they reached toward the sky. They were learning a new dance that Mr. Muktoyuk had choreographed, inspired by an exhausting whale hunt he had participated in months earlier in Wainwright, near Point Hope.\u201cMake sure you get this,\u201d he said to Ms. Muktoyuk.videoAdvertisement"}

In an emailed statement Saturday night, Milstein Properties said it built 30 Lincoln Plaza in 1978.\u201cWe are long-term members of this community and have played a central role in nurturing this special theater,\u201d the statement said, adding that \u201cvital structural work\u201d was needed to repair and waterproof the plaza around the building.\u201cAt the completion of this work, we expect to reopen the space as a cinema that will maintain its cultural legacy far into the future,\u201d the statement said.A Milstein spokesman said in an email that it was yet to be determined if the cinema would reopen with the Talbots in charge.Stepping off the escalator into the theater, which is below an apartment building, feels like entering a bygone era. A statue of Humphrey Bogart stands in a corner. French movie posters adorn the lavender walls. The concessions stand sells muffins and carrot cake.As moviegoers filed into the theater on Saturday morning, they mourned a New York institution.\u201cWe\u2019re somewhat brokenhearted,\u201d Paul Johnson, 68, said.Allan Sigall, 68, of Brooklyn said he often checks the newspaper to see what is playing at Lincoln Plaza. He pulled out a copy of the Saturday New York Times and pointed to the theater\u2019s advertisement.\u201cI have eclectic taste,\u201d Mr. Sigall said. \u201cMost movies aren\u2019t made for people my age.\u201d\u201cYou work here long enough and you see how things are going,\u201d said Mr. Tabarez, 28, who started at the theater 10 years ago. \u201cYounger folks are not really into it. They\u2019re more into \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and \u2018Iron Man.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve gone over to the commercial product,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey play what\u2019s box office.\u201dOn Saturday, Ms. Talbot said Lincoln Plaza\u2019s mission had been the opposite: \u201cWe often will play a film that we know has no, quote, commercial value, but we admire it and respect it and would like to share it with our audience,\u201d she said.Moviegoers increasingly want \u201cthe experience,\u201d Mr. Tabarez said, such as reclining seats and huge screens. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, it\u2019s all about the movie.\u201dThe lack of flashy amenities isn\u2019t the only sign of the theater\u2019s age. As he spoke, Mr. Tabarez printed out-of-order signs for two stalls in the men\u2019s restroom. The automatic ticket kiosk was broken, too.\u201cA lot of them have a love-hate relationship\u201d with the theater, Mr. Tabarez said of its regular customers. \u201cThey love our movies, but they hate the fact that we never renovate.\u201dStill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure a lot of these folks are going to start crying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox-Disney Deal Gives Rupert Murdoch His King Lear Moment", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible.But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley.Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief.The $52.4 billion deal \u2014 which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company \u2014 has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy.After all, Mr. Murdoch didn\u2019t grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. \u201cRupert has always been a collector, a builder,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.In 2012, under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch split his entertainment assets into a separate publicly traded company, 21st Century Fox, from News Corporation, the company that includes The Journal, the New York Post and other newspapers. For a time Mr. Murdoch\u2019s enterprise looked like an entertainment company with a newspaper problem, with glitzy Hollywood assets and lucrative Fox News keeping Mr. Murdoch\u2019s true love, printed papers, afloat.But 21st Century Fox soon faced the same economic headwinds affecting other traditional media companies that have been disrupted by the rise of digital: customers cut the cable cord and streamed TV shows and movies on multiple devices. At the same time, Fox News, the highly rated basic cable channel and a big moneymaker, has suffered setbacks after a series of sexual harassment allegations at the network led to high-level departures and costly legal settlements.Mr. Murdoch must have known he needed to get even bigger to survive. But lately his buying prowess has taken a hit. In 2014, investors rebuffed him when he tried to gain scale with an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc., the company that owns HBO and CNN \u2014 and which may end up the property of AT&T, if a deal long in the making survives the scrutiny of a skeptical Justice Department. Regulatory hassles have also thwarted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s efforts to pay $15 billion for the 61 percent stake in Sky not already owned by 21st Century Fox.\u201cHe tried to buy, and when that didn\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t sulk \u2014 he sells,\u201d Ms. Martin said.Disney\u2019s planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox \u2014 Mr. Murdoch\u2019s confidants call it a merger \u2014 makes economic sense, analysts say, and may be the best way for Mr. Murdoch\u2019s broader empire to thrive. But it also makes the identity of his heir less apparent.Lachlan Murdoch, the elder brother at 46, has been caricatured as the prodigal son. He left the family business in 2005 and was happily living out of the fray in Australia, with a supermodel wife and a trust fund. But as part of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s succession plan, Lachlan returned to the United States in 2015 to serve with his younger brother \u2014 and alongside his father, as co-executive chairman \u2014 at 21st Century Fox. Seen by some insiders as a daddy\u2019s boy, he moved into his father\u2019s former office on the company\u2019s palm-tree-lined lot in Beverly Hills.Questions abound about which son would carry on the family legacy, should the Disney deal go through. (Mr. Murdoch\u2019s older daughters, Prudence and Elisabeth, have stayed mostly out of the business, and his younger daughters, Grace and Chloe, are teenagers.)\u201cYou have this issue with two sons who are seemingly capable of commercial success and, if you\u2019re Rupert, you want to leave them both in a good spot, for lack of a better spot,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.In one possible outcome, James Murdoch would take on an executive position at Disney, and Lachlan Murdoch, who shares his father\u2019s passion for news, would move to News Corporation or oversee the company that absorbs Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.\u201cThe Disney deal gives Lachlan a clear run to manage the remnants,\u201d said Neil Chenoweth, an Australian financial journalist and author of \u201cRupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World\u2019s Greatest Media Wizard.\u201dA company insider who could only discuss ongoing deal negotiations anonymously said it was too early to know what roles the Murdoch sons would take on, and added that James Murdoch could decide to strike out on his own.The Disney deal would leave him without a seat at the Dolby Theater for the Academy Awards \u2014 a string of Fox Searchlight Pictures films including \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cBirdman\u201d have won best picture Oscars \u2014 but Mr. Murdoch would maintain his seat at the White House. In August, the family patriarch had a private dinner with President Trump; Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser; and the White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.Mr. Murdoch talks regularly with Mr. Kushner, who knows a thing or two about tiptoeing around powerful family business dynamics. People close to Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Kushner described them as friends, but others saw a transactional relationship.\u201cRupert is a guy who doesn\u2019t have friends,\u201d said Mr. Chenoweth, the Murdoch biographer.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s news properties will allow him to maintain the political influence that he has cultivated.\u201cI think he\u2019s keeping his passion projects,\u201d said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.As for his sons, people close to Mr. Murdoch do not envision a scenario in which either James or Lachlan thrives long-term at the top of a company that doesn\u2019t have their father\u2019s stamp on the door.In a joint memo to employees sent last week, James and Lachlan tried to quell concerns about the sale. \u201cUncertainty,\u201d they wrote, \u201calways breeds unease.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Dowdy Celtics Are Trying to Wear Supreme", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro BasketballBOSTON \u2014 You may long for the old Boston Garden and its parquet floor shot through with dead spots. You may miss the short shorts of John Havlicek and Larry Bird. But the championship banners \u2014 all 17 of them \u2014 are still here in this newer arena called TD Garden, and they tell the story of one of the most iconic franchises in sports.But I didn\u2019t come for history.Instead, I wanted to know how the N.B.A. has become the Netflix of sports properties, a league whose players are helping transform the way sports are being bought, sold and consumed in much the same way the streaming services have changed entertainment.Yet even the hidebound Celtics are trying to jump on board.\u201cOn the surface, we are a traditional old-school brand,\u201d said Rich Gotham, the Celtics\u2019 president, \u201cbut underneath we are quite evolved.\u201dThe team\u2019s ownership group, led by chairman Wyc Grousbeck, is composed of private-equity veterans. Fifteen years ago, the group bought the Celtics for $360 million, a bargain. They not only wanted to hang another championship banner here \u2014 the last had come in 1986 \u2014 but also sought to unlock the value in what had become a moribund franchise.Enter Gotham, a tech executive, charged with identifying the team\u2019s consumers and making it easy for them to fall in love again with the Celtics. It helped that money guys and tech evangelists were becoming part of other N.B.A. franchises as well as the league\u2019s front office.Both here in Boston, and around the league, executives came to the conclusion that their most valuable asset was a generation of basketball players who were bigger, faster and more talented than those who came before. Players who also cared deeply about how they dressed, what music they listened to and what was going on in the world.Even better, these players had come of age with smartphones and social media and were eager to broadcast their tastes and opinions to whoever was listening.\u201cWe have thoughtful, socially conscious and digitally savvy players,\u201d Gotham said. \u201cAll we needed to do is turn them loose.\u201dImagine hearing that from the Patriots owner Robert Kraft across town, or Jerry Jones in Dallas, or any N.F.L. executive.No one in the N.B.A.\u2019s league office flinches when LeBron James wears one black and one white shoe with the word \u201cequality\u201d written on them, as he did on Sunday in a game against the Washington Wizards in the shadow of the White House. He then posted a photograph of them on Instagram, which quickly garnered more than one million likes.This partnership has not only given voice and weight to different points of view, but it has also helped drive interest in N.B.A. players off the court.\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember how black-dominated the N.B.A. is as a sport, and as a result you are getting viewpoints on civil rights and equality that you don\u2019t necessarily hear all the time,\u201d said Ramesh Srinivasan, a U.C.L.A professor and a scholar of technology, politics and society. \u201cThe league knows it can\u2019t stop these athletes, so instead they have embraced them and provided a bigger megaphone.\u201dThis is the same N.B.A. that in the late 1970s and early 1980s worried that it was losing popularity because it was too black. This is the same N.B.A. that in 2005 instituted a dress code to distance itself from hip-hop culture.Now Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper are courtside fixtures as well the source of the music blasted out of arena sound systems.Of the hundreds of millions of N.B.A. fans, 46 percent are under the age of 35, according to Gotham. Each morning, my soon-to-be-13-year-old-son watches the previous night\u2019s highlights on Snapchat. He heads to YouTube, where compilation videos of each basket can turn a two-hour game into 20 minutes.The players have, for the most part, used their elevated platforms judiciously and joyfully. James has attracted 96.6 million followers across all platforms by posting lighthearted fare, like his team\u2019s New York subway videos, to go with his social commentary.Irving has cracked the N.B.A.\u2019s top 10 with an active Instagram (11 million) feed and a knack for viral gestures, such as giving away his jersey and shoes to a pair of United States servicewomen in Brooklyn last month after a game against the Nets. He also knows social media helps move merchandise: He unveiled his Kyrie 4s with a video urging his fans to continue exploring their best selves.One of his teammates, Jaylen Brown, posted on Twitter a video of himself jumping out of his car and dunking on unsuspecting pickup players in one of this year\u2019s social-media fads, the Drive-By Dunk Challenge. Both Irving, 25, and Brown, 21, may be still finding their voice, but there is no doubt that there is an audience eager to hear them.\u201cWe are reaching a generation that doesn\u2019t see the same cultural barriers to the game that we once did,\u201d Gotham said.When one of the oldest and most accomplished franchises like the Celtics can trust its players with messages as far-reaching as the platforms, it\u2019s good for business today and will be even better for the N.B.A. tomorrow.Follow Joe Drape on Twitter @JoeDrapeAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Halifax Explosion and Au Revoir to Hi: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile I was in Halifax this week to write about the massive explosion there 100 years ago that killed 2,000 people and injured 10,000, I went to a screening of a documentary film without a soundtrack. But I wouldn\u2019t call it a silent movie.That includes the deaf. At the time of the explosion, Halifax was home to the only school for deaf children east of Ontario. Unlike other Canadian boarding schools of that era, its history is generally positive. It is widely remembered for creating a community for its pupils and advancing sign language and deaf culture.The blast blew out the school\u2019s windows and doors and it was closed for structural repairs. But while some students were injured, mostly by flying glass, none of them died.The film is subtitled for viewers who don\u2019t know American Sign Language, which is used in interviews and narration. Ms. Campbell said in an email that some hearing audience members have told her \u201cthat the lack of sound really changed the experience for them, making it much more immersive.\u201dAs well, Ms. Campbell wrote that Shawn Beckwith, the film\u2019s editor, took the producers\u2019 advice \u201cabout editing in \u2018A.S.L. rhythm\u2019 as opposed to Canadian English editing patterns.\u201dThe film also reveals another aspect of Halifax\u2019s deaf community. The subtitles sometimes indicate that someone is speaking in Maritime Sign Language. Ms. Campbell, an Albertan by birth, said that M.S.L. is little known outside Atlantic Canada, even among deaf people. She learned it after moving to Nova Scotia from Ontario 11 years ago and now must remind herself to switch back to A.S.L. when traveling.The film will be making the rounds of festivals in Canada and the United States next year. Catch it if it comes to your community.From Dan Bilefsky, who began reporting for the Times from Montreal this week:When I came of age in Quebec in the 1980s, the province was being buffeted by a Catalan-style referendum on independence, and business was fleeing. French Quebecers were agitating to uphold their right to live in French. Stop signs across Montreal were painted over by vandals to say \u201cStop 101,\u201d a reference to Bill 101, a law strengthening the French language in QuebecToday, many young Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois switch effortlessly between French and English, French Canadian rappers perform in English and French; and separatism is largely in retreat. The top official in Quebec, the Liberal party\u2019s Philippe Couillard, recently appealed to Anglo-Quebecers who fled the province to \u201cplease come home!\u201dNevertheless, nearly three decades after I left, it only took me a few days back in Montreal to see that the culture wars of the past are far from dead. Barely had I set foot on Canadian soil before the province\u2019s legislature passed a resolution calling on merchants to say \u201cBonjour\u201d instead of the hybrid \u201cBonjour-Hi,\u201d the quintessentially Montreal bilingual greeting. It had an eerie sense of deja-vu. Judging by the backlash against the move \u2014 and the backlash against the backlash \u2014 these questions of identity politics are here to stay.\u2014Lorsque j\u2019ai eu 18 ans dans les ann\u00e9es 80, la belle province venait de tenir un r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum sur l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance, comme l\u2019a fait la Catalogne derni\u00e8rement, et les entreprises fuyaient vers Toronto.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How does the Disney deal affect Fox\u2019s efforts to buy control of Sky?\u2022 The media world is gossiping over whether someone might try to top Disney.\u2022 Meet the advisers who helped put the transaction together.\u2022 Tim Cook and Charles Koch wrote a joint op-ed urging protection of Dreamers.As the Trump administration moves to block one media deal, it appears more supportive of today\u2019s big transaction.President Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch on Thursday and congratulated him ahead of a deal for Walt Disney Co. to buy some of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc., White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal,\u201d Sanders said.But then there\u2019s the jobs angle There\u2019s a problem. Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House. However, Iger didn\u2019t specifically address the prospect of a White House run at the time.Here are a few other notable business people that are on the list:\u2022 Howard Schultz of Starbucks\u2022 Mark Cuban\u2022 Oprah Winfrey\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook\u2014 Stephen GrocerThat\u2019s the question that media executives and Wall Street bankers have been asking this morning.Could a digital company like Amazon, Google or Apple emerge with a higher bid? Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives.

{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Goes Deep With Mobile and Verizon", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith television audiences for the N.F.L. getting smaller, the league\u2019s new digital rights deal with Verizon Communications represents the latest challenge to the traditional media partnerships that for decades have served as the lifeblood for North America\u2019s richest sports league.The deal, which will cost Verizon more than $2 billion during the next five years, gives the telecommunications giant the rights to stream games across its variety of digital media brands, including Yahoo Sports, Complex and go90. In addition, fans no longer have to be Verizon customers to gain access to the games, which they can watch regardless of which company is their mobile provider.CBS, NBC, ESPN and Fox currently pay the NFL some $5 billion a year for the rights to televise those games. Those rights help those networks garner top fees from pay television distributors and help those distributors convince subscribers not to cut off their cable subscriptions.Rick Cordella, executive vice president and general manager for digital media at NBC Sports, a unit of the pay television distributor Comcast, said the Verizon deal could help expand the reach for NBC\u2019s advertisers, since fans watching the Verizon stream will see NBC\u2019s inventory of ads.\u201cWe are selling one audience, no matter where they watch our content,\u201d Cordella said.Like previous agreements with Amazon, Twitter and Yahoo, the new Verizon agreement illustrates the N.F.L.\u2019s proclivity to push the envelope to broaden its reach, especially among younger viewers, who may not have a pay television subscription, even if it means potentially angering its television partners as they approach the start of negotiations for new deals.In a statement announcing the deal, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was thrilled to get more deeply involved with digital distribution.\u201cLive N.F.L. action directly on your mobile device \u2014 regardless of carrier \u2014 will give millions of fans additional ways to follow their favorite sport,\u201d Goodell said.Hans Schroeder, an N.F.L. executive in charge of media, believes fans won\u2019t choose to watch on their phones instead of their televisions, but instead will add to the television audience. \u201cWe think this is a very complementary way of growing, engaging and reaching younger fans that will ultimately become longer term viewers,\u201d he said.Since 2010, Verizon mobile customers have been able to stream N.F.L. games for free through the N.F.L. Mobile app.The deal potentially allows Verizon, and the N.F.L., to reach more people, but also does away with what made the previous agreements so lucrative for Verizon: Exclusivity. When signing an extension of the mobile agreement in 2013, Verizon executives said that the number of subscribers the N.F.L. Mobile app helped retain, or add, contributed to the company\u2019s decision to re-sign.Now Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile customers will also be allowed to stream N.F.L. games, as long as they go to Verizon-owned apps or websites with their mobile phones.Over the past few years, Verizon has acquired a spate of digital media companies, including paying more than $9 billion combined to buy AOL and Yahoo, a sign of the company\u2019s growing ambitions at becoming a digital media powerhouse able to challenge the likes of Google and Facebook for advertising dollars.There are some protections for traditional broadcast partners built into the agreement, which does not extend to streaming on tablets or through smart televisions.For the N.F.L., the deal is surely a short-term win. Verizon is paying nearly double the amount of money each year and doesn\u2019t retain exclusivity over the games, though they are adding a number of sponsorship benefits. But long term it seems certain to allow for further erosion of pay television subscriptions, and it will challenge the N.F.L.\u2019s partners in legacy media, who are already facing two straight years of declining ratings.The N.F.L.\u2019s broadcast agreements all expire after the 2022 season. With ratings trending downward and digital rights giants, such as Netflix, Facebook, Amazon and Google, so far balking at paying hundreds of millions, or billions, for sports rights, the N.F.L. could soon be in for a round of tense negotiations.Advertisement"}

Pretty much everyone in Silicon Valley says that that\u2019s bogus and that consumers will lose, while big corporations like Comcast will have free rein to jack up prices for different types of internet services. I fall in the latter camp.So, what say you here? I assume you\u2019re with me, though since you like to be contrarian on occasion perhaps you\u2019re going to go for the pro-Pai argument?Moving on, I wanted to get into a slightly wonky, somewhat overlooked section of the internet: Patreon and the uproar among its creative community.If you aren\u2019t familiar, Patreon is basically a payments platform used by artists and creative types, where they can charge or offer subscriptions to people for the types of things they produce. It ranges from writers and humorists to artists, journalists, crafty people, gamers \u2014 really whatever service you think people will pay to receive. It\u2019s been growing, and has an indie flair to an ancient practice. (\u201cPatrons\u201d were quite common among artists hundreds of years ago.)But Patreon is also a business that has promised huge gains to its investors, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it manages these two audiences. This time it seemed to go too far in the direction of its investors; perhaps now that it\u2019s been burned, it\u2019ll keep a closer eye on its indie artists.Yes, this is an extended way of saying, \u201cLook how smart I am.\u201d But also, it\u2019s more: Do you think we\u2019re basically creating artificial, overinflated value in these alternative currencies that really has no long-term staying power? And do we think a plethora of other, potentially scam alternative currencies may draft on the surging power of Bitcoin? (Hint: The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d)No, seriously, I think for once you have a point. There\u2019s no earthly way that Litecoin becomes something people will use and consider valuable in the future. It\u2019s obviously being run up by bubbly speculation. But Bitcoin? I think it\u2019s got a chance.Anyway, have fun with your nog. See you!Advertisement"}

He was 61.Mr. Carney emerged from Akron, Ohio, in the late 1970s as a member of Tin Huey, a band on the arty side of new wave, and became a busy studio musician. Although best known for playing saxophones of all sizes, his arsenal also included clarinet, trumpet, violin, harmonica, panpipes, keyboards, trombone, ukulele and banjo.His long list of studio credits reflects not a colorless sideman for hire but a versatile musician with a distinct sensibility: whimsical, rowdy, eclectic, wry, historically informed, sometimes spooky, sometimes absurd. He could make his saxophones honk, croon, cackle and lament.Mr. Carney was born on Jan. 23, 1956, in Akron. His first instrument was banjo, which he began playing in junior high school. An entirely self-taught musician, he turned to saxophone at 15 and immersed himself in jazz, from traditional to avant-garde.Mr. Carney\u2019s music was also at home on animated television series for both children and adults, including \u201cEncyclopedia\u201d and \u201cThe Motion-Enhanced Chronodirectional Adventures of Romanov.\u201dMr. Carney is survived by his partner, Megan Hinchliffe; his daughter, Hedda Carney; and his brother, Jim.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality\u2019s Holes in Europe May Offer Peek at Future in U.S.", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast spring, Swedes got a tantalizing offer: If they subscribed to Sweden\u2019s biggest telecom provider, Telia Company AB, they could have unlimited access on their mobile phones to Facebook, Spotify, Instagram and other blockbuster apps.The issue is now working its way through the courts. As it does, the offer is still available.Such deals may be gaining momentum in the United States.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on Thursday to roll back the net neutrality rules in the United States. While the European Union has such rules in place, telecom providers have pushed the boundaries at times in Sweden, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, offering a glimpse at the future American companies and consumers may face if protections are watered down.For the European Union\u2019s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.That\u2019s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren\u2019t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.That doesn\u2019t necessarily bother consumers.\u201cFrom a user perspective, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem and I think most consumers don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. \u201cThere are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify. But then they get free surfing on Spotify.\u201dWasn\u2019t net neutrality being compromised? \u201cIt\u2019s not Cuba,\u201d Mr. Haglunds replied. \u201cCuba has a problem,\u201d he said, citing the country\u2019s severe restrictions on the internet.A Swedish court ultimately overturned the decision on technical grounds after Telia appealed. Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries. But Sweden\u2019s administrative court is expected to issue a broader decision on zero rating rules this year.Critics of the rollback in the United States have cited zero ratings schemes in Europe, or versions of it, as an omen of how the web may be split.\u201cProviders are starting to split the net into packages,\u201d Mr. Khanna wrote.In Germany, a similar case involved a Deutsche Telekom offer called StreamOn, which allows users to access unlimited videos and music from specific partners like Netflix. The country\u2019s telecom regulator approved the deal, drawing criticism from consumer activists. StreamOn sought to address some of the concerns by expanding the offer to include around 50 partners.\u201cThis a battle for the next century,\u201d said Klaus M\u00fcller, the chairman of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, a lobbying group. \u201cWe can either have oligarchical markets with huge players, or a big variety of companies with lots of competition, which would be good for consumers but bad for big business.\u201dHalf of the 2 billion searches done annually through Startpage are in the United States. If American I.S.P.s start charging companies to be in the internet\u2019s fast lane, Mr. Beens said he would not be able to keep up with deep-pocketed competitors like Google, Bing and Yahoo.\u201cPeople want privacy, but what if we can\u2019t pay the amounts of money that I.S.P.s are looking for?\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S., people would have a slower connection to our search engine. It could really harm our business model.\u201dPerhaps the biggest issue for Europe \u2014 and other parts of the world \u2014 is that countries watch what the United States does.\u201cThe U.S. set good standards for the globe, but now they could go backward,\u201d said Maryant Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, a senior policy adviser at European Digital Rights, an association of civil and human rights organizations advocating an open digital environment.\u201cThe consequences are not very good internationally.\u201dAn earlier version of this article included a quotation that misstated the availability of the internet access in Cuba.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Journey From the Calais Jungle to the London Stage", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFounded in January 2015 but never officially recognized by the French government, the camp was a woeful sight. \u201cIt was a bad place,\u201d Mr. Sarrar said in a recent interview. \u201cIt was wind and rain and cold and freezing and no electricity. It was not a proper place to live.\u201dBut one structure stood out: a large domed tent, from which Mr. Sarrar, himself a drummer and singer, could hear live music playing. One day, he went in. And that visit ended up changing his life.So he took a hazardous route to Europe, crossing desert and sea to Italy, then on to France, where he considered trying to claim refugee status. But he said that the French police reminded him too much of the ones back home. \u201cI got beaten up like I did in Sudan,\u201d he said. He decided to head to Britain.And that meant finding his way to \u201cthe Jungle.\u201d He arrived in Calais not long after two other young men did so as well, coming from the opposite direction. Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson \u2014 also both now 27 \u2014 were friends from northern England who had met at Oxford University and had begun writing plays together.And so they did.\u201cWe arrived in Calais and found 8,000 people and the basic structure of a society,\u201d Mr. Murphy recalled. \u201cAnd then these nice Kuwaiti men took us in and built us a tent because we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201dThey named their theater Good Chance, partly because it gave refugees a chance to express themselves, but also because it was a nod to a piece of Jungle slang (\u201cHe got his good chance\u201d) that meant successfully stowing away and crossing the English Channel.But even with the ameliorating factors of music and camaraderie, the Jungle was no idyllic setting.It certainly wasn\u2019t pleasurable for Mr. Sarrar; he said that he tried to leave every night. But he played in his band, wrote some songs \u2014 he is particularly proud of an upbeat number recounting an absurd 24 hours he spent trapped in the Eurostar terminal in Calais \u2014 and made some contacts. One night, his own \u201cgood chance\u201d came: He stowed away in a truck and made it through to Birmingham, England, where he claimed asylum. Six months later, he was granted leave to remain for five years, with the possibility of extension.Mr. Murphy and Mr. Robertson remained in Calais, where the situation was rapidly deteriorating. \u201cThe cold was awful,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cThe sanitation was awful, the police gradually became more aggressive and the unaccompanied kids started to go, well, mad. The mental health really got awful.\u201dThe duo assembled a cast that features three former camp residents, one of whom is Mr. Sarrar, who had moved to northern England after being granted asylum and then reconnected with the duo at a workshop in Manchester. Now smartly dressed, with a natty blond streak in his hair and a decent grasp of English, he plays a drum-toting refugee named Omar.Rehearsal are freewheeling, lively and tinged with chaos. On a recent afternoon, the scenes being played out involved the actions of good-intentioned Western volunteers resulting in borderline farce after the Jungle\u2019s denizens refuse to play ball. Performed in an immersive set that replicates one of the camp\u2019s Afghan restaurants, the show is an unabashedly entertaining attempt to map and explain the Jungle\u2019s brief existence. But it also explores the idea that volunteer intervention may have done more harm than good.\u201cI think when something tragic happens, be it Grenfell Tower or what was happening in the Jungle, the British have a particular, hugely generous response,\u201d said Mr. Martin, who is Australian. \u201cThe play examines that. Can we help? Should we help? How do we help? And do we make things better or worse?\u201dIt is a question that haunts the authors, who saw attitudes toward volunteers change in the camp as conditions got inexorably worse.\u201cAt the start all we heard was \u2018U.K.! U.K.! U.K. is the best country in the world!\u2019\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cBut I remember the first time somebody went to me and said, \u2018Are you from the U.K.?\u2019\u201d \u2014 and then hurled an expletive at him \u2014 \u201cI think that\u2019s where the germ for this play was.\u201dBritain\u2019s current standing in the eyes of the world, particularly after the Brexit vote, is a complicated matter. But its traditional virtues \u2014 decency, hospitality, tolerance \u2014 are surely on display in the rapid integration of Mr. Sarrar, who was recovering in a Sudanese hospital just two years ago. Seated together in the National Theater\u2019s interview room, Mr. Robertson and Mr. Murphy seemed genuinely nervous when Mr. Sarrar was asked whether he thought this play rang true to his own experience.\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m doing nothing in the play, I\u2019m just looking at it and it takes me back to Calais,\u201d said Mr. Sarrar to the playwrights\u2019 evident relief. \u201cAll these emotions.

{"Headline": "In the N.F.L., Stability Comes With a $200 Million Price Tag", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballIn a word, continuity, numerous owners said, and the start of a smooth transition to new leadership, as Goodell begins the process of finding a suitable successor to take over when his deal expires in 2024, if he does not decide to leave sooner.Goodell, the owners acknowledge, is hardly the perfect leader for North America\u2019s most successful sports league. His tenure, they know, has been filled with missteps and controversies, unforced errors and self-inflicted wounds.But he has worked for the league for 35 years, and he knows, better than anyone, the owners, their ancestors and their progeny. That is no small thing. He knows which ones he must listen to, and which ones he can pretend to listen to, and how to finesse them. The same goes for the media titans who have helped turn the N.F.L. into a $14 billion-a-year juggernaut. During his tenure as commissioner, which began in 2006, Goodell has helped team values skyrocket, and the owners are betting that will continue under his leadership.\u201cYou can\u2019t be cutting off your nose to spite your face,\u201d one owner said of his colleagues who want to replace Goodell for his missteps, most notably in his handling of player discipline and off-field controversies. \u201cPeople tend to focus on the things he did wrong. But who\u2019s going to replace him? That\u2019s when things bog down.\u201dThe owners did not want to speak publicly about league business before Wednesday\u2019s owners\u2019 meetings.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones tried for months to undermine the new deal, arguing that Goodell should not be rewarded with a new contract while the league was facing big challenges, like the decline in television ratings and player protests during the national anthem. Jones hired the star lawyer David Boies and threatened to sue his fellow owners if they did not halt the contract talks, a move that led to his ouster last month from the compensation committee.At the one-day owners\u2019 meetings here on Wednesday, Jones and several of his allies continued to quietly complain about the deal, Goodell\u2019s leadership and a league office they believe is filled with too many meddlesome executives.Speaking after the meeting, Goodell tried to downplay the friction created by his contract extension. He said that the league was stronger because owners were able to disagree, both among themselves and with the commissioner. He added that his relationship with Jones has not been damaged.\u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, I\u2019m not paid to agree and he\u2019s not paid to agree with me,\u201d Goodell said.Goodell then gave Jones an awkward hug and left the room.Jones took the podium and said the owners will consider changing the N.F.L.\u2019s constitution to give them more sway over league executives, including the commissioner. He added that the owners would look at trimming the power of the department that investigates off-field behavior by players.Jones tried to downplay the tension he created when he threatened to sue the owners on the compensation committee, saying that he was only trying to improve the league. But he also took a dig at the size of the commissioner\u2019s new contract.\u201cI know how much Roger Goodell loves the National Football League, and he should love it even more right now,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Jones failed to derail Goodell\u2019s new contract because of a basic truth: Whatever their differences, most owners believe Goodell is still the best man to lead the league, and they know there is no credible replacement they could agree on. That\u2019s why, in May, the owners voted unanimously to extend his contract through 2024, and they raised little fuss when the compensation committee offered him a deal worth up to $40 million a year.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Atlanta Falcons and the chairman of the compensation committee, said on Wednesday that most of the other owners were glad the fight with Jones was over.\u201cThe owners were bothered by anything that was a distraction from the league, the league\u2019s business,\u201d Blank said. \u201cThere was a strong feeling in the room that we need to bond together, be together.\u201dMany owners say it would be risky to replace Goodell at a critical juncture for the N.F.L. Roughly half of the league\u2019s revenue comes from broadcast and media deals, yet television ratings are down for the second straight year. In the coming years, networks could balk at paying even more for the rights to show games as the league continues to chip away at the legacy media companies\u2019 traditional lock on N.F.L. content. Digital media companies, such as Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, have shown little appetite for competing for rights that now cost more than $1 billion a year.Some of the world\u2019s most prosperous companies clamor to become league sponsors, but that enthusiasm has been eroded by a series of public relations disasters, including, most recently, the protests during the national anthem.\u201cWe take that very seriously,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThose are issues that are important to us. We want to make sure all of our employees, whether at the NFL Network or league office, or at clubs, are working in a safe and comfortable environment.\u201dAlso, with the league\u2019s labor agreement set to expire in 2020, and its television contracts expiring in 2021 and 2022, Goodell\u2019s institutional knowledge could be difficult to replace. He has been willing to cede much of the power during labor and media negotiations to a handful of key owners, something a hypothetical replacement might not be willing to do.\u201cIn an industry as complicated as ours, with fans, media, owners and players, you have to have someone who understands the league\u2019s business,\u201d another owner said. \u201cYou need to understand each owner\u2019s personality, understand the process and understand how to get votes.\u201dStill, several owners said that they have protected themselves in case Goodell falters. They structured his contract so that 90 percent of his compensation is based on financial and nonfinancial goals, and the members of three influential committees made up of about 20 owners will decide whether he meets the targets.According to several owners, Goodell has already said that he will not seek another contract beyond 2024, when he will be 65. Grooming a successor, or searching for one outside the league\u2019s Park Avenue headquarters, will be one of his chief responsibilities. One owner added that Goodell may leave after a new labor deal is struck or the league\u2019s broadcast contracts are renewed, and not finish his contract.\u201cI think there is a limit to how many years you should serve in this,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared and ready to go.\u201dAt the very least, the fight over Goodell\u2019s contract and his leadership skills has forced the owners to openly discuss the league\u2019s future, another owner said. With the contract dispute seemingly resolved, the owners are confronting the far more complex and daunting tasks ahead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Australian Debut Brings Excitement, Dread and Defiance", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut people who posted on social media about Amazon\u2019s debut were generally underwhelmed, with prospective Australian customers playfully pointing out lackluster product offerings and uncompetitive pricing.One New York Times reporter spotted a pair of shoes listed in the website\u2019s cookware section, a sign of the site\u2019s growing pains.Some compared Amazon\u2019s unremarkable Australian debut with that of another digital giant: Netflix. When that service arrived in Australia in 2015, it offered a notably leaner offering of its streaming-on-demand product, especially in comparison with its American lineup.However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s early days \u2014 it\u2019s Day 1,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. \u201cAs you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you\u2019ll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there.\u201dMr. O\u2019Leary pointed out that at Amazon\u2019s debut, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers \u2014 or third-party vendors \u2014 who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon\u2019s formula of providing large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices.As the number of sellers increases \u2014 and the company\u2019s pricing algorithm takes hold \u2014 its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said.Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon\u2019s entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions.\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to adjust to anything,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in business now for 56 years. I\u2019ve always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I\u2019ll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don\u2019t follow them.\u201dAustralians spend less on the internet than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market.Mr. O\u2019Leary, who has studied Amazon\u2019s impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company\u2019s product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to out-Amazon Amazon \u2014 well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering.

{"Headline": "Free Your Mind? \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Isn\u2019t Too Hopeful", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe following essay includes plot points for episodes of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d including Season 4, which arrived on Dec. 29 on Netflix.In the beginning, there was a rock. Pretty soon, someone got bashed in the head with it. Not long after that, someone fashioned a stone knife. Bronze, iron, steel: knife, knife, knife.Since the series began in 2011, its anxieties have evolved. \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d was first concerned about media, in episodes like \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d (in which kidnappers coerce the British prime minister into having sex with a pig on live TV) and \u201cThe Waldo Moment\u201d (a crude cartoon character runs for office). Then it focused on internet culture, in \u201cNosedive\u201d (about a society in which one\u2019s welfare is tied to one\u2019s online popularity) and \u201cHated in the Nation\u201d (a parable about social-media mobs).In Season 4, Mr. Brooker has turned his dark imagination to the digitization of consciousness itself \u2014 what people will do with, and to, human minds that have been rendered into zeros and ones.Unsurprisingly, Mr. Brooker is not optimistic. Where some futurists might see the potential for immortality or richly augmented brains, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d sees the opportunity for people to commit their usual cruelty and selfishness, creatively and in perpetuity.Season 4 references that technology \u2014 \u201cwhen they upload old people into the cloud\u201d \u2014 in \u201cBlack Museum.\u201d But in this episode, it\u2019s a horror show: Rolo Haynes (Douglas Hodge), the proprietor of a museum of curiosities, turns out to be a perpetrator of cyber atrocities.Finally, Rolo captures the consciousness of a death-row inmate, charging museum visitors to \u201celectrocute\u201d his hologram. As a souvenir, they get to take home \u201ca conscious sentient snapshot\u201d of the prisoner, \u201ca true conscious copy of his mind perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain.\u201dThe sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke coined the law \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u201d Fittingly, Mr. Brooker\u2019s episodes are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from supernatural horror tales. They warn that while the pain of physical weapons ended with the release of death, giving people power over eternal consciousness would turn ordinary sadists into digital Satans.Every episode of the new season involves artificial consciousness or cyborg technology; over and over, probes, implants and needles interface with the human temple. Even the season\u2019s simplest tale, the lean thriller \u201cMetalhead,\u201d involves artificially intelligent \u201cdog\u201d robots \u2014 possibly related to an apocalypse that seems to have ended most human life \u2014 hunting people as prey.So if science makes it possible to render people\u2019s thoughts, their perceptions, their very selves into code, someone will figure out how to control them. In \u201cCrocodile,\u201d a device that seems like a boon to crime fighting \u2014 it shows a raw video feed of people\u2019s memories \u2014 is used by a criminal to find and kill an investigator\u2019s family.Even in the lighthearted romance \u201cHang the DJ,\u201d we learn that the characters we have hoped would fall in love are simulations in a dating app, conscious code that feels heartbreak over and over so that a couple on another plane of existence (ours?) can experience 99.8 percent foolproof love.Sometimes, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d suggests, people will abuse technology out of love. In \u201cArkangel,\u201d it\u2019s the misguided love of Marie (Rosemarie DeWitt), who has a surveillance implant placed in the head of her toddler daughter, Sara, then uses it to spy on her as she becomes a rebellious teen (Brenna Harding).The technology is fanciful: Marie can track Sara, see through her eyes, even adjust the settings so Sara perceives frightening images as pixelated blurs. But its attractions are familiar to any parent who\u2019s used tech to monitor a child, to filter her media experience, to keep her safe. \u201cArkangel\u201d is a bit of a melodramatic after-school special, but it\u2019s rooted in the fear at the heart of raising a child.The technology that protects Sara robs her of the developmental experience of processing unpleasant events, the ability to make and learn from her own mistakes. As Sara\u2019s teacher says during a lecture, \u201cMoral responsibility implies the existence of free will,\u201d a gift that Marie has denied her growing daughter. The next step from helicopter parenting is hacker parenting.The season\u2019s most explicit story of digital enslavement is its longest and most ambitious: \u201cU.S.S. Callister,\u201d written by Mr. Brooker and William Bridges. It also manages to be the best reconception of \u201cStar Trek\u201d in a year that also gave us \u201cThe Orville\u201d and the actual prequel, \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201dIt starts with an ingenious bait-and-switch. The opening, a campy sendup of the original \u201cStar Trek,\u201d turns out to be a virtual-reality simulation, created by Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons), a socially inept coding wizard who\u2019s an outcast at the very company he founded.The premise that the setup suggests, a Walter Mitty fantasy story about a sympathetic loser, is also a fake-out. Daly has created a private VR universe populated by conscious, subservient versions of his own company\u2019s staff \u2014 destined to obey his whims forever \u2014 whom he terrorizes and tortures, men and women alike, with his godlike powers.When a new employee, Nanette (Cristin Milioti), shuns him after the office whisper network informs her that he\u2019s \u201cstare-y,\u201d he adds her as a new character, outfitted in a 1960s miniskirt. Her digital version externalizes Daly\u2019s stunted sexuality; his swaggering captain character compels kisses from his female crew members, but they, and the men, have no genitalia. They\u2019re the smooth-crotched virtual action figures for an omnipotent, overgrown preteen.\u201cU.S.S. Callister\u201d allows you a glimpse of the way Daly sees himself \u2014 as the decent guy who can\u2019t get the girl, before you see him as a predatory schlemiel-monster. This story of virtual workplace harassment is unnervingly timely, but it also captures an ugliness that\u2019s been percolating in digital culture for a while.Daly personifies a familiar figure: the Gamergate warrior, the social-media men\u2019s-rights troll. His character touches at the curdled heart of modern misogyny \u2014 the pickup-artist mind-set that gamifies sex, the grievance that \u201cnice guys\u201d are entitled to women\u2019s attention, the craving by poorly socialized men to interact with programmable pawns rather than complex people.\u201cU.S.S. Callister\u201d inverts this idea by having its tech-bro channel his resentment into fashioning his own personal matrix. (Mr. Brooker has hinted at the marriage of technology and misogyny before; \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d and \u201cBlack Museum\u201d involve a man employing absolute power over a woman in cookie form.)\u201cU.S.S. Callister\u201d ends with Daly\u2019s defeat, as the digitized Nanette pulls off an \u201cInception\u201d-like ruse by blackmailing her flesh-and-blood self into helping her. But that makes the episode no less disturbing. Daly may have lost, and his technology may be a fiction. But creeps like him are very real, and so is their impulse to use the latest tools to make hell a place on earth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is a Trivia App the Answer to Questions About Live Streaming?", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are heady times for the creators of HQ Trivia.The app, which broadcasts live shows to iPhones and iPads twice a day, has taken off since its debut in August. Its ability to attract tens of thousands of people to log in for each 15-minute segment in hopes of winning money by answering a dozen trivia questions has some wondering if it has reimagined the TV game show for the cord-cutting era.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of attention on us now because this thing has blown up overnight practically,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said in an interview. \u201cWe have ambitions to essentially build the future of TV, and, yeah \u2014 there is a lot of pressure to get everything right all the time, and I admit that I made a mistake.\u201dThe show, which can be glitchy, is typically hosted by an energetic comedian, Scott Rogowsky, who cracks jokes as he asks a dozen multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty. Players use their touch screens to respond in less than 10 seconds, and the app shows how many people are eliminated after each round. Players can also share their reactions via a rapid-fire chat function at the bottom of the screen.Early questions tend to be on the easier side, like: \u201cWhich president is featured on the U.S. one dollar bill?\u201d Those who answer all the questions correctly share in a prize that has fluctuated between hundreds and thousands of dollars and is distributed via PayPal.Mr. Kroll, a Twitch fan, said that much of what people knew as live video from apps like Twitter\u2019s Periscope lacked a sense of urgency and participation.\u201cThere\u2019s a point-of-view live, where you\u2019re experiencing something through someone else\u2019s phone, and then there\u2019s this idea of interactive video, where the audience is actually a key component of driving the content,\u201d he said. \u201cI became really interested in the latter and saw there was a real absence in the market of that sort of experience.\u201d\u201cWe schedule our lives, but the apps on our phones have been designed to make content available anytime, anywhere,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. \u201cWe suffer from the paradox of choice ultimately \u2014 you search Netflix for 20 minutes and end up watching nothing.\u201dMr. Kroll added that HQ\u2019s schedule was inspiring people to play with co-workers in the afternoon and again with family and friends in the evening, making it more akin to a broadcast TV program.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit trite to say, but things grow because they\u2019re fun,\u201d said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners. \u201cThis is way more fun than playing a quiz game on your phone and way more fun than watching \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 on TV.\u201dStill, whether HQ can turn its sudden popularity into a long-term business is an open question. Could it ultimately serve as a blueprint for bigger tech companies that have been looking for ways to drum up interest in live video content? Mr. Kroll and Mr. Yusupov were hesitant to share details around how they produce the show and what, if any, parts of HQ could be patented. They also declined to disclose the number of people they employ.\u201cI learned what I do know, and that\u2019s apps and engineers and designers, and I learned what I don\u2019t know, which is how to work with talent and celebrities,\u201d Mr. Yusupov said. He added that the company had since hired a public relations representative and a person to manage talent.The men said that HQ had been approached by a bevy of ad agencies and chief marketing officers but that they were still determining how sponsorships could be worked into the app. Mr. Yusupov said brands could potentially fund the prizes, adding that a goal was offering a $1 million prize.Mr. Liew said he was confident in the start-up and its eventual business plan even as he expected other companies to mimic what HQ Trivia had done.\u201cYou have to let time talk and figure out how people are interacting and using something before you have clarity with a business model,\u201d he said. More important, he added, \u201cif you can become part of popular culture, you can figure out a way to make money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Disney Deal Expected to Value Fox at Around $40 a Share", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 Disney\u2019s pursuit of Fox is nearing its conclusion.\u2022 The Fed still projects three rate increases next year.\u2022 How will Doug Jones\u2019s election affect the Trump agenda?\u2022 But Mr. Jones\u2019s arrival probably won\u2019t affect the tax bill.Reuters reports:Walt Disney Co\u2019s deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday.That\u2019s the answer to the main question investors had ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy statement on Wednesday.Despite its improved outlook for the economy, the Fed remains cautious about raising rates too quickly. Two officials \u2014 Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2014 voted against Wednesday\u2019s rate hike. The reason? Concerns about inflation.Fed officials predicted that inflation would stay below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target next year, and then stay at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Those were unchanged from September.Here\u2019s how Wall Street economists reacted:\u2022 Republicans will have a harder time passing legislation \u2014 from infrastructure spending to potential cuts to programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 with a Senate majority of just one seat.\u2022 The Republican Party may split further between establishment figures like Mitch McConnell and dissidents in the vein of Mr. Moore whose allegiance aligns more closely alongside President Trump and shaking up the status quo.\u2022 Democrats now have a more plausible, though still difficult, path to regaining a majority in the Senate.The likely changes\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 21 percent, slightly higher than what lawmakers had originally proposed\u2022 A slight lowering of the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent\u2022 Limiting the mortgage deduction to loans of up to $750,000, a compromise on levels set in the House and in the Senate proposalsWhat still needs work\u2022 Whether to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax\u2022 A resolution on the estate tax\u2022 How to treat state and local tax deductions.The tax flyaround\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dWhat was still being hammered out as of yesterday\u2022 The price that Disney would pay for the Fox businesses it would acquire\u2022 What role, if any, James Murdoch would take at Disney\u2022 What sort of protections the companies would need in case antitrust authorities raise objectionsThe F.C.C. is expected to vote tomorrow on rolling back the regulations. But Facebook, Google and their peers have been noticeably quiet. Why? They\u2019re already on the defensive on other issues.\u201cWith the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations.\u201dAndrew writes:If that\u2019s true, it means that employee cuts would be even more severe than I had anticipated. About 12,000 people would lose their jobs, more than the number of people Qualcomm employs at its headquarters.Why did the SEC call up Munchee and cause it to shut down? \u201cBecause Munchee was making reckless and unsupported claims about incredible returns that deceived investors and separated little old ladies from their hard-earned retirement ether,\u201d you might assume, but you\u2019d be wrong.Critics\u2019 corner Lumped together, the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and others in lower-, mid- and senior-level management positions in the financial sector increased from 17 percent to 21 percent in the period.Before diversity advocates cheer, they should read on.

Let us help you. For the week of Dec. 24, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed:In \u201cArkangel,\u201d directed by Jodie Foster and starring Rosemarie Dewitt, an overprotective mother has her daughter\u2019s mind uploaded onto an app that allows her to filter her child\u2019s experiences. In \u201cHang the DJ,\u201d directed by Timothy Van Patten and starring Georgina Campbell and Joe Cole, a dating service provides its users with a stream of prospects until they make their perfect match.It\u2019s been a whirlwind couple of months for \u201cThe Hip Hop Nutcracker,\u201d and not just because of the spins, flips and other break dancing tricks that ignite this boisterous reimagining of the holiday classic.If the skier Molly Bloom had made it down the slope as planned, the next stop might have been the Olympics. Instead, a freak collision with a pine bough resulted in a crash-and-burn and set into motion the events that led to her christening as the Poker Princess.In \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d opening Christmas Day, Aaron Sorkin adapts Ms. Bloom\u2019s 2014 memoir and, in his directorial debut, follows her up the money mountain as she lures Hollywood stars, pro athletes and Russian mobsters into high-stakes poker games \u2014 and then gets busted by the F.B.I.Jessica Chastain, who earned a Golden Globe nomination for playing the whip smart Molly, brandishes Mr. Sorkin\u2019s rat-a-tat dialogue in verbal duels with Kevin Costner, as her psychologist father; Michael Cera, as a celebrity card shark; and Idris Elba, as her defense attorney, who can\u2019t understand why she doesn\u2019t take the government\u2019s deal \u2014 and the $4 million it confiscated from her.Phish played Madison Square Garden for the first time on Dec. 30, 1994.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Mosaic\u2019 is a Frustrating Soderbergh Story, Some Assembly Required", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of it raises the question: What the hell is TV anymore?\u201cMosaic,\u201d the latest \u2014 work? \u2014 from the director Steven Soderbergh, will not settle that. But it complicates the issue in some interesting ways.The story, in short: Olivia Lake (Sharon Stone), a famous children\u2019s author, goes missing from her Utah mountain home, and her lover, Eric (Frederick Weller) is jailed for her murder. Four years later, Eric\u2019s sister, Petra (Jennifer Ferrin), shows up to try to clear Eric\u2019s name, her amateur investigation drawing in Joel (Garrett Hedlund), Olivia\u2019s former boarder, and Nate (Devin Ratray), a local cop who worked the original case.As a mystery, \u201cMosaic,\u201d directed by Mr. Soderbergh and written by Ed Solomon, is sleek-looking but sluggish, burdened by flat characters. But as an investigation of what stories are and how we assemble them in our minds, the app is fascinating, if not ultimately successful.It would be a mistake to call \u201cMosaic\u201d a choose-your-own-adventure. Instead, you choose a path \u2014 which parts of the story you see and from whose point-of-view. You have to watch one segment before you unlock new alternatives. You\u2019re advancing along a flowchart, illustrated by a \u201cmap\u201d built in to the app. You can go back, but you can\u2019t skip forward.So what\u2019s the correct way to watch? Should you keep advancing, accepting that there are portions of the story you will never see? That was my instinct: After the beginning, I mostly followed Petra as she delved into her brother\u2019s past.From there, the interactivity consisted of doubling back to see which unexplored pockets make the story fuller \u2014 and honestly, make it better. I prefer that to be the artist\u2019s job. I felt, at times, as if Mr. Soderbergh had dumped a bunch of reels of film on my desk and said, \u201cHere. You edit it.\u201d (His own cut for HBO will run about five hours.)Going back, I saw that the route I randomly chose largely excised Olivia. She was more of a presence in the other throughlines, but they followed a plot that I had mostly watched unfold and couldn\u2019t un-see.The effect was like rereading a novel I had skimmed. Over and over, I saw multiple takes of the same scenes. I met a few new characters; some previously puzzling points made more sense. I was getting more information. But I wasn\u2019t getting more invested.Maybe the cold, flat-affect execution of this particular tale kept me from engaging with the characters. But maybe we\u2019re wired to receive linear stories \u2014 this and this and this and done \u2014 for a reason.The other novelty in \u201cMosaic\u201d is that every so often a \u201cdiscovery\u201d \u2014 a video clip, a voicemail, a PDF image \u2014 pops up in the timeline to add context or further information. You can read a news story that\u2019s been referenced or watch a past conversation between characters.Sometimes a \u201cdiscovery\u201d adds key information, other times just texture. But it always appears smack in the midst of a scene, which you have to pause in order to open the discovery and find out what it is. If you\u2019ve always thought TV would be better with footnotes, I suppose this is for you.\u201cMosaic\u201d is not a game, but the experience is gameified. The discoveries are like cut-scenes from an old-school CD-ROM, and navigating the narrative through the map felt a little like playing one of those hypnotic smartphone games that divides the play into chapters.I was surprised how closely focused the app kept me. I wasn\u2019t tempted to surf Twitter on my iPhone when I was already watching something on my iPhone. And Mr. Soderbergh seems to have thoughtfully filmed \u201cMosaic\u201d with an eye toward how it will play on a tiny screen, framing his characters with plenty of tight shots.But the constant expectation of interaction \u2014 waiting for a \u201cdiscovery\u201d to pop up, for a decision to present itself \u2014 made me feel alert more than immersed. There was a constant low-grade tension of waiting for the call of duty.For all that, I\u2019m glad that Mr. Soderbergh tried it. Even a misfired experiment can advance the form. In 2003, the director took a flyer on HBO\u2019s \u201cK Street,\u201d a semi-improv political satire shot within days of its air date. It was better in concept than execution, but its mockumentary style has since become familiar on TV.And as an R&D project, there\u2019s hardware in \u201cMosaic\u201d that I could imagine stripped out and applied to the machinery of other fiction.At one point, \u201cMosaic\u201d nods at its own gimmicky nature. The children\u2019s book that made Olivia famous had a twist, too: Read it front to back and it\u2019s the story of a hunter chasing a scary bear, but flip the book over and it\u2019s the story of a bear defending itself from a scary hunter.Neat concept, right? So is \u201cMosaic.\u201d It\u2019s just waiting for the right story.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Inside the Opposition to a Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the founders, Tiffiniy Cheng and Holmes Wilson, have pushed the group\u2019s 1.8 million supporters to flood social media sites with warnings about how the change could favor big companies and hurt smaller ones. They have also supplied online tools to their followers, like one that makes it easier to call lawmakers and another to file comments directly to the Federal Communications Commission, the agency considering the repeal.For next week, just ahead of the agency\u2019s vote on the proposal, they have organized hundreds of internet companies to alter their websites \u2014 slowing them down, for example \u2014 to show what online experiences could be like without the rules.\u201cWe believe people care about this enough to take a stand,\u201d Ms. Cheng, 37, said while sitting inside the house, nearly surrounded in a tiny office by bookshelves stocked with medieval literature.But Mr. Pai and his two Republican colleagues have committed to passing the proposal at the agency\u2019s meeting next Thursday, in what would be a 3-to-2 party-line vote. Mr. Pai, who was nominated as chairman by President Trump, has said that the rules are unnecessary and that market forces would prevent internet service providers, like AT&T and Verizon, from blocking or slowing sites.\u201cWe want to raise the political costs on this issue,\u201d Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, said. \u201cWe want members of Congress to think of this as a third-rail issue that they have to support or else they will suffer in their elections.\u201dThe protests on Thursday mostly took place outside stores run by Verizon, where Mr. Pai used to work as a lawyer. At a strip mall in Shoreline, Wash., just north of Seattle, about 18 protesters turned up on a cold, sunny morning outside a Verizon store between a Costco and a teriyaki restaurant.Shasta Willson, a web developer who lives in Shoreline, said she ran a small literature publishing business and was concerned that the loss of net neutrality could turn the internet into something more like cable television, where access to certain online services are sold as part of content packages.\u201cI feel like this is the most important issue going on,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s some crazy stuff going on, but if we lose net neutrality you might not hear about any of it.\u201dIn the shadow of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, 15 to 20 protesters chanted, \u201cSave the net\u201d and \u201cFree speech, equal access.\u201d Although demonstrators said they knew the rule change would almost certainly happen next week, they were hopeful that their actions could generate enough last-minute attention to bring about a reversal.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rear-guard action,\u201d one of the protesters, Maxine Rockoff, 79, said. \u201cBut I hope if we protest across the country, the folks in Congress will recognize it was a bad decision.\u201dFight for the Future was started in 2011 by Ms. Cheng and Mr. Holmes, friends from a math and science high school in Worcester. The two initially got $800,000 in seed funding from the Media Democracy Fund, a grant organization focused on media and telecommunication issues, to fight a bill meant to stop the piracy of movies and music online.The friends, who had long fought for artists\u2019 rights and free-speech issues, saw the bill, known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, as a way for big Hollywood studios to control the internet. They helped organize online protests, coordinating with hundreds of websites, including Wikipedia and Reddit, which went offline at the same time and raised broad awareness of action in Washington on an arcane legislative issue. The bipartisan bill, widely expected to pass, was killed after a public outcry.In 2015, the group used many of the same tactics to support the net neutrality rules that were passed.\u201cThey were so creative and brought something totally different to activism,\u201d said Marvin Ammori, the general counsel for Hyperloop One, a high-speed transportation start-up, and a board member of Fight for the Future.Fight for the Future is now has an annual operating budget of $1.5 million, a chief technology officer and staff dispersed around the globe. The Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, venture capitalists such as Brad Feld of Foundry Group and entrepreneurs like Craig Newmark of Craigslist.org support the group financially.The group does not take money from the biggest tech companies. Its biggest Silicon Valley donors include the search engine DuckDuckGo, which donated $25,000, and the reviews site Yelp, which donated $10,000 last year.Of the 23 million comments filed to the F.C.C. about net neutrality this year, two million were through a site that Fight for the Future helped run. The group said its tools allowed people to make more than 800,000 calls to Congress and 6.7 million emails to lawmakers.The potential repeal outraged Lesley Perg, a 44-year-old adult education instructor in St. Paul. She heard of Mr. Pai\u2019s plan in July and submitted her name, email and phone number to BattlefortheNet.com, a site run by Fight for the Future and its partners to see how she could fight back. She is among more than 1,500 volunteers, and for weeks she has put in four to eight hours a week in training organizers of demonstrations and congressional office visits.\u201cNet neutrality underlies everything I care about,\u201d said Ms. Perg, an avid knitter who is deeply involved with knitting communities online. \u201cEven though Pai has three votes, we need to put Congress in a tough spot and to prepare for this to go to the courts. This is a long game.\u201dThe group\u2019s approach has also attracted criticism.In August, Fight for the Future and the other groups put up billboards in the districts of three Republican House leaders that said the lawmakers had sold out to big internet service providers with their support of the F.C.C. plan. The three were Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who heads a communications subcommittee; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader; and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cI think it is really unfortunate that this issue has been politicized,\u201d said Dan Lyons, an associate professor at the Boston College Law School. \u201cThis is a dry admin law debate: Is antitrust sufficient to control broadband providers and, if not, will additional prophylactic rules do more harm than good to innovation?\u201dIn an interview, Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner at the F.C.C., said, \u201cThere is a lot of misinformation out there.\u201dEvan Greer, a director for Fight for the Future, said that to get members of Congress to speak out in favor of the issue, the group needed to deploy a range of efforts to make the government officials uncomfortable.\u201cBacklash is our middle name,\u201d she said.Last week, as Mr. Pai was giving speeches that mocked celebrities like Cher and Alyssa Milano for criticizing his proposal, the group was gearing up for a big online protest set for just before the vote. It needed to make net neutrality something that millions more Americans could care about.On a Google hangout, its leaders, designers and political directors were in a heated debate about their protest slogan. Even minute details, like the font they would use and the color on a banner meant to be shared on sites like Twitter and Facebook, drew pointed discussion.Even after several years promoting net neutrality, it was clear that their enthusiasm was undiminished. One design lit up Ms. Cheng.The design, she exclaimed, made her think: \u201cWe can stop the F.C.C.!\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting from Shoreline, Wash., and Zach Wichter from New York.Advertisement"}

If it is controlled, my generation of students could be inclined to be just on one part of the spectrum. That\u2019s dangerous.\u201dThe repeal of net neutrality has gotten many of these teens politically engaged for the first time, with fears that the dismantling of rules could open the door for broadband providers like AT&T and Comcast to distort the experience of accessing anything online with equal ease. For them, a dry issue that has often been hard to understand outside of policy circles in Washington has become a cause to rally around.\u201cFor students that have used an internet that is open and without tolls their whole life, as complicated as net neutrality is, kids can get their heads around it pretty easily,\u201d said John Lewis, the head of Gunston School, a private high school in Centreville, Md.Many became digital users when net neutrality was in effect. Net neutrality has existed in various forms since about 2006, when the F.C.C. first created open internet guidelines for broadband providers known as the \u201cFour Internet Freedoms.\u201d In 2015, the F.C.C. declared that broadband had become utility-like and deserved extra government oversight. Since 2006, more and more children began using Netflix, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube and all manner of other apps and online services.Alli Webb, 18, a senior at Gunston, missed school last week ahead of the F.C.C. vote with permission from Mr. Lewis and her parents. With three other students, she drove two hours to downtown Washington to stand in front of a Verizon store during lunch hour. There, she hollered slogans to save net neutrality rules with signs that read \u201cStop F.C.C.!\u201d and \u201cEqual Opportunity: Still Loading.\u201dAt Southside High School in Rockville Centre, N.Y., net neutrality dominated conversation in the lunchroom last week and throughout the day of the vote, last Thursday as students checked for updates.\u201cI\u2019ve met lots of friends on Instagram and I communicate with my mom and with all my friends at least 10 times a day on social media,\u201d said Matthew Baxley, 15, a 10th grader who recently participated in a texting effort to protest the repeal. \u201cThe internet is at the center of a lot of what I do and care about.\u201dSome teachers had to make adjustments. Laurie Crowe, a high school history teacher in Kyle, Tex., tried to give an exam to 11th graders at Lehman High School last Thursday but couldn\u2019t get her students off their phones and laptops. She was surprised to find them streaming the F.C.C. vote. Eventually, she postponed the exam so they could watch the five commissioners cast their votes and explain their positions.When the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, cast the final vote to dismantle the rules, students slammed their laptops shut and tore off their earphones in disappointment, Ms. Crowe said.\u201cThese kids felt very indignant and betrayed by this decision because they feel entitled to information and the internet,\u201d she said.Ms. Dasari remains determined to fight. She said she would continue to push lawmakers to salvage open internet rules through legislation and she is following the news for lawsuits challenging the repeal.\u201cI will tweet and email and call and stay in the process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have time and we won\u2019t go away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Deal for 21st Century Fox Is Said to Be Close", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDisney was closing in Tuesday on an all-stock transaction to cleave out most of the assets of 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the Murdoch family, with an agreement possibly coming as soon as Thursday, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks \u2014 now down to the final details \u2014 were private.\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dThat would leave Mr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox with three properties: Fox News, the relatively young FS1 cable sports channel, and a broadcasting unit formed by the Fox network and local TV stations. His plans for those operations were unclear, but almost all of them involve news, a business that has long been dear to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s heart. Analysts have suggested that they could be combined with the family\u2019s newspaper-focused company, News Corporation.Disney did not respond to queries on Tuesday. A Fox spokesman declined to comment.Behind Disney\u2019s interest in a deal is a zealous effort to dramatically lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable and satellite subscriptions that surged for the last two decades but is now in decline. Instead, Disney has begun pivoting toward what it sees as a new growth engine: subscription streaming services that bring its movies and TV shows directly to consumers. Disney\u2019s first major streaming effort, ESPN Plus, will arrive in the spring. A second and still-unnamed offering, built around the company\u2019s Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar brands, will roll out late next year.Disney has sought the 21st Century Fox assets to bolster those efforts and add a third service to its streaming portfolio. That would be Hulu, which focuses on older viewers with programming that includes ABC shows and original programming like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Disney, which already has a stake in the service, would own about 60 percent of Hulu if it completes the deal with 21st Century Fox.By self-distributing content in a major way, Disney would help fortify itself against competition from Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Google. Those companies have built online entertainment operations that have become wildly popular, particularly with the young viewers coveted by Disney.Netflix has shrugged off the loss of Disney content by noting that it has aggressively moved toward making its own movies and shows. Next year, it will spend an estimated $7 billion on original programming. A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox would be another matter entirely, dwarfing Mr. Iger\u2019s previous deals and creating complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney management.The Murdochs were not seen as sellers as recently as October. \u201cThis potential about-face is startling,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.One question that has not been resolved, and may not be by the time a deal is announced, is whether James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s younger son and the current chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney. Were he to do so \u2014 and leave the family business \u2014 the younger Mr. Murdoch could potentially oversee the international broadcast operations, one of the people briefed on the matter said, though negotiations over any such role were still under review. Disney insiders have downplayed speculation that he could eventually take the chief executive reins from Mr. Iger.Though Comcast had also vied for 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets, the cable giant never gained as much traction. In a statement on Monday, Comcast conceded that it was out of the running. \u201cWe never got the level of engagement needed to make a definitive offer,\u201d the company said.A deal between Comcast and Fox could have posed antitrust issues, especially at a time when the Justice Department has sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. A deal with Disney was seen as potentially posing fewer problems, but deal makers have said that little is certain in the current regulatory environment.Analysts said that Disney\u2019s two biggest governmental hurdles would most likely involve the regional sports networks, which would add to ESPN\u2019s dominance, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio, which employs 3,200 people and has been controlled by Mr. Murdoch since 1985. Together, Disney and Fox last year controlled about 40 percent of the movie tickets sold in the United StatesBrooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix and Spotify Ask: Can Data Mining Make for Cute Ads?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe tweet was meant to be an entertaining jab at a cheesy holiday film that the company released last month. But while many saw the humor, others were creeped out by the specificity of the information, with some complaining that Netflix appeared to be using its data in a flip manner that mocked some customers.This is amazing. Except for the \u201cwatching us like big brother \u201c part ;)It\u2019s no secret that companies, especially those born in the digital age, are amassing deep and detailed troves of information on the habits and preferences of their consumers. For streaming services, that data fuels the recommendations. But companies are also taking a bit of a risk when they turn those findings into marketing, whether through conversational social media posts or advertisements from Spotify with lines like \u201cTake a page from the 3,445 people who streamed the \u2018Boozy Brunch\u2019 playlist on a Wednesday this year.\u201dA message that one person might see as clever and unexpected can just as easily be seen by another as an ominous reminder that Big Data is often lurking just around the corner.\u201cThis gives the public a kind of view into the ways that the major content companies are gathering and using our data,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, head of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, which advocates for consumer protection and privacy. \u201cBehind the ease of being able to access video and audio content are very sophisticated customer surveillance and analytics applications, and there\u2019s nothing funny about that.\u201dOthers scoffed at such concern last week, saying Netflix\u2019s joke was harmless and noting that people were complaining on a social media platform that engages in similar data collection practices.Spotify is in the midst of its third ad campaign featuring tag lines rooted in highly specific listener data. (Indeed, several people called Netflix out for seeming to copy Spotify with its post.) The music streaming service recently bought ads on billboards and buildings with a marketing message built around the theme \u201c2018 Goals,\u201d with cheeky messages that sometimes have a political bent.\u201cDeliver burns as well as the person who streamed \u2018Bad Liar\u2019 86 times the day Sean Spicer resigned,\u201d one proclaims. Another says, \u201cEat vegan brisket with the person who made a playlist called \u2018Leftist Elitist Snowflake BBQ.\u2019\u201dSpotify\u2019s marketing executives said last year that they avoided lines that appeared to be laughing at people\u2019s habits in favor of those that celebrated unusual behavior. They also said they sought permission from people when using their playlist names in ads. The people were usually delighted to be asked, the executive said, who noted that the data collection wasn\u2019t a surprise given that that\u2019s how Spotify provides users with its weekly recommendations and year-end lists.People and publications such as AdWeek and AdAge called the campaign \u201camusing,\u201d \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201chilarious.\u201d While that has largely continued this year, there has also been criticism that some of the messages veer too close to making fun of users.And the Netflix hubbub didn\u2019t seem to help.Netflix, which has more than 100 million members, emphasized that the use of data to better serve users was a main part of its business and that its behavioral data was collected anonymously.The company has frequently shared interesting information about viewers\u2019 habits in the past, said Jonathan Friedland, a Netflix spokesman. He added that last week\u2019s tweet might have inspired an intense reaction in part because \u201cit was brought down to an individual level as opposed to a broader trend level.\u201d But he pointed out that Netflix does not use customer data to sell ads on its platform, as Google and Facebook do, or sell it to other entities.Tidbits on Netflix viewing habits are \u201cfascinating to people,\u201d Mr. Friedland said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re breaching anybody\u2019s privacy, because the core proposition here is we know you and try to put the right\u201d films and TV series in front of you.Advertisement"}

Because he\u2019s divorced \u2014 a deal breaker for the Church of England, which is inextricably linked to the monarchy \u2014 Elizabeth can\u2019t give them her permission to wed.To complicate matters, the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 prevents Margaret from marrying without her sister\u2019s blessing until she turns 25. So, the royal family keeps the couple separated (and out of the tabloids) by sending Peter to Brussels for two years of government busywork, and Elizabeth gives Margaret her word that she won\u2019t stand in the way of the marriage if they wait.To complicate matters, the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 prevents Margaret from marrying without her sister\u2019s blessing until she turns 25.

Philip hates that his wife wields more power than he does, and he spends the early years of her reign soothing his sore ego with masculine pastimes like flying planes. They fight constantly, but as a wrenching argument from Episode 9 reveals, Elizabeth still loves him.At one point in the finale, Margaret commiserates with Elizabeth\u2019s husband, Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh (Matt Smith), over the queen\u2019s perceived callousness toward the two of them.

Near the end of Season 1, Anthony Eden (Jeremy Northam) replaces Churchill as prime minister and inherits a diplomatic nightmare. Britain is dependent on oil supplies that must travel through the Suez Canal in Egypt, where Gamal Abdel Nasser (Amir Boutrous) and his revolutionary forces have recently overthrown the monarchy. Nasser and Eden famously hated each other. In the finale, we watch the prime minister recount to Elizabeth his many awkward, failed attempts to court the volatile leader\u2019s favor. Nasser became Egypt\u2019s president and nationalized the canal in 1956, and Eden retaliated with an ill-conceived invasion that went down in history as the Suez Crisis.Meanwhile, on the international stage, tensions are ramping up in the Middle East.

{"Headline": "Review: With \u2018Dark,\u2019 Netflix Delivers Science Fiction With European Roots", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 10-episode series, Netflix\u2019s first German production, is a multigenerational science-fiction-and-horror tale set in a small town in the shadow of a mysterious installation, in this case a nuclear power plant. It involves children who go missing in other dimensions, nighttime searches, underground passages and an elaborate hand-drawn map. The surface similarities to Netflix\u2019s American-made hit \u201cStranger Things\u201d are strong.Along the same lines, it has a lot of voice-over philosophizing about what turns out to be its major theme: time travel. Simple ideas about fate and determinism are worked out at great length and in complicated ways that will appeal to those who like their sci-fi on the heavy side.Indeed, one of the major challenges of watching \u201cDark\u201d is simply keeping track of who\u2019s who in a story that jumps among three timelines (2019, 1986 and 1953) and four families, with many of the main characters played by multiple actors of different ages.At times the series, created by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese, seems to have been constructed with the aid of spreadsheets, but there\u2019s no denying its ingenuity. Beginning with the unexplained suicide of a father in 2019, it moves forward and backward in time, introducing the tangled lives of the residents of the forest town of Winden.Affairs are had, secrets are revealed, and families move up and down in the town\u2019s pecking order, which centers on the nuclear plant. (There\u2019s a strong \u201cDays of Our Half-Lives\u201d soap-opera element.) Lights flicker all over town, and ominous sound and music cues relentlessly pump the suspense. A series of disappearances echoes events from 33 years before, and an intrepid teenager, Jonas (Louis Hofmann, steady at the center of the large cast), sets off into the caverns under the plant to solve the mystery.The lugubrious discussions of fate and circularity are a drawback, unless you like that sort of thing, but the show does have a sense of humor that peeks through occasionally, particularly once the time traveling starts in earnest. In a moment with a touch of \u201cStranger Things\u201d-style self-awareness, Jonas, learning the ropes, is told, \u201cNo DeLorean.\u201dJonas\u2019s search for answers offers the pleasures of puzzle-solving, if not profound drama, and if you give \u201cDark\u201d a few episodes you may find yourself hooked. (You may also wonder whether the idea of cutting off evil influences emanating from the past is a specifically German theme.) Mr. Odar and Ms. Friese seem confident that viewers will sign on \u2014 their finale takes a wild turn that dares Netflix not to give them a second season.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Interview a Celebrity Like a Celebrity", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorge Wayne has a theory about why his celebrity column was a hit at Vanity Fair for more than two decades: sex.\u201cWhen you read my interviews, I want you to have a good laugh and I want you to learn something you didn\u2019t know about these people before,\u201d he said as he dipped his spoon into a bowl of butternut squash soup over lunch in Chelsea recently. \u201cSo, of course, I am always going to ask about sex. That\u2019s my No. 1.\u201dMr. Wayne, 54, was born in Jamaica and earned a degree in journalism from the University of Georgia before moving to New York. In 1984 he started his own magazine, R.O.M.E., a do-it-yourself collection of interviews he photocopied on paper and bound together with tape. He met Andy Warhol and, after the artist died, became an associate editor at Mr. Warhol\u2019s Interview.Later, Mr. Wayne caught the eye of the media scion S. I. Newhouse Jr. and was named one of the first contributing editors at Allure magazine. But it was at Vanity Fair that Mr. Wayne (who calls himself G. W.) found his niche as a celebrity chronicler. \u201cI interviewed Fabio,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was my very first interview at Vanity Fair.\u201dMr. Wayne met a man in Pushkin Square \u2014 a boxer in training, he said \u2014 who he invited to his hotel. The writer decided to stay a few extra days. \u201cMartha Stewart\u2019s jaw dropped,\u201d Mr. Wayne said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why are you staying? Are you kidding me?\u2019\u201d She had a point. Violence erupted in Moscow after Boris Yeltsin, the president, sought to disband the Russian parliament and seize control. \u201cI turned on CNN after having the best sex with this Russian boxer and there is a coup taking place in the country,\u201d Mr. Wayne said.We decided to turn the celebrity tables on Mr. Wayne and ask him some of the same questions he asked notable luminaries, among them Carrie Fisher, Ivanka Trump, Anna Wintour and his old boss at Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter. Many were lifted from \u201cAnyone Who\u2019s Anyone: The Astonishing Celebrity Interviews, 1987-2017,\u201d a collection spanning Mr. Wayne\u2019s 30-year career. We didn\u2019t tell Mr. Wayne until the end of our interview that the questions were his. (His answers are edited for context and space.) And, yes, as you might imagine, we brought up his No. 1 topic.Laura M. Holson: What\u2019s one of the most outrageous rumors you\u2019ve heard about yourself lately? (a question posed to Carrie Fisher)George Wayne: Lately? That I\u2019m drunk. No. I haven\u2019t heard any. I never Google myself. I have no idea. I don\u2019t listen to rumors. So I don\u2019t know. You are asking the wrong person.LH: Have you ever done drugs? (Farrah Fawcett)GW: I\u2019ve dabbled in some things, not everything. Growing up in a country like Jamaica, people think that you smoke marijuana, ganga, like a ganga head. The first time I did marijuana was in college. I think marijuana is the weed of wisdom. It heightens your creative abilities. That is basically what I do. I\u2019ve never tried the hard stuff. I\u2019ve tried Molly once. Ecstasy.LH: Who is the phoniest person in Hollywood? (Joan Rivers)GW: That\u2019s a tough one. Can I think about that and get back to you?LH: No. You have to tell me now.GW: Angelina Jolie. That is just my personal opinion. She is a bit of a phony baloney.LH: Have you ever interviewed her?GW: No, I\u2019ve never interviewed Angelina. After what she did to Brad, really? I\u2019m not buying any of that stuff she said about Brad Pitt.LH: If there is one vice, what would it be? (Ivanka Trump)GW: I love champagne.LH: That\u2019s not a vice.LH: How much time do you spend in front of the mirror each morning? (Fabio)GW: Oh my God. Not very much at all. I take three showers a day. I do. I like to take them all the time. I use Mario Badescu. That, I live by. I don\u2019t get the facials. I get their products. Serums, which I love. And the shaving cream.LH: How big are your arms? (Fabio)GW: My arms are O.K., they aren\u2019t big. I work out. I go to the gym.LH: How is your sex life? (Milton Berle)GW: I\u2019ve been, basically, celibate a long time. I would love to be in a relationship. For some reason I never have sex in New York City. I would love to be in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m very picky.LH: What girls do you think are next in line for the title of world supermodel? (Donatella Versace)GW: Without question, Kaia Gerber. She is exquisite. I saw that full page Omega ad she just did, the campaign for a new watch. She is stunning. She is like her mother, Cindy Crawford, plus more. She is the future. No question.LH: Is it true you write all of your books in longhand? (Jackie Collins)GW: I do. (He pulls out a stack of white paper stapled together.) These are some notes. I save everything. It\u2019s like regular white paper. I cut it. I make little books. So if you come to my apartment, which is the size of this table, you\u2019ll find nothing but filing cabinets and magazines. Filing cabinets with my notes.LH: Tell me a little about your childhood. Was it privileged? (Anna Wintour)GW: Yeah. I was a lucky kid. My parents gave me the best of everything, to be honest. My father worked with a Canadian company, a conglomerate. My mother sold real estate. And she drove a Peugeot. And nobody in Jamaica drove a Peugeot. I went to boarding school. It was called Munro College, where a lot of Rhodes scholars went.I was on the quiz team. We won twice. The quiz competition in Jamaica is a big deal. It is like being on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d All the high schools compete against each other on live television. And it\u2019s a must watch. It\u2019s called the Jamaica \u201cSchools Challenge Quiz.\u201d Four members from each school compete against each other. After we won, I was a super-stud on campus. I was a campus star. They loved me.LH: What do you think about Donald Trump? (Ian Schrager)GW: You know, Hillary Clinton wrote the book, \u201cWhat Happened?\u201d Well, what happened to \u201cThe Donald\u201d? In the golden age when Donald and Ivana were together, he was amazing. Donald was a lot of fun. And I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the strangest thing, what has happened. It\u2019s like watching an ogre metastasize. I\u2019m just thinking a lot of us knew the man who was so fun and so charming, he always had his quirks. Who knew that he would become this Islamaphobic, homophobic racist? I just can\u2019t imagine where this all came from. Is it because of Steve Bannon, who has completely got his mind? It is disappointing to see that.LH: Do you pack heat? (Geraldo Rivera)GW: No. But maybe I should get some mace.LH: Do you watch television? (Milton Berle)GW: I love television. Basically I watch the BBC, to be honest.LH: Are you watching \u201cThe Crown\u201d?GW: You know what? I don\u2019t have Netflix! A friend of mine just sent me the last season of \u201cThe Crown\u201d on my computer, which I am going to watch. To watch Netflix, you have to get a special TV, no?LH: When are you inspired to write your material? (Sandra Bernhard)GW: The funny thing is I like to write at night. I\u2019m a night owl. I like to write when it\u2019s 11 p.m. to about 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. I need my eight hours of sleep. You ask me what my vice is? It\u2019s sleeping. I like to get my beauty rest. I smoke a spliff and then I write.LH: And what will be the title of your memoirs? (Graydon Carter)GW: \u201cSimply George-ous!\u201d May I say, simply gee-ooorge-us!LH: Do you like Edith Piaf or Charo? (Graydon Carter)GW: Edith Piaf! Actually, I like the Pet Shop Boys.LH: What does that have to do with Edith Piaf?GW: Nothing. But I like their music. Edith Piaf is too maudlin for me. I feel like I\u2019m at a dirge. But I don\u2019t like Charo either.LH: Did you think these were good questions?GW: Yeah. For the most part.LH: They were your questions.GW: What? Mine? Are you kidding? I asked those questions over 30 years? You\u2019re good. Oh my God. Do you pack heat? Oh, I love it. Brilliant. I can\u2019t believe it. When did that come to you? That\u2019s funny. But, I\u2019ll tell you one thing. I have a weak bladder. I have to go pee. I\u2019ll come right back.Advertisement"}

Close behind with six apiece were \u201cThe Post,\u201d a Watergate-era drama about the struggles of Katharine Graham to lead The Washington Post, and \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d about a mother (Frances McDormand, a nominee for best actress) who pushes local authorities to investigate her daughter\u2019s murder.All of those films come from 20th Century Fox, which led film companies with 27 nominations, including 15 from its Fox Searchlight specialty label.\u201cAll three come from filmmakers with something important to say \u2014 uncompromised, singular, strong, auteur voices,\u201d said Stacey Snider, Fox\u2019s movie chief. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we have differentiated ourselves as a place for that kind of filmmaking.\u201dThe other nominees for best drama were \u201cDunkirk,\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s World War II epic, and the romance \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d Voters also gave Mr. Nolan a directing nod but unexpectedly disregarded the \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d filmmaker Luca Guadagnino.But timing is everything in show business, and Academy Award voters (some 8,400) cannot help but pay attention to the Globes. The 75th Globes ceremony will be hosted by Seth Meyers and broadcast live on NBC on Jan. 7. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce Oscar nominations on Jan. 23.Among television categories, HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d emerged as the one to beat on Monday, taking six nominations, including for best limited series and all four of its actresses \u2014 Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman in the lead category and Laura Dern and Shailene Woodley in supporting. \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d helped push HBO to 12 total nominations, the most of any television network.The nominations were announced by Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell and Sharon Stone in a pre-dawn presentation at the Beverly Hilton Hotel timed for the East Coast-based morning news shows. The press association handed out Champagne before 5 a.m. Pacific Time to toast the 75th anniversary of the awards.\u201cThe Post\u201d also picked up nominations for its screenplay, written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the score by John Williams.Because the press association gives a prize for best drama and best comedy, Hollywood often looks to directing nominees for clues about what film truly rose to the top at the Globes. Joining Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Nolan and Mr. del Toro were Martin McDonagh, who wrote and directed \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d and Mr. Scott, who abruptly reshot portions of his kidnapping thriller \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d after one of its original stars, Mr. Spacey, became embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal.Mr. Spacey\u2019s replacement, Christopher Plummer, received a nomination for his supporting role. In a surprise, Michelle Williams, who stars in \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d as the desperate mother of J. Paul Getty III, who was kidnapped in 1973, was nominated alongside Ms. Streep, Ms. McDormand and Ms. Hawkins as best dramatic actress. Jessica Chastain (\u201cMolly\u2019s Game\u201d) filled out that category.The press association has worked hard in recent years to jettison its reputation for oddball nominations that were interpreted more as efforts to populate its televised banquet with stars than honor the year\u2019s best performances. The list on Monday contained no outright embarrassments. But there were some nods that assured pretty young faces: Ansel Elgort, an acting nominee for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d for instance.Foreign film nominees were Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d (Cambodia), \u201cA Fantastic Woman\u201d (Chile), \u201cIn the Fade\u201d (Germany and France\u201d) \u201cLoveless\u201d (Russia) and \u201cThe Square\u201d (Sweden, Germany and France).Globes voters like to make agenda-setting choices with their television awards. They paid early attention to \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cMr. Robot\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d helping to catapult those series into the cultural firmament. But Emmys voters may have beaten them to the punch this year.But Globes voters also bestowed multiple nominations on \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cSMILF.\u201d They even found ways to throw attention toward the new ABC hit \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d which has received middling reviews, honoring its star, Freddie Highmore, in the best actor category. Joining him is Jason Bateman \u2014 nominated for his work in the new Netflix crime series \u201cOzark\u201d \u2014 Sterling K. Brown (\u201cThis is Us\u201d), Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) and Liev Schreiber (\u201cRay Donovan\u201d).A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified an actress in Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d She is Alex Borstein \u2014 not Susie Myerson, which is the character Ms. Borstein plays in the show.John Koblin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Few industries miss an opportunity to fete themselves and their biggest stars with a glamorous, hopefully headline-grabbing night out.The organizers of the first Leopards Awards for Excellence in Jewelry, held Nov. 15, looked to stars outside the industry to raise jewelry\u2019s profile among a wider audience.Calling themselves the London Leopards, a reference to the hallmark that has been used for centuries to mark gold and silver pieces weighed in the city, they said that jewelry deserves more attention than it sometimes receives.\u201cWe feel jewelry is very important culturally, and very important to London,\u201d said Ms. Woolton, who added that the capital continues to be a valuable destination in terms of jewelry design, craftsmanship and sales.Ms. Azagury-Partridge noted a lack of news coverage about the industry and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put it on the map and in people\u2019s consciousnesses.\u201dThe organizers chose the winners, and the awards \u2014 small leopard statues that were designed by Ms. Azagury-Partridge \u2014 were presented at a dinner in the gilded, candle-chandelier-lit Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall, the center of British jewelry for almost 700 years.The fashion designer Gareth Pugh presented Daphne Guinness, the muse and musician known for her distinctive style and close collaboration with designers including Alexander McQueen, with the award for Jewelry in Fashion.The Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d was awarded a Leopard for Jewelry on Screen and the Victoria & Albert Museum was recognized for its contribution to Jewelry in the Arts.Elton John was named Leopard Legend, his award collected by his husband, David Furnish, who joked that Mr. John could not be there because he was on tour in order \u201cto buy more jewelry.\u201dOne award category was conspicuously absent. There was no Leopard for best jewelry designer or brand. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to pitch one jeweler against another,\u201d Ms. Woolton said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the awards to be generically industry. We wanted them to appeal to a very broad group of people and to provoke everyone to think about the importance of jewelry in their lives, in art, in film.\u201dThe event, held in aid of the Prince\u2019s Trust charitable organization, will also help support a mentorship program for jewelry designers under 30.The Leopards selected the winners: Louis Browning, Katherine Anderson, Mollie Rose Hemming and Hannah Jackson.The winners\u2019 entries will be produced with the Leopards\u2019 guidance and sold at their stores, with proceeds donated to the Prince\u2019s Trust.Ms. Azagury-Partridge said she hoped the event and the mentorship program would help inspire a new generation of designers and jewelry makers. \u201cIt\u2019s a dying art and we hope more young people will want to be a part of it,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Observers of American Anglophilia say it is complicated.Tom Sykes, an Englishman in Dublin who writes about the royal family for The Daily Beast, described the royals as the ultimate celebrities, albeit ones with \u201csome meat on the bone.\u201d\u201cI do think if you\u2019re going to be interested in celebrities you don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Sykes said, \u201cthe royal family are probably more interesting people to be interested in than the Kardashians, say, because of the thousand years of history behind them.\u201dThe era of prestige television has helped cultivate and encourage these trans-Atlantic tastes by making escapist fare instantly, and repeatedly, accessible in a way that rental VHS versions of \u201cHowards End\u201d were not for an earlier generation.Streaming services have helped introduce Americans to shows like \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d turning them into critical darlings and bestowing American celebrity upon their British stars, like the actors Michelle Dockery and Claire Foy.And while the monarchy may be the most popular institution in British public life, some in Britain criticize it as out of touch, said Suzanne Mackie, the executive producer of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d whose second season begins this week.\u201cThere would probably be an apathy, an ambivalence, and some people would even be ill-disposed to them symbolically in what they represent,\u201d said Ms. Mackie, who is British. \u201cSo it\u2019s always interesting to us to counter that with the American relationship with the royal family and interest in the royal family.\u201d\u201cAmericans are particularly interested in the British monarchy, it\u2019s not just monarchy in general,\u201d said Arianne Chernock, a historian at Boston University. \u201cYou don\u2019t see the same kind of interest directed at the Japanese Crown. I think it is about this special relationship, at root.\u201dAnglophilia in the United States dates back to \u201calmost immediately after the American Revolution\u201d ended British rule in the 13 colonies, Ms. Chernock said. \u201cThere is a desire to retain that strong cultural tie, and I think that persists to this day.\u201dIt is a feeling that has long cut across the social divide. In 1860, when Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, visited the United States on the eve of the Civil War, hundreds of thousands gathered to see him in cities from Boston to Richmond, Va., which would soon be the secessionist capital, said Elisa Tamarkin, a scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.\u201cThe love of this 18-year-old traveling prince was described as a universal feeling,\u201d Ms. Tamarkin said. \u201cSouth Carolina had committed to secede if Abraham Lincoln wins, his winning was assured, Wall Street was in a panic, but the Prince of Wales was actually on the cover of Harper\u2019s Weekly five times in six weeks.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They dance for crowds that extend into the thousands.\u201cI\u2019m like, you just think we appear and it\u2019s perfect?\u201d said Alyssa Quezada, the coach of the Knicks City Dancers, with a laugh. \u201cDo you know how much work goes into it?\u201dHours before the players show up, the dancers measure their spacing on the court. (They use cracks and lines on the floor as a map for their spots.) And they must know their steps.At a recent Knicks City Dancers rehearsal, Ms. Quezada had a firm message: \u201cCarve this into your muscle memory because we don\u2019t have time to go back over this a million times on Sunday\u201d \u2014 game day.Ms. Quezada runs a tight ship because she has to. The dancers are part-time, so they have a lot of choreography to churn out. Her position as coach is part-time, too. \u201cI asked for that,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I want time to pursue other dance opportunities.\u201dThe Brooklynettes, established in 2012, perform at Barclays Center; the Knicks City Dancers, who have been around since 1991, appear at Madison Square Garden. Each team has 20 dancers and performs at home games only; the Brooklynettes do two routines a game; Knicks City Dancers one or two.In 2014, the Knicks City Dancers changed their approach, from 50-second routines rooted in pop, street jazz and hip-hop, to 90-second numbers aligned more with Broadway or the Rockettes.Now the group\u2019s goal, Ms. Quezada said, is \u201cto create a production \u2014 a show \u2014 in the middle of a basketball game.\u201dThe Brooklynettes, with unabashed athleticism, stick (with certain exceptions) to choreography that lands in a hip-hop and street jazz vein. The spirit is Brooklyn, and the routines range from one minute to 90 seconds.As for the tone? It depends. At a recent rehearsal, Adar Wellington, the Brooklynettes\u2019 coach and choreographer, brought more than high kicks for a new number. She brought a theme \u2014 female empowerment. \u201cFor this one,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like us to get into a character.\u201dShe gave them a back story: You\u2019re a woman. Your boyfriend is bad news. \u201cYou think, what\u2019s the worst possible time to end this?\u201d Ms. Wellington said. \u201cNets versus Knicks finals. Game seven. All his boys are over. You go to the bathroom, you gather your emotions and you come out and break out into this dance.\u201dBut as Ms. Wellington explained during rehearsal, \u201cThe only thing that should be feminine\u201d \u2014 she marked the word with air quotes \u2014 \u201cis this.\u201dShe turned to profile with deeply bent knees and rose while arching her back. \u201cEverything else should be grounded,\u201d she said. \u201cA more masculine approach.\u201dThough one is a glamorous throwback, the other urban and modern, the Knicks City Dancers and the Brooklynettes share a problem: How do you make a basketball crowd pay attention to dance?\u201cDynamics is huge here,\u201d Ms. Wellington said. \u201cBecause of the arena setting and it being in the round, it\u2019s important that the choreography reads from the very top row. A lot of choreographers that are very established \u2014 they\u2019ve worked in theater, in movies \u2014 don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s just very different here until they get in and are like, Oh wait \u2014 no one\u2019s going to see this little movement unless they\u2019re in the front row.\u201dShe encourages outside choreographers to create big movement and prefers that transitions into new formations take as little as four counts. \u201cThere should never be any sections that are breathers,\u201d she added, referring to less strenuous moments when a dancer can catch her breath. \u201cThe entire thing should be jam-packed.\u201dMarc Bauman, senior vice president and executive producer for in-game entertainment at Madison Square Garden, was formerly the supervising producer at \u201cLive from Lincoln Center.\u201d Early into his job at Madison Square Garden, he came to the conclusion that the choreography needed improving. \u201cBefore me, it had been two or three people rotating through,\u201d he said. \u201cSort of rinse and repeat.\u201dWith his theatrical background, Mr. Bauman has made other changes, like incorporating blackouts before performances to capture the crowd\u2019s attention. \u201cIt\u2019s all of it: The lighting, the costuming, the music selection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s concise. The dance team has to have a shape.\u201dFor him, shape refers to the choreography\u2019s point of view. \u201cSome of that is precision, grace, the beauty of the line,\u201d Mr. Bauman continued, noting that for the great choreographer George Balanchine \u201cthe most beautiful part of the dancer\u2019s body was the hand.\u201dAnd so, even though they\u2019re the Knicks City Dancers, he doesn\u2019t see them as a team that is supporting the Knicks. \u201cThere\u2019s equal opportunity there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re there to create just as much of a show as the basketball players.\u201d\u201cBack then, he was really avant-garde and weird,\u201d Mr. Bauman said. \u201cHe had a phrase: That what he did in his choreography stretched your aesthetic. That\u2019s always been in my head. What can I do that will stretch people a little bit?\u201dOne way, both teams know, is through choreography with something to say and dancers who perform it with intention. At one point during the rehearsal for \u201cLike a Boy,\u201d Ms. Wellington told her team \u201cto be internal a little bit more, even though we\u2019re never internal.\u201dIn the contest between subtle and strong, strong usually wins out when you\u2019re preparing for an arena show. Much of the dancers\u2019 attention is focused on performing stylized precision at breakneck speed rather than on nuance and details. But Kathryn Mulcahey, a Brooklynettes dancer and one of its three captains, said that there\u2019s another fundamental ingredient.\u201cWe want the energy and the vibe to be more important than our spacing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to feel each other. At the end of the day, we say to each other: \u2018Just dance.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Disney-Fox Deal Has Friends in High Places", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseRupert Murdoch, the media mogul who is executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, is one of President Trump\u2019s closest allies and advisers. Fox News has been the president\u2019s most reliable media champion. Mr. Murdoch and the president have each publicly described the other as \u201cmy good friend.\u201dBecause AT&T and Time Warner aren\u2019t direct competitors, and the suit was such a break with Justice Department tradition, it gave rise to speculation that the real motive was to punish CNN, the Time Warner-owned Trump punching bag.The $52.4 billion Disney-Fox deal, in which Disney is acquiring Fox\u2019s venerable movie studio and the bulk of its other entertainment assets, poses the opposite problem: 21st Century Fox is controlled by the Murdoch family.Even though antitrust decisions are supposed to be independent of political influence, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t hesitate to weigh in when the deal was announced. \u201cI know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president\u2019s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs,\u201d the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.\u201cIt looks bad to me,\u201d said Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.Larry Downes, an antitrust expert and a fellow at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business, agreed. \u201cThe government\u2019s theory in Time Warner very much applies to Fox and Disney,\u201d he said. If the government \u201cdoesn\u2019t challenge this, it will look very weird,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure appearances matter to this administration.\u201d\u201cI have never been instructed by the White House on this or any other transaction under review by the antitrust division,\u201d he said of the AT&T case.That\u2019s unlikely to stop speculation about his division\u2019s handling of the latest blockbuster. Antitrust experts told me that in many ways the Disney-Fox deal raises even more antitrust questions than does the combination of AT&T and Time Warner. That\u2019s because it\u2019s both a merger of direct competitors \u2014 a so-called horizontal merger, which typically get close scrutiny \u2014 and has some of the same vertical elements that caused the Justice Department to try to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger.Whether a combination of the Fox film and television studios with Disney\u2019s entertainment arm would raise red flags under Justice Department guidelines depends on how the government defines the market. The deal would reduce the number of Hollywood studios to five from six. Last year, Disney\u2019s studio accounted for 26.4 percent of the domestic theatrical box office, the largest share, and Fox was third, with 12.9 percent. Although the combined studios would have had close to 40 percent of the market in 2016, that\u2019s typically not enough to run afoul of the department\u2019s merger guidelines, Mr. Sagers pointed out, unless the government decides to define the market differently.If the market is as narrow as films about superheroes, and Disney gains control of Fox\u2019s \u201cX-Men\u201d franchise, that would almost surely trigger concerns.There are more serious antitrust issues about Fox\u2019s regional sports networks, given ESPN\u2019s dominance of cable sports. If that market is measured by cable sports revenue, the Disney-owned ESPN is so dominant that nearly any acquisition of another cable sports provider, even Fox\u2019s relatively small regional networks, would trigger antitrust review.\u201cFrom a horizontal perspective, sports is the main issue,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, a law professor and antitrust expert at New York University School of Law.If the Justice Department really wanted to be aggressive, it might also invoke the words of former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who wrote in a landmark opinion, \u201cThe widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public.\u201dUnder terms of the proposed deal, Fox shareholders would own about 25 percent of Disney in an all-stock transaction. Given the concentrated market for cable news, a combination of Fox News and Disney\u2019s ABC would most likely not have passed antitrust muster. But depending on how much influence the Murdochs are able to exert at Disney, the family might achieve much the same objective, perhaps with a board seat, or, as some have speculated, if James Murdoch joins Disney as an executive and even becomes a potential successor to the Disney chief executive, Robert Iger.Such speculation may not be all that far-fetched. \u201cReports suggest that James Murdoch is apparently in line for a senior management role within Disney as part of the deal,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. in a note to clients Thursday.Mr. Iger said during a conference call Thursday that James Murdoch\u2019s future role, if any, hasn\u2019t been decided.Mr. Hemphill, the law professor and antitrust expert, pointed to an emerging antitrust doctrine called common ownership, which looks beyond the formality of separate companies to examine who actually exerts control.All those concerns are based on traditional antitrust review standards. But since the case against AT&T and Time Warner was filed, those standards have been anything but traditional.Vertical mergers like that of AT&T and Time Warner \u2014 AT&T buys content from Time Warner, but doesn\u2019t compete directly with it \u2014 used to be approved almost routinely, albeit often with conditions. No longer. \u201cWe\u2019re in a topsy-turvy antitrust world,\u201d Mr. Downes said.One of the government\u2019s concerns in its effort to block the AT&T deal, according to its complaint, is the risk that AT&T would withhold Time Warner content from rivals like Netflix, thus hurting consumers.But Disney, as it prepares to start its own direct-to-consumer Netflix rival, is already withholding some content, and has said it would withhold much more as existing agreements expire. It will almost surely pull 21st Century Fox content, like \u201cX Men,\u201d the planned \u201cAvatar\u201d sequels and TV shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cThe Americans,\u201d and offer them on its own service.Mr. Downes said he doesn\u2019t see how the Justice Department would distinguish between the two deals, should it approve the Fox-Disney transaction.How Mr. Delrahim and the antitrust division handle the Fox-Disney review remains to be seen, of course. But whatever he decides, the shadow of Mr. Murdoch will loom large.\u201cI hesitate to make any predictions about Trump and what he\u2019ll do,\u201d Mr. Sagers said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a long tradition that the White House shouldn\u2019t get involved in these decisions.\u201dHe said he was \u201creluctant to believe\u201d that Mr. Delrahim would allow politics or Mr. Trump\u2019s friendship with Mr. Murdoch to influence his decision \u2014 \u201cbut maybe I\u2019m being na\u00efve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sifting Through a Life After Suicide", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring a support-group meeting for people left behind by suicide, Hope Litoff realized she was among a group of collectors.\u201cWe all had storage spaces of our dead person,\u201d said Ms. Litoff, a New York film editor whose sister, Ruth, an artist and photographer, committed suicide in 2008 at the age of 42. \u201cWe all had the same feelings. We had saved every single thing. The items themselves were too precious to part with, but at the same time, too painful to look at.\u201dAs Ms. Litoff thought about her ability to keep emotional distance in her work, it occurred to her that perhaps by making a film about her sister\u2019s life and her possessions that were packed in a storage space, she could sort through all of it.\u201cWhen I\u2019m editing a film, I\u2019m able to feel a certain amount of distance from the footage, even if it\u2019s really sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to stay objective and tell the story. I had this fantasy if I filmed the items, they would exist on film, they would never be gone and I would be magically protected by the process \u2014 which I found out was totally not true.\u201dI spoke with Ms. Litoff about her reasons for making the film, how suicide affects those left behind and what she hopes people will take away from her story.With the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d and the Broadway hit \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d the entertainment industry recently has seemed more willing to tackle the topic of suicide. Why do you think that is?Many people are still uncomfortable with the topic.I know a fancy private school in New York where a student killed himself. The school\u2019s reaction was to take all mention of suicide out of the curriculum, any literature, any films, all art. It was removed from the course of study and not reintroduced until every single student who had been there at the time of the suicide had graduated. So for 10 years there was no mention of suicide. That\u2019s absolutely the wrong way to respond to something like that.There are many tragic and unexpected deaths. Why do you think suicide wreaks such havoc on the lives of those left behind?My mother did die of cancer, and it was a long, lingering bout with lung cancer. I never said to myself, \u201cI\u2019m going to cure cancer.\u201d That was not a fantasy that I had. With suicide there is this belief that you can make a change, and there are suicide hotlines and ways to help people. You don\u2019t need to be a surgeon or a scientist to intervene and help someone who is struggling with depression. You are left with the thought that maybe I can be the one who\u2019s going to help my sister, and I\u2019m going to find the right words to say or the right way to make her happy.How did you find the strength to make a movie about this?The movie did wreck me. I was driven. I was obsessed and maybe in an unhealthy way I had to go through it. It\u2019s really scary how dark I went, but I feel really grateful that I\u2019m on the other side. I\u2019m still dealing with it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m all better. But now there are no more boogey monsters. I\u2019ve read every journal. I\u2019ve seen every date book. I\u2019ve seen every pill bottle. It\u2019s not as terrifying to me.What do you hope people will get from the film?What I am really hoping is that people who see the film feel like it\u2019s for other people like me. It\u2019s for people who were left behind and who were so alone that when they walk down the street they feel like a Martian and nobody can understand what they are feeling. I hope they feel less alone by seeing someone else who has experienced the same thing. I hope that people who love people who have lost someone to suicide will understand there\u2019s no time limit to the pain. Just be patient with the person that is still in mourning. All you can really do is listen and be there. Don\u2019t try to pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t not talk about it. It\u2019s the not talking about it that keeps us all isolated and sad. If people go home or go out to dinner and talk about the film, that to me is an incredible success.Advertisement"}

At the moment he was shipping a copy of Churchill\u2019s \u201cMy Early Life\u201d ($1,500), as well as a portrait that had been signed by the former British prime minister during World War II ($11,000).The mug request had Mr. Singer stumped. He told the caller to hold and disappeared into the rear of the store, a stately refuge of red carpet and carved oak book cabinets tucked in the public atrium of the Park Avenue Plaza between 52nd and 53rd Streets.The shop has had a good year, with the British statesman being portrayed in two recent films, \u201cChurchill\u201d and \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d as well as in the Netflix series, \u201cThe Crown.\u201d The store itself was even featured as a setting recently in the Showtime series \u201cBillions.\u201d But the holiday rush was providing some new challenges for Mr. Singer.Churchill died in 1965 at age 90, leaving an output of more than 40 titles and volumes that have been reprinted in some 8,000 different editions by now.There are also roughly 800 books about Churchill, said Mr. Singer, who added that he\u2019s had a copy of all of them in the store at some point. His inventory ranges from a $10 paperback of \u201cChurchill on Europe\u201d to a 1906 first-edition softcover of \u201cFor Free Trade,\u201d written by the man himself, and stored in a safe at the shop. It goes for a \u201cnegotiable\u201d $185,000, Mr. Singer said.Rare editions of every title Churchill authored can be glimpsed on five shelves locked behind glass doors in the rear of the store: from a first edition of \u201cThe Story of the Malakand Field Force\u201d ($5,500), to a signed volume of one of his final works, \u201cA History of the English Speaking Peoples\u201d ($6,500).The shop has hung on as one of the last independent bookstores in Midtown Manhattan partly because of Mr. Singer\u2019s own Churchillian tenaciousness, and also because the skyscraper\u2019s owners, the Fisher Brothers, have long extended a \u201cfavorable\u201d financial arrangement to Mr. Singer, he said.\u201cThey have a certain affection for the shop,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who, throughout the years, has certainly leveraged the spell that Churchill casts over certain rich and powerful men who admire his resolve and leadership. .For example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bought copies of John Lukacs\u2019 \u201cFive Days in London: May, 1940\u201d to lean on, Mr. Singer said.Caspar Weinberger, while serving as secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan, bought a pile of books and told Mr. Singer to send the bill to the Pentagon, Mr. Singer said.His 2012 book, \u201cChurchill Style: The Art of Being Winston Churchill\u201d is on prominent display in the shop for $25, with signed first editions priced at $50.Mr. Fisher named the shop after Chartwell, Churchill\u2019s country home in Kent, England, but the store wasn\u2019t devoted to Churchill, at first.Mr. Steinberg\u2019s secretary called down to Mr. Singer requesting \u201ca complete set of everything Churchill ever wrote, first edition and bound in leather,\u201d Mr. Singer said.\u201cI asked if he\u2019d like an estimate on that, and she said, \u2018No just do it as soon as possible,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who figured out around this time that perhaps he should streamline his inventory. Mr. Singer spent several years traveling to England. He scoured bookstores and \u201clearned about Churchill on the fly,\u201d he said.Mr. Singer wound up charging Mr. Steinberg $100,000 for the set, half of which was for a rare copy of Churchill\u2019s \u201cMr. Brodrick\u2019s Army.\u201d\u201cHe got a bargain \u2014 it\u2019s worth more now,\u201d said Mr. Singer, who after his first year open, switched to a Churchill theme.Mr. Steinberg kept the set in his 34-room Park Avenue triplex and held on to it for emotional support, Mr. Singer said, even when his losses forced him to sell off many other assets.Mr. Singer reappeared from his office with a Churchill coffee mug, his personal keepsake, grabbed from his desk.\u201cI have one for you,\u201d he told the executive on the phone, a regular customer. \u201cOn the house.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the author of the book, \u201cFive Days in London: May, 1940.\u201d The author was John Lukacs, not Winston Churchill.Advertisement"}

In, not out.\u201dBy the finale, Elizabeth has given birth to the couple\u2019s fourth child, Prince Edward, and Philip \u2014 who can\u2019t stand deferring to his powerful wife \u2014 is kneeling at her feet in a grand gesture of devotion.

Episode 2 follows Philip, his wandering eye and his bushy beard around the world, as he relives his youthful adventures in the Royal Navy.

Our first hint that there\u2019s more to the duke than complaining and (maybe) philandering comes when he insists on returning a shipwrecked mariner to his out-of-the-way home.The season includes surprisingly few story lines that revolve around Elizabeth herself. When she does step into the spotlight, \u201cThe Crown\u201d almost always casts her as a victim. In Season 1, we watched a timid and unprepared young queen learn that her new job would often mean disappointing the people she loved most. After Elizabeth endures Philip\u2019s alleged infidelities, the renegade aristocrat Lord Altrincham pens an essay calling the queen \u201cpriggish\u201d and regressive. The punishment for forgiving her uncle, the abdicated King Edward VIII, is the discovery that he palled around with Nazis. And then there\u2019s the mean, beautiful Jackie Kennedy, who pretends to like the queen but calls Elizabeth an \u201cincurious, unintelligent, and unremarkable\u201d middle-aged woman with thick ankles at a party.

It just got tiresome to watch the queen\u2019s goodness win out every time. We find out that she prudently implements Lord Altrincham\u2019s suggestions, that she writes to Jackie after John F. Kennedy\u2019s death, that she forgives Philip \u2014 and even that she feels guilty for being unable to forgive Edward. By contrast, her tormentors are mostly painted as lost, pathetic people.My problem with this onslaught of humiliations wasn\u2019t that the show took too many liberties with history.

This season\u2019s episodes felt more self-contained, on the whole, than last season\u2019s. That made them slightly less bingeable, but it also gave us the gift of two episodes devoted almost entirely to Margaret. She\u2019s drunk, disconsolate and bitter the first time we see her, still wrecked from her involuntarily aborted relationship with Peter Townsend. It actually hurt me to watch her settle for a safe proposal from her old friend Billy Wallace, which made the way she crushes him after realizing that he doesn\u2019t deserve her absolutely delicious.Thankfully, we also get the rebellious Princess Margaret, who really deserves a show of her own.

The characters\u2019 courtship, in Episode 4, is vividly specific: Tony begins the seduction at a photo session that produces a scandalous image of the princess with \u2014 gasp! \u2014 bare shoulders. One of the country\u2019s most powerful women thrills at the idea of submitting to an artist without a title; he says he senses she\u2019s dying to play the \u201csupplicant,\u201d and she swoons over his contemptuous attitude. This isn\u2019t often a steamy show, but that episode\u2019s director, Benjamin Caron, gets credit for bringing real heat when the story requires it.But the single most wonderful part of Season 2 was Margaret\u2019s romance with the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, a fascinating historical figure played with charisma, intelligence and a healthy dollop of decadence by Matthew Goode.

We also get the impression that he finally agrees to wed Margaret for the spectacularly petty reason that the marriage will enable him to become an earl, thus outranking the stepfather and stepbrother he hates.They get married in Episode 7, \u201cMatrimonium,\u201d my favorite hour of the season.

So close, yet so far away, Star-Lord. Better luck next time, Captain Jack Sparrow.\u201cWomen truly emerged as the giants of cinema this year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior comScore analyst, adding Oscar contenders like \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d \u201cThe Post\u201d and \u201cI, Tonya\u201d to the list. \u201cThe Post,\u201d starring Meryl Streep as a newspaper publisher coming into her own, has only been playing for 10 days in three cities but has already taken in about $2 million, a strong total that bodes well for its Jan. 12 wide release.Between Friday and Sunday, \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d (Walt Disney Studios) collected an estimated $52.4 million to become the No. 1 movie of 2017 in North America, with a three-week total of $517 million. Overseas, \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d has taken in an additional $523.3 million and has yet to arrive in China, the world\u2019s second-largest movie market.Marvel superheroes also did some heavy lifting. Led by Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d was the fourth biggest movie of the year, while \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d rounded out the top five. \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cLogan\u201d made the top 10.Underneath those positive results, however, was a grim reality: Ticket sales were propped up by higher prices. Attendance declined by roughly 4 percent, to 1.26 billion, according to analysts, the lowest total in about two decades, as a string of big-budget films stumbled.Disappointments included \u201cJustice League,\u201d with Ben Affleck as Batman; \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d starring Tom Cruise; \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\u201d starring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow; \u201cBaywatch,\u201d led by Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron; and \u201cAlien: Covenant,\u201d directed by Ridley Scott.Mr. Scott also had a tough time over the weekend with \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d (Sony), a crime drama about the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III and his grandfather\u2019s refusal to pay a $17 million ransom. The film, which cost Imperative Entertainment more than $50 million to make, collected about $5.5 million, for a domestic total since arriving on Monday of $12.6 million.Also of note for the year in moviegoing: Only one animated movie, \u201cDespicable Me 3,\u201d ranked among the top 10 ticket sellers. Last year, four films made the cut (\u201cFinding Dory,\u201d \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets,\u201d \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cSing\u201d). The pullback may involve blurring boundaries \u2014 chunks of superhero movies are essentially animated \u2014 and sequelitis: \u201cCars 3\u201d underperformed for Pixar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fox Deal Would Test Disney", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIf scale is coin of the realm in media, then it is easy to see why Mr. Iger might be eager to bulk up with 21st Century Fox\u2019s TV shows and films. Fear is also a pervasive motivator. Netflix\u2019s success as a streaming service in gathering 100 million global subscribers \u2014 coupled with its heavy spending, up to $8 billion next year, on content \u2014 is driving rivals into big deals.Picking off parts of Fox would come with considerable risks. For starters, not all of Fox\u2019s cable networks mesh with Disney\u2019s fare. The Mouse House is known for keeping tight control of its family-friendly brand. Fox peddles edgier programs with series like the blood-spattered \u201cThe Americans\u201d and the raunchy \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\u201dDisney\u2019s cable outlet ESPN is one of the most popular networks in the United States, yet subscribers are declining. But adding Fox\u2019s regional sports channels would expose Disney even more to the rising cost of media rights \u2014 expected to increase nearly 6 percent to $20 billion in North America alone, according to PwC \u2014 and the overall drop in ratings for some franchises like the NFL.There is also the question of whether Disney could manage the politics. Government watchdogs fresh from suing AT&T to block its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, will be on notice. Together, Disney and Fox studios have accounted for more than 30 percent of movie-ticket sales this year, according to Box Office Mojo.Much depends on Mr. Iger himself. The Disney chief executive is due to leave in July 2019 but may extend his contract again if this deal occurs. Investors ought to hope he does. So far, Mr. Iger has been a savvy acquirer, snapping up Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. Even so, carving up Fox would be in a different league.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Crisis Line That Calms With Texting and Data", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesRight now, algorithms are scouring vast data sets to determine the news you\u2019ll be exposed to today on social media, the advertisements that will appear alongside your search results and what you\u2019ll end up being charged for your next car ride. But can algorithms be used to address more urgent social and individual problems, like how to build trust or provide effective care? Can algorithms be used to increase the love and kindness in the world?\u201cWe\u2019re in a growth industry,\u201d says Nancy Lublin, who founded the Crisis Text Line, \u201cbecause pain is a growth industry.\u201dText messaging has turned out to be a surprisingly effective way to do crisis counseling. To begin with, it\u2019s the default mode of communication for young people. Three-quarters of Crisis Text Line\u2019s users are under 25 years old and 12 percent are under 13.\u201cTexting also offers anonymity,\u201d said Becka Ross, a licensed clinical social worker who spent 12 years as a therapist for youths at risk and now works as a supervisor for Crisis Text Line. \u201cAlmost two-thirds of the people who text in tell us something they\u2019ve never told another human being. And they can text us from anywhere and nobody knows. If they were talking to a friend or calling a hotline, they\u2019d have to go somewhere private. But a student can text us from the lunchroom when they\u2019re being bullied or the school bathroom.\u201dCrisis Text Line concludes every conversation with an automatic message asking users if they found the conversation helpful. Over all, 86 percent respond yes; that\u2019s up from 76 percent four years ago, reflecting improvements in the organization\u2019s training and supervision. Twenty percent of users also complete a post-conversation survey, providing additional information about themselves and their experience. Recently the organization hired Shairi Turner-Davis, a physician with experience in trauma, to serve as its chief medical officer. \u201cMy job is making sure that counselors don\u2019t get burned out and ensuring that we\u2019re keeping them up to speed on the latest in the fields of trauma, social work and crisis intervention,\u201d she said.An ideal conversation involves 40 to 60 messages exchanged over 45 minutes. Effective conversations go through five stages \u2014 building rapport, exploring support systems, identifying a goal, collaborative problem solving and wrapping up and sharing resources. Users often end conversations with messages like: \u201cThanks for showing me love and humanity.\u201d \u201cThanks for helping me feel more in control.\u201d \u201cThank you for letting me know I\u2019m not alone.\u201d \u201cYou made me feel valuable and worthy.\u201d \u201cIt helped so much just to have someone on the other line in the middle of the night.\u201dThese are successful outcomes, but a person who is depressed, has an eating disorder, is engaged in self-harm, or is in despair because of bullying or academic pressures often needs longer-term support. Crisis counseling isn\u2019t meant to be therapy. \u201cThe job of a crisis counselor is to help move someone in pain from a hot moment to a cool calm,\u201d Lublin says. Counselors will often offer connections to local services for follow-up help. In the 1 percent of cases in which counselors and supervisors believe a texter is at serious risk for suicide, the service initiates what is called an \u201cactive rescue,\u201d calling the local police or 911.What those 56 million text messages add up to is an extraordinary opportunity to save lives. The data can help identify when and where problems are spiking, and what interventions are warranted. For example, although National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month is observed in September, data show that suicidal ideation peaks in April and May \u2014 critical information for mental health counselors in schools and universities. Suicidal ideation is also triggered by popular culture aimed at youth.\u201cLast year was a particularly strong spring in part because of \u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019 the Netflix show,\u201d Lublin said. \u201cClose to 5 percent of our traffic explicitly mentioned the show last spring.\u201dThe data can be used to flag issues that require greater attention. For example, one in five conversations from users under the age of 13 mention self-harm, usually cutting. In 40 percent of those conversations, the words \u201cscared\u201d and \u201calone\u201d show up. After counseling, 62 percent of those texters report feeling less alone or more hopeful. These sentiments have a direct implication for counselors, said Bob Filbin, the organization\u2019s chief data scientist. \u201cThese texters want to be heard,\u201d he said.\u201cAnother thing we\u2019ve seen that has been surprising,\u201d Lublin said, \u201cis the number of kids who are feeling something intensely \u2014 a breakup, suicide, depression, school pressure \u2014 who have a parent in the house with them while they\u2019re texting us and don\u2019t feel they can communicate with their parent. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201dSome of the insights from the data raise questions about prevailing assumptions in crisis counseling. One is the belief that counseling must be tailored by issue. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that a person experiencing a particular crisis needs a particular type of care,\u201d Filbin said. \u201cSo if it\u2019s sexual abuse or L.G.B.T.Q. or suicidal ideation, the care or the training would need to be different in each case.\u201d But when Filbin examined the data, he found that not to be the case.Similarly, it has been assumed that counselors do better when they come from the same geographic area or have the same gender identification as the person they are assisting. This assumption has implications for the placement and staffing of crisis centers. \u201cWe tested if matching by locality or gender matters,\u201d Filbin said. \u201cThe data showed that it didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOther things matter a lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are universal skills that make or break a conversation: active listening and collaborative problem solving are the big two.\u201dHere, too, the data has been instructive. \u201cThe most important part of what we do is \u2018strengths identification,\u2019 \u201d Filbin added. \u201cWords like \u2018smart,\u2019 \u2018brave\u2019 and \u2018proud\u2019 show up a lot in highly rated conversations. What really turns conversations from hot to cold is reminding people that they are powerful enough to move themselves out of crisis. The data shows that it has to be reinforced. A counselor can use eight strength identifications in a conversation before maxing out the benefits.\u201d\u201cStrength identifications can\u2019t be false,\u201d Lublin adds. \u201cIt has to be authentic. We\u2019re really just echoing back to you and reminding you how strong you are.\u201dResearchers at Stanford University are using the data to determine why some crisis counselors are more effective than others at making people feel better. With millions of messages, it\u2019s likely that similarities will be discoverable among some types of interactions, according to Jure Leskovec, an associate professor of computer science at Stanford.

{"Headline": "The Race to Erase Kevin Spacey", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The sun was setting on Nov. 7, when Christopher Plummer arrived at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan for a secret, hastily arranged meeting.He had intended to be resting in Connecticut after a whirlwind month. But Ridley Scott had flown in from London with an urgent plea: Would Mr. Plummer help expunge the disgraced Kevin Spacey from Mr. Scott\u2019s latest film, one set for theatrical release by Sony in just six weeks?By the next morning, Mr. Plummer had agreed to replace Mr. Spacey as Grandpa Getty.\u201cAt my age, which is enormous, you get worried that your memory won\u2019t hold up,\u201d Mr. Plummer said. \u201cBut this was too damn good to pass up.\u201dAnd so began a race to pull off something never before attempted in Hollywood: revisiting a finished movie, reassembling major members of the cast, refilming crucial scenes, re-editing many sequences, retooling the marketing campaign \u2014 and doing it all at the last possible minute. Mr. Scott and others worked 18-hour days as they rushed to finish in nine days what would typically have taken at least a month.\u201cYou can sit there and let something kill you, or you can take action,\u201d Mr. Scott said in his no-nonsense way. \u201cI took action.\u201dBut \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d presented unique challenges. A trailer was already on heavy rotation in theaters. Awards prognosticators (nudged along by Sony publicists) had also been touting Mr. Spacey\u2019s performance as Oscar worthy.It was decided that \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d which also stars Michelle Williams as the kidnapped boy\u2019s desperate mother and Mark Wahlberg as a Getty family fixer, would arrive on Dec. 22 as planned. (Sony eventually settled on Dec. 25.) \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was any solution,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cWe would have to muddle through the best we could.\u201dA few days later, two of the film\u2019s producers, Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas, unexpectedly arrived at Mr. Rothman\u2019s office. They told him they were determined not to let the wrongdoings of one person damage a film that had been worked on by more than 800 people. And they floated an audacious idea that they had privately discussed with Mr. Scott: What about replacing Mr. Spacey with another actor? Mr. Plummer, perhaps.\u201cThat would theoretically be fantastic,\u201d Mr. Rothman said he responded. \u201cBut I have supervised 450 movies over the course of my career. And what you are saying is impossible. There is not enough time.\u201dBut impossible? Not with the experienced and indefatigable Mr. Scott in the director\u2019s chair, Mr. Friedkin maintained. \u201cTwenty years from now, I want to be able to pull this film off the shelf and be proud of it,\u201d Mr. Friedkin said.This is where the story of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d becomes about, as Mr. Rothman colorfully put it, \u201ctwo octogenarians kicking absolute ass.\u201dWith Sony\u2019s blessing, Mr. Scott sprang to action, convincing Mr. Plummer to take on the challenge. (Why Mr. Plummer? Mr. Scott had considered him during the initial casting process but went with Mr. Spacey for reasons that included scheduling.) The director said he did not tell Mr. Spacey that he was being replaced because Mr. Spacey had never contacted him to discuss the misconduct allegations.\u201cA phone call would have been nice,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cAt first I was disappointed. Then I was mad.\u201d (He added that nothing in Mr. Spacey\u2019s contract prohibited his replacement; he got paid.) Representatives for Mr. Spacey did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Scott, who called the assertions about Mr. Spacey\u2019s behavior \u201cshocking,\u201d also managed to bring back Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Williams, both of whom agreed to work through Thanksgiving due to the severe time constraint. Production on \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d resumed on Nov. 20 in London, with the cast and reassembled crew moving to Rome a few days later.The actual kidnapping had taken place in Italy. Operatives in the \u2019Ndrangheta crime syndicate held the teenage Getty hostage for five months, even chaining him to a stake in a cave. At one point, the kidnappers cut off Getty\u2019s ear and mailed it to a Rome newspaper. He was ultimately released for a payment of roughly $3 million.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a grand documentary, a blow-by-blow look at how and why a family \u2014 one blessed with so much wealth \u2014 disintegrates into tragedy,\u201d Mr. Scott said.Since the original scenes had all been filmed on location, no sets needed to be reconstructed, saving a lot of time. Also making the situation more manageable: Mr. Plummer was nearer in age to the character, making it possible to forgo the kind of facial disguise that Mr. Spacey had donned.Long hours may have been their biggest challenge.\u201cI\u2019m kind of like a funny battery that never wears out,\u201d he said.Despite their efforts, \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d faces an uphill battle at the box office.Of course, the publicity generated by Mr. Scott\u2019s race to scrub Mr. Spacey from the movie may prove helpful. The effort has been cheered online in some of the same forums where boycotts were brewing. \u201cMr. Scott is an inspiration!\u201d wrote one commenter on EW.com.And it is possible that Mr. Plummer, an Oscar winner for \u201cBeginners\u201d in 2012, turned in a performance that eclipsed the one given by Mr. Spacey. In a surprise, Golden Globe voters, who saw a not-quite-finished version of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d last week, nominated Mr. Plummer for best supporting actor and gave nods to Mr. Scott for his directing and Ms. Williams for best actress.\u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic change,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cKevin\u2019s performance was colder. Christopher has enormous charm \u2014 a twinkle and a smile \u2014 that makes this coldly logical character feel even more dangerous.\u201dWill the original version of \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d ever be released, perhaps on DVD, so that viewers can judge for themselves?Mr. Scott let out a huff. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Clearly not deterrence, as evidenced by the article itself. Clearly not reduction in drug availability or use, as evidenced by troves of data.

The Justice Department appears to be taking a different approach to these two deals.AT&T-Time WarnerThis would be traditionally be considered a vertical merger. AT&T is a telecom company, one that specializes in the delivery of content; Time Warner is a media company, the maker of the content.Disney-21st Century FoxThis would typically be called a horizontal merger, because the companies compete in a number of media endeavors, including television and film.Concentration matters in the media business.

{"Headline": "12 Surprising Reasons to Be Grateful for the Arts in 2017", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese 12 blink-and-you-might-have-missed-them cultural moments of 2017 brightened up a year otherwise defined by the threat of nuclear war, natural disasters \u2014 from hurricanes to wildfires \u2014 that left hundreds of thousands homeless, a string of sexual harassment charges against some of the country\u2019s most prominent political and entertainment figures and yet more terrorist attacks. These are the small but indelible pleasures that our editors and reporters have been grateful for in the past year.\u201cGLOW\u201d culminates in a televised bout, and the pleasure of the to-the-brow eye shadow and belted lam\u00e9 is overpowering. But by that point the women have already turned themselves into TV-friendly caricatures \u2014 Liberty Belle, Welfare Queen, Fortune Cookie. So I have a soft spot for the costumes in the initial episodes, when the wrestling women aren\u2019t yet playing their in-the-ring roles. If most of them are dressing for comfort, they\u2019re also telegraphing how they\u2019d like to be seen \u2014 Ruth\u2019s serious blues, Arthie\u2019s soft pinks \u2014 before they realize that the camera won\u2019t want their real selves, Sheila\u2019s pelt excepted. (That some of the women find their wrestling characters empowering while others don\u2019t is one of the more interesting complications of the series.)One of the joys of being a podcast fan in 2017 was bearing witness to another era of transformation in the medium, which, three years after the \u201cSerial\u201d revolution and the leap in production values that followed, still feels like a simmering primordial stew: You never know what strange new species may rise to the surface.I haven\u2019t been able to shake John B. McLemore, the troubled and ferociously articulate protagonist of \u201cS-Town,\u201d since the series was released in March. His mesmerizing, acid soliloquies on clock repairing and climate despairing and small-town farce have no analogue in fiction. But the most delightful and surprising episode focused on another jewel of a subject, Olin Long.We meet Mr. Long \u2014 a friend and onetime love interest of Mr. McLemore\u2019s who, as we learn in one of the show\u2019s most endearing digressions, may be the world\u2019s biggest fan of \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d \u2014 in Episode 6 of the podcast, after we think we have a handle on its major contours. Some criticized \u201cS-Town\u201d for sidestepping the pulpy tale of murder and corruption teased by its cryptic prerelease marketing. But what made the series so exceptional was its insistence on examining the human riddle at its center, turning it over and over again to uncover astonishing new facets and missed connections.Episode 6 is not the most consequential in the arc of the show, but Mr. Long\u2019s interviews sketch a portrait of unquenched desire and suppressed heartbreak that recast everything we\u2019ve previously heard in new light. Not so unlike Mr. McLemore, many of us have bouts of misery and misanthropy. But most of us can\u2019t help but suspect that the cure for what ails us, if it can be found, lies somewhere in other people. My favorites of his jokes hint at an entire life beyond the joke. They share a quality that the best acting does, how a performer can evoke an odd subtext or back story in a gesture or piece of business. Jack Handey will begin a sentence in a blandly benign narrator tone, then take a sudden wrong turn, landing who knows where: \u201cOne bad thing about ice skating is you\u2019re always knocking over little kids.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in my right place,\u201d she sings. \u201cDon\u2019t be a downer.\u201dIn the episode, Sam (Ms. Adlon) \u2014 a single mother raising three daughters \u2014 blindfolds Max, her oldest, and takes her outside for her graduation present. \u201cTilted\u201d plays while Sam, along with her two other daughters and their grandmother, re-enacts Ms. Letissier\u2019s video.Wearing black, they perform the choreography \u2014 sometimes shakily, but with spectacular intention \u2014 on a shiny elevated stage against a background of trees. And Ms. Letissier\u2019s message endures: What does it mean when you lose balance? Are you falling or flying?Or make that 45 minutes or so, presented without commercials as the camera tracked first Elliot (Rami Malek) and then his friend-turned-nemesis, Angela (Portia Doubleday), through an E Corp headquarters thick with skulduggery, rioting and panic, as each tried to outwit the other. (There were camouflaged edits throughout.) Long takes stress out viewers by withholding the cutaways our minds crave, making us feel the anxiety racking the characters. In \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d this intensified the show\u2019s radically subjective perspective at a spot in the story when Elliot and Angela were not only under the gun but were so in opposition to one another. The episode also functioned as a microcosm of the entire series, Elliot using the size and disconnected structure of E Corp against it as he expertly manipulates its networks and vulnerabilities.How tranquil he looked in his pearlescent frock coat. But beneath the satin beat the heart of a revolutionary, and like his American cousins a decade before, he could look past the corruption of the capital and imagine a new kind of government, constituted by and responsible to all people. A great portrait is a likeness of an individual that takes on universal meaning, and this one \u2014 whether it depicts Zamor or not \u2014 radiated virtues I needed to be reminded of: liberty, equality and, above all, fraternity.As the stars, swaddled in their glamorous Catherine Zuber-designed costumes, walked onstage and started their separate opening numbers, the audience went into overdrive, clapping and shouting for several minutes.Ms. Ebersole happily took in the tribute, grinning at the other actors in her scene and waiting until the applause eventually died down before uttering her first line. A few minutes later, however, Ms. LuPone was all business, taking her place onstage with just a brief pause and a slight smile \u2014 and quickly holding up her hand to silence the audience, as if to say, \u201cChildren, enough; I have a show to do.\u201dYou cannot only count the number of pop stars performing at this level in their 50s on one hand, you can count them on two fingers: Ms. Jackson and Madonna. (Madonna, however, does it in heels.)But something else happened at the \u201cState of the World Tour\u201d I had never seen before at a major pop concert: One of Ms. Jackson\u2019s backup dancers was getting an ecstatic reception. She was fierce, charismatic and curvy; I would call her normal size. The fashion industry would probably call her plus size.A bit of babble has been on my mind since I heard it more than 10 months ago. It\u2019s part of a piece written in 2014, but the a cappella purity of the voices harkens back to the Renaissance. The words are simple: \u201cI want you/I want to,\u201d sung so quickly that \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cto\u201d blur into each other. The mood is simultaneously anonymous and tense; it\u2019s heated, yet cool.The piece broadens from those initial seconds to encompass scattered fragments of love letters written by Mr. Hearne (in 2006) and his father (in 1962); Catholic and Jewish wedding rites; and text messages exchanged with one of the Steubenville High School students convicted of rape in 2013. The voices hover and slip past one another, find peace and then tumble into more eddies of perplexity.The rush of language, and the difficulty of establishing its source and legitimacy, captured for me so much about our contemporary predicament. Mr. Hearne is hardly sympathetic toward those who wrong women, but I hear \u201cConsent\u201d as compassionating all of us who have been bequeathed unequal, curdled social relations. Without judgment \u2014 this composer creates spaces of contemplation, not pat politics \u2014 his juxtapositions reveal how freely given consent (marriage, I\u2019m looking at you) has ended up systematically wronging women, just as rape and assault have.The confusion between desiring people and desiring what they can do for you; the overarching anxiety about, simply, possessing; the difficulty, when confronted with the language of love and caring, of distinguishing whether it\u2019s real or feigned \u2014 it\u2019s all here, uncannily beautiful, in a form that sounds as old as time. As a fan of the band\u2019s literary, word-drunk output, I was excited to see them in the Lincoln Center Songbook series, touring behind the new album \u201cAway.\u201d We\u2019d be able to sit and really listen to those private reveries and gnomic story songs, polished to dark shine, as we gazed through the oversize windows into the shadows of Central Park.He recalled growing up in rural New Hampshire in the \u201980s, before the internet and all that cable TV. About how paging through The Times every Sunday gave him a sense of what it meant to be creative and sophisticated. About how so many of the events that seemed thrilling from afar happened at Lincoln Center.I could only wish, he said, that one day this world would make room for someone like me.And so it had.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s So Funny? The Times\u2019s Comedy Critic Explains", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre punch lines spoilers? Since a film review isn\u2019t supposed to reveal the end of a movie, should a comedy review avoid divulging the big twist in a joke? As the comedy critic for The New York Times, I regularly struggle with this question.From the start, the column focused primarily on live performance, and I still believe stand-up and improv are at their best when the performer and audience share the same space. But as comedy has evolved, developing an increasingly global and diverse audience on the internet, my viewing habits have adjusted. I still try to visit clubs, theaters and bar shows several times a week, but now spend more time watching screens.Starting this job required me to address thorny issues, like what should be the subject of a comedy review. Is a 10-minute set at a club as worthy of criticism as a play or a few episodes of television?I try to strike a balance, staying true to journalistic principles while also respecting the process and hard work of artists. My current thinking on spoilers is: You can\u2019t accurately describe a comedian\u2019s show, an essential part of the job, without mentioning punch lines. You also risk making funny comics sound humorless. One joke isn\u2019t analogous to an entire plot, and no one would suggest a movie review reveal nothing of the story. But I am also sensitive to the fact that publishing punch lines comes at a cost \u2014 as one or two comics have told me \u2014 since part of the pleasure of a joke comes from surprise. So I use them, but sparingly.As for what to review, my emphasis has also shifted to reflect the scene. Early on, I rarely reviewed a single performance. I tried to see a comic several times before covering him or her, incorporating live and filmed work into the review. But in recent years, as often expensive theater and arena shows proliferated, along with high-profile Netflix specials, I have become more like colleagues in film, theater and other disciplines, covering single shows as well as new hours on streaming services. I remain cautious with short club sets, occasionally using them as part of a larger piece, but never making them the subject of an entire column.A critic needs to be open to change. But being a critic also changes you. At shows, I have noticed \u2014 with some anxiety \u2014 that I laugh less than I used to. Have years of watching the same premises turned me into a joyless grump, the way critics are always portrayed in movies?No, I still find jokes funny as often as ever, even if I\u2019m quieter expressing it. One thing you learn watching comedians for a living is that laughter isn\u2019t merely a response to the show; it\u2019s an integral and complex part, with an impact on pace, mood and timing. It\u2019s not as much of a knee-jerk reflex as many think, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn from it. So I laugh less \u2014 because I listen more.Advertisement"}

Her husband has become someone else. Her sister has become someone else. And she\u2019s going, \u2018Who am I, then?\u2019 She has a bit of an identity crisis, I think.\u201d Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Season 2 finds the queen dealing poignantly with aging amid the rise of sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in British culture.The story of middle age is quite important. I just don\u2019t think that Elizabeth ever thought about the way she looked. It was never significant to her. And then it was, because people judged her. That\u2019s what she deals with in this \u2014 that she suddenly realizes she\u2019s not a spring chicken anymore.It\u2019s especially crushing when all of London, including her husband, perks up when President and Mrs. Kennedy visit. I love those episodes because there were these two couples who were seemingly completely different but shared a commonality, which is that they were the most viewed couples in the world. And they both had tensions in their marriage, and it was fascinating. But it\u2019s known that [the queen and Jacqueline Kennedy] didn\u2019t have a particularly sisterhood meeting at first. It was a bit dicey.That voice. We have an incredible coach, William Conacher, who is in charge of everyone\u2019s voice, which gives the show a tone. That\u2019s so integral to the character, because the way she speaks and uses her mouth and expresses herself has so much to do with her physicality. It\u2019s extraordinary how much the voice is the person and the person is the voice.You\u2019ve said that you\u2019d now like to play someone who expresses herself.That was tongue-in-cheek.

{"Headline": "The Effects of Ending Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday abrogated the very limited net neutrality regulations that the Obama administration had put in place. In a season when Washington politics has been overwhelmed by the naked greed of special interests, this may win pride of place as the single most greedy, corrupt and damaging such action.It is hardly a secret that American telecommunications markets are monopolized by a very few large corporations, and that the current F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, worked for one of those large firms, Verizon. The end of net neutrality will allow Mr. Pai\u2019s former employer to extract higher profits without returning better service to the American people.Who really thinks that allowing the large telecom corporations more control over what Americans see and read is a good thing? Giving monopolies more power will make it harder for new companies to enter the marketplace and limit the pace of innovation.In sum, Mr. Pai and the end of net neutrality exemplify everything that is currently wrong with Washington. Vested interests corrupt the policy process, lie to the American people and make decisions that further concentrate wealth and power in the hands of an elite few, with bleak consequences for the American people and our economy.Taking a clear stand against this may at the very least increase the chance that the inevitable next such outrage can be stopped.The writer is a professor of political science at Marquette University.To the Editor:Pay for what you use.

I wonder how the F.C.C. chairman could possibly answer a query like: \u201cPolls show that more than three-quarters of the public wants to keep net neutrality rules.

{"Headline": "What if You Couldn\u2019t See This Page?", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 To taste a future without net neutrality, try browsing the web in Beijing. China\u2019s internet, provided through telecom giants aligned with the Communist Party, is a digital dystopia, filtered by the vast censorship apparatus known as China\u2019s Great Firewall. Some sites load with soul-withering slowness, or not at all. Others appear instantly. Content vanishes without warning or explanation. The culprit is rarely knowable. A faulty Wi-Fi router? A neighborhood power failure? Commercial sabotage? A clampdown on political dissent? To most Chinese netizens, the reason matters little. They simply gravitate to the few sites that aren\u2019t slowed or blocked entirely: the Chinese counterparts of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. But these Chinese platforms come with heavy government surveillance and censorship by corporate and party apparatchiks. For the Communist Party and its commercial allies, this is win-win, cementing respective monopolies on political markets and consumer power.The Trump administration\u2019s plan to dismantle net neutrality regulations has brought this nightmare scenario to America\u2019s digital doorstep. With the Federal Communications Commission scheduled to vote on the issue today, the threatened rollback not only imperils fair play and free speech; it will also empower foreign entities with substantial market-making power, like China\u2019s government, to meddle in American public discourse on a scale dwarfing Russia\u2019s recent cyber-chicanery. Worse, abolishing net neutrality gives American corporations the means, motive and opportunity to become accomplices in selling out our freedom of speech.As the incentives and opportunities to self-censor accumulate, content providers will gravitate to producing and promoting whatever reaches the most customers worldwide, even if that means pleasing Chinese cyber-commissars who control access to a billion of them. Content providers \u2014 companies like Facebook and LinkedIn \u2014 are not, after all, common carriers. They do not control the pipes, or carry a unique public trust in the eyes of the government. As private businesses, they are not bound by the First Amendment. Self-censorship is simply good business.For those telecom conglomerates that have current or potential business before the Chinese government, the temptation to take behind-the-scenes guidance on content \u201cmanagement\u201d as a quid pro quo for market access may prove irresistible. China already exports its cutting-edge internet censorship technologies, honed in the world\u2019s largest natural laboratory for \u201copinion guidance,\u201d to authoritarian countries around the world. These technologies are masterpieces of subtlety and sophistication, offering a world-class censorship experience amenable to consumers and commissars alike. They rarely resort to the \u201chard\u201d censorship of crude deletion, but rather give a suite of \u201csofter\u201d monitoring and management tools to steer public discourse and discourage all but the most dogged netizens from accessing undesirable content. For those who stick to domestic and approved Chinese sites, the browsing experience is speedy and seamless, the sutures where unwanted content has been excised barely visible.In the future, if the article you\u2019re reading loads slowly, or not at all, you might not know the reason.

{"Headline": "Best Movies of 2017", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, share their favorite pictures of the year.There was a lot to feel bad about in 2017: plenty of reasons to take offense, get angry, go numb or feel sick to your stomach. If that sentence bummed you out, I\u2019m sorry. (It was an epic year for dubious apologies, too.) But I\u2019m not sorry about this list of the movies \u2014 a top 10 and a second 11 \u2014 that made me feel other, better ways. Not always cheerful, but enlightened, moved, surprised and gratified. In bad times, we tend to either ask too much or expect too little of art, pretending it might heal or save us, and dismissing it when it doesn\u2019t. Its actual function is much simpler: it keeps us human. That\u2019s what these movies did for me this year.The promise of an independent, socially conscious, aesthetically adventurous homegrown cinema is spectacularly redeemed in Sean Baker\u2019s latest feature, which managed to be both the most joyful and the most heartbreaking movie of the year. Steeped in the gaudy materialism of Central Florida, animated by Brooklynn Prince\u2019s gleeful spontaneity and anchored by Willem Dafoe\u2019s deep craft, the movie already has a feeling of permanence. Ms. Prince\u2019s Moonee has earned a place in the canon of American mischief alongside the likes of Eloise and Tom Sawyer.Jordan Peele wrote and directed the inescapable movie of 2017, a work of biting anti-consensus filmmaking that broke box office records. Part of the film\u2019s genius is the way it splinters the mythology of American racial healing and then reassembles the shards into something lacerating and beautiful. Possibly conceived as a mordant punch line to the Obama era, it may turn out to be the inaugural blast of insurgent cinema in the age of Trump.But the truth can also be delightful. Which isn\u2019t to say that strong, bitter emotions don\u2019t have a place in the latest auto-documentary by Agn\u00e8s Varda. In her late 80s, accompanied by a thirtyish artist named JR (who is also credited as director), Ms. Varda roams the French countryside, searching out the remnants of a once-vibrant working-class tradition. Contemplating some of the sorrows in her own past and the precariousness of the European present, she keeps gloom at bay with her resilient faith in the power of art to conserve and expand human dignity. Every second of this movie proves her right.There are movies that satisfy the hunger for relevance, the need to see the urgent issues of the day reflected on screen. Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s eighth feature \u2014 which may also be Daniel Day-Lewis\u2019s last movie \u2014 is emphatically and sublimely not one of them. It awakens other appetites, longings that are too often neglected: for beauty, for strangeness, for the delirious, heedless pursuit of perfection. I\u2019ve only seen this film once (it opens at Christmastime), and I\u2019m sure it has its flaws. I will happily watch it another dozen times until I find them all.Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio\u2019s portrait of Marina, a transgender woman mourning the death of her lover and facing the hostility of his family, is at once bluntly realistic and ripely melodramatic, polemical and poetic, pointed and, well, fantastical. Daniela Vega, who plays Marina, doesn\u2019t show up on screen right away, but once she does (singing a torch song in a nightclub in Santiago, Chile), the camera never leaves her for long. What it finds in the planes of her face is some of the glamour of old-time movie stars \u2014 hints of Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Anna Magnani and Lauren Bacall \u2014 and even more of the emotional authenticity that made them stars in the first place.The kid-goes-to-college movie has emerged as a minor American genre. This year\u2019s examples include \u201cLady Bird,\u201d \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\u201d and \u201cBrad\u2019s Status,\u201d all of which offer gently comical perspectives on a familiar rite of passage. Cristian Mungiu, the Romanian director of \u201c4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Hills,\u201d offers a grimmer view. A provincial doctor wants his daughter to attend university in England, and is willing to compromise his ideals to ensure that she can. A family drama and an ethical thriller, Mr. Mungiu\u2019s film is an indictment of the everyday corruption that festers not only in Romania, but everywhere selfishness has become the supreme social value.But not so quiet, really. As Emily Dickinson, Cynthia Nixon is forthright, sometimes abrasive, often funny and never less than thrilling company. Terence Davies\u2019s blithely unconventional biopic glides through Dickinson\u2019s life with poetic compression and musical grace, illuminating both her temperament and the austere, intellectually intense 19th-century New England environment that nurtured and constrained her gifts.Never has human extinction seemed so richly merited, and rarely has digital ingenuity been put to such sublime use. The third installment in the revived series is an epic of national founding, with echoes of the Aeneid and the Book of Exodus. Somber and exciting, the film, directed by Matt Reeves, shows how large-scale action filmmaking can explore political and moral matters without bogging down in pretentiousness. Andy Serkis remains the key to the enterprise. His performance as Caesar, spanning three movies, is one of the great feats of acting in modern movies, a breathtaking fusion of technological magic and solid thespian craft.videoAdvertisement"}

But he also feared for their lives and ultimately implored them to leave, warning that the Chinese troops who had arrived to quell the disturbance might soon open fire. The soldiers did, massacring hundreds.For Mr. Liu, a mission of political opposition was born. Risking prison, he became one of the Beijing regime\u2019s most outspoken critics, and in 2010 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.Mr. Liu was just one of a remarkable roster of disparate people who died this year having fought, as their eulogists might say, \u201cthe good fight\u201d \u2014 an expression that rings of clich\u00e9 but also of truth. They had fought, and fought some more, for causes larger than themselves.They were rarely famous. Their names may have found their way into obituary headlines, but they were not \u201cheadline names,\u201d as we know the term \u2014 not like those of the many luminaries who died along with them this year. But they were remembered.No one death is bigger than another, but some deaths get more attention, and probably none more so than in pop culture, where fame is the coin of the realm. There, a funereal drumbeat sounded all year.Manson\u2019s obituary, for one, was on the front page of The New York Times \u2014 a proper placement that nevertheless bore out former Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s remark about how he read newspapers.\u201cI always turn to the sports section first,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sports page records people\u2019s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man\u2019s failures.\u201dBut let\u2019s turn Warren\u2019s aphorism on its head and conclude with the men and women he so justly admired, who strive on the playing fields and in the arenas, win or lose. This seems apt, heading as we are into a new year, carrying what every athlete must preserve to be able to get up and try again: hope.Lambert\u2019s story was even more rueful. A world-class German high jumper, she was used by the Nazis for propaganda purposes and then summarily barred from competing because she was Jewish. A gold medal had been within her grasp: In a preliminary meet she had tied the German high-jump record.The hurt stayed with her for the rest of her 103 years. \u201cIt was a terrible shock,\u201d she later said, \u201cbecause I was the best.\u201dBut she and her achievements were not forgotten, either. Not far from her home in Queens, where she died, a high school athletic field \u2014 where young men and women continue in her footsteps to run, leap and soar \u2014 bears her name.William McDonald is the obituaries editor of The TimesAdvertisement"}

So far, Netflix has been the clear winner. It spends billions of dollars a year and has seen subscriptions soar, especially internationally, with the critical and popular success of shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at some of the leading streaming services.And it still has the rights to old episodes of big TV shows, including some from 21st Century Fox. The first season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d about the O. J. Simpson murder trial that was a ratings smash for FX and a big award winner? Netflix will continue to hold onto that.On the other hand, Hulu remains a relatively small business that bleeds money. The last time it disclosed the number of people who subscribe to the service (a year and a half ago) it was a relatively teeny 12 million. As a comparison, Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. And there are plenty of indications that Hulu\u2019s growth has only inched a bit in the time since.Still, Disney will assume Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu, and will now own more than 50 percent of the streaming service. Whether that means Disney can simply merge Hulu\u2019s enormous array of content into its forthcoming service is unclear. Some analysts are skeptical that NBC Universal\u2019s parent company, Comcast, will allow Disney to simply buy it out.\u201cWe see no reason why Comcast would want to enable Disney to have a more successful streaming service that hampers the legacy bundle that is vital to Comcast,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, at analyst at BTIG.Plus, even with leadership changes, Amazon sits on a mountain of cash. That has many Hollywood executives convinced that Amazon could become a real rival to Netflix if it deploys its resources in the right way.Facebook and YouTube are still looking for a signature hit.Meanwhile, there are live TV services for people who are just looking to shed an expensive cable package. Hulu and YouTube have offerings with a suite of cable channels, and so do services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Departure With Implications for Investors: Disney\u2019s John Lasseter", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseSo far, the wave of high-profile, scandal-tarred departures of celebrated media personalities over allegations of sexual abuse has had scant impact on investors.But there may end up being one major exception: John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation and principal creative adviser for Walt Disney Imagineering, which conceives and executes Disney\u2019s theme park attractions.He added that, for Disney, the importance of animation \u201cgoes way beyond the earnings at the studio.\u201d\u201cIt stokes the engine for consumer products and theme parks and getting kids into the Disney fold.\u201d Mr. Creutz said. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything at the core of Disney, it\u2019s animation.\u201dJust a month ago, Mr. Lasseter was feted at the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco with its lifetime achievement award, and the songwriters and stars of \u201cFrozen\u201d serenaded him with a tribute. Sporting one of his trademark Hawaiian shirts, he was on the red carpet the next night for the premiere of \u201cCoco,\u201d the latest Pixar release, which dominated the Thanksgiving weekend box office and drew rapturous reviews.No one has publicly accused Mr. Lasseter of sexual assault or anything close to it. People at Disney (who were told not to speak to the press) described Mr. Lasseter\u2019s effusive and often theatrical personality, and said he sometimes subjected women to prolonged bear hugs, inappropriate touching and kissing on the lips, incidents they said were usually fueled by alcohol.In an email to employees in Disney\u2019s animation division, Mr. Lasseter, 60, apologized \u201cto anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape or form.\u201dWhile Disney executives said they hoped and expected that Mr. Lasseter would return rejuvenated after his six months away, that is by no means assured, especially if new complaints surface. In a statement accompanying Mr. Lasseter\u2019s departure, Disney stressed that it was committed to an \u201cenvironment in which all employees are respected and empowered to do their best work.\u201d (A Disney spokesman declined to comment further and said Mr. Lasseter wasn\u2019t available to talk.)While Pixar has been extraordinarily successful, its track record isn\u2019t entirely unblemished. \u201cCars 2,\u201d the last Pixar film for which Mr. Lasseter served as director, as opposed to executive producer, was widely panned by critics, and \u201cCars 3,\u201d released last spring, was a box office disappointment. \u201cThe Good Dinosaur,\u201d released in 2015, was an even bigger flop. Disney scrapped \u201cGigantic,\u201d an animated take on \u201cJack and the Beanstalk,\u201d and took a $98 million write-off in October.For all his achievements, Mr. Creutz said, \u201csome of the best films Pixar has made weren\u2019t necessarily done by John Lasseter, especially over the past 10 years.\u201dMr. Lasseter has been the face of Disney animation for so long that few others in the division have become well known on Wall Street. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much insight into the people below him,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.But there is a group of talented animators and directors that goes back to \u201cToy Story,\u201d which opened in 1995, and includes Pete Docter (director of \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d and \u201cInside Out\u201d) and Andrew Stanton (\u201cFinding Nemo\u201d). A longtime Pixar executive, Ed Catmull, remains president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation. Disney hasn\u2019t named a replacement for Mr. Lasseter during his absence, and finding a strong permanent replacement for him, if that becomes necessary, will be crucial not just for continuity but for maintaining the confidence of investors.In addition, animated films are multiyear projects, and Mr. Lasseter has already put his stamp on those in development. \u201cFrozen 2,\u201d expected to be a box office juggernaut, isn\u2019t due for two years. Disney has no animated releases scheduled for the next six months.Over the near term, Mr. Creutz said, he expects little impact at Disney. \u201cNo one stays forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a very strong culture that has produced a lot of great entertainment. John leaving doesn\u2019t suddenly change that.\u201dLonger term, he said, the situation bears watching. \u201cWe may not know for a long time how this affected the culture of Pixar, and whether it\u2019s for better or worse,\u201d he said.Mr. Nathanson, noting that Disney stock barely moved on the news of Mr. Lasseter\u2019s sabbatical, said, \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people on Wall Street to shrug and say these people are all fungible.\u201d\u201cPixar is an amazing company with an amazing track record,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cIt\u2019s really unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen. You have to believe Lasseter has something special \u2014 taste, editorial judgment, whatever you choose to call it \u2014 to have created so much great product. If he\u2019s at risk of not coming back, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something Wall Street has focused on.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The F.C.C. Wants to Let Telecoms Cash In on the Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe chairman of the Federal Communications Commission wants to let Comcast, Verizon and other broadband companies turn the internet into a latter-day version of cable TV, in which they decide what customers can watch and how much they pay for that content.Net neutrality prevents those companies from having companies like Amazon pay a fee to get their content delivered more quickly than their rivals\u2019, and from having the firms throttle other services and websites, even blocking customer access to, say, Netflix or an online newspaper.Under Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, telecom companies would effectively be allowed to sell you a basic internet plan that might include only limited access to Google and email. For Facebook and Twitter you might need a slightly more expensive deluxe plan. The premium plan might include access to Netflix and Amazon. Oh, and by the way, media businesses eager to gain more users could pay broadband companies to be included in their enhanced basic or deluxe plans.That might sound like a far-fetched scenario. But there is reason to fear that some version of that awful vision could become a reality, because most Americans have just one or two choices for broadband access at home. People have access to four national wireless companies, but those connections tend to be slower and less useful for data-intensive applications than wired service provided by cable and telephone companies.Instead of making sure that broadband companies can\u2019t take advantage of their gatekeeping power over the internet, Mr. Pai wants to let them do whatever they want. All they would be required to do is be \u201ctransparent\u201d about what they are doing. In other words, they could simply tell customers what to expect in endless contracts filled with legalese and printed in tiny type. Mr. Pai further argues that the Federal Trade Commission would then make sure that companies were living up to their promises, essentially abdicating any responsibility the Federal Communications Commission has for the most important communications system in the country.Broadband companies are delighted by Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, which the three-vote Republican majority on the commission is expected to adopt at its meeting on Dec. 14.

{"Headline": "Disney Said to Be Nearing a Deal With 21st Century Fox", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Walt Disney Company is in advanced discussions to buy significant parts of 21st Century Fox, the media company run by the Murdoch family, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.And a deal between the two companies could end up splitting up the Murdochs as an operating team, with James Murdoch potentially leaving his father and brother to work at Disney.Fox is also in negotiations with Comcast, but the talks with Disney are moving faster, these people said. An agreement with Disney could be announced as soon as next week, these people added, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.If a deal is reached, it would be the latest instance of upheaval in the media industry, as giants like Disney and Comcast seek to get even bigger to compete against newer players like Netflix. And medium-size companies like Fox are under pressure to also gain scale through acquisitions or to shrink and focus on specific businesses.Under the terms of the talks, Disney would buy big parts of Fox\u2019s empire in an all-stock transaction, including its movie and television studios, international assets like the Star cable and media company in India and a stake in the British broadcaster Sky, and a stake in the Hulu streaming service, these people said.James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, could take a senior executive role at Disney with oversight of the Sky and Star companies as part of his portfolio, these people added.Adding assets like the Fox movie and television studios would give Disney more sources of content at a time when it is rolling out its own streaming video service to challenge companies like Netflix and Amazon. And Star and Sky would help give Disney an international broadcasting presence.For Fox, a transaction with Disney might pose fewer regulatory risks than one with Comcast because the latter would bear some similarities to AT&T\u2019s proposed takeover of Time Warner \u2014 which the Justice Department is seeking to block.What would be left of 21st Century Fox would be several highly profitable operations, including Fox News Channel, a broadcast network and the FS1 sports channel. It would be overseen by Rupert Murdoch and his other son, Lachlan, who are executive chairmen of the company.The Murdoch family also still controls News Corporation, a separate publicly traded company that owns The Wall Street Journal, the British newspaper The Times and other news publications.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For \u2018Transparent,\u2019 Accusations Against Jeffrey Tambor Burst an Idealistic Bubble", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the acclaimed Amazon series \u201cTransparent,\u201d things were supposed to be different.As Amazon investigates the complaints, the series is suspended in an agonizing limbo. For instance, Mr. Tambor was widely believed to be leaving \u201cTransparent\u201d after he issued a statement saying, \u201cI don\u2019t see how I can return.\u201d Yet a representative for the actor disclosed to The Times recently that, in fact, Mr. Tambor had no plans to quit.In interviews, several cast and crew members said that the socially progressive values of \u201cTransparent\u201d \u2014 with its embrace of transgender characters and its commitment to workplace inclusivity \u2014 made the accusations of sexual harassment all the harder to process.\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d said Micah Fitzerman-Blue, a former writer and producer who is still in touch with many of the show\u2019s staff members. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly sad that that happened in the midst of something that felt so revolutionary.\u201d\u201cEven in the safest of sets, where there were people who were really thinking constantly about how do we make sure we\u2019re heart-connected at work, things happened, or things may have happened,\u201d the show\u2019s creator, Jill Soloway, said on a panel a few days after the second of three women, the \u201cTransparent\u201d actress Trace Lysette, came forward with accusations about Mr. Tambor.Mx. Soloway dotted the set with at least 60 transgender and gender nonconforming writers, actors and crew members, as well as many more extras, through what Mx. Soloway called the show\u2019s \u201ctransfirmative action\u201d program. A pair of transgender artists-turned-producers vetted the story lines to ensure authenticity. There were sessions to teach set decorators, drivers and other staff members how to speak and write sensitively about transgender issues.\u201cWe all feel like we\u2019re part of a greater good,\u201d Andrea Sperling, an executive producer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s there to entertain, but it\u2019s part of something bigger than all of us.\u201dWriters referred to Mx. Soloway\u2019s writers\u2019 room, with joking affection, as the \u201cwriters\u2019 womb,\u201d a nurturing yet unpasteurized space where the intimate details of their own lives \u2014 including sexual proclivities, extramarital affairs and more quotidian memories \u2014 were discussed and then stirred into the show.Their willingness to explore any personal experience, no matter how graphic or private, gave the story lines some of their emotional rawness and sexual frankness, and the set its warm, freewheeling atmosphere.Yet the absence of boundaries could also create uncomfortable moments for anyone less willing to share; one former writer, speaking anonymously to discuss private work sessions, recalled texting a friend out of unease when the writers were asked about their masturbation habits. (Mx. Soloway said in a written response to questions that sex was just one of many things the writers talked about, and that it was common practice among television writers to mine personal experiences for content.)In interviews with writers, producers and an actress arranged by Mx. Soloway\u2019s personal publicist, Mr. Fitzerman-Blue was one of the few to say he believed the women\u2019s allegations against Mr. Tambor; most others would not discuss them.The first accusations surfaced last month when Mr. Tambor\u2019s former assistant on the show, Van Barnes, wrote in a private Facebook post that the actor had sexually harassed and groped her.Two of Ms. Lysette\u2019s friends \u2014 Rain Valdez, an actress who worked as a producer on \u201cTransparent,\u201d and Mindy Jones, a singer \u2014 said in interviews that Ms. Lysette had confided in them about Mr. Tambor\u2019s actions at the time. Another actress, Alexandra Billings, said in a statement to The Times that she had overheard Mr. Tambor tell Ms. Lysette, \u201cMy God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually.\u201dIn an interview with The Times, Ms. Lysette said she hoped the show would evolve to focus on transgender experiences beyond those of Mr. Tambor\u2019s character. \u201cLike, come on,\u201d said Ms. Lysette, who is transgender. \u201cWe have a lot to share, and the world wants to see it, and I just think that it sucks that so much rides on these leading men.\u201dMr. Tambor, too, produced a supporting account. In a statement provided by the actor\u2019s publicist, Allan Mayer, a hairstylist on the show, Terry Baliel, said that he had never witnessed the actor doing anything of an \u201cinappropriate sexual\u201d nature.A few days later, in a new statement provided to The Times, Mr. Mayer expanded on Mr. Tambor\u2019s position: \u201cWhat he said was that given the toxic atmosphere and the politicization on the set, it\u2019s very hard for him to see how he can possibly return. But no final decision for next year has been made, either by Jeffrey or by Amazon.\u201d He declined to elaborate on what Mr. Tambor meant by toxic atmosphere and politicization of the set.Responding to questions, Mx. Soloway wrote, \u201cI take what Van Barnes and Trace Lysette are saying very seriously,\u201d but declined to discuss the accusations, citing Amazon\u2019s internal investigation.Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of Glaad, the L.G.B.T.Q. media advocacy group, said \u201cTransparent\u201d had \u201cbroken the mold, or created the mold\u201d for hiring transgender actors and other industry workers, who have historically faced barriers to employment in Hollywood.Mx. Soloway had become \u201cdeeply aware\u201d of the issue, but had \u201choped that being able to invite mainstream audiences into this family using a well-known actor was worth the trade-off,\u201d Mx. Soloway wrote in response to questions.Rhys Ernst, a producer, said he had argued to friends that Mr. Tambor was a \u201csocially responsible exception\u201d to the principle of casting transgender people in transgender roles, given the show\u2019s overall benefit to the movement.But Mr. Ernst, who is transgender, said he thought \u201cTransparent\u201d had made casting transgender people in transgender roles a more urgent issue.\u201cIf we were to start this whole thing all over again,\u201d Mr. Ernst said, \u201cit would probably go a different way.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the distinction achieved by Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s Golden Globe for his role on \u201cTransparent.\u201d It was not the first Golden Globe given to an actor for a transgender role; Hilary Swank won a best actress award for \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry\u201d in 2000.Advertisement"}

The crusade against adding fluoride to public water began in the 1950s among Americans who saw danger in the protective measures that had been adopted over decades to protect the populace from disease and contamination.But the off-grid water movement has become more than the fringe phenomenon it once was, with sophisticated marketing, cultural cachet, millions of dollars in funding and influential supporters from Silicon Valley.One recent morning in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., Cody Friesen, the founder and chief executive of Zero Mass Water, was inspecting water collection panels he had installed for his investor Skip Battle, a longtime tech leader who now sits on the boards of LinkedIn, Netflix and OpenTable.The system \u2014 called Source, which retails for $4,500, including installation \u2014 draws moisture from the air (the way rice does in a saltshaker) and filters it, producing about 10 liters of water a day and storing about 60 liters. The goal, Mr. Friesen said, is to make water \u201cthat\u2019s ultra high quality and secure, totally disconnected from all infrastructure.\u201d\u201cJust take a breath of air,\u201d said Mr. Friesen, a professor of materials science at Arizona State University. \u201cTake a deep breath. No matter how wealthy or poor you are, you can take a breath and own that air that you breathe. And yet water \u2014 the government brings it to you.\u201dMr. Battle\u2019s system runs on power from its own small solar panel. It feeds into a tap set up in his stone garden, where he goes to drink. He said he\u2019s been making all his meals and drinks with it.Mr. Battle poured himself a glass. \u201cThe water from the tap just doesn\u2019t taste quite as refreshing,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is that because I saw it come off the roof, and anything from the roof feels special? Maybe.\u201dBefore he could order raw water on demand, Mr. Evans went \u201cspring hunting\u201d with friends. This has become more challenging lately: The closest spring around San Francisco has recently been cut off by landslides, so reaching it means crossing private property, which he does under cover of night.\u201cYou have to be agile and tactile, and be available to experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally, you have to carry bottles of water through the dark.\u201dThe founder of Live Water, Mukhande Singh, started selling spring water from Opal Springs in Culver, Ore., three years ago, but it was a small local operation until this year. Marketing materials show Mr. Singh (n\u00e9 Christopher Sanborn) sitting naked and cross-legged on a hot spring, his long brown hair flowing over his chest.Pure water can be obtained by using a reverse osmosis filter, the gold standard of home water treatment, but for Mr. Singh, the goal is not pristine water, per se. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get 99 percent of the bad stuff out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now you have dead water.\u201dHe said \u201creal water\u201d should expire after a few months. His does. \u201cIt stays most fresh within one lunar cycle of delivery,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it sits around too long, it\u2019ll turn green. People don\u2019t even realize that because all their water\u2019s dead, so they never see it turn green.\u201dMr. Singh believes that public water has been poisoned. \u201cTap water? You\u2019re drinking toilet water with birth control drugs in them,\u201d he said. \u201cChloramine, and on top of that they\u2019re putting in fluoride. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it\u2019s a mind-control drug that has no benefit to our dental health.\u201d (There is no scientific evidence that fluoride is a mind-control drug, but plenty to show that it aids dental health.)\u201cWithout water treatment, there\u2019s acute and then chronic risks,\u201d Dr. Hensrud said, including E. coli bacteria, viruses, parasites and carcinogenic compounds that can be present in untreated water. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence all over the world of this, and the reason we don\u2019t have those conditions is because of our very efficient water treatment.\u201dDr. Hensrud said he has noticed more interest in alternative water sources; a patient recently asked questions about a raw water he had been drinking. \u201cThere are people, just like with immunizations, that don\u2019t accept the status quo,\u201d Dr. Hensrud said.The rules for selling bottled water are imposed by states and the Food and Drug Administration, which does not specify how water be treated but sets acceptable amounts of chemicals and bacteria at a low level. State and federal inspectors make unannounced visits to bottling plants to test for harmful contaminants.Seth Pruzansky, the chief executive of Tourmaline Spring (whose website touts its \u201csacred living\u201d water), got an exemption from the State of Maine in 2009 to sell his water untreated. \u201cThe natural food industry has been in the dark ages when it comes to water,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is a renaissance.\u201d\u201cFluoride? It\u2019s a deathly toxic chemical,\u201d said Vanessa Kuemmerle of Emeryville, Calif., who does landscape design for large tech companies. She said she was an early adopter of raw water, and has noticed many of her clients following suit.The health benefits she reported include better skin and the need to drink less water. \u201cMy skin\u2019s plumper,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019m getting better nutrition from the food I eat.\u201dIn the community of tap-water skeptics, many talk about water the way others might about fine wine.\u201cMy friends who drink spring water, when they come over now they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh yeah, give me the good stuff,\u2019\u201d said Amanda Thompson, a writer in San Francisco. \u201cThe consciousness around water is changing.\u201dNot everyone has been receptive. Many San Franciscans are proud of their tap water, which comes from Hetch Hetchy, a reservoir in Yosemite National Park.\u201cMy landlord lives across the street and thinks I\u2019m crazy,\u201d Ms. Thompson said. \u201cHe gave me a big rant around Hetch Hetchy water and how the water\u2019s so good. I always hope he\u2019s not around when there\u2019s a delivery.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like \u2018raw water\u2019 because it sort of makes people think of raw sewage,\u201d Mr. Vitalis said. \u201cWhen you say \u2018live water,\u2019 that\u2019s going to trigger a lot of people who are into physics and biology. Is it alive?\u201dAn earlier version of a caption misstated the connection between the Crooked River in Oregon and the aquifer tapped by Opal Springs Water Company.

{"Headline": "Why Concerns About Net Neutrality Are Overblown", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCritics worry that getting rid of neutrality regulation will lead to a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d internet: Internet service providers will start charging fees to websites and apps, and slow down or block the sites that don\u2019t pay up. As a result, users will have unfettered access to only part of the internet, with the rest either inaccessible or slow.Those fears are vastly overblown.Service providers have also blocked sites that competed with their own services. In 2004, the Madison River Telephone Company in North Carolina blocked Vonage to protect its own phone service from competition; it was fined by the F.C.C. for violating network neutrality rules. In 2012, AT&T let only some of its customers use the phone app FaceTime; after there were complaints to the F.C.C., it allowed all customers to use it.These incidents are troubling for anyone who wants on open, neutral internet. But keep two things in mind. First, these are rare examples, for a reason: The public blowback was fierce, scaring other providers from following suit. Second, blocking competitors to protect your own services is anticompetitive conduct that might well be stopped by antitrust laws without any need for network neutrality regulations.But even today, service providers can and do throttle peer-to-peer sites, as a necessary network management technique \u2014 something explicitly allowed by the rules. Some university networks also slow peer-to-peer traffic, so that other kinds of traffic are not slowed down. This has nothing to do with service providers slowing down websites that have not paid a fee.So why am I not worried? I worked for a telecommunications company for 25 years, and whatever one may think about corporate control over the internet, I know that it simply is not in service providers\u2019 interests to throttle access to what consumers want to see. Neutral broadband access is a cash cow; why would they kill it?Even if they wanted to, service providers would have a hard time extorting money from huge companies like Google and Netflix, because each service provider needs Google and its billions of users a lot more than Google needs it. Service providers could try to go after smaller websites, but they don\u2019t have much money to pay.And there\u2019s still competition: Some markets may have just one cable provider, but phone companies offer increasingly comparable internet access \u2014 so if the cable provider slowed down or blocked some sites, the phone company could soak up the affected customers simply by promising not to do so.Recently, net neutrality proponents have pointed to Portugal as an example of their nightmare scenario. A mobile carrier there offers various internet packages \u2014 one optimized for users who like video, others who like email and so on. What the carrier does not do is offer only those things, precisely because no consumer is likely to buy just video or just email (and in any case, Portugal is governed by the European Union\u2019s net-neutrality rules).The internet did not start out as a neutral invention. Instead, neutrality was an organic outcome of a competitive market. In the early days of the commercial internet, AOL and @Home had \u201cwalled gardens\u201d of content that users could get to more easily, but over time service providers stopped favoring sites and just gave customers fast, neutral internet connections. No government policy created that outcome.The good news is that we will soon have a real-world experiment to show who is right and who is wrong. The United States will get rid of its rules, and the European Union and Canada will keep their stringent regulations. In two years, will the American internet be slower, less innovative and split into two tiers, leaving Canadians to enjoy their fast and neutral net?Or, as I suspect, will the two markets remain very similar \u2014 proving that this whole agonized debate has been a giant waste of time? Let\u2019s check back in 2019. \u2610Ken Engelhart, a lawyer specializing in communications law, is a senior adviser for StrategyCorp, an adjunct professor at Osgoode Hall Law School and a senior fellow at the C.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Next After the Repeal of Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere is a guide to what will happen next:Consumers will probably not encounter immediate changes to their internet service. The biggest broadband companies, like Comcast and AT&T, have promised that consumers will not see a change in how they experience the web. And with such a big spotlight on them, the companies will probably be careful about changing service plans, partly to avoid angering customers and attracting lawmakers\u2019 attention.Broadband companies are \u201clikely to proceed cautiously pending final resolution of these legal challenges,\u201d said John Beahn, a regulatory lawyer at Skadden, Arps, who does not have clients with interests in net neutrality. \u201cThey recognize the ultimate fate of the regulations is still far from certain at this point.\u201dOne Republican commissioner, Mike O\u2019Rielly, said he supported some forms of paid prioritization, which could open the door for an internet model more like cable television, with different price tiers for certain websites.To be sure, there are programs that consumers may like. AT&T already offers its customers free streaming of DirecTV, which it owns. Other carriers like T-Mobile offer free streaming of apps like YouTube and Netflix, a practice known as \u201czero-rating,\u201d which at one time was viewed as a potential net neutrality violation. More programs like that could come along.But it\u2019s hard to see prices going down for internet service because of the end of net neutrality. Many economists say the only way prices could fall is through more competition in the broadband industry, which is now dominated by a handful of companies.The net neutrality rules, passed in 2015 during the Obama administration, were intended to be a protective measure for consumers as more Americans migrated to the internet for communications. The regulations were also meant to make sure new and small companies, as well as media companies, could sell their goods and distribute information without restrictions from broadband companies.Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the F.C.C., said transparency would act as the primary measure against wrongdoing. The agency will require broadband companies to disclose if they are blocking or throttling or setting up fast lanes for certain traffic. Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated to the chairmanship by President Trump, said that the disclosure would give consumers full knowledge of what they would be getting into and that if they didn\u2019t like the practices, they could switch providers.As part of the changes approved on Thursday, the F.C.C. handed oversight duties for the broadband carriers to the Federal Trade Commission. The F.C.C. said the F.T.C.\u2019s broad antitrust and consumer protection laws were best suited to stop any harmful business practices. The F.T.C. has to monitor nearly every sector of the economy and is most likely to go after alleged bad actors when they are brought forward in a complaint, a costly and time-consuming process.Comcast, AT&T and the major trade groups for broadband and cable providers say they don\u2019t and will not block or throttle sites. They say they won\u2019t engage in most forms of paid prioritization, the practice of charging sites more for faster delivery of streams and downloads.With legal challenges against the F.C.C. expected, many telecom experts say that the companies will largely to stick to those promises for at least the next year and that any changes to service will be subtle.The net neutrality debate has flared up multiple times over the last decade or so, ending in different places depending on the political party in power.Many Democrats on Capitol Hill have called for passing the Obama-era rules through legislation, instead of leaving the rule making in the hands of the F.C.C. Numerous Republicans have also suggested passing a law, though they generally argue for much lighter restrictions than the 2015 rules. Some Democratic lawmakers have also said they would overturn the F.C.C. action through a congressional review act, which would require a majority vote to abolish new agency rules. Given the Republican control in Washington, and the general gridlock in Washington, any sort of legislative resolution appears unlikely.Most certainly, there will be lawsuits, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition and by several state attorneys general, including those from New York and Pennsylvania. The suits are expected to be filed after the rules become official, which could be well into January or later.Lawsuits will most likely claim, perhaps among other things, that the F.C.C. acted hastily and capriciously by abandoning the rules just two years after they were created. For instance, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has said the F.C.C. should have delayed its vote on the ground that the law enforcement office found many public comments on net neutrality were fraudulent.It will probably argue that rolling back rules essentially returns the regulatory environment to the way it was before 2015, when there was little evidence of consumer harm.The agency is also likely to argue that it followed all the necessary procedures for making a regulatory change. The plan to overturn net neutrality was first announced in April by Mr. Pai.In a news conference on Thursday, after he had won the vote to overturn the rules, Mr. Pai said he was prepared for the legal challenges, using a tone of defiance and some sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked, that people are going to challenge this decision in court,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren.

Parties who argued against the F.C.C.\u2019s ruling maintain that, for example, without regulation an internet provider may block or slow user access to, say, Hulu and ease the connection to an entertainment service it owns or has an agreement with.But as the smarter business analysts know, superhero movies are relatively low on the list of concerns that, erm, animate this deal. No, this deal is about the future, about traditional movie studios trying to gain traction in the streaming market in the hope of overtaking already established platforms.But let\u2019s peek at the bright side for now. Netflix recently shared with The New York Times its slate of original films scheduled from January until April. I can\u2019t watch any of them yet, so I\u2019m ill-equipped to assess them, but here are some titles that have potential.On Jan. 19, there\u2019s \u201cStep Sisters,\u201d a collegiate drama directed by Charles Stone III. Its plot linchpin is, yes, step dancing. Mr. Stone did a pretty good job with the 2002 Nick Cannon film \u201cDrumline,\u201d which was about, yes, a marching band, so he might do the trick similarly here.\u201cWhen We First Met\u201d (Feb. 9), directed by Ari Sandel and starring Alexandra Daddario and Robbie Amell, looks quite a bit more ordinary. The plot hook for this rom-com fantasy is that Mr. Amell, after what he considers a perfect first night with Ms. Daddario, is upset that he is relegated to \u201cthe friend zone\u201d (official synopsis words, not mine), but he gets to travel back in time to alter the situation.March brings a revival of the \u201cBenji\u201d franchise, with a brand-new film directed by Brandon Camp, the son of the series originator Joe Camp. It\u2019s produced by Jason Blum, who\u2019s mostly famous for founding Blumhouse Productions, a company best known for horror pictures such as \u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d \u201cSinister,\u201d \u201cInsidious\u201d and the attendant sequels. I doubt the prospects for a cute-dog-horror hybrid, though, and suspect a pre-emptive move to get a good children\u2019s franchise going before Disney establishes its own streaming service.March and April bring a couple of films with African-American themes and stories. \u201cRoxanne Roxanne,\u201d which played at 2017\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and is scheduled to hit Netflix sometime in March, is about Lolita Gooden, who became a force in hip-hop under the name Roxanne Shant\u00e9. Newcomer Chant\u00e9 Adams plays the rapper, while Nia Long plays her mother. Also featured are Mahershala Ali, who won an Oscar for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and Adam Horovitz, the Beastie Boy known as Ad-Rock. The writer-director of this movie, Michael Larnell, also directed the well-received but little-seen 2015 film \u201cCronies.\u201d\u201cCome Sunday,\u201d debuting on April 13, stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as the Rev. Carlton Pearson, a graduate of Oral Roberts University whose ministry in the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ was jeopardized by his \u201cGospel of Inclusion,\u201d which, among other things, cast doubt on the concept of a hell of eternal torture. Adapted from \u201cHeretics,\u201d an episode of \u201cThis American Life\u201d (one of the movie\u2019s producers is Ira Glass, the host and executive producer of that radio program), the movie is directed by Joshua Marston, whose earlier pictures include \u201cMaria Full of Grace\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Forgiveness of Blood\u201d (2011), both of which showed a commendable sensitivity to cultural diversity.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "4 Comedy Specials to Watch: Seasoned Stand-Ups Making Debuts", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyComedy takes time \u2014 at least, good comedy does. That\u2019s part of the reason comics often don\u2019t release their first specials or albums until they\u2019ve been telling jokes for many years, even decades. Which explains why some of the funniest new stand-up available is in debuts by seasoned performers with honed acts.Here are four first efforts that will add to your holiday cheer. \u201cNice Lady\u201d (HBO)Silly fart jokes tied to meaty social commentaries that spin out into unexpected personal confessions interrupted by nicely crafted one-liners (\u201cA soft penis looks like the sound of sad\u201d): This comedic Rube Goldberg device is a quirky and delightful contraption, far sturdier than it appears. Michelle Wolf\u2019s range is anchored by a distinctive persona: a goofy but slyly forceful mischief maker determined to get you to see her view of the world, one way or the other.She starts by saying it\u2019s an unpopular time to be a feminist, then goes into a bit about activist woman not being focused enough. It\u2019s an off-key opening, considering that feminist arguments are currently upending the culture. But no comic can anticipate the news cycle, even one as savvy about gender and politics as Ms. Wolf, a workaholic who appears on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and in seemingly every comedy room in New York.Her act has always been smart, but over the years, she has developed a level of flashy showmanship that matches her shiny high-top sneakers. Her jokes crackle with character work and strategic shifts in her nasal voice to deeper registers.She remains at her best in intricate bits like one sending up the impossibility of a woman \u201chaving it all\u201d: She runs down a litany of unrealistic expectations for women before juxtaposing it with the simplicity of male ambition, which involves a sandwich and part of the garage. If there\u2019s a thematic core to this hour, it\u2019s a proud affirmation of single-minded professionalism. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a relationship for the same reason I don\u2019t want a kid: I don\u2019t want anything in my life to be more important than me,\u201d she says, adding that that might be selfish, before deepening her voice and saying, with a chuckle, \u201cThe jig is up: I\u2019m not a nice lady.\u201d \u201cAmerica Is the Greatest Country in the United States\u201d (Netflix)Judah Friedlander, who has been performing regularly since 1989 without putting out an album or special, uses more than a dozen punch lines in the first two minutes of his new special, a pace he sustains for more than two hours. If comedy were measured by volume, an argument could be made that no one offers a better deal on Netflix.In the age of Trump, Mr. Friedlander\u2019s preposterous arrogance, which extends to believing he can solve every political problem in a quick sound bite, does not seem so silly, which he seems to understand. His jokes arrive refracted through a left-leaning lens, and while he doesn\u2019t parody the president, he increasingly seems to pivot off him. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to bring back coal,\u201d he says dismissively. \u201cBut I am going to bring back all the VCR repairman jobs.\u201d\u201cComedy Central Stand-Up Presents\u201d (Amazon and Comedy Central)After explaining that a bride for whom she was the maid of honor asked her to wear a pumpkin-spice-colored dress, Yamaneika Saunders freezes, silent onstage, waiting a beat. Then her face seems to retreat, flattening out, her pupils dancing from one side to the other and back again, veering farther from her nose than seems possible. This contortion transitions into a mask of confusion as her shoulders rise, the only help her body offers to the wonderful above-the-neck physical comedy that turns the punch line that follows into a mere coda. (\u201cThat\u2019s not even a color. That\u2019s a drink at Starbucks.\u201d)Is she better live? Of course. But this Comedy Central special is still really good. She doesn\u2019t waste a second on anxious embarrassment after confessing that she lost her virginity at age 27, heading right to anger, explaining how her grandmother\u2019s warning that \u201cJesus is watching\u201d paralyzed her. \u201cWhen I had sex for the first time and the guy called out, \u2018Jesus!\u2019 I was like, \u2018Where?\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s not a bad line, but what makes you really laugh is the panic on her face. \u201cEstablished 1981\u201d (iTunes)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Peaky Blinders\u2019: The Disparate Ingredients of a Cult Hit", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 The Liverpool Olympia is best known as a music venue, having hosted storied acts like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. But on a morning in June, this 112-year-old theater had been turned into a TV set for \u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d the gritty-chic crime drama with a cultural imprint that is more modest in scale, though perhaps not in intensity.\u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d has become a cult hit for the BBC and Netflix, drawing famous fans like David Bowie and Leonard Cohen, who each offered songs for its soundtrack, and style disciples inspired by its story of a natty and ruthless Birmingham crime family in the era between the world wars.Its fourth season begins Thursday, Dec. 21, on Netflix (it already ran on BBC Two), and finds the gang, led by Cillian Murphy\u2019s icy Tommy Shelby, getting into the fight game. So the Olympic has been transformed into a 1920s boxing arena complete with vintage posters and an enormous Union Jack. It filled up with herbal cigarette smoke and stylish overcoats as a foghorn-voiced sidekick commanded a few dozen extras to step right up for an audience with \u201cthe Peaky [expletive] Blinders!\u201d\u201cTo influence people \u2014 not people involved in the industry but real people who watch TV and then go out and do something about it \u2014 it\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Knight said.As a primarily Roma group in Birmingham, the Peakys are a departure from the usual pop culture gangsters. The new menace \u2014 a New York-based Mafioso with a grudge played by Adrien Brody \u2014 represents the first time they will tangle with the more classic version. The Shelby family, which also includes Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory) and Tommy\u2019s brothers Arthur (Paul Anderson) and John (Joe Cole), has been arcing toward respectability, but the new threat will force them to return to the old neighborhood.\u201cThe whole series is about escape, with a particularly British point of view: Can you escape where you\u2019re born?\u201d said Mr. Knight, who writes every episode. \u201cSeason 4 is a very literal pulling back of the entire family to where they\u2019re from, so they can re-evaluate who they are in the environment they once were in.\u201dBut while it deals in a specifically British theme, \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d does so with an amalgam of disparate influences and elements \u2014 American westerns, a lithe Irish actor playing a tough crime boss, an art punk soundtrack \u2014 that add up to an arresting whole.\u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d was born from the stories Mr. Knight heard about his father\u2019s uncles, members of the real Peaky Blinders gang in Birmingham. The name came from the members\u2019 signature flat-caps that became \u201cblinders,\u201d the probably apocryphal story goes, when weaponized with razor blades sewn into the peaks.The stylized look and feel \u2014 the dazzling suits, the cathedral-like neighborhood pub, the slow-motion shots of the gang swaggering through grimy streets \u2014 is designed to approximate the wonder Mr. Knight felt upon hearing these marvelous tales while growing up in that city.\u201cThe horses are bigger and blacker; the men are stronger and more rugged; the women are more glamorous; the lipstick\u2019s brighter,\u201d Ms. McCrory said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a graphic novel.\u201dThough it\u2019s a crime show, \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d was inspired by American westerns, specifically the way they turned what was fundamentally \u201c19th-century agricultural labor\u201d into a heroic genre full of chivalry and myth.\u201cI wanted to apply that sort of boldness to the city where I came from and my parents\u2019 family,\u201d Mr. Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way into history because it\u2019s through the imagination and the feeling, rather than through the bricks and mortar of it.\u201dCaryn Mandabach, an executive producer, couldn\u2019t see the slender Mr. Murphy as an imposing crime boss. Until she met him. \u201cHe was so powerful in the room that it didn\u2019t matter that he was physically not a big guy,\u201d she said.Since emerging in the 2002 zombie thriller \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d Mr. Murphy had become best known for roles in indie films like \u201cThe Wind That Shakes the Barley\u201d as well as Christopher Nolan movies like \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cInception.\u201d But he noticed the more ambitious storytelling happening on TV and asked his agent to \u201cput the word out that I\u2019m interested,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo days later, I read the first two episodes of \u2018Peaky Blinders\u2019 \u2014 it was serendipity, you know what I mean?\u201dAs the anchor of the Shelbys and the show, Tommy displays the classic contradictions of the gangster antihero \u2014 a family man who murders without compunction. But in his case the dissonance has a specific source: his time in World War I, which physically and emotionally decimated a generation of Europeans. \u201cI wanted Cillian to encapsulate that closed-down, totally war-damaged male that shows no emotion,\u201d Mr. Knight said.The core relationship of the show is between Tommy and Ms. McCrory\u2019s Polly, who comes somewhat undone in Season 4 but remains Tommy\u2019s most trusted ally. The dynamic is emblematic of the show\u2019s strong female roles, a rarity in gangster dramas.\u201cI always find it surprising when that gets commented upon,\u201d Mr. Knight said. \u201cIn any family that I\u2019ve ever come across, the females are dominant. They just are.\u201dThe signature Peaky cut, high and tight, with the sides shaved every couple of days, initially \u201chorrified\u201d the actors, Mr. Knight said. The style was inspired by the World War I cuts favored by infantrymen to discourage lice \u2014 now \u201cfootballers in England with multimillion-pound contracts are having them,\u201d he said.The tracks suggest the seething emotion beneath Tommy\u2019s placid exterior \u2014 Nick Cave \u201cis Tommy\u2019s spirit animal,\u201d Ms. Mandabach said \u2014 and the soundtrack benefits from the fact that \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d is popular among musicians.Antony Genn, the show\u2019s composer and a former member of the English rock band Pulp, joined the show this season, and has placed more emphasis on original recordings featuring \u201cmy talented friends who are also outlaws,\u201d like Flea, Iggy Pop and Jarvis Cocker.The focus on new music dovetails with arguably the most curious \u201cPeaky\u201d brand extension yet: a musical that Mr. Knight has proposed as the next era of the Shelby story, once the TV series wraps up. (He said Season 5 would probably be the last one.)\u201cWe\u2019ve been approached by some very reputable people who have said this is perfect for a musical, so who knows?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the least likely thing with \u2018Peaky Blinders,\u2019 so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll probably do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hygge Gets Heave-Ho as Swedes, Norwegians Join the Fun", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of StyleHappiness, of course, is more ephemeral, less quantifiable, than coziness, though Mr. Wiking marshals some engaging behavioral-science data. Anticipation makes you happy: three days, it turns out, is the optimal amount of time for looking forward to stuff, according to one study. Coach passengers are more prone to rage if they have to walk through first class, according to a study that points out how the perception of inequality makes people unhappy. Volunteers are happier than nonvolunteers, and the self-employed are happier than those with bosses. Parents of young children are less happy than everyone else, but the level of their unhappiness varies depending on the social supports of whatever country they\u2019re in. In the United States, they are 12 percent less happy. In Denmark, which mandates a year of parental leave, two months leave to take care of a sick child and universal day care, the gap is just 3 percent.What makes Mr. Wiking happy, he writes, is leftover pizza.So why don\u2019t Danes smile more? Noting the \u201czombie death stare\u201d of his countrymen, Mr. Wiking wonders drolly if Denmark is truly a \u201c\u2018Resting Bitch Face\u2019 Nation,\u201d as he puts it. To find out, he has begun tracking the incidences of people smiling at home and abroad by sitting in cafes and watching passers-by. He and his colleagues have collected \u201c30,000 data points\u201d of smile frequencies in 20 countries around the world, which I think means they\u2019ve clocked the smiling or not smiling faces of 30,000 people.In fact, as he learns, Danes do smile occasionally, nearly 13 percent of the time, compared to New Yorkers, who smile less than 2 percent of the time. Everyone everywhere smiles less when they are alone, which may account for my city\u2019s low scores.The success of so many hyggelig titles would appear to have made Denmark\u2019s neighbors \u2014 particularly Sweden \u2014 jealous.In her book, Ms. Brantmark extols the behaviors of a modest Swedish life: sleeping naked, buying secondhand furniture, crafting, eating lots of herring. And practicing fika, otherwise known as a \u201ccoffee break,\u201d though Ms. Brantmark calls it \u201ca sacred Swedish social ritual meaning \u2018taking a break for coffee and enjoying a small treat.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cYou can literally do it anywhere\u201d (including the coffeeshop FIKA, which has locations all over Manhattan).Beyond an obsession with coffee breaks, Swedes have other appealingly modest habits, like taking their bed linens with them when they are houseguests, so their hosts don\u2019t have to do extra laundry, and eschewing both marriage and cohabitation in their relationships. There are cute names for these scenarios: Sambo is what you call your partner when you live together but don\u2019t marry; sarbo is what you call your beloved when you live apart.\u201cBeing together, but not too together,\u201d Ms. Brantmark explains.Karl Ove Knausgaard fans will not be surprised when Ms. Aurell suggests that one aspect of Norwegian behavior means never looking anyone in the eye and taking lots of hikes. To be Swedish, line up properly, she writes, with two meters between yourself and the next person. Do not make conversation.How to act like a Dane? Dress exclusively in black clothing and \u201cbe hygge superior.\u201dMs. Aurell introduces a phenomenon she calls janteloven \u2014 or, the law of jante \u2014 which has something to do with the town in a popular Scandinavian bildungsroman from the 1930s and seems to be a societal aversion to what the British call tall-poppy syndrome, in other words not putting on airs or thinking you\u2019re better than anyone else.That which \u201csparks joy\u201d \u2014 Ms. Kondo\u2019s criteria for what stays in your closet \u2014 in Ms. Magnusson\u2019s heart means a tender and witty reverie generated by an object before she gives it the heave-ho. Investigating her late husband\u2019s snickarbod (Swedish for toolshed and sometimes called a mansdagis, or male kindergarten) she marvels at its harmonious arrangements \u2014 chisel, level, rotary hammers, pliers and hacksaw frames, warrantees and instructions filed neatly in binders \u2014 and notes the erotic qualities of its oils, pumps and rubber valves.\u201cA master of order, my husband was,\u201d she writes, and then plucks out a hammer, some pliers, a yardstick and some screwdrivers, giving away the rest of his snickarbod to her children and their friends.She writes of the inability of men of her generation to cope with housekeeping after the death of a spouse, and notes how death cleaning has traditionally been women\u2019s work.\u201cWomen of my generation were brought up not to be in the way,\u201d she writes, \u201cto not trouble their surroundings with their presence. This is not the case with men, who take the space they are given for granted. My daughter sometimes says that I am so worried about being a nuisance that my worry itself becomes troublesome. Men don\u2019t think like I do, but they should. They too can be in the way.\u201dThose in Nordic countries may not be so unlike the rest of us, after all.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of a book.

Ms. Klobuchar, the Senate antitrust subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, asked for a hearing to ensure \u201cappropriate oversight.\u201dMr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, expressed confidence on Thursday about winning the approval of regulators.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dAs Hollywood began to get its head around the acquisition, it was seen as either the sad ending of an era or the exciting beginning of one.The film business has not seen significant consolidation in generations \u2014 perhaps not since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox, going on to deliver classics like \u201cHow Green Was My Valley,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and \u201cWall Street.\u201d Now that Disney is a content colossus, analysts expect a wave of Hollywood mergers, as companies like Viacom, CBS, Sony, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer look to gain scale.Filmmakers, writers and producers began to moan that all of their creative impulses would now be subject to algorithm approval.But others had the opposite perspective: By supersizing Disney \u2014 the only major pieces of 21st Century Fox not included in the deal were Fox News, the FS1 sports channel and the Fox broadcast network \u2014 Mr. Iger had engineered Hollywood\u2019s best chance for survival. After all, rather than being swallowed by a Silicon Valley giant, Fox\u2019s creative businesses will be managed by an entertainment veteran.\u201cWith this deal, Bob is really saying, \u2018You can all make bets on platforms and algorithms,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chernin said. \u201c\u2018I am going to make my bet on content and control how that content reaches consumers.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Long-Handled Tool", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWordplayTUESDAY PUZZLE \u2014 Today Andrew Kingsley gives us a minty fresh holiday puzzle that\u2019s bound to get you hooked. A grid that\u2019s not afraid to show its stripes; one that proudly hangs from the highest branch.Each of this puzzle\u2019s four corners displays an upside-down \u201cJ\u201d shape of either eight (north) or nine (south) circled squares (I\u2019m told the digital and print versions match). The \u201cJ\u201ds mirror each other on the vertical, so the eastern two are facing (and reading) backward as well. There is a hint entry at the dead center of the puzzle, 36A: \u201cChristmas tree decoration \u2026 or a hint to what the circled letters form.\u201d13D, \u201cTends to, as a cradle,\u201d isn\u2019t the most straightforward way to clue this entry, but the cradle part makes it pretty self-explanatory: ROCKS.15D: \u201cFlip call,\u201d if taken literally, gives you a 50/50 chance of entering \u201cheads\u201d or \u201ctails\u201d and being correct; any cross other than the S (my gimme was Kurt COBAIN) will assure you that the answer here is HEADS.52D: \u201cPotful for Winnie-the-Pooh\u201d is simple, unless you were raised by salmon, chickens or any other bear-fearing (arkoudaphobic) beings. It\u2019s HONEY.And 54D: \u201cSuccumb to pressure?\u201d has enough possible answers to need crosses again; I assumed \u201ccrack,\u201d since that would be the most standard answer, but the ? at the end of this clue is an indication of something beyond that; in this case, think of a balloon, perhaps; we\u2019re looking for BURST.I got very little help from these entries, and for that I give Mr. Kingsley credit. The first corner I filled in, at northeast, rang no bells: with RIG at 9A and HERA at 15A, the bubbles read AIRHEADS. After hassling through some crosses, however, I finally knew 36A was CANDY CANE; filling that in was my \u201caha\u201d moment. Even though I consider myself an aficionado of the sweet and artificial, the theme of this puzzle took a long time to unwrap.23A: \u201cRetro\u201d in the crossword is usually clued with something, like an era (\u201cdeco,\u201d for example) a haircut (\u201cbeehive,\u201d \u201cAfro\u201d mullet\u201d) or a fad (\u201clava lamp,\u201d \u201cpet rock\u201d). On its own, here, it actually clues a more stringent definition than the examples above, not that something was once trendy, but that it is also BACK IN. I had to use crosses for this, but I think it works.32A: \u201cSharper\u201d can be all sorts of things \u2014 more likely to cut you, less in-tune if you\u2019re thinking of music, tangier if you\u2019re thinking of cheese \u2014 but in this case it means more likely to outthink you. I was surprised to learn that the answer here, SAVVIER, is a Times puzzle debut; it seems like a great tough entry when you want to use some V\u2019s. (I heavily doubted myself at 27D, \u201cNetflix item,\u201d but apparently you can still get a DVD from them. Talk about RETRO).58A: I was convinced that \u201cThat would stink\u201d was bound to have a funny answer, since this puzzle\u2019s tone is a little offbeat. That, combined with completely muffing 40D, made this one of the last clues I filled in, and it\u2019s a bit more than offbeat to me, more toward head-scratching, but HOPE NOT does fit there. I mean, one does not hope for something, usually, to stink, does one?33D: Obscure filler alert, I say. First of all, does \u201cArchaeological handle\u201d refer to a place to hold a thing or the name of a thing? It really doesn\u2019t matter. The answer is ANSA, and it does refer to the first of the above possibilities. This word appears from time to time in the puzzle, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard anyone use it in idle chatter lately.40D: One of the first clues I blithely wrote in as I made an early pass at this puzzle was ARACHNE; that\u2019s what happens when you muddle your myths. I had exactly one letter right, and one fact. Arachne is \u201cin textiles\u201d; she\u2019s a weaver who got turned into a spider for being snotty to Athena. But ATROPOS is the \u201cFate who cuts the thread of life.\u201d No offense intended, please, Atropos.This puzzle is one in a string of themed puzzles I created this summer while directing a STEM summer camp \u2014 don\u2019t tell the campers. Having primarily constructed themeless puzzles thus far, and with the Friday/Saturday competition growing ever fiercer, I figured I\u2019d give themes a shot. With themelesses, there\u2019s always this nagging insecurity \u2014 How could my fill be snazzier? How can I pack in one more entry? But with themed puzzles, I\u2019ve enjoyed the pleasant finiteness to the four or five entries that undergird the grid.May there be more to come. Shout out to John Lieb for helping me tinker with this puzzle to find its sweet spot.What did you think?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Crown\u2019 Season 2 Takes the Queen From Crisis to Crisis", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThrough most of the 10-episode season on Netflix \u2014 the second installment in a proposed 60-episode series encompassing Elizabeth\u2019s long reign \u2014 the humiliations are closer to home, however.Here\u2019s a look at all the issues weighing on the royal mind going into Season 2.In the first season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d he had a great actor, John Lithgow, who enlivened things considerably with his shambling, towering presence as Winston Churchill (even if he probably wasn\u2019t quite right for the role). Season 2 misses Mr. Lithgow, as well as Jared Harris, who played Elizabeth\u2019s father, George VI.That puts the focus more than ever on Ms. Foy. And while she is quite capable, her strengths are those of impeccability: Each thought, each idea is clearly delineated in her face and posture. She makes sure we don\u2019t miss anything, and she\u2019s engaging, but she doesn\u2019t pack that much of an emotional punch.Season 2 does have its moving and exciting moments, achieved with the help of capable directors like Philippa Lowthorpe and Benjamin Caron. A complicated sequence in which the louche photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones (Matthew Goode) shoots a portrait of a swooning Margaret, his future wife, while Elizabeth and Philip retire to separate beds, is cleverly handled. Ms. Lowthorpe wonderfully stages an episode-closing shot of Elizabeth and the Queen Mother (Victoria Hamilton) putting on smiles and going down a receiving line of commoners, invited into Buckingham Palace for the first time.And because it\u2019s a British prestige production, \u201cThe Crown\u201d is dotted with stellar supporting performances. Jeremy Northam finds humor in the smug self-regard of Anthony Eden, the prime minister who succeeds Churchill. Mr. Goode was born to play the seductive Armstrong-Jones and Greg Wise is good as Philip\u2019s uncle, Dickie Mountbatten. In a small role as the unhappy wife of Philip\u2019s private secretary, Chloe Pirrie (a vivid Emily Bront\u00eb in \u201cTo Walk Invisible\u201d) effortlessly conveys the rage and frustration you suspect Elizabeth must also be feeling.Not everything Mr. Morgan tries works \u2014 an episode involving Elizabeth\u2019s complicated feelings toward Jacqueline Kennedy, and a plot contrivance in which Philip is more closely linked to the Profumo scandal than history would suggest, don\u2019t pan out. But the pleasures of high-class melodrama are always present, as is the comforting notion \u2014 increasingly hard to believe \u2014 that our leaders can be compassionate, intelligent and exceedingly well behaved.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Wormwood\u2019 Confirms That Errol Morris Is Our Great Cinematic Sleuth", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe circumstances of his death \u2014 initially classified as an accident \u2014 remained murky until 1975, when Olson\u2019s family received an explanation and an apology from the government. His widow and three children were offered a monetary settlement and given an audience at the White House with President Ford. It was disclosed that Olson had been unwittingly dosed with LSD as part of a secret C.I.A. experiment, and that a bad reaction to the drug had caused him to commit suicide.This widely reported revelation was shocking at the time, but it also belonged to a welcome moment of post-Vietnam, post-Watergate reckoning with official lies and secrets. What happened to Olson was surely regrettable, but the belated official acknowledgment of wrongdoing could be seen as commendable. Everyone involved was sorry, and it wouldn\u2019t happen again.Varying his usual head-on methods, Mr. Morris often films himself and Mr. Olson in a two-shot, facing each other across a room in Mr. Olson\u2019s childhood home. A clock on the wall is permanently stopped between 2:30 and 2:35, the approximate time of Frank Olson\u2019s death. The conversations \u2014 at times strangely buoyant, given the gravity of the topics under discussion \u2014 are interwoven with old photographs, home movies and television clips.They also, more strikingly, give way to re-enactments of what is known or believed to have happened in the days just before and after Frank Olson\u2019s death. Peter Sarsgaard plays him as a troubled man with a sensitive face and a gentle demeanor, and he\u2019s surrounded by other well-known character actors (including Bob Balaban and Tim Blake Nelson) in what can feel like a lost, unfinished Hitchcock movie. The world of the 1950s is a somber swirl of cigarette smoke and dark shadows, where people speak in whispered riddles, drink martinis and drive around in hulking automobiles. Olson seems like a quintessentially Hitchcockian wrong man, a relative innocent sucked into a vortex of conspiracy and preyed upon by men with sinister agendas and dubious scruples.Eric Olson, who has a Ph.D in psychology from Harvard, does not come across as temperamentally prone to obsession, or intellectually inclined toward conspiracy theories. His fundamental sanity makes his story all the more heartbreaking: like Hamlet, he has been driven to the brink of madness by doubts and suspicions that no amount of investigation can assuage. Mr. Morris, one of the great sleuths of modern cinema (who many years ago worked as a private detective), brings to \u201cWormwood\u201d a long acquaintance with the slipperiness of truth and the deceptions of power. He listens with the patient attentiveness of a therapist and the quizzical intensity of a gumshoe.\u201cWormwood\u201d is haunted by doubleness. It\u2019s a work of journalism and of imagination, of history and portraiture, of indignation and melancholy. (It\u2019s also, simultaneously, a movie and a mini-series, streaming in six episodes on Netflix.) As such, it takes time to absorb, and invites repeated, obsessive watching. Mr. Olson and Mr. Morris make claims that are vitally important \u2014 about the credibility of the United States government during the Cold War and ever since \u2014 in a spirit that seems more weary than urgent.

{"Headline": "Disney Makes $52.4 Billion Deal for 21st Century Fox in Big Bet on Streaming", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 In a move that will reverberate from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to TVs and smartphones around the world, the Walt Disney Company said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, the empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $52.4 billion.Disney has already announced an ambitious plan to introduce two streaming services by 2019. With this deal and the wealth of movies, TV shows and sports programming it provides, the company will now have the muscle to challenge Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook in the fast-growing realm of online video.\u201cThe pace of disruption has only hastened,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive and chairman, said in an interview. \u201cThis will allow us to greatly accelerate our direct-to-consumer strategy, which is our highest priority.\u201dBut lately, as most of Hollywood has, 20th Century Fox has struggled to keep pace with the changing way younger audiences view content \u2014 namely on an internet-connected device. Some analysts interpreted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sudden willingness to sell as his reading the writing on the wall: The business climate is going to become tougher for old-line Hollywood.Not included in the acquisition: Fox News, the Fox broadcast network and the FS1 sports cable channel. In the news release announcing the Disney deal, Mr. Murdoch said he would spin those businesses and a handful of other properties, including the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, which Disney is not buying, into a newly listed company. Mr. Murdoch also still controls his newspaper-focused company, News Corporation, which has holdings that include The Wall Street Journal.The deal got its start with a casual get-together over the summer at Moraga Vineyards, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s Bel Air winery. There, Mr. Iger and Mr. Murdoch chatted about the way technology was roiling the media business, according to Mr. Iger, who came away thinking \u2014 to his surprise \u2014 that Mr. Murdoch might be open to a merger discussion. Mr. Iger said he called him a few weeks later in August to propose more serious talks.There was at least one due-diligence meeting at Mr. Murdoch\u2019s apartment in Manhattan with senior management. As the agreement was being completed on Tuesday, Mr. Iger had lunch with Mr. Murdoch in London. (Mr. Iger was in town for a premiere of \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi,\u201d which arrives in theaters on Friday.)\u201cI know a lot of people are wondering, \u2018Why did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u2019\u201d Mr. Murdoch said on a conference call with investors. \u201cAre we retreating? Absolutely not. We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.\u201dMr. Murdoch\u2019s older son, Lachlan, 21st Century Fox\u2019s executive chairman, added that the move was \u201cabout returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive challenger brand\u201d that would be \u201cfocused at the beginning on must-watch news and live sports.\u201dThere has been speculation that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s other son, James, who is chief executive of 21st Century Fox, would join Disney in a senior role. Mr. Iger told investors on a conference call that that had not yet been decided.\u201cHe will be integral to helping us integrate these companies over the next number of months,\u201d Mr. Iger said. \u201cOver that time, he and I will continue to discuss whether there is a role for him here or not.\u201dThe Murdochs declined an interview request.Mr. Iger is buying 21st Century Fox\u2019s minority stake in Hulu, resulting in majority control of the streaming service by Disney, which previously owned 30 percent. Comcast and Time Warner also have stakes in Hulu.The Disney-Fox merger is happening as the Justice Department fights AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner in court. Mr. Iger acknowledged that antitrust regulators would heavily scrutinize Disney\u2019s purchase but expressed confidence about winning their approval. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that President Trump had spoken with Rupert Murdoch and \u201ccongratulated him\u201d on the deal.\u201cIf they look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Iger said, \u201cthey should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways.\u201dWhen Mr. Iger announced Disney\u2019s streaming strategy in September, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to launch big, and we\u2019re going to launch hot.\u201d At the time, his comment was viewed in Hollywood as old-fashioned showboating.Not anymore.To augment ESPN Plus, Disney is adding 21st Century Fox\u2019s chain of 22 regional cable networks dedicated to sports, including the YES Network, which carries New York Yankees games.As part of the deal, Disney will also get the FX and National Geographic cable networks, and stakes in two behemoth overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. That component of the deal would seem to contradict Disney\u2019s push to lessen its reliance on traditional television, a business built on third-party cable subscriptions that is now in decline as people turn to streaming services for home entertainment.With the acquisition, \u201cDisney goes from being a juggernaut to being a megajuggernaut,\u201d Steven Cahall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Cahall and other analysts said the acquisition would likely prompt other entertainment companies to join forces as a competitive maneuver. Speculation immediately surrounded Viacom and CBS, which share common ownership; Lionsgate, which owns Starz; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which controls rights to the James Bond franchise; and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has struggled with low box office market share.But pulling off the acquisition of 21st Century Fox dwarfs those deals and will create complex integration challenges. Some executives who work at Fox\u2019s studio offices in Los Angeles have been complaining bitterly about the prospect of Disney cost-cutting. Disney said it expected the acquisition to yield at least $2 billion in total cost savings.And though Mr. Iger played down any antitrust issues, others in Hollywood have already disagreed.\u201cThe antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant,\u201d the screenwriters\u2019 union, the Writers Guild of America West, said in a statement on Monday, calling media consolidation a \u201crelentless drive to eliminate competition.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "MoviePass Adds a Million Subscribers, Even if Theaters Aren\u2019t Sold on It", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet attendance was flat at North American cinemas in 2016, and analysts are predicting a 4 percent decline in 2017, bringing ticket sales to a 22-year low.Perhaps something more radical is necessary.It may be time to get on board: MoviePass said this month that it had signed up more than one million subscribers in just four months. It took Netflix more than three years to reach that level when it started selling low-priced subscriptions for DVD rentals in 1999. Spotify was relatively quick, at five months in 2011. It took Hulu 10 months to reach one million later that year.\u201cWe\u2019re actually shocked,\u201d Mr. Lowe said. \u201cWe seem to have hit a nerve in America.\u201dUnder the MoviePass business model, theaters get paid full price for every admission. People who sign up receive a membership card that functions like a debit card. When members want to see a movie (no more than one a day) they use a MoviePass smartphone app to check in at the theater. The app instantly transfers the price of a ticket to the membership card. Members in turn use the card to pay for entry. It all works independently of theaters, sometimes to their chagrin.The blistering growth has prompted new criticism from theaters and studio owners \u2014 namely that MoviePass will never be able to make money by charging $9.95 a month when a single ticket can cost almost twice that amount. They say that will cause MoviePass to either raise prices or go out of business, disappointing audiences and ultimately hurting the fragile multiplex business.Mr. Farnsworth said, \u201cWhen you apply computer science and machine learning to an industry that we believe has lacked significant innovation, useful patterns start to emerge.\u201d If MoviePass gets big enough, it could try to demand that chain theaters sell tickets at a discount or share a slice of their concession revenue.Helios recently raised $60 million for the expansion of MoviePass, which expects to have more than three million subscribers by the end of next year. Monthly subscriber retention is roughly 96 percent, Mr. Lowe said. About 75 percent of MoviePass users are millennials, a group that Hollywood has struggled to turn into avid moviegoers.\u201cMillennials understand us because they grew up on subscription,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.Dan Steven, 34, signed up for MoviePass in October. Mr. Steven, who lives in Orlando, Fla., said he had gone to \u201cmaybe one movie a month\u201d before he became a subscriber. In November, he went 12 times.\u201cI used to only go if it was clearly worth buying a ticket \u2014 something big-screen worthy, a spectacle or a movie with a lot of effects,\u201d he said. \u201cI would skip the undercard movies. I would just wait until they came out on Netflix.\u201d\u201cThis is something that has to happen, in part because consumers are demanding it,\u201d Jim Gianopulos, chairman of Paramount Pictures, said at an investor conference in September.MoviePass, which has been around since 2011, struggled to gain traction in its early years because of pricing ($50 a month, later lowered to $35) and pushback from exhibitors, who worried that a subscription service would undermine per-ticket pricing. By early 2017, MoviePass was trundling along as a fringe service; it had about 20,000 users in the United States.When Mr. Lowe and Mr. Farnsworth drastically lowered the price, people started signing up en masse.To a degree, the service depends on traditional subscription economics: More people pay than go. The model starts to get more complicated, however, when you consider the price of movie tickets.So far, none of the major studios have signed on as clients, and no studio executive contacted for this article would comment on the record. Mr. Lowe said MoviePass had been \u201cmaking huge progress with content owners\u201d and had signed up a small studio as a partner, but he declined to provide details.The big theater chains have held their ground, although AMC recently softened its stance. A bit.\u201cWe appreciate their business,\u201d Adam Aron, AMC\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts last month. But Mr. Aron added, \u201cAMC has absolutely no intention \u2014 I repeat, no intention \u2014 of sharing any \u2014 I repeat, any \u2014 of our admissions revenue or our concessions revenue.\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s getting a bad rap in some circles, but we love MoviePass,\u201d said Brian Schultz, Studio Movie Grill\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSome people aren\u2019t sure they want to pay $10 to $12 to see a movie like \u2018Lady Bird.\u2019 MoviePass takes out that hurdle.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated attendance trends at North American cinemas in 2015.

{"Headline": "Hillsong Unites Believers and Those Old Agnostics John, Paul, George and Ringo", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than a thousand worshipers attended a Pentecostal singalong whose set list included Beatles hits like \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love\u201d and \u201cHere Comes the Sun.\u201dThe Beatles did not have a great relationship with Jesus Christ.Hillsong, a Pentecostal megachurch that was founded more than 30 years ago in Sydney and spread on the back of a hugely successful Christian recording label, has between 9,000 and 10,000 members in New York \u2014 most of them young, racially diverse and screamingly fashionable.On Sunday, more than 2,300 of them packed the 2,200-seat Hammerstein Ballroom for the first of two evening services, after which was to come a musical production.Within the next hour, they would witness a production that used the Beatles\u2019s oeuvre to tell the story of the three kings who visited the baby Christ, a kind of mash-up of \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d and the nativity story. Most of them had no idea.Karen Ruiz was one of many millennial faithful in the crowd who did not know what to expect. Originally from Colombia, Ms. Ruiz, 27, was raised evangelical and intent on finding a religious community when she moved to New York.\u201cI just Googled churches in New York, and this was the first option that came up,\u201d she said.It stands to reason that someone at Hillsong has mastered SEO. The church has made inroads with digitally-savvy young professionals in more than 20 cities worldwide, including four in the United States. Its New York members are WeWork employees, N.Y.U. musical theater majors, social media mavens, life coaches and Netflix actors.The show went quickly. The three kings reached Joseph and Mary, both played by black actors, within the initial minutes. Mr. Finochio and the other performers interspersed dialogue and sermon, performing versions of \u201cBlackbird\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Buy Me Love,\u201d during which Mary handed Baby Jesus to a responsible reindeer so she could cut a rug with Joseph.As George Harrison\u2019s \u201cHere Comes the Sun\u201d played to celebrate Jesus\u2019s return from Egypt, the crowd on the second-floor balcony turned on their cellphone flashlights to mimic candles and waved their arms in devotion.The band\u2019s lyrics and arrangements were largely left alone; the Beatles may have talked a big old atheist game, but it\u2019s not difficult to see the religiosity in their songs. (At least, apparently, the ones Ringo didn\u2019t have a hand in.)Mr. Finochio\u2019s final monologue was his most heartfelt. He started from the premise that God was better than Santa Claus, because He answers to need while Papa No\u00ebl is purely a people-pleaser, before offering a prayer over the congregation, asking that Jesus deliver a supernatural breakthrough in 2018, as well as plenty of jobs and promotions.Backstage after the show, Mr. Finochio, who has Christ-length hair and a deadpan sense of humor, admitted that he had been so nervous that he verged on panic. His production came together with many happy accidents, including a notably diverse cast that reflected Hillsong\u2019s membership. Had he meant to imply that baby Jesus \u2014 swaddled in blankets and barely perceptible \u2014 was black, too?\u201cThe Holy Spirit is technically his biological father so he would be mixed-race,\u201d Mr. Finochio said.He was thoughtful when asked why he thought that millennials, who are stereotypically averse to institutions, religious or otherwise, were attracted to Hillsong. He quoted something often attributed to St. Augustine \u2014 \u201cthe church is a whore, but she is my mother\u201d \u2014 and said that skepticism for the church was health. He seemed less able to explain the attraction.But he said that the joy displayed in the show was a fitting example of Hillsong\u2019s appeal.\u201cSometimes Christians suck at partying,\u201d he said, pointing out that a group of people who feel assured that they are going to heaven should have less trouble lightening up. \u201cChristians should be known as the biggest partyers in the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
