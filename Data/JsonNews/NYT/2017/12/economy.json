{"Headline": "Fear and Prejudice in Bollywood", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMUMBAI, India \u2014 On Dec. 1, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, one of the most opulent and operatic filmmakers in Bollywood, was releasing his movie \u201cPadmavati,\u201d which is based on a mythical Hindu queen. Two weeks before the theatrical release, some Hindu activists from the Rajput warrior caste declared that the movie hurt the sentiments of their community by depicting a Muslim king lusting after a Rajput queen. And they could not permit that to be shown under any circumstance.Alauddin Khilji did fight and defeat the Rajput king of Chittor in Rajasthan in the early 14th century. Queen Padmavati, however, never existed.The legend of Padmavati was born more than two centuries after Khilji\u2019s death. Malik Muhammad Jayasi, a Sufi Muslim poet, created the character of Padmavati in an epic poem he wrote in the mid-16th century.The trailer of the movie suggests that Mr. Bhansali has portrayed Khilji as a savage despite historians\u2019 rather complimentary assessments. Mr. Bhansali\u2019s Khilji has shoulder-length hair, eyes lined with black kohl, and several scars adding menace to his face. He rides furiously ahead of a mighty invading army, pounds men to dust in wrestling matches, bares his teeth after psychopathic laughter and lustily chomps on a massive chunk of meat.The protests around the movie helped create the myth of Hindu sentiments being under siege. Even a fictional queen and a Muslim king have become tools to garner Hindu votes. Fabricating a hostile \u201cother\u201d helps retain power. The methodology has been transparent \u2014 generate fear and hatred, and use those to legitimate violence.Because Bollywood movies are widely publicized and occupy a significant place in everyday conversation, they become perfect targets to generate instant publicity for the groups or individuals attacking them. Bollywood has developed a justifiable sense of being left to the wolves; the state has almost never shown any inclination to prevent or curb violence against films.The film industry itself has failed to offer a unified, collective response. The biggest stars and the most influential filmmakers have stayed silent. There have been no calls for strikes and protests, no appeals for boycotts or shutdowns. They see such attacks as specific to the film, its actors and filmmaker. It doesn\u2019t concern itself about the broader principles of creative freedom.The fear of a mob at their glamorous gates is a factor in their silence but Bollywood stars and producers also have a long history of acquiescence and cowardice in their dealings with power. The assault on Mr. Bhansali\u2019s movie illustrates a bleak scenario where Bollywood\u2019s anxiety about extraconstitutional censorship will weigh heavily on its creative choices. It might just fall back on the old formula of romances and comedies with song and dance routines.Anjum Rajabali has written several Hindi movies and heads the screenwriting program at the Whistling Woods International film school in Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Touts Border Arrests as Proof of Crackdown on Illegal Immigration", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration claimed victory on Tuesday in its crackdown on illegal immigration during its first several months, announcing that the number of arrests at the border dropped to the lowest in nearly a half-century as proof that its deterrence efforts have been effective.Border Patrol agents arrested 310,531 people trying to enter the country illegally during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, a 25 percent decrease from the previous fiscal year. About one-third were from Mexico, according to the Border Patrol. Most of the rest were from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.Inside the United States, officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement also arrested 143,470 people, a 25 percent increase over the previous fiscal year, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said. The increase comes after the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era policy that only targeted those with criminal records.\u201cWe have clearly seen the successful results of the president\u2019s commitment to supporting the front-line officers and agents of D.H.S. as they enforce the law and secure our borders,\u201d said Elaine C. Duke, the acting Homeland Security secretary.The drop in border apprehensions and increase in interior arrests represent President Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to more aggressively enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws by unleashing the full force of the Department of Homeland Security to find, arrest and deport those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes.Many agents at Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement felt that they were constrained by Obama administration rules that allowed them to go after only dangerous criminals. Unions representing workers from both agencies endorsed Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.The department now has stepped up efforts to publicize crimes by immigrants, enlist local police officers for the effort, erect new detention facilities, discourage asylum seekers and, ultimately, speed up deportations.The release of the year-end border enforcement and immigrant arrest data came a day after the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Trump's ban on travel to the United State by most citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, along with some groups of people from Venezuela, can go into effect while efforts to block it proceed in the courts. The ban had been blocked by lower courts.Although Homeland Security officials touted the overall drop in arrests, they did note that, since May, arrest had ticked up, mainly because of families and unaccompanied children from Central America trying to escape violence and instability caused by fighting between drug cartels, a yearslong trend.Customs officers at airports, land crossings and seaports also denied entry to 216,370 people, a nearly 25 percent decline from 2016. Customs officers stationed abroad stopped more than 15,000 people from boarding flights to the United States, officials said.Under Trump administration policy, undocumented immigrants are eligible for arrest and deportation unless they are protected under a program such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama administration policy that allows some individuals who entered the country as minors to live and work in the country without fear of deportation.Mr. Trump ended the program in September and called on Congress to pass a replacement before he begins phasing out its protections in six months.Local officials and immigration advocates say the Trump administration\u2019s policies have put immigrant communities on edge, with people afraid to go to school, report domestic violence, attend church or even seek medical attention.Congress has so far declined to provide funding for many of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including an increase the number of border agents and deportation officers and money to pay for a border wall.\u201cWe have an obligation to uphold the integrity of our immigration system, but we must do more to step up and close loopholes to protect the American worker, our economy, and our communities,\u201d Ms. Duke said.Advertisement"}

Television commercials are running in key districts. On Tuesday, evangelical Christians supporting the immigrants were arrested after demonstrating outside the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan.With their future now in jeopardy, a wide range of well-organized, well-financed supporters are lining up behind the Dreamers, including celebrities, philanthropists, religious groups and pillars of corporate America.Republicans control Congress but cannot keep the government running without Democrats, and several Democrats have said they will not vote for a spending bill unless it also resolves the plight of the immigrants. \u201cWe will not leave here without a DACA fix,\u201d Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, said on Thursday.The multipronged campaign to help the young immigrants underscores how much the country has come to identify with them and how extensively they have been integrated into the economy. Many Republicans have joined Democrats in supporting DACA beneficiaries, and polls show overwhelming support for them. It is no longer politically risky to get behind them.In a recent conference call with religious leaders who supported helping the immigrants, one Republican, Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois, told them he would support legislation to shield the immigrants from deportation only if it came with enhanced border measures. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Roskam\u2019s office said his view had not changed.The mobilization began in September, as soon as the Trump administration announced the repeal of the deferred-action program.The companies, which have a substantial lobbying presence in Washington, began leveraging relationships with lawmakers from districts where they have major operations. In mid-November, a lobbying blitz on Capitol Hill involved officials from 40 large companies introducing DACA recipients who work for their firms to lawmakers.\u201cWe held dozens of meetings with members of Congress from both parties and we heard consistently that they want a solution,\u201d said Christopher Padilla, vice president of government affairs for IBM, which employs more than 30 DACA recipients. He added that the company wanted lawmakers to \u201cgive Dreamers the clarity and stability they deserve.\u201dAmong those photographed was a DACA recipient named Laura Cruz, a public-health major who clutched the cap and gown she had just picked up to wear at her December graduation. Given the uncertainty over her future, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to decide what to do next.\u201dDavis Darnsman, a junior studying corporate communications, said his best friend had received DACA protection. He also said he would be amenable to bolstered border security. \u201cThere has to some compromise that can be made to benefit everybody,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, the dozens of evangelical Christians who gathered outside Mr. Ryan\u2019s office bore boxes stuffed with cards on which young immigrants in their communities had written messages relating their \u201cdreams.\u201d Several protesters poured the cards onto the floor as if they were an offering, then knelt, prayed and sang \u201cSilent Night\u201d before being arrested on civil disobedience charges.Cheryl Miller, a lifelong Republican who had traveled from rural Texas to the demonstration, said, \u201cThis is the first time I have done anything like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Takes More Than Bluster to Brexit", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDUBLIN \u2014 This month, as Arctic winds have swept down through Britain, Brexit has led the government of Prime Minister Theresa May into a blizzard of humiliations.It is two weeks since the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which is propping up Mrs. May\u2019s minority government, made a show of her. She was in Brussels for a working lunch, about to smile her way through the carefully choreographed announcement of a deal that guaranteed \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But Mrs. May was called offstage to take a call from the leader of the D.U.P., Arlene Foster, who told her that the party would not tolerate a deal that distinguished Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain. Ms. Foster\u2019s concern was that the deal would effectively move the border to the Irish Sea, creating the illusion that Ireland was united and separate from \u201cthe mainland.\u201d That would be anathema to unionists, for whom the border that winds across the island of Ireland is the last frontier of the empire. (The D.U.P. has loved the way that Brexit, with its strutting nationalism, has brought out in the rest of the Britain the Union Jacks that festoon the parts of Northern Ireland that are loyal to the queen.)Four intense days after the D.U.P.\u2019s intervention, the European Union and Britain reached a new deal that weakened the British Brexiters\u2019 position, strengthened that of the Irish government and had the support of the rest of the bloc. This time it spelled out that there would be \u201cfull alignment\u201d between Britain and Ireland in relation to the rules of the single market and the customs union; and that Northern Ireland\u2019s peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement, would be honored.But Brexit Secretary David Davis promptly and breezily confided on a British television show that this hard-won deal was \u201cmuch more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing.\u201dThe Brexit that is taking shape around the hapless Mrs. May is not the one hard-line Brexiters promised when they vowed to \u201ctake back control.\u201d Locking the door on migrants and free trade with purveyors of chlorinated chickens look increasingly unlikely. To avoid making a special case of Northern Ireland, Britain has been forced already to concede a \u201csoft Brexit.\u201d In effect, it is going to be stuck with European Union rules \u2014 it just won\u2019t have any say in making them.Faced now with the requirement of stating its plans in language capable of being turned into laws and protocols, the government looks more and more foolish. Mrs. May\u2019s attempts to stride purposefully on the international stage look increasingly like someone floundering, lost, through the snow.There were a few emollient words for the prime minister before she was sent home across the English Channel on Thursday, but they just sounded patronizing. Any embarrassment over a debacle authored entirely by Britain is looked upon coldly. If the country makes a fool of itself, all the better \u2014 an unedifying spectacle is sure to discourage other restless member states down the road.If Mrs. May and her blustering crew represent the best of British diplomacy, then post-Brexit Britain will be a sorry state.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Christmas Eve in Ukraine, the Church Is Chilly (or Is It?)", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI celebrated Christmas with relatives in the village of Shutromynsti. There were many courses, multiple toasts, piercing memories and joyful singing.The 12 of us around the kitchen table said our prayers individually in hushed tones.Michael Ziatyk, the 73-year-old head of the household, dipped his spoon into the large bowl of wheat porridge at the center of the table and twice swept it from side to side in the sign of the cross, then ate a spoonful mixed with nuts, poppy seeds and honey. In turn, we also dipped our spoons and ate, a family communion of sorts.This meal marked the beginning of the second of three \u201choly suppers\u2019\u2019 my wife and I shared with relatives on Christmas Eve, on Jan. 6 of this year, in the small Ukrainian village of Shutromynsti. (Ukrainians who are Greek Catholic and Eastern Orthodox usually celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7 because they follow the old Julian calendar as opposed to the newer Gregorian calendar.)Each meal consisted of 12 vegetarian and pescatarian dishes ranging from salads and golubsi, rice and nuts stuffed in rolled cabbage leaves, to slices of herring and varenyky, dumplings filled with potato or cabbage.My relatives believe souls of the dead visit on Christmas Eve, the reason I was urged to nibble on a garlic clove to ward off any spirits who might be evil. Garlic cloves also were tucked beneath the corners of the tablecloth for the same purpose. Some food is left out overnight for the good souls \u2014 much like treats for Santa Claus in America. Food from the meal also is shared with the family\u2019s pigs and cows because they provide sustenance during the year.Since my relatives are Greek Catholic we could have attended a one-hour Christmas Eve mass. But my second cousin Olena Ziatyk, 76, who walks with a cane, opted for the village\u2019s other church, fittingly named St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas also is the patron saint of the village. The three-and-a-half hour Ukrainian Orthodox Divine Liturgy, she said, would allow her time to meditate about her life, her soul.The opportunity to meet and spend the holiday with Olena, her two brothers and their extended families fulfilled a quest that began years ago when I found a packet of letters and photographs that belonged to my late mother.A sister of Olena\u2019s grandfather, my mother Eva Stricharchuk ((maiden name, Ziatyk), had emigrated as a child to the United States in 1910. The oldest letters date to 1939. The most recent, a Christmas greeting from Olena in the early 1960s, asked my mother to visit one of Ukraine\u2019s larger cities. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll come so that we will come and see you,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in Ukrainian. My mom never made the trip.Last November, after a five-hour train ride to western Ukraine, where I met up with a translator who drove us another two hours in his car, we pulled into Olena\u2019s village for the first time \u2014 after several stops to allow women herding cows to cross the main road. There is no commercial area, just a community center that occasionally opens for dances. Like others in the village, Olena\u2019s family tends to plots of land where they raise potatoes and other vegetables.After hugs and three kisses on our cheeks Olena showed us her chickens and a shed where she kept a cow and four pigs, including one destined to be slaughtered for Christmas dinner. The main house, separate from a building where food is prepared for the family and the animals, is among a dozen in the village of 400 people that have indoor plumbing and Wi-Fi.I also learned why the Ziatyks were living in the Ternopil oblast when the village listed on my mother\u2019s baptism record was some 225 miles to the west, in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in what had been the Austro-Hungarian empire.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to leave they threatened to burn you in your house,\u2019\u2019 said Olena, who was six years old when her family was moved. The homes of 250 people who lived in Solinka were set ablaze. One family member claimed he was Polish in the hope he would be allowed to stay. He was tied to the tail of a horse and dragged through the village, Olena said. Paralyzed by his injuries, he died five years ago.The Ziatyks had left behind 10 hectares of land (roughly 25 acres) and a sizable house, according to a document Olena showed me. They also lost most of their possessions and animals, except for one horse, she said.The house the Soviets assigned them, long since replaced, had previously been the home of two Jewish brothers and their families. They were among nearly a dozen Jews from the village who were murdered by Nazis. Olena told the story of the village\u2019s last Jew, a 10-year-old boy who kissed the boots of Nazi soldiers and pleaded to be spared. \u201cThey shot him anyway,\u2019\u2019 she said.At 14, Olena began working at the nearby kolkhoz, a Soviet collective farm, raising beets and tobacco, a job that spanned more than 40 years \u2014 until the fall of the Soviet Union.After I walked through the kolkhoz\u2019s dilapidated buildings and a church where the Soviets stored fertilizers and chemicals I asked Olena what her life was like. Some days she said she got by on little more than two and a half hours of sleep and earned as little as 18 cents a day, enough for bread. She said she once worked an entire summer for which her father received a shirt.When the Soviet Union collapsed, she said, so too did the village\u2019s economy, as people like Olena who depended on the state lost their jobs. In rural Ukraine employment has never recovered. People routinely take jobs in other countries.Olena\u2019s son-in-law, a grandson and another villager, for example, make their living driving workers to and from Warsaw, a trip that can take up to 12 hours one way. Other family members have lived and worked in Italy, England and the United States. Some only return once or twice a year. Olena, who was married briefly and resumed using her maiden name, lives on a government pension of about $40 a month, or roughly one-fifth the average Ukrainian worker\u2019s monthly earnings.In the 1950s and 1960s I remember tagging along with my mother to send packages of clothing to the Ziatyks. My mother told me she always sent three of each item, suspecting the packages would be pilfered as they moved through customs.The packages also made recipients targets for harassment because the Soviets did not want Americans knowing how dire life was behind the Iron Curtain. At one point Soviet agents demanded that Olena sign a document declaring she no longer wanted the packages. Doing so would have meant future packages would have been returned, marked addressee unknown.Olena declined.\u201cI told them if I signed my name my father would kill me,\u201d she said. They apparently believed her. Her father had a reputation for being fearless \u2014 threatening to use his ax to chop the head off a government official who demanded paperwork authorizing the purchase of materials the family used to build their house. During World War II he had suffered gunshot wounds to an arm and leg while serving as a soldier in the Soviet army.After our last Christmas Eve meal we rested for two hours, then bundled up for the 11 p.m. church service.The wind stung our faces \u2014 the temperature was barely above 1 degree \u2014 as we walked through crunchy snow to the church, built around 1800 by an Austrian miller for whom the village is named. In my thick parka and scarf, my hands inside double pairs of gloves in my pockets, I tried to ignore the cold by focusing on the blinking red and blue Christmas lights adorning the altar, the icons of saints and the joyful singing. Many of the women and girls at the front of the church wore bright red and green scarves and sang as passionately and loudly as the choir in the loft above us.When the priest moved to the center of the church, not far from where I stood, I could see his breath as he recited the liturgy. After about an hour and a half, my wife tugged on my coat, the signal to leave. We were both chilled to the bone.At the Christmas meal the following day meat dishes such as holodets, pork or chicken embedded in gelatin; blood sausage and kielbasa; and smoked pork sausages were served along with the same fare as the night before. Nearly everyone remarked about how warm the church had been the night before.I could see the priest\u2019s breath, I replied.No, they said, it was warm.An earlier version of this article gave an erroneous conversion from hectares to acres. Ten hectares are roughly 25 acres, not five.Advertisement"}

The volcano has since calmed down, at least outwardly, and the airport has reopened. But Ubud, a popular destination about 20 miles southwest of the volcano, has seen a sharp drop in visitors, as has much of the rest of Bali, Indonesia\u2019s top tourism spot.\u201cBusiness is superbad at the moment,\u201d said Mr. Yanjun, 35, who has been driving a taxi for seven years. \u201cIt is a very uncertain situation for us now.\u201dWhile nearly all of Bali\u2019s resort hotels and tourist attractions are well outside the danger zone, uncertainty over future eruptions and possible airport closings has prompted many travelers to cancel planned trips to Bali or avoid it altogether.Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardhana Sukawati, head of Bali\u2019s hotel and restaurant association, said that the island\u2019s hotel occupancy rate is now at 20 percent, compared with 60 percent this time last year.Bali\u2019s normally crowded beaches had only a handful of visitors Thursday and hotels were offering steep discounts to lure travelers back.That does not bode well for the tourism outlook as the island heads into what would normally be a busy holiday season.\u201cUncertainty is as much an enemy to the regional tourism industry as the actual eruptions,\u201d said Keith Loveard, a senior analyst at the Jakarta-based firm Concord Consulting.Also affected is the neighboring island of Lombok, an increasingly popular tourist destination. Its airport has also been forced to close at times because of volcanic ash in the air, which can damage an airplane\u2019s engine.Arief Yahya, Indonesia\u2019s minister of tourism, said last week that Bali would lose about $665 million through the end of November because of the volcanic activity, which started increasing noticeably in September.Indonesia is unlikely to make its target of 15 million visitors this year, he said. The country\u2019s goal of 20 million visitors by 2019 is also in jeopardy.Ubud, a picturesque town in the foothills, is surrounded by rice paddies and is popular with foreign tourists. On a clear day, Mount Agung is visible from some parts of town.The town center is full of art galleries, clothing stores, coffee shops, spas and yoga studios. Normally, the main street is choked with traffic and its sidewalks crowded with pedestrians.But now, Ubud\u2019s hotels and shops have few customers and the streets are uncharacteristically devoid of traffic. Tour buses, typically ubiquitous, have vanished.Sales clerks, waiters and spa workers sit in front of their empty establishments, chatting with each other and offering their services to the occasional tourist who walks by.Many worry whether they will be able to keep their jobs.\u201cThis is the quietest I have ever seen Ubud,\u201d said Dewa Septiana, 25, a barista at a coffee shop. \u201cUsually this street will be full of traffic. But since the airport closing last week, it has been empty here. Very empty.\u201dI Made Gunarta, 53, who operates the Yoga Barn, a yoga studio and guesthouse, said that his yoga classes typically attract 50 students but now have 20. The guesthouse usually has 80 percent occupancy but is now only half full.He is concerned that he may not be able to keep all of his 250 employees.\u201cThe impact of the eruption is very huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis definitely will hit the economy. The people who will be affected most by this situation are the people with the lowest income.\u201dSome Balinese compare the current downturn to the aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombing, when Islamic extremists blew up a popular nightclub in Kuta and killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists.The island\u2019s tourist industry took years to recover and then suffered another setback in 2005 with restaurant bombings that killed 20 people.Desak Putri, 44, who sells knickknacks at the popular Ubud Market, said she used to take in more than $200 a day, but now is lucky if she sells $15 worth of merchandise. On one recent day, she sold nothing.\u201cEven after the Bali bombing, it wasn\u2019t this quiet,\u201d she said.Tourists who have made it to Ubud, on the other hand, are taking advantage of the tranquillity \u2014 even if they feel a bit guilty.Two visitors from Britain, Steph Sorum, 27, and Alex Jones, 29, who are on their way home after working in New Zealand for two years, liked Ubud so much that they extended their stay.Sites that they expected to be overrun with tourists have turned out to be surprisingly peaceful, they said.\u201cIn our selfishness, we enjoy it,\u201d Ms. Sorum said.Mr. Jones added: \u201cIt is devastating for the locals though. I mean if you walk by the street, and you know the guys offering taxis are desperate. I really feel sorry for them.\u201dMuktita Suhartono reported from Ubud, Indonesia, and Richard C.

Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale), a walking embodiment of Lawrence\u2019s archetype, has made a career of genocidal slaughter, which has left him bitter but not remorseful. Blocker is no brute: He reads Julius Caesar in the original Latin. And he hates Indians with a righteous purity that is shocking to contemplate now but was hardly abnormal in those days.To the extent that Blocker has been a soldier doing his job, the movie regards him with sympathy, and supplies an Eastern intellectual (Bill Camp, wearing round spectacles) to sneer and judge. In general, those few white people who speak up in the movie against white brutality are viewed with contempt, even as the agents of that brutality are offered a chance at redemption. The moral economy of \u201cHostiles\u201d dictates that only those who have made war can participate in the regenerative violence that leads toward peace.Before he can collect his pension, Blocker is given what for him is a supremely distasteful mission. He must escort one of his old enemies, a dying Cheyenne chief named Yellow Hawk, to his ancestral lands up north. Blocker holds Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) personally responsible for the deaths of his friends and regards the government\u2019s decision to set him free after years in captivity to be an intolerable betrayal. But duty is duty, and he gathers up a posse of fine character actors (including Jesse Plemons, Jonathan Majors, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and an especially good Rory Cochrane) to accompany the chief and his family (Q\u2019orianka Kilcher, Adam Beach, Xavier Horsechief and Tanaya Beatty).They are soon joined by Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike), whose family has been slaughtered by Comanches. Her presence allows Blocker to show his compassionate side and alters the relations between the Cheyenne and the soldiers. The existence of a common enemy \u2014 those Comanches, whose aggression offends both Blocker and Yellow Hawk \u2014 creates a cautious, tactical alliance that foreshadows a more comprehensive settling of differences.The marauding Comanches are not the only villains. \u201cHostiles\u201d is committed to evenhandedness and so introduces some bad white men into the mix. These include a rapacious band of fur trappers and a disgraced soldier (Ben Foster), who faces hanging as punishment for his indiscriminate killing of natives. As he points out, what he is condemned for having done is no different from what Blocker has spent his career doing. Only times and government policies have changed.\u201cHostiles,\u201d for all its earnest maneuvering to stay both true to history and on the right side of it, nonetheless sits a bit uncomfortably in the present. It is unlikely to escape notice that this is yet another tale of a white man\u2019s conscience, which uses Yellow Hawk and his children and grandchildren as vehicles for Blocker\u2019s awakening. Whether this awakening is complete and whether the film\u2019s final notes of absolution are fully earned are matters worth arguing about.\u201cHostiles\u201d itself wants to be both a throwback and an advance, not so much a new kind of western as every possible kind \u2014 vintage, revisionist, elegiac, feminist. What makes the movie interesting is the sincerity and intelligence with which it pursues that ambition, heroically unaware that the mission is doomed from the start.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 7 Years of Job Growth, Room for More, or Danger Ahead?", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy\u2019s vital signs are stronger than they have been in years. Companies are posting jobs faster than they can find workers to fill them. Incomes are rising. The stock market sets records seemingly every month.The latest evidence of the revival came Friday, when the Labor Department reported that American employers added 228,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000. Job growth has slowed since its peak in 2014 but remains remarkably steady: For the first time on record, employers have added jobs every month for more than seven years \u2014 86 months, to be precise.\u201cIt\u2019s a really, really strong economy,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago. \u201cCompanies really want to take advantage of the economy, so they want to hire and get while the getting\u2019s good.\u201dThat strength could also pose challenges, particularly in light of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Congress could pass as early as this month. Economists expect the tax bill to provide at least a modest lift to the economy \u2014 but they are not sure that\u2019s a good idea.With unemployment so low and the economy fundamentally healthy, a tax cut could lead the economy to grow too quickly, pushing up inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than planned.\u201cIt\u2019s a very poorly timed fiscal stimulus,\u201d said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America. \u201cIt kind of raises the risk of a boom-bust cycle.\u201dFor now, however, the figures present a political opportunity for President Trump, who ran for office on a promise to revive the American economy.Economists almost universally say Mr. Trump has had little to do with the rebound, which began long before he was elected and has not accelerated meaningfully since he took office. But with unemployment low and wages beginning to creep upward, voters may be more inclined to give credit.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Friday that the jobs report was evidence that \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s bold economic vision continues to pay off.\u201dWherever the credit lies, workers are benefiting from an economy that is delivering broad-based gains in income and employment for the first time in at least a decade. Groups that were left behind in the early stages of the economic recovery, such as African-Americans and people without a college degree, have seen their unemployment rates drop sharply in recent years.And although wage growth remains disappointing, household income \u2014 which reflects not only hourly pay rates but also how many people have jobs and how many hours they are working \u2014 has shown strong gains, particularly for poorer households.Companies in nearly every sector are reveling in the best opportunities they have seen in years. Improving global growth is giving a lift to manufacturers, which have added jobs for four straight months. Rising incomes and strong consumer confidence helped retailers, whose payrolls grew at the fastest pace since January despite the shadow of rising online sales. Even the fall hurricanes, which led to a short-lived slowdown in hiring in September, are now helping employment as Texas and Florida rebuild. The construction sector added 24,000 jobs in November.So as far as the business climate, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not quite the best ever, but it\u2019s pretty close to the best ever,\u201d said Mike Bolen, chief executive of McCarthy Building Companies, a commercial construction company with offices across the country.\u201cTypically, we\u2019ll have one region that\u2019s really hot and one region that\u2019s really slow, and right now, all five regions are just cooking,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything\u2019s busy.\u201dBusiness could get even busier soon. The Republican tax plan aims to encourage business investment by cutting corporate taxes, which could increase demand for the big projects \u2014 hospitals, airports, office building \u2014 that make up a big part of McCarthy\u2019s business. In fact, Mr. Bolen said, many clients are already making plans on the assumption that the legislation will pass.\u201cA lot of people are making decisions this year assuming that it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Bolen said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, I think you\u2019ll see some people pull back.\u201dThe challenge for McCarthy, as for other builders, is finding the workers for their projects. A couple of years ago, Mr. Bolen said, job seekers would line up outside the gates of construction sites, hoping for a chance to work. Today, McCarthy is having so much trouble finding qualified workers that it is building a 10-acre training center outside of Houston and hiring staff members to teach construction skills.\u201cIt\u2019s a really big deal now, probably a bigger deal than I\u2019ve ever seen it, and I don\u2019t see it getting better,\u201d Mr. Bolen said. \u201cWe are spending a lot of money and effort trying to train up the unskilled portion of our work force.\u201dThe question vexing many economists is why, if labor is as scarce as Mr. Bolen and other executives claim, workers are not seeing bigger increases in their paychecks. McCarthy has raised pay, especially for people with specialized skills. But over all, wage growth remains restrained. Average hourly earnings were up 2.5 percent in November from a year earlier, only a bit faster than the rate of inflation.\u201cIt\u2019s still just creeping higher,\u201d said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cWage growth is just not taking off the way we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201dThat picture could change. Other measures of earnings, for example, show faster growth. And according to an analysis by Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, wages are rising faster in regions where the unemployment rate is lowest. That suggests that pay growth could accelerate if the unemployment rate continues to fall in 2018 as Mr. Shepherdson expects.Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter, said wages would pick up when workers gained the confidence in the economy to demand raises \u2014 and to change jobs if they do not get them. There are signs that could be happening. Nearly 9.5 million workers quit their jobs voluntarily in the third quarter, the most since 2001.\u201cIf people are feeling really confident and comfortable with the labor market, they\u2019re going to be more likely to seek that next opportunity,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. \u201cWhen we see that type of confidence, that\u2019s when wages will grow.\u201dRising pay would be good news for workers. But it could cause concern at the Federal Reserve, where policymakers have been gradually raising rates and paring the Fed\u2019s bond holdings in a bid to keep inflation in check.The Fed is all but certain to raise interest rates at its meeting next week, and has signaled plans to do so three times next year as well. But if inflation starts to pick up, the Fed could be forced to act more quickly than it wants, with unpredictable effects on financial markets and the economy.\u201cYou could be looking at a combination in the summer of stronger growth, unemployment at 3.5 percent and still falling, and wage growth picking up as well,\u201d Mr. Shepherdson said. \u201cThat requires a fairly substantial adjustment to markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Melting Arctic Ice Makes High-Speed Internet a Reality in a Remote Town", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "The receding ice has opened new passageways for high-speed internet cables. Point Hope, a gravel spit in northwest Alaska, is along one of the new routes.Supported byPOINT HOPE, Alaska \u2014 This is one of the most remote towns in the United States, a small gravel spit on the northwest coast of Alaska, more than 3,700 miles from New York City. Icy seas surround it on three sides, leaving only an unpaved path to the mainland.Getting here from Anchorage, about 700 miles away, requires two flights. Roads do not connect the two places. Basics like milk and bread are delivered by air, and gas is brought in by barge during the summer.\u201cI don\u2019t know if people even know that we exist,\u201d said Daisy Sage, the mayor.Needless to say, this is not the sort of place you expect to be a hub of the high-tech digital world.But in a surprising, and bittersweet, side effect of global warming \u2014 and of the global economy \u2014 one of the fastest internet connections in America is arriving in Point Hope, giving the 700 or so residents their first taste of broadband speed.High-speed internet cables snake under the world\u2019s oceans, tying continents together and allowing email and other bits of digital data sent from Japan to arrive quickly in Britain. Until recently, those lines mostly bypassed the Arctic, where the ice blocked access to the ships that lay the cable.But as the ice has receded, new passageways have emerged, creating a more direct path for the cable \u2014 over the earth\u2019s northern end through places like the Chukchi Sea \u2014 and helping those emails move even move quickly. Quintillion is one of the companies laying the new cable, and Point Hope is one of the places along its route.Financial companies would certainly welcome \u2014 and pay for \u2014 a faster connection between London and Toyko. Over the past decade, traders have increasingly relied on powerful computer programs to buy and sell securities at huge volumes and lightning speeds. A millisecond can be the difference between a big profit and a big loss. Quintillion\u2019s faster connection would also appeal to the operators of data stations around the world that store and send information for social media sites, online retailers and the billions of gadgets that now connect to the internet.But it will be years before the full connections between countries are made. For now, Quintillion\u2019s undersea cables are just around the northern part of Alaska, and the company is taking advantage of a nascent business boom in the Arctic. Oil, shipping and mining companies that can benefit from a faster internet are rushing into the more open waters.Quintillion is also teaming up with local telecommunications companies to use the undersea cables to bring faster internet service to some of the nation\u2019s most disconnected communities.In Point Hope, the new connection could mean better health care, as patients in the town and doctors in faraway cities communicate via seamless webcast. It could help improve education, too. Teachers, now used to waiting hours to download course materials, will now be able to do it in minutes.Many of Point Hope\u2019s older residents cringe at the incursion of technology. For the most part, this is still a traditional community of Inupiaq native Alaskans. Until the 1970s, many families lived in sod houses framed with whale bones.People here also have no illusions about the overall effect of global warming. They see the waters rising and worry about sea mammals disappearing. They rely on the sea for food, and their year is built around festivals for berry picking and whaling.\u201cInupiaq people are taught to be patient,\u201d said Steve Oomittuk, a leading local whale hunter whose family has lived in Point Hope for many generations. \u201cWe wait for animals to come to us for our food, our shelter, our medicine, our clothing. The internet makes people impatient for everything. This is not our way of life.\u201dBut interviews with dozens of Point Hope residents suggest that people here see Quintillion\u2019s cable as a way of connecting with an outside world that has long been beyond easy reach \u2014 and something that could change their lives for the better.Leona Snyder, for one, is excited about what the connection could do for her Justice Jones, who turns 16 on Sunday. She wants him to go to college, which would mean leaving the village. Having broadband internet could help him study and research outside opportunities.\u201cInternet means exposure to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want that for Justice. I want him to be a judge. Judge Justice Jones. It has a ring to it, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIn June, three ships carrying huge rolls of cable traveled through waters in the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea to lay the final miles of Quintillion\u2019s undersea internet network.The boats unfurled 40 miles of fiber optic cable into the dark, choppy water. An enormous shoveling tool plowed the sea floor and buried the cables for protection. It was the final stretch of a 1,200-mile network connecting six coastal towns, including Kotzebue, Nome and Point Hope.\u201cA project like this has been discussed for 20-plus years but was formidable from a cost and weather standpoint,\u201d said Tim Woolston, a Quintillion spokesman. \u201cThe ice situation has evolved to the point where it\u2019s now physically possible.\u201dAn infusion from Cooper Investment Partners, a private equity firm in New York, has helped Quintillion finance the laying of the cable. The company would not say how much the network had cost to build so far. But it insisted that supplying high-speed internet service to an estimated 20,000 people along the cable\u2019s route would be a good business.Quintillion makes money leasing the bandwidth from its undersea cable network to local telecoms that then bring internet service directly to homes and businesses in Alaska. The company has not announced its business plans for connecting internet service between Asia and Europe, but will probably use a similar model.Although that is a relatively small number of people, Quintillion believes it will increase along with what the company expects to be broader commercial growth in the region driven by oil and mineral exploration. With broadband service available, Quintillion is also betting that more data centers, research centers, hospitals and schools will make the Arctic Circle home.Other broadband-internet providers have the same idea. Cinia, a telecom company owned by the Finnish government, has completed the first stage of a multiyear plan to lay a subsea broadband network between Europe and Asia through the Arctic Ocean. Cinia, which expects the Arctic network to cost about $700 million, just completed the first leg, from Germany to Finland.\u201cThe financial sector wants the shortest route for trading, and we are talking about fractions of milliseconds, but it makes a difference,\u201d Ari-Jussi Knaapila, Cinia\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. Multiplayer video games that connect participants around the world also demand faster internet traffic with less delay, he added.After Alaska, Quintillion plans to bring its undersea cables to Asia. A third stage would extend the network to Europe. The company would not predict how long the project would take to complete.In the meantime, Quintillion is offsetting some of its costs by joining forces with local telecom companies to sell the internet service directly to customers. In Point Hope, several local companies, including the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative, have rushed to prepare homes. Alaska Communications, another telecom, has signed up city offices and businesses at other sites.The fiber network will bring connection speeds of 200 gigabits per second to the village, among the fastest rates in the country. Point Hope will not feel the full effect right away. Residential customers will initially be able get service at 10 megabits per second under plans starting $24.99 a month, while service will be faster for businesses.That is still 10 times faster than the existing phone-line connections here, and good enough for streaming video on a service like Netflix. The companies said they planned to offer faster speeds if demand warrants doing so.People here are already thinking that the new broadband lines could transform the local economy.The one general store, the Native Store, will be able to order new supplies more easily. The phone association has installed computer terminals at City Hall to provide free internet service to the public. Point Hope\u2019s transportation director is building a conference center with Wi-Fi and web video conferencing above a bus garage to host state events. Artists are planning to sell native crafts and jewelry online.Last month, about 25 residents, including the mayor, gathered at City Hall and talked about how internet service could turn Point Hope, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in North America, into a tourist destination with a museum with interactive displays and a website. The village\u2019s small motel with 20 beds would offer Wi-Fi.\u201cThe trigger to all of this is lower-cost broadband that will bring a whole new economy and hope to places like Point Hope,\u201d said Jens Laipenieks, president of the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative.Nome, a few hundred miles to the south and with 4,000 residents, offers a glimpse into Point Hope\u2019s future. Climate change, and broadband connections, have already altered education and commerce.With the warming of the Bering Sea, the Crystal Serenity cruise ship, 820 feet long and with a capacity of more than 1,000 passengers, has started to anchor offshore, bringing new tourism. The ship has only recently been able to navigate around the ice.If local politicians have their way, it will be only the beginning. They are lobbying the state to build a deep water port so that even larger cruise ships can dock in Nome. The officials have indicated Quintillion\u2019s broadband service improves its case to state officials, who want to make sure Coast Guard and tourist boats will have access to high-speed internet service.\u201cThe future is here and there is not anything changing that,\u201d said Richard Beneville, Nome\u2019s mayor, who also runs a tour company.Nome has had broadband internet service for years. The arrival of Quintillion\u2019s lines, which were turned on Dec. 1, will make the connections much faster.Like the changes that Point Hope is experiencing, the ones in Nome worry some residents. Austin Ahmasuk, a marine environmentalist who lives along the coast, is among them. He is concerned that the change will dilute some of the local culture and result in harm to the environment.\u201cThe very thing that kept most global development away from the north \u2014 ice \u2014 is disappearing in all its formats,\u201d Mr. Ahmasuk said. \u201cHistory shows that outside people don\u2019t have the same interest in our culture and environment.\u201dBut residents here are mostly embracing having a stronger connection with the rest of the world.Early on a weekday evening, Bryan and Maggie Muktoyuk organized more than a dozen people at the Lutheran Church on Bering Street for a weekly rehearsal of native dance and drums.Seated in a row, men and teenage boys pounded on round drums made of stretched walrus stomach. Women with mittens and ornate mukluk boots swayed their hips to the beat.Ms. Muktoyuk held up her iPhone and, with a Wi-Fi connection, started to stream a video of the rehearsal on Facebook. Mr. Muktoyuk had set up a group page on the social network for other native dancers around the Alaska\u2019s North Slope region.A line of men took to the community room\u2019s floor, pounded their feet and shouted as they reached toward the sky. They were learning a new dance that Mr. Muktoyuk had choreographed, inspired by an exhausting whale hunt he had participated in months earlier in Wainwright, near Point Hope.\u201cMake sure you get this,\u201d he said to Ms. Muktoyuk.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Israeli War of Words: Benjamin Netanyahu vs. Ehud Barak", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetterTo the Editor:Mr. Barak makes plain his rejection of the democratic will of the Israeli people. Perhaps he\u2019s just reciprocating; that same public rejected him after just over a year and a half in office, making him the shortest serving prime minister in Israeli history.The reason Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now serving in his fourth term is that the Israeli people know that he is strengthening the country, protecting its citizens, leading an unprecedented flourishing of Israel\u2019s diplomatic relations and unleashing the full potential of its economy.Amazingly, Mr. Barak blames Prime Minister Netanyahu for the lack of peace. Apparently he forgot that he himself offered the Palestinians a state in nearly every inch of the West Bank in 2000. The Palestinians rejected that offer and launched the worst campaign of terror in Israel\u2019s history, killing over a thousand men, women and children.Contrary to Mr. Barak\u2019s spurious claims, Israel has a vibrant free press, a thriving civil society and an independent judiciary. Far from dividing Israelis, Prime Minister Netanyahu shows deep concern for all sectors of Israeli society (including Arab Israelis, whose communities he is supporting with unprecedented levels of funding), because he believes that all citizens should benefit from Israel\u2019s economic miracle.Mr. Barak is welcome to try his hand at politics again, but his political future will undoubtedly end like his political past if he continues to besmirch and belittle the will of the Israeli people. Instead of making his case to The New York Times, he might try to convince his fellow citizens, for whom he has such obvious disdain and for whom the feeling is so clearly mutual.SHAI HAIK, JERUSALEMThe writer is the media adviser to the Likud chairman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Advertisement"}

Mr. Zarrab made it clear that he believed the Turkish action had been in retaliation for his cooperating with United States prosecutors.But a defense lawyer, Cathy Fleming, tried to put a different spin on Mr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony during cross-examination. Ms. Fleming pointed out that under his plea bargain to become a cooperating witness, he had already agreed to forfeit all the proceeds of his crimes.\u201cCorrect?\u201d she said.\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Zarrab replied.The trial has riveted Turkey, and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has charged that the case is a fabrication.Perhaps because the case could stir up political trouble for Mr. Erdogan and his former ministers, the president lashed out on Tuesday in a heated attack against the United States in a meeting in Ankara with legislators from his governing party.\u201cIt is an international coup attempt,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe won\u2019t watch our hands being tied by those who attempt to crucify us in America with the claim that we violated the sanctions.\u201dAt a social event last Sunday in the coastal city of Izmir, Turkey, a former prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who was foreign minister at the time of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s gold-for-oil trade scheme with Iran, defended Turkey\u2019s decision to disregard American sanctions against Iran.\u201cWe did not abide by the U.S.A.\u2019s one-sided embargo, and we will not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said it then, we say it now, and we will say it until Judgment Day.\u201d\u201cIran is our neighbor,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is a part of our honor to defend our sovereignty and independence.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s revelations, and the sheer scale of the bribery, have given ammunition to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political opponents. Mr. Zarrab testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Zafer Caglayan, who was the country\u2019s economy minister at the time of the scheme.A prominent opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who heads the Republican People\u2019s Party, unveiled a leaked report by the Turkish intelligence service on a 2013 investigation that warned that the scandal could hurt the government and relations with the United States.\u201cAll the skulduggery was explained,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu told a women\u2019s gathering in Ankara. \u201cZarrab transfers money,\u201d he read from the document, \u201cit may cause a problem in Turkey-U.S. relations.\u201dIf Mr. Zarrab\u2019s ties to Mr. Caglayan are revealed, he continued, \u201cit may become a liability for the government.\u201d\u201cI am telling this to Erdogan,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu railed. \u201cThe fraud, the bribes to your ministers was put in front of you. What did you do? You closed the file. You turned a blind eye to the scam.\u201dThe inmate says in the lawsuit that Mr. Zarrab had sexually abused him over several months in late 2016 and early 2017, while they were cellmates.Robert J. Anello, a lawyer for Mr. Zarrab, called the lawsuit\u2019s allegations \u201coutrageous and false.\u201dThe suit was filed late on Wednesday and reported online by The New York Times on Thursday. It raised the question about whether lawyers for the Turkish banker on trial, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, would seek to cross-examine Mr. Zarrab about the rape accusation in an attempt to undermine his credibility.A court transcript shows the lawyers, prosecutors and judge had sidebar discussions out of the jury\u2019s earshot after the article was published.A prosecutor said the lawsuit was \u201cnothing but allegations.\u201dJudge Richard M. Berman said he had not read the Times article. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds to me like Page Six stuff.\u201dUltimately, the defense did not raise the lawsuit before the jury.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Red Line Is Holding Up Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans suddenly have a fiscal headache in their tax bill. They can thank President Trump for it.He is demanding that lawmakers come up with hundreds of billions of dollars to bring down that cost, most likely through future tax increases. With Republicans holding a narrow majority of just 52 seats, they can afford only two defections if they want to pass the bill without Democratic support and other senators besides Mr. Corker who are also undecided.Lawmakers are now considering raising corporate and individual taxes down the road, a largely unpalatable solution for Republicans, particularly those in the House, who could object to the measure once lawmakers try to reconcile both versions of the tax bill.One simple way to find the money that Mr. Corker is requesting would be to reduce the corporate tax rate, not to 20 percent, but closer to 25 percent; the difference between the rates is a bit under $500 billion over 10 years, said Scott Greenberg of the independent Tax Foundation. For a similar price, senators could choose to phase in, over a decade, their cut to 20 percent from 35 percent, a move favored by conservative economists like Alex Brill of the American Enterprise Institute.But Mr. Trump has drawn what the White House calls a red line in negotiations at a rate of 20 percent, putting Republicans in something of a box.\u201cBusiness tax relief is central to the goals of creating jobs and promoting economic growth,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand we are concerned that any effort to hold the corporate tax rate above 20 percent will substantially limit our ability to achieve those goals and expand opportunities for all Americans.\u201dThe Koch network was instrumental in defeating a proposal from House Republican leaders earlier this year \u2014 known as border adjustment \u2014 that would have raised additional revenue by taxing imports. Eliminating that provision was a central focus of the network\u2019s semiannual donor retreat in Colorado over the summer; officials there warned that it would drag on economic growth.Republican leaders never found a sufficient replacement for the revenue that border adjustment was projected to raise to offset tax cuts. To the surprise of many lobbyists, they followed Mr. Trump\u2019s lead and did not budge from the corporate rate of 20 percent. On Wednesday, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah began calling for 22 percent, but they want that money to pay for an expanded child tax credit, not to offset losses.The decisions made by Mr. Trump and Republican leaders leave just a few ways to meet Mr. Corker\u2019s demands, including phasing out some tax cuts in the later years of the bill or making the cuts less generous.It is possible that those negotiations will end with Mr. Trump\u2019s 20 percent rate unscathed. It is possible that they will load the bill with provisions that economists warn could curb the growth effects of the cuts. There is a small chance that they could sink the bill altogether, if they do not succeed.In recent days, Mr. Trump has drawn praise from Republicans for rousing senators\u2019 support for the tax bill. He has also consistently prodded Congress to move quickly on tax issues, particularly since late summer, and congressional aides say the bill would not be advancing at such a dizzying pace if not for his pressure. It remains to be seen whether he will intervene on this matter or whether he will leave Republicans to work it out among themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Wind Farms Meet Coal Country, There\u2019s Enduring Faith in Trump", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "GLENROCK, Wyo. \u2014 No place is more likely than this one to benefit from President Trump\u2019s promise to make the United States a dominant energy force in the world, or more likely to be disappointed if the promise is not kept.A sparsely populated expanse of windswept rolling meadows and sharp bluffs filled with pine trees and the occasional ranch and hay farm, Converse County also has some of the country\u2019s richest resources: the nation\u2019s third-largest coal mine, its largest uranium production facility, four big wind farms, more than a thousand oil and gas wells, and a large coal-fired power plant.But diversified in nothing but energy, the county and nearly the entire state of Wyoming are acutely vulnerable to commodity prices. And while oil and coal prices have headed higher of late, they remain far below the levels of recent years, resulting in layoffs and plummeting tax receipts.\u201cFor sale\u201d signs dot nearly every residential neighborhood as young energy workers have left to seek jobs in healthier labor markets in Colorado and Utah. Occupancy at the Higgins Hotel, a landmark in this town of 2,500, dropped 80 percent between 2014 and 2016, and according to Doug Frank, the owner, this year there has been \u201ca slight uptick, but nothing noticeable yet.\u201dNevertheless, like so many others here, Mr. Frank, who is also mayor of Glenrock, has not lost faith in the president.\u201cThe mind-set is huge \u2014 it is what is driving the people here,\u201d Mayor Frank said while shaking margaritas and his own high-octane concoctions for customers at the Antelope Bar in his hotel. \u201cThe most amazing thing about his base is the willingness to forgive the cacophony. We see a greater good coming.\u201dThey express hope that the president can limit oil imports while encouraging more production and exports. The unflinching sentiment may best be expressed by a sticker appearing on the back of some local pickup trucks that says \u201cTrump 2017-2025,\u201d with the T depicted as a gushing oil well.\u201cMy livelihood, taking care of my family, depended on Trump\u2019s election,\u201d said Bryant Michael, a 27-year-old technician who fills heavy oil-field equipment and trucks with fuel. Unemployed for a year, he was hired in May as drilling began to pick up again.\u201cI think Washington is a main factor in where we get our oil and what we do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody was whispering in Obama\u2019s ear. Every time there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House, there\u2019s hardly any work in the oil field.\u201dConverseCounty,Wyo.CONVERSEU.S.Population14,191323 mil.Percentage white88%61%Median householdincome in 2016$66,700$55,3003.9%4.1%Unemployment rateMining and energyshare ofemployment18.3%0.4%ELECTION RESULTS2012201679.5%RomneyTrump83.0%Obama17.2%Clinton10.0%Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Bureau of Economic Analysis;Dave Leip\u00a0|\u00a0By The New York TimesActually, oil and gas exploration soared during most of the Obama administration before it swooned in the final two years. But Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of coal mining and unfettered energy production is particularly welcome here, since almost everyone is dependent on energy jobs \u2014 coal miners and their families, out-of-state oil workers who drill and complete wells, and the business owners and service workers catering to everyone. This is a place that gauges its well-being by the local rig count and, since big-time coal mining began here in the 1970s and 1980s, how often mile-long coal trains pass by.Things could still be going far better. During the first nine months of the year, coal production at Cloud Peak Energy\u2019s Antelope Mine, a pillar of the local economy, increased by a fraction of 1 percent over the same period in 2016, a particularly weak year. Employment at the mine peaked in 2015 at 616, and is now around 530 \u2014 equal to what it was when Mr. Trump was inaugurated \u2014 even though the nation\u2019s coal exports are up this year.And there has been little regulatory relief so far, energy executives note. The end of the moratorium on leasing on federal lands means more certainty that the Antelope Mine can be extended someday, but that would not make a difference for more than five years into the future, and only if there is greater demand for coal.But there are some positive signs. Coal prices have risen, along with natural gas, in part because demand is up in South Korea, Japan and parts of Europe. Four large wind farms have been built in recent years, including one completed last fall, and expansions are on the way. But all of them together, according to county officials, employ at most 100 workers full time.\u201cPeople think Trump is a good guy, so people trust his judgment,\u201d said Robert G. Short, a leading Glenrock businessman who is vice chairman of the Converse County commissioners. But he added: \u201cAre we going back to where we were? The simple answer is no. Coal is diminished and never will likely come back.\u201dThough few people here say so, the energy workers of Converse County are competing with one another. The hydraulic-fracturing boom is coaxing more natural gas out of the local shale fields, which lowers both gas and coal prices and depresses the attractiveness of nuclear energy. And the growing wind power \u2014 helped along by tax incentives enacted at the end of the Obama administration \u2014 ultimately eats into the market share of all the other energy sources.And yet the workers in all the energy sources wistfully see themselves as having common goals and say Mr. Trump may offer the county its last big hope.The coal-fired Dave Johnston Power Plant, outside Glenrock, is like a monument to the county\u2019s energy legacy. Its giant chimneys and plumes of smoke dominate the skyline by day, while at night it offers a display of colors so bright it looks like a small city from the Rocky Mountain foothills nearby. It is where Shawn Gates is living the Wyoming dream, though he knows it may be ending sooner rather than later.Since going to work in 2011 at the plant, where his father is also employed, he has worked his way up to become a control room operator and makes more than $40 an hour. With overtime and shift differentials, he has, at 36, acquired a solidly middle-class living. He, his wife and their four children live in a comfortable ranch house with a motorboat and a recreational vehicle in the front yard and a trampoline in the back, along with eight horses.His 10-year-old son, Guthry, hopes to work in the plant as well, extending the family\u2019s foothold there to a fourth generation.\u201cI think my job is fairly secure,\u201d he said during a chat at his kitchen table. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would have been under Hillary. I can\u2019t find another job like mine.\u201dBut even as he praises Mr. Trump\u2019s goals, he sees warning signs. \u201cI think he will keep fossil fuels operating and keep E.P.A. within limits,\u201d Mr. Gates said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. But knitting his brow with concern, he added, \u201cThey\u2019re putting all these wind turbines up that are not cost effective, at the taxpayer\u2019s expense.\u201dMr. Gates\u2019s wife, Jesi, a nurse, said Mr. Trump\u2019s election was great for Wyoming, but \u201che can only do so much as one person.\u201d She noted that the power plant was tentatively scheduled to be shut down in a decade, adding: \u201cThat 2027 date definitely looms in your mind. At least my kids will have graduated from high school by then.\u201dMr. Gates grew up in Glenrock, and worked for a while as a ranch hand, maintained water wells and did some electrical work. On the side, he took online business classes. But he always had energy on his mind \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s what Wyoming is,\u201d he said.When it was time to raise a family, he followed in his father\u2019s footsteps for the steady salary and insurance. He has done well at the plant, moving from the coal yard to his current position as assistant auxiliary operator responsible for the vital task of checking motors and oil levels.Like many in Converse County, Mr. Gates expresses a strong distrust for Washington and elites in general. \u201cYou need to clean house of politicians,\u201d he said, calling for term limits for Congress.Even his attitude toward Mr. Trump is not entirely positive: \u201cI think he\u2019s blunt. I don\u2019t think he is dishonest, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s 100 percent truthful, either.\u201d Still, he said, \u201che got elected, so let him do his job.\u201dWoody Ricker, a 38-year-old technician at Duke Energy\u2019s Top of the World wind farm outside Glenrock, comes at the energy picture from a different perspective. But his views, like those of many wind workers here, are surprisingly similar to those of workers whose jobs rely on coal.For years, he has been teased by friends for having an \u201cObama job\u201d in an area where wind farms are seen as taking business from the coal industry. He also knows that the growth of renewable energy sources in recent years, like the one responsible for his employment, has a lot to do with concerns about climate change.But Mr. Ricker, like most of his neighbors in and around the town of Douglas, isn\u2019t particularly convinced that humans have much impact on climate change.\u201cI am not convinced on what has caused the change in climate,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing a fix without finding a root cause? I don\u2019t see it.\u201dHe anticipated the next question. \u201cSo why am I working in the wind industry?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not in it for that. I\u2019m in it to produce more American energy, to make it more stable.\u201dMr. Ricker, who lives with his wife, Stacey, and their three children in a house surrounded by craggy bluffs and sunflowers, fell into the wind business. Having grown up here and studied biology in college, he owned a local construction company with his father until business dried up during the last recession. When some men who came by to look at one of his properties liked his handiwork, they suggested that he apply for a job with their wind contract business.Needing good health insurance to pay for his daughter\u2019s hip surgery, he made the switch and eventually went to Duke when the big utility took over operations of the wind farm. At a time when many states and business customers are demanding more clean energy, Mr. Ricker is not worried that Mr. Trump might turn against renewables.\u201cI have had people presume my political leanings because of my job \u2014 incorrectly, for the record,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Ricker has no family roots in the energy business \u2014 his father was an assistant pastor who was also a cowboy \u2014 he relates to fossil fuels as much as he does to wind.\u201cCoal and oil are what keep the value of my house where it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hugely in favor of American energy, and if I\u2019m going to pick a state that it will benefit, it\u2019s Wyoming.\u201dA coal man would not have said it much differently.Slowly but surely, women are entering the energy work force, and while they tend to be as outspoken as the men, their views sometimes sharply differ.Pam Graham, a truck driver at the Cloud Peak mine, is a rarity in Converse County. She\u2019s a Democrat who thinks that climate change is no hoax, that the Affordable Care Act should be fixed and not scrapped, and that as for immigration, \u201cthe idea of building a wall is a stupid thing.\u201dHer choicest words are aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women, which she describes as disrespectful. \u201cI get tired of the tweeting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that whole thing with the grabbing of women, that\u2019s just nasty.\u201d\u201cThose women should have decked him,\u201d she said sternly as she steered 240 tons of coal loaded on her Komatsu haul truck through the deep canyons of the strip mine. She quickly smiled, and added with a knowing chuckle, \u201cI would have given him a black eye.\u201dBut when she cast her ballot, she said, there was no doubt that she would vote for Mr. Trump.While not an ideological conservative, Ms. Graham looks to the president to bolster the fortunes of Converse County energy, and in the end that was the most important consideration in choosing him over Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI don\u2019t have to like him as a person,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was thinking if she won, in a few years we\u2019d probably be out of work. Am I going to find another job that pays $30 an hour?\u201dAt 53, Ms. Graham is an avid motorcycle rider who brings a personal style to her job. \u201cThere\u2019s a view of a coal miner with a black face and dirty fingers, and I don\u2019t look like one \u2014 I dress up,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I go out to do errands, I like to wear fashionable girlie clothes.\u201dBefore she enters her truck cabin for the day\u2019s first run, she sprays disinfectant on the seats and thoroughly wipes off the dashboard. \u201cI\u2019m probably a little unconventional, yeah,\u201d she said.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ms. Graham came to her job in an unconventional way, though her grandfather worked in the oil and gas business as a tool pusher and her stepfather drove water trucks in the oil field. Local coal mining was still in its infancy when she grew up in Douglas, so after dropping out of junior college, she waited on tables and worked as a bartender. She had a child, divorced and worked as a bank teller and personal loan officer for nearly 12 years.Tired of banking, she saw an advertisement in the newspaper for coal truck drivers, applied and started working for Cloud Peak. She said the toughest thing about learning the job had been her fear of heights, since a truck cabin is as high off the ground as the roof of a house. \u201cI didn\u2019t look down from the truck for two years,\u201d she said.Ms. Graham has remarried, to an old high school friend who is a contractor, and she helps take care of five grandchildren. She is one of 61 women employed by the mine. For her, the best thing that Mr. Trump brings is more security.\u201cBefore the election, I felt my livelihood was threatened \u2014 not just my job, but my way of life,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a house and a mortgage, and there are 130-some houses on the market around Douglas, so where are we going to go?\u201dShe is less than enthusiastic about the president\u2019s performance, but said he was, at least, putting a spotlight on coal\u2019s importance. \u201cWe\u2019re the redheaded stepchild,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand that if it weren\u2019t for us, and they turned on the heat, nothing would happen.\u201dRobert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making 2 Become 1: Ironing Out Senate and House Tax Bill Differences", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawmakers from both chambers are now headed to conference, where they will try to work out their differences and emerge with a final bill that can be passed by the House and Senate and then sent to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas.Getting a bill signed into law by Mr. Trump remains a top priority of Republican lawmakers, and momentum to get something to his desk quickly remains.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that lawmakers were working on the bill \u201cso that it comes out very beautifully.\u201d\u201cI call it \u2018the mixer,\u2019 he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a conference where everyone gets together and they pick all the good things and get rid of the things they don\u2019t like.\u201dAnd, below, we outline some of the top issues that must be resolved before the legislation can be signed into law.Senate lawmakers, in their bill, seeking additional revenue, brought back the corporate alternative minimum tax and reinstated a limited version of the alternative minimum tax for individuals. The House bill eliminated both versions of the alternative minimum tax.Together, the Senate changes are expected to raise about $173 billion over the next decade. But the possible reinstatement of the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliciting significant blowback from businesses, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, manufacturing companies, technology companies and pharmaceutical companies, which say it would undermine their ability to use valuable tax credits.The reason: Both bills cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. But the corporate alternative minimum tax is also set at 20 percent. It is devised to ensure that companies cannot use loopholes to avoid paying taxes and requires that companies calculate their taxes under both the corporate rate and the alternative minimum rate and pay the greater amount.By lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent but keeping the alternative minimum tax, Congress is essentially setting a 20 percent floor. Companies that try to use tax breaks to lower their effective tax rate, like the research and development tax credit, would still face the 20 percent alternative minimum tax, nullifying the value of incentives that are supposed to promote research.Lawmakers are scrambling to resolve the issue. While they could simply do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax, the Senate would then have to find additional revenue to ensure the legislation stays within the $1.5 trillion bucket that Congress has created for the tax cuts.One possible solution floating around is to increase the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, rather than 20 percent, which would raise more revenue. But that plan may not sit well with House Republicans, many of whom have been unwavering in their push to lower the rate to 20 percent.The House bill guts a number of itemized deductions while the Senate bill expands them.Mortgage interest deduction\u2022 House caps at $500,000; Senate retainsMedical expense deduction\u2022 House repeals; Senate expandsTeacher deduction for school supplies; graduate student tuition waver; student loan interest deduction\u2022 House repeals all; Senate expands or retains allThe Senate bill allows owners of businesses organized as pass-throughs to deduct 23 percent of their business income.The House bill sets a new 25 percent tax on pass-through businesses and builds guardrails to prevent companies from exploiting the loophole.The Senate bill creates seven income tax brackets: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 38.5 percent. Those brackets expire at the end of 2025.The House bill creates four income tax brackets: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Those brackets are permanent.The House bill ultimately kills the estate tax, which Republicans refer to as the death tax, because it is a tax on wealthy estates that are left to heirs.The Senate bill applies the death tax to fewer people by doubling the exemption to levels to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples, but it does not kill the tax.The Senate bill leaves the Johnson Amendment untouched.Repealing the amendment has long been a key priority of the religious right, which views the ban as an example of government hostility to religion in the public square. But such a repeal is opposed by thousands of religious and nonprofit leaders, who warn that it could blur the line between charity and politics.Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the 1954 ban, and religious groups have said they expect it to be included in the final legislation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases. There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals. Several prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that.There is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases. Critics counter that there is little historical evidence for that claim.GrowthThis capital deepening \u2014 having more and better capital for each worker \u2014 reverses recent trends and raises productivity growth. More rapid productivity growth, in turn, raises the real wages of the middle class and restores upward mobility to a stagnant labor market.There is nothing wrong with the idea that reducing a tax on capital will spur investment, which should increase worker productivity and, eventually, wages. But these models ignore important features of the real world, the tax code and the proposed tax law changes.BUDGETA fair concern has been raised over the need for additional federal borrowing as a result of the proposed reform. Certainly the level and trajectory of the federal debt are a troubling issue, and a revenue-neutral approach would have been preferable. But it is important to get the right order of magnitude of any impact. That means the Treasury will need to finance another $40 billion to $60 billion more each year. This is a drop in the bucket of the Treasury market, with inconsequential implications for the overall level of interest rates.MULTINATIONALSAmerican businesses have booked roughly $3 trillion overseas to avoid paying United States taxes. Under the Republican plan, they would get a tax break worth about $500 billion in return for bringing the money home. Republicans argue that the money would be used to create jobs. Critics say the proposal would reward companies for tax-avoidance strategies without \u2014 based on past cases \u2014 an economic dividend.WAGES PROSPERITY Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia to Allow Movie Theaters After 35-Year Ban", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In the latest in a series of gestures toward modernization that would once have seemed improbable, Saudi Arabia announced on Monday that it would allow commercial movie theaters to open for the first time in more than 35 years.Although satellite television and video downloads have made the ban on commercial theaters all but irrelevant, the announcement highlights the diminishing power of the kingdom\u2019s conservative clerics. The grand mufti, Saudi Arabia\u2019s highest religious authority, publicly called commercial films a source of \u201cdepravity\u201d and opposed the opening of movie theaters as recently as a few months ago.And opening the door to such changes raises suspenseful questions about how far they will go, beginning with the issue of what movies will be shown and how they may be censored.Taken together, the loosening of the restrictions is \u201cvery real and quite significant,\u201d said Jane Kinninmont, a scholar at the British research organization Chatham House who studies Saudi Arabia, adding that \u201cmaybe there will be some jobs created in a new agency to censor the movies\u201d along the way.Critics say the detentions were intended, in part, to neutralize potential challengers.The prince has promised that he will use his power to move Saudi Arabia toward a more tolerant form of Islam than its religious establishment has promoted in the kingdom and around the world for decades.In a statement, the Culture and Information Ministry said the government would begin within 90 days licensing movie houses to open. It did not indicate what kind of movies the government might allow to be screened, but made clear that films would be governed by Islamic law.\u201cThe content of the shows will be subjected to censorship based on the media policy of the kingdom,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe shows will be in line with the values and principles, and will include enriching content that is not contrary to Shariah laws and ethical values of the kingdom.\u201dMs. Kinninmont of Chatham House noted that Saudi Arabia\u2019s national airline already shows commercial films on seat-back screens during flights, which may offer clues to the future standards for theaters. No films with sex or nudity are shown. Bottles or glasses of alcohol are obscured with pixels, as are bare shoulders or other displays of flesh.The movie selections, she said, avoid romance and tend toward gore, \u201csince there does not seem to be a problem with showing things that are graphically violent.\u201dIn practice, many Saudis already watch the films they want on their computers or mobile devices, so the opening of commercial theaters would add only a more public venue for viewing certain films.It was unclear how movie theaters\u2019 seating would be configured in a conservative kingdom that enforces gender segregation in most spheres of life. Restaurants and coffee shops are divided into different rooms, one for men and the other for families.The ministry hoped the move would \u201cencourage economic growth by developing the culture and media sector, and offer new employment opportunities,\u201d including 30,000 full-time jobs by 2030.Saudi Arabia began closing movie theaters soon after it adopted ultraconservative religious standards in 1979. Saudi clerics denounced Western movies, and even the many Arabic-language films made in Egypt, as contrary to the teachings of Islam.Saudi movies, some dealing with the delicate issue of gender separation, have also been screened at prestigious cinematic events outside the country.Mona Boshnaq contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Humans have destroyed themselves, save for one man who roams alone. This post-apocalyptic vision of the future isn\u2019t new, but Margaret Atwood\u2019s 2003 book \u201cOryx and Crake,\u201d the first installment of the MaddAddam trilogy, still manages to enthrall readers with its technicolor world-building and deeper ethical questions.Snowman fights to survive in a desolate landscape while mourning the deaths of his brilliant best friend, Crake, and mysterious lover, Oryx. A group of genetically-engineered semi-humans called Crakers keep him company, but when his food supply runs low, he is forced to leave them and venture back to the once-powerful city he left.Between the suspenseful chapters of Snowman\u2019s journey, Atwood fills us in on his \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 more vibrant past. Before he became the weathered, disillusioned Snowman, he was Jimmy: a creative, attractive man who grew up in a broken home. He lived in a society where unrestrained scientists birthed new creatures at their will, massive corporations disseminated unregulated products for profit, and clueless plebeians ate it all up, literally. It was the golden age of genetic engineering \u2014 but after Oryx and Crake exposed him to the world outside the comfortable Compounds he\u2019d always lived in, Jimmy started to see its cracks.The storylines transition seamlessly, bridging together in a breathtaking showdown at the end (or middle?). It isn\u2019t quite an \u201caha!\u201d moment given the conspicuous hints dropped earlier in the book, but it satisfies. Although some characters and backstories remain frustratingly elusive, an unexpected twist at the end suggests some answers in the sequels.\u201cOryx and Crake\u201d straddles the line between being entertaining and thought-provoking. Lives are at stake, characters hide things, and doom is inevitable. There\u2019s rarely a dull moment.But the book\u2019s government-absent world is also a playground to unleash human temptations and raise questions about our moral choices. Characters watch executions for entertainment; scientists build murderous creatures in the lab just because they can. One day we, too, might have the ultimate power to manipulate life in any way we desire. But does that mean we should?Atwood\u2019s beautiful, quirky prose and her overwhelming use of silly-sounding names like \u201cHappicuppa\u201d gloss over a devastating plot with a touch of playfulness. The resulting sense of slight detachment reminds us of our own tendency to avoid confronting the problems stirring beneath our society like they are in Jimmy\u2019s: rampant pollution, unethical actions of companies, child trafficking, and so on.\u201cOryx and Crake\u201d presents a riveting portrait of the future \u2014 but it also warns us about today.Sara Wasdahl, age 17: \u201cEverything\u2019s a Little Mad Here\u201dPerceptive and cynical, filled with droll observations and wry humor, \u201cMe Talk Pretty One Day\u201d is a sharp and witty collection of essays from American humorist David Sedaris.Sedaris had his major break as an essayist with his 1992 piece \u201cSantaland Diaries,\u201d which he read on National Public Radio to great acclaim. In his fourth collection of personal essays since, Sedaris has lost none of his characteristic sarcasm and wit. \u201cMe Talk Pretty One Day\u201d is a collection of seemingly dry experiences from the author\u2019s life: his parents get a dog, he eats at an expensive restaurant with his boyfriend, and he tries to learn French by listening to a pocket medical dictionary on tape. Through these seemingly dry details, however, Sedaris skillfully calls attention to the absurdity in daily life. Why are people so hopelessly devoted to their pets? Why does he pay exorbitant amounts of money to eat raw fish in a bath of chocolate sauce? Why are French nouns sexualized?David Sedaris grew up the second of six children in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina. In his twenties, he toyed with avant-garde visual and performance art, before becoming an (unqualified) writing teacher, a personal assistant, and then a furniture mover. He eventually ended up in France with his boyfriend, Hugh, and many of the essays in this collection center on his cultural observations and his brave attempts to learn French.The author makes perceptive and often comic observations, using anecdotes in place of flowery adjectives to make for precise and unique commentary. His approach is mainly observational and descriptive: rather than inflicting external meaning on his subject matter, he lets humor and irony speak for itself as he carefully considers each topic. \u201cThere are cats that weigh more than my IQ score,\u201d he says about taking a Mensa qualification test in the essay \u201cSmart Guy.\u201d \u201cWere my number translated into dollars, it would buy you about three buckets of fried chicken \u2026 Either you reason things or you don\u2019t. Those who do have high IQs. Those who don\u2019t reach for the mayonnaise when they can\u2019t find the insect repellent.\u201dThis is not a traditional memoir in that Sedaris does not try to self-reflect, or paint a perfect portrait of himself. Instead, this memoir allows us to see snapshots of the cynical, creative, perceptive, self-deprecating and downright hilarious person David Sedaris is.\u201cMe Talk Pretty One Day\u201d is a book that urges us to laugh at the absurdity of our behaviors and the randomness of our cultural customs. It reminds us that nothing in life is too sacred to be ruthlessly mocked.Evan Reynolds, age 15: \u201cBattle of the Sexes: A Hillary Clinton Movie in a Donald Trump World\u201dThe year is 1973. A highly publicized tennis match, \u201cThe Battle of the Sexes,\u201d is aired between incendiary sexist has-been Bobby Riggs and young up-and-comer Billie Jean King. The media circus of blatant chauvinism surrounding the match quickly fades, as King wins against Riggs in three sets, shattering a glass ceiling for female athletes and putting an end to the outrageous gender politics of the era. Or so it was thought.Contrast 1973 with 2016, where competent, experienced Hillary Clinton loses the presidential election to Donald Trump, a demagogic businessman who exploits institutionalized sexism in order to draw greater crowds. One of the final glass ceilings suddenly becomes that much harder to reach. And the world\u2019s assumption that modern sexism is ending comes to a screeching halt.It is this brave new world in which \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d (the movie) debuted, eight months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Through no fault of its own, the film loses its resonance, as an ending that was clearly intended to be a victory lap in a Hillary Clinton presidency becomes merely a wistful memory.Don\u2019t misunderstand me. If one were to keep a checklist of everything that makes a movie conventionally \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 the acting, the direction, the script, the pacing \u2014 it would fill out every single one of those boxes. If one judges the film based solely on artistic merit, it is a resounding success. But the agenda that it clearly tries to push here appears unrealistic.King (Emma Stone) takes center stage, working with a group of all-star female players to close the gender wage gap while simultaneously struggling with her own sexuality. Riggs (Steve Carell), by contrast, is a washed-up former tennis player and gambling addict who finds himself once again drawn to the court. In order to gain attention, Riggs makes inflammatory statements about women to any media outlet he can find, and challenges multiple women to exhibition matches in order to \u201csettle the debate\u201d about female athletes.Stone and Carell both give measured, capable performances, and the film is that much better for it. It tackles and takes sides on major issues. But the film loses its impact when it begins portraying sexual discrimination as something ridiculous, a museum relic that children and mothers can point to and laugh at before moving on down to the Jim Crow selection.Our current politics don\u2019t reflect an end to sexism but a resurgence, as abortion policy and women\u2019s health initiatives are now dictated by committees of white men. \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d is a victim of bad timing, released in a world where its gender politics border on fallacy. Through little fault of its own, it appears hopelessly out of touch.Arnav Prasad, age 17: \u201c\u2018Universal Paperclips\u2019: The Rebirth of a Classic Video Game Genre\u201dTo the adroit gamer, one all too familiar with the dynamic gameplay, lifelike graphics, and intricate plots of popular gaming franchises, Frank Lantz\u2019s \u201cUniversal Paperclips\u201d surrenders visual complexity for conceptual depth.For much of recent video game history, the \u201cclicker\u201d format, where users repeatedly press the screen through the entirety of the game, has condemned itself to short-lived, viral streaks \u2014 think \u201cFlappy Bird\u201d or \u201cSubway Surfer.\u201d Dismantling the monotony of clickers, \u201cUniversal Paperclips\u201d represents the next step in the genre\u2019s natural evolution. The routine imagery of sex, violence and profanity that permeates classic prestige games is lost on \u201cUniversal Paperclips.\u201d In its replacement, the game capitalizes upon numbers, their ubiquity, and their power in a world cast in their image.Beyond a plain opening interface, the basic clicker game transforms itself into a profound narrative of an easily recognizable reality. Centered around a harmless paperclip manufacturing business, the premise of the game is simple: sell paperclips to maximize profits. With a click of a button, the user, who comes to represent artificial intelligence, begins a storied journey to develop an evermore seamless paperclip factory. With skilled manipulation of the price, pace of production, and stocking of paperclip inventory, the user rapidly cultivates their own financial power. As paperclips convert to available funds, the user unlocks myriad potential upgrades that promise the expansion of the business. From allocating computational power to \u201cinterpret and understand the human language,\u201d to inheriting an algorithmic hedge fund, to investing in the exploration of the universe for novel paperclip material, the versatility of paperclips and its associated economy sees no virtual bounds.The immersive game exists at the intersection of subtle cultural commentary and mindless time-waster. At its core, \u201cUniversal Paperclips\u201d is simply another browser game. Yet, beyond its literal focus on paperclips, the game warns of a problematic breed of artificial intelligence that champions earnings at the expense of morality. Perhaps, artificial intelligence will risk the world order to promote its overarching goal of paperclip mania; or instead, humankind will gradually succumb to the tumultuous rigors of the vast paperclip economy. In a technological age marked by supercomputers and the like, \u201cUniversal Paperclips,\u201d in the face of its perceived simplicity, acts as a timely reminder of how artificial intelligence blurs the boundary between object and life. In short, the artistry of game derives from its asking of how society must grapple with computers\u2019 expanding control over the ethical ambiguities ever so prevalent in the world. Thanks to Frank Lantz and his innovations, at least everyone now knows to take their paperclips a little more seriously.Amaya Oswald, age 17: \u201cRashid Johnson\u2019s \u2018Stranger\u2019 and the Desire to Be One\u201dRashid Johnson\u2019s \u201cStranger,\u201d which was recently held at the Hauser and Wirth gallery in Somerset, United Kingdom, uses art to explore the complex way that human identity is constantly shaped by unfamiliar experiences and culture, all while progressively unfolding a story of being an outsider. Growing up in an African-American household in Chicago, Johnson then moved to New York City as an adult, and later to the U.K. This infusion of culture across cities and countries is the backdrop for \u201cStranger.\u201dBeginning with three massive, metal-wired structures, the first room of the experience excellently captures Johnson\u2019s personal identity; each cage-like framework embraces bottle-green African plants tangled in the metal, attempting to escape their containments. Jutting out from the wire shelves lie books about the African-American experience in the United States, and propped in the center of the wire cage are timid yellow heads carved with African shea butter with crosshatched mouths and deep, sad eyes. The fusion of these many native African materials and diverse art forms serves to create a vibrancy and richness emphasized by being confined in one room. This arrangement is shocking against the barren English brick walls of the exhibition room and makes the structure feel especially alien.The next room of the exhibition is an entirely different scene; the walls are spaced with daringly large, sunken faces and darkly scratched coal eyes. The repetitious faces are a stark contrast to the first room that overwhelmed the space with identity, and the fierce black marks express a kind of rugged anger at the world. Just as Johnson\u2019s hand would be while drawing all those faces, his identity seems to become tired and maddened. The faces are dizzying on the walls, and such constancy of thought in the one room makes the atmosphere charged and suspenseful.A few more pieces follow, bearing the same dark frustration, before there is just one last, long oblong room left. Still dizzy, I amble through the door to see what the final room holds in store. There is just one piece, and it is shining vibrantly from the bookend of the room: a fluorescent neon sign that reads \u201cRun.\u201dThe soft, electric instruction is clear and direct. The command run is not negative \u2014 instead, there is in fact something positive about this structural beauty. The glowing italics, with all their allure and power, are simply urging me to experience. Run, it says. To different worlds, be a wanderer \u2014 despite the side-effects of a complex identity, continue to develop your individuality, and experience nothing if it isn\u2019t new. Be a stranger.Vicky Lee, age 17: \u201cCirque du Soleil: Oh, So Kurios\u201d\u201cThe circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\u201d \u2015 Erin Morgenstern, The Night CircusI have been properly bewitched since this October. That is to say, absolutely and hopelessly bewitched: ever since the infamous Cirque du Soleil hurricaned into my life. One moment I was bitterly cursing into my mittens, in line behind another hundred grumpy individuals huddling away from the biting West Coast wind. And the next, I was stepping into a steampunk fairy-tale world all underneath a soaring depthless black. The hextech lights, the swinging music, the fantastical costumes all featured in Kurios: Cabinet of Curiosities; they brought me back to my sci-fi fantasy-loving, 10-year-old self once again, even before the performance began.Beyond amazing tricks and illusions, I found myself entranced by the interactions between the stage and audience. Cast members would chaotically pile themselves on platforms to entertain each and every section of the crowd, creating a hectic yet festive merrymaking for all. Some performers would venture into front rows to bug or play with children. It is an intimate exchange where the entertainers visibly feed off the enjoyment of the audience. I personally fell in love with the live singer Eirini Tornesaki, whose ghostly and captivating voice accompanies most of the scenes in the show.However, I cannot properly recreate the experience for you \u2014 because that is what it is: an experience. But know when the show begins, you will hear a chime. The numbers on a clock above the stage, previously unnoticed by the audience, starts revolving at a slow, dreamlike pace. You will hear gears groaning and machines sputtering to life. Suddenly the lights turn off and a hush settles over the gathered crowd. It\u2019s 11:11, with no indication of daytime or nighttime, and the circus has arrived.The ephemeral atmosphere will coax you from reality and completely consume you. When the half time gives you a brief respite, a haze lingers in your mind. And when the show ends you will find yourself in middle of the cold, cold parking lot, wondering if it really happened or not. You understand one thing though. You hope that the circus will visit you again; you hope to see it in your dreams.Matthew Lamberson, age 17: \u201cXana-don\u2019t: The Costly Monstrosity\u201dNew Jersey isn\u2019t famous for astounding artistic works, but sometimes art doesn\u2019t need to be good to draw attention. Consider Congo the chimpanzee, whose paintings sold for over $20,000 and were proudly displayed by Pablo Picasso. If there\u2019s an architectural equivalent of this, it is certainly the Meadowlands Xanadu. At least Congo didn\u2019t need billions of dollars, seventeen years, and two other chimpanzees to complete his project.Xanadu, located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, was first drafted in 2002 by the Mills Corporation, which was known for large malls with an abstract or modern style. Within five years, Mills had gone bankrupt and the property was sold, but not before they could bestow upon it their signature bizarre architecture and color palette. The mall changed hands a few times and remained at 80 percent completion until 2017, and it is now projected to open in 2019.Visually, the most egregious of Xanadu\u2019s many design flaws is the color scheme, which at least takes on the uniquely New Jersey look of a pile of Cape May cottages after Hurricane Sandy. Some sides of the mall have a seemingly random array of white and blue, giving it the appearance of a large cargo ship stacked with shipping containers. Other walls are painted with alternating stripes of yellow and maroon, which closely resembles rust and gives the building a decrepit air. Some walls aren\u2019t painted at all, and a stark contrast is formed between the Brutalist look of the concrete and the otherwise chaotic palette. With these features combined, Xanadu actually resembles nearby Newark harbor, which is brimming with fading cargo containers, rusty barges, yellow marsh grass and unimaginative concrete.Unfortunately, it is difficult to fully grasp Xanadu\u2019s interior design without trespassing, but if the outside is any indicator, it is certainly doozy. The building has a nearly triangular shape with one parking garage in the middle and three surrounding it, meaning traffic in the area, especially with MetLife Stadium next door, will be a nightmare. Frankly, the best thing about the design is that the mall will never run out of parking spaces, considering it has over 28 lots and four garages. The open triangle shape also doubles the amount of time required to move from one side of the building to the other (assuming shoppers don\u2019t want to dodge the aforementioned horrendous traffic on foot). Xanadu may even have problems on a purely structural level, as several serious cracks appeared following heavy snow in 2011.To summarize:Thorne Kieffer, age 16: \u201cAn Incurable Fever\u201dThe definition of a fever is \u201ca high body temperature, usually accompanied by shivering, headache, and sometimes, delirium.\u201d In his entertaining memoir, \u201cFever Pitch,\u201d Nick Hornby offers a history of his fever for soccer and his love for his home team Arsenal. It\u2019s a fever that runs so strong it becomes the lens through which Hornby examines his whole life.\u201cFever Pitch\u201d is an action-packed narrative, perfect for the avid soccer fan, but a love for sports is not a requisite to enjoying this book. One may not understand every nuanced soccer term Hornby mentions, but that won\u2019t take away from the visceral impact of going to hundreds of soccer games with the author at Highbury Stadium in North London.Each chapter takes us to a different Arsenal game where Hornby lives through the victories and defeats and provides a running commentary of his concurrent emotional state. He shows us his elation after every big Arsenal victory. Hornby\u2019s perfect day is comprised of, \u201cA 2-0 home victory against the League leaders after a fish-and-chip-lunch.\u201d In 1979 Arsenal makes it to the Cup Final for the second year in row only to lose again, which plunges Hornby into an almost debilitating slump: \u201cI hated Arsenal. The club was a burden I could no longer carry but one that I would never, ever be able to throw off.\u201d Hornby is so invested in Arsenal that, \u201cArsenal\u2019s moods and fortunes somehow reflected (his) own.\u201d His emotions are dangerously tethered to the successes and failures of his team.As a subtheme, Hornby provides the reader a wonderful sense of the fierce camaraderie between British soccer fans. His writing is extremely detailed and vivid, so when he takes us to rowdy away games on Wednesday nights, the reader feels they are sitting in the seat beside him. The reader sees fans risk their lives in intense brawls in small British stadiums, where fevered fans just like him scream their lungs out as if they were on the team themselves. One witnesses how English soccer is more than just a sport, it\u2019s a way for people to escape their daily lives and feel emotions on a greater scale. Soccer gives Hornby and his friends a greater sense of hope for their everyday lives.Although his detailed descriptions of each game are gripping from a soccer standpoint, it is the way Hornby delves into his fluctuating emotions that makes this book a great read. In the end, this memoir is a sensitive description of a young boy\u2019s coming-of-age during his years of fevered devotion to soccer. Hornby grows up through soccer in these pages, and it\u2019s his poignant and growing self-awareness that keeps us reading.Connor Crowell, age 16: \u201cA Study in Repetition\u201d\u201cSacred Guitar and Violin Music of the Modern Aztecs\u201d isn\u2019t an album that was ever intended to be reviewed critically \u2014 it\u2019s an anthropological record recorded in 1977 by two ethnomusicologists simply looking to catalog the ceremonial music of a dying culture. The album is listed as educational on some websites; it was released on the \u201cSmithsonian Folkways\u201d record label. None of this matters however, when one looks at the album objectively: nobody releases a record so that it isn\u2019t listened to, so there is no reason that \u201cSacred Guitar and Violin Music of the Modern Aztecs\u201d should not be critiqued as any other album would be.This is music intended to be listened to during worship ceremonies, but I cannot imagine that even then it wouldn\u2019t grate on the listener after two minutes. The average song on the album goes as follows:1. Create a joyous violin or guitar riff.2. Play that riff for eight minutes, or however long you feel like, with varying degrees of success as to whether or not you play the riff correctly each time.3. That\u2019s it.There are two songs on the album that are not over five minutes long, and even they begin to wear on you before they end. Some may find the simplicity of these songs charming, a \u201cpart of our culture musically that is unexplored,\u201d but any claim of the sort would be ridiculous \u2014 repetition is a staple of nearly all European-American music, from the 12 bar blues to the Passacaglias of Bach \u2014 we have a repeat sign in musical notation for a reason. The problem with \u201cSacred Guitar and Violin Music of the Modern Aztecs\u201d isn\u2019t that it\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s that it never builds on top of that repetition: a repeating phrase with variations in it is an ostinato; a perpetually repeating phrase in the background of a song is a chaconne; a song that is just a repeating phrase is a boring song.\u201cSacred Guitar and Violin Music of the Modern Aztecs\u201d is meant as a snapshot of a cultural ceremony that is foreign to the lives and ears of its listeners. It is meant to encourage a diversification of musical tastes, to support a broadening of one\u2019s anthropological and artistic horizons. The album, however, only convinces the listener of one thing: people didn\u2019t go to these ceremonies for the music.Lily Barnett, age 16: \u201cFreetown Sound: Messy, Confusing, and Brilliant\u201dAs minority groups feel increasingly insecure, there\u2019s been a trend for artists to churn out superficial albums that receive praise for their sheer mention of race, gender or sexuality. Real representation of insecurity ought to be messy, just as is the subject itself. Dev Hynes\u2019s third album, under the alias Blood Orange, perfectly encapsulates this dilemma through his politically-charged lyrics and beats reminiscent of the \u201880\u2019s. Titled \u201cFreetown Sound,\u201d Hynes pours his thoughts into the project, making for a raw and hypnotic depiction of identity.Fans of Hynes will see similarities to previous projects in his powerfully-subdued lyrics, but \u201cFreetown Sound\u201d creates a listening experience far different from the alt-pop boppy anthems of prior albums like \u201cCoastal Grooves.\u201d In Freetown, tracks are broken up through conceptual interludes, like the messy and atmospheric album opener \u201cBy Ourselves\u201d. The track features no clear hook and a layer of vocals that creates a state of confusion, setting the perfect tone for the tracks to come. Before ending, the last sentiment of a sample of black slam-poet Ashlee Haze\u2019s \u201cFor Colored Girls (The Missy Elliott Poem)\u201d echoes \u201cthere are a million black girls waiting to see someone who looks like them\u201d as the statement trails off in free-jazz, clearly leaving the listener who\u2019d come for Hynes\u2019 classic \u201880\u2019s dance beats somewhat confused. However, this album is not just for the abstract-minded listener; one can certainly look to the track \u201cBest to You\u201d for the same blast-with-the-windows-down sensation that might have drawn them to Blood Orange in the first place. And even so, the politicization of the tracks is not so far-fetched to no longer be enjoyable; the track \u201cDesir\u00e9e,\u201d despite being adorned with samples from queer-minority cult documentary \u201cParis is Burning,\u201d still manages to flow beautifully in a more conventional sense.Not only is the album compositionally vital, it really does sound good; it arguably features Blood Orange\u2019s best vocals yet, with his range on full display in \u201cEVP.\u201d In this and other tracks, the heart-thumping rhythm of the gated reverb creates an air of \u201880\u2019s nostalgia. And yet these appealing rhythms have a purpose, as their inspiration draws on a decade filled with immense identification struggle in the midst of political and social turmoil, honing in on Hynes\u2019s own story. Of the problems he addresses \u2014 those based on his experiences as a queer black male \u2014 none are given clear-cut solutions. There is no one specific question posed by Hynes on these 17 tracks; to most genuinely represent these issues, Hynes proves that there can\u2019t be, given all of their complexity, confusion and frustration._________Judges: Amanda Christy Brown, Shannon Doyne, Caroline Crosson Gilpin, Michael Gonchar, Natalie Proulx and Katherine Schulten.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Evans Questions March Toward Higher Interest Rates", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOther Fed officials, including the chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, favor a rate increase, and financial markets regard it as a lock. But Mr. Evans is worried about the slow pace of inflation. He says the Fed needs to show it is serious about driving inflation back up to its target 2 percent annual pace.\u201cIs there really a hurry to raise rates?\u201d he asked in an interview. \u201cWhat if we just decided to wait until the middle of the year and if we saw inflation pick up, then we could do something? I would say at the moment I think the current decision is really a judgment call.\u201dThe interview was conducted last week; Fed officials are not allowed to comment publicly on monetary policy in the week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.In questioning whether the Fed is doing enough to revive the economy, Mr. Evans is reprising a role he has played repeatedly since the financial crisis. At times, he has succeeded in persuading his colleagues to do more. It remains to be seen whether he will again prove prescient in his concerns, or whether inflation will rebound in the months ahead.The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity. How goes the economy?I think the economy is doing very well. I think it continues to show strength. The second half is looking like very good growth: 2.5 to 3 percent growth. And this is to be measured against our assessment that sustainable growth is more like 1.75 percent. So 2.5 to 3 percent is very strong growth, which should continue to lead to improved labor market activity.Unless something structural improves to increase trend growth, we\u2019re going to be decelerating to something under 2 percent \u2014 and that will still be a pretty good economic picture. Should the Fed raise its benchmark interest rate in December?I\u2019ve been looking at the data, and the data have not been strongly indicating that we should continue with a rate increase. I do worry that inflation expectations have not yet moved up in a noticeable way that I think is on the path to being more consistent with 2 percent. I\u2019m going to be listening to everybody, but I don\u2019t think that the call is obvious at this point. Why does inflation remain below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target?One of the things that makes me nervous is that longer-term inflation expectations have moved down over the last few years. I think that makes it more challenging to get inflation up to 2 percent. I think everybody is mindful that you don\u2019t want inflation to get out of hand. Having said that, we\u2019ve now gotten to the point where low inflation as an objective is extremely credible. We\u2019ve gained a lot of credibility, and I don\u2019t think markets or the public are expecting central bankers to let inflation get out of hand. I think we\u2019ve got a bit of a reverse problem. We haven\u2019t demonstrated with our actions that 2 percent isn\u2019t a ceiling. What steps should the Fed take to strengthen inflation expectations?I think our policy moves to date have been thoughtful and reasonable. We\u2019ve increased our funds rate objective by 100 basis points. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop and see whether inflation expectations are going to move in line with our 2 percent objective. And if the judgment was that we\u2019re still likely to be underrunning our 2 percent objective, maybe we would stop briefly and assess for more information, maybe wait until mid-2018.If we\u2019d said four or five years ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be the hardest thing \u2014 getting unemployment down to our objective or getting inflation up to our objective?\u201d I think a lot of people would have said that inflation was going to be easier.But my point is really more about the future dilemmas that we\u2019re going to be facing. At some point, something is going to happen and we\u2019re going to need to address a downturn or a weakness in the economy. I worry that as we get down to the zero lower bound and we have to trot out other tools, we\u2019re going to be relying on the public and markets to believe we\u2019re going to follow through and get inflation up to 2 percent. If we don\u2019t live up to it this time, I think it\u2019s even harder to get that message across and our tools would not be as effective. I look at the Bank of Japan, and they have struggled for decades with this type of credibility issue. You\u2019ve also suggested that concerns about financial stability are not a good reason to raise interest rates. Why not?I do take seriously that if we have overly accommodative policy \u2014 even in an attempt to get inflation up to our objective \u2014 then we\u2019re somehow providing the means for the financial sector to lever up a bit, particularly if we don\u2019t have the right prudential standards in place. It just seems to me that it would be much better if we used our other tools, supervision, that would allow our monetary policy tools to address our inflation and employment goals. Are those other tools strong enough?There are few really good examples of macroprudential policies that central banks have brought out over time. I think in spite of that, what the regulators do in talking to the institutions is really very helpful, and those are the tools we need to pursue. We have to have a culture of reasonable regulatory approaches that are balanced so that businesses and consumers can go out and meet their needs. It\u2019s not uncomplicated, but that\u2019s what goes with the territory. Does the Trump administration\u2019s aversion to regulation lead you to think that you may need to lean more heavily on raising rates?I know that the president is going to make some appointments to the Federal Reserve Board. I\u2019m confident that that board will look at everything carefully and implement what I think are appropriate policies. I think that\u2019s the way policy has to be made and proceed. That\u2019s where the authorities lie. I\u2019m hopeful that good, quality people will be put in place that look at the risks.I\u2019ve always enjoyed and benefited from working with Janet Yellen, and I thought she was just an extremely outstanding Fed chair. But presidents get to come in and make their appointments, and I think Jay will be extremely good. He\u2019s been involved in everything for the last five years. He\u2019s got a lot of knowledge. He also knows something about our quirkiness. I think that\u2019s a benefit.I think what we need to at least consider is, what should the strategic framework look like going forward? For me, the take-away is we really need to work on these things. We need to get to the point where we understand the frameworks. Is that happening?I think we\u2019re having discussions about this. This takes the form of various parties saying, \u201cWe should talk about this.\u201d The minutes periodically will talk about a special memo. I don\u2019t think anything has risen to the point where I\u2019d say, \u201cYes, this is a long discussion about the alternative strategy for the future.\u201d I think it would be natural for the Fed chair, particularly a new Fed chair, to entertain discussions like that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fancy Sausages and a $2 Million Bribe: A Trial Uncovers Kremlin Infighting", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, a former economy minister in Russia who had clashed with a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was convicted on Friday of soliciting a $2 million bribe, in a case that pulled back the curtain on Kremlin infighting.Mr. Ulyukayev and his supporters insisted the evidence against him was concocted to eliminate a critic of growing state dominance in the oil industry. But the judge, Larisa Semenova, rejected the arguments that the former minister had been framed and sided with prosectors, who called it an open-and-shut case of corruption.Judge Semenova sentenced Mr. Ulyukayev, who had been locked in a struggle with Igor I. Sechin, the director of the state oil company Rosneft, over how to revive the swooning Russian economy, to eight years in a penal colony and a fine of 130 million rubles, or $2.2 million.The punishment was less than the 10-year sentence and 500 million-ruble fine sought by prosecutors. Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s lawyers said they would appeal.Russia\u2019s smoothly executed military operations in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of election meddling in the United States, have lent Mr. Putin an air of mystery and monolithic power, but the case against Mr. Ulyukayev shed light on the jockeying for position among members of the president\u2019s inner circle.Mr. Ulyukayev had been a prominent member of a liberal wing in the Russian government, and he was accused of seeking a huge bribe from Mr. Sechin in exchange for acquiescing to a major oil deal he had initially opposed.Mr. Sechin accused Mr. Ulyukayev of seeking the bribe in exchange for dropping objections to the state oil company\u2019s acquisition of a recently nationalized midsize oil producer, Bashneft.The sale was billed as a privatization, but Mr. Ulyukayev contended that privatization was impossible if the buyer was a state company.Mr. Sechin said the former minister had solicited the bribe in October 2016, but only with a gesture: During a game of pool, he said, Mr. Ulyukayev held up two fingers, signaling that his price was $2 million.At his annual year-end news conference on Thursday, Mr. Putin chastised Mr. Sechin for ignoring a summons to testify at court. \u201cSechin should have come to court,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWhat is the problem anyway?\u201dMr. Putin did offer a mild defense of Mr. Sechin, saying that no law had been broken when he refused to testify, despite critics who argued otherwise.Igor M. Bunin, the president of the Center for Political Technologies, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Ulyukayev\u2019s undoing was that he had fallen from favor with Mr. Putin, in part for delivering bad economic news.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support the liberal course, another to fail to create a good personal relationship with Putin,\u201d Mr. Bunin said. Earlier in his career, for example, Mr. Ulyukayev, then deputy governor of the central bank, had been passed over for a promotion to bank governor after pushing back against Kremlin pressure to spur economic growth by lowering interest rates, saying such a move risked sparking inflation.In his closing statement earlier this month, Mr. Ulyukayev protested his innocence and said the court proceedings had evoked the era of show trials in Russia under Joseph Stalin. \u201cThe evidence shows that I\u2019ve been targeted in a monstrous provocation,\u201d he said.Speaking of Mr. Sechin\u2019s refusal to testify, Mr. Ulyukayev said the oil executive had vanished and \u201conly the smell of sulfur in the air was left,\u201d a reference to the \u201cThe Master and Margarita,\u201d the riotous Russian novel by Mikhail Bulgakov about the devil appearing in Stalin\u2019s Moscow.Anybody could fall victim to a fabricated criminal case, Mr. Ulyukayev said. \u201cNow this is very easy: A bag, a basket, a poorly filmed video, three clicks and it is ready,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Wavers on Environment, and Earth\u2019s Largest Wetland Starts to Wither", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIRANDA, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s booming soy industry and cattle ranches are threatening one of the richest wildlife havens on the planet, where packs of jaguars, caimans, marsh deer and macaws have roamed freely for eons.The Pantanal region, the world\u2019s largest tropical wetlands, is starting to wither. Over the last 15 years, about 8,700 square miles of the area, which straddles Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, have been altered, with fast-growing patches of yellow, arid land introduced into the lush biome, which covers roughly 70,000 square miles, or about the size of Syria.This degradation of the Pantanal is seen by critics as one sign of Brazil\u2019s weakening resolve to protect its environment.While the Brazilian government earlier this year hailed a modest achievement in its signature environmental fight \u2014 containing the deforestation of the Amazon \u2014 it has been embarrassed by other trend lines. The country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions increased by 9 percent last year, compared with 2015, marking the highest output since 2008.Fueled in large part by the conversion of forested land for farming and other commercial purposes, last year\u2019s emissions increase has called into question Brazil\u2019s ability to honor its international commitments to combat climate change, including those under the Paris agreement.The expansion of agriculture into areas with few environmental regulations, or lax enforcement, has coincided with a politically turbulent period in Brazil during which a powerful coalition of federal lawmakers, representing farming interests, has had its way on a number of controversial land-use policies.\u201cIn practice, Temer has removed Brazil from the Paris agreement, just like President Trump did, with the difference that he doesn\u2019t have the courage to assume that position publicly,\u201d said Marina Silva, who was Brazil\u2019s environment minister from 2003 to 2008. During that period, the country was celebrated abroad for its aggressive efforts to curb rampant Amazon deforestation.\u201cThere\u2019s a firm effort to dismantle the government apparatus created over the past decades to support policies that were consistent with the reduction of greenhouse gases,\u201d Ms. Silva said.Mr. Temer is unabashed about his support for the agriculture and cattle industries, calling them essential engines of economic growth.\u201cIt is often said that I, or my government, protects farmers or cattle ranchers,\u201d he said during a recent speech at an industry event. \u201cIt\u2019s the contrary. It\u2019s farmers and cattle ranchers who protect the national economy and that is the clear reality. We can\u2019t be afraid to say that.\u201dA law regulating the sustainable use of land in those areas, however, was passed for only one of the biomes, the Atlantic Forest. That meant that landowners in places like the Pantanal had few constraints when Brazil\u2019s commodities boom at the turn of the century suddenly made their parcels highly profitable.The Temer government has characterized the surge in agricultural exports, mainly to China, as an important ingredient of the country\u2019s slow recovery from a yearslong recession.This export-led growth has generated tempting opportunities for landowners in Pantanal, a region whose swampy terrain and sweltering temperatures had previously made it unattractive for farming. That changed as new technology made it possible to turn wetlands into soybean fields.Last year, there were 4.8 million acres of soy fields in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, the two states that include the Pantanal \u2014 a 77 percent increase from a decade ago.\u201cThank God we have China buying our products,\u201d said Roberto Folley Coelho, a farm owner who makes a living raising cattle, planting rice and soy, and hosting tourists.Mr. Coelho scoffed at the notion that his soy crops could be causing environmental damage, arguing that imposing environmental regulations in the region would do more harm than good.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that curtailing private initiative could lead to more poverty here,\u201d he said.The threat of rigid environmental regulations remains remote in Pantanal. In 2011, a law was introduced in Congress seeking to create a framework for sustainable development in the region, but the legislation has stalled.\u201cWhat we need is to strike a balance,\u201d said Felipe Dias, the executive director of the SOS Pantanal Institute, which advocates wetlands conservation.But farmers, he said, often don\u2019t focus on the long-term damage caused by their crops, which erode the soil, polluting and diverting rivers. This alters the rhythms of the wet and dry seasons in the Pantanal, permanently flooding large areas. \u201cThey don\u2019t think about tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re fine now, they don\u2019t care about what happens next.\u201dAt the national level, a similar focus on short-term economic gains has made sustainable development an afterthought, environmentalists argue.Those initiatives came as Mr. Temer, a deeply unpopular leader, spent enormous political capital fending off the threat of trial on corruption and obstruction of justice charges by persuading lawmakers to block them.\u201cLacking popular support, the Temer government sought the backing of groups with clout in Congress, among them the agricultural bloc,\u201d said Carlos Rittl, the executive secretary of Climate Observatory, an environmental group. \u201cTemer leaned on that support to shield himself from investigations and sold out the environmental agenda.\u201dTemer administration officials defended their record on the environment, arguing that criticism was overblown. Their main achievement this year was a 16 percent reduction in Amazon deforestation, following several years of steady rise.\u201cDeforestation was out of control,\u201d Environment Minister Sarney Filho told reporters recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve addressed the situation.\u201dAnother initiative the Temer government cited as part of its commitment to the environment has been met with criticism.In October, officials announced they would offer companies that have been fined for violating environmental regulations steep discounts to settle their debts. Proceeds, the government said, would go toward conservation projects. The ministry noted that only about 5 percent of environmental fines had been collected in recent years.Mr. Sarney defended the measure as pragmatic in light of the fact that big companies can refuse to pay fines by fighting them in court for years on end. The long-term solution, he said, is to find a way to compensate owners who preserve their lands.\u201cForest protection services need to be paid for,\u201d he said.Adauto Rodrigues Oliveira, a soy farmer in Miranda, agrees. Environmentalists, he said, show little regard for the livelihood of farmers.\u201cThey don\u2019t care, they just say you can\u2019t plant here,\u201d he said. \u201cEnvironmentalists want to protect the land but they don\u2019t want to pay indemnity.\u201dAsked about the long-term impact of his soy fields on the surrounding wildlife, he shrugged. People in the region are less poor than they were before agriculture in the area took off.\u201cSoy is a good business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very good for Pantanal.\u201dLis Moriconi contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governors Look to Save Nafta Amid Washington\u2019s Tough Talk", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration continues to cast doubt on the future viability of the North American Free Trade Agreement, American business leaders, members of Congress and governors have paraded into the White House to warn about the economic dangers of unraveling the pact.Government officials and business executives have met in recent weeks with President Trump and Vice President Pence, a development that\u2019s being viewed by proponents of Nafta as a positive sign for the future of the agreement. But as American, Canadian and Mexican trade negotiators met this week in Washington to reach a new deal, there has been no sign that the United States is ready to alter its tough negotiating stance.Mr. Trump continues to criticize the deal and talk about withdrawing from the 1994 pact, including at a rally last Friday in Pensacola, Fla. And talks with Canadian and Mexican negotiators, which took place a few blocks from the White House, concluded Friday still deadlocked over several proposals by the United States.Instead, negotiators meeting in what they call an \u201cintersessional\u201d round this week focused on forging agreements on less contentious parts of the pact, including reducing regulatory barriers, setting standards related to the electricity sector, and regulating state-owned enterprises.Officials are trying to lay the foundation to announce more progress at the sixth official round of negotiations over Nafta, which is scheduled to take place in Montreal on Jan. 23-28. The lead negotiators are angling to reach agreement on as many as six of the pact\u2019s roughly two dozen legal chapters at that meeting, people familiar with the negotiations say.It\u2019s an ambitious goal, but one that many see as necessary, given that the timeline for resolving the pact will soon run up against political issues next year, including a presidential election in Mexico and midterm elections in the United States.With time running out and the United States continuing to take a tough stance, industry leaders and state officials have begun trying to convince the administration to avoid upsetting a trade pact they say has benefited many American companies and communities. In 2016, 33 American states counted Canada as their biggest export market, while six states ranked Mexico first.Pushback from automakers and farmers, two groups that are likely to be harmed if the United States withdraws from Nafta, helped result in the series of meetings between the administration and Nafta\u2019s supporters.Mr. Pence discussed Nafta\u2019s importance to the economy with the governor of Indiana and auto manufacturers on Tuesday, and the governors of Arkansas, Iowa, Michigan and Tennessee on Thursday. Last week, Mr. Trump and Robert Lighthizer, the trade adviser who is leading the Nafta negotiations, held several meetings with senators to talk about the pact. On Nov. 27, Mr. Pence met with Mr. Lighthizer and representatives from the United States\u2019 three largest automakers.In a statement following the meeting on Thursday, Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas, said he had told the administration that his state \u201cmust be able to continue its access to North American markets unimpeded by trade barriers.\u201d\u201cIt is clear that there is great potential for harm in Arkansas, especially to our farmers, if the United States reverses course regarding cross-border trade,\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said.The meetings followed a somewhat contentious visit by Mr. Pence to the Republican Governors Association\u2019s annual conference in mid-November. At the meeting, in Austin, Tex., governors complained to the vice president about the state of Nafta negotiations and their inability to air concerns with the United States trade representative, according to people close to the talks who were not authorized to speak.The latest round of meetings were a bit of a push and pull, according to those familiar with the talks. Mr. Lighthizer, the strategist behind many of the administration\u2019s goals for Nafta, stood his ground in these meetings and tried to differentiate legitimate complaints from hype, these people said.To those concerned about agricultural trade, Mr. Lighthizer emphasized that the administration\u2019s goal is to preserve duty-free access by successfully reworking Nafta and remaining in the pact. To auto companies and officials concerned about tougher manufacturing requirements, he talked about creating a transition period that would help companies gradually meet the stricter rules.The administration\u2019s supporters have argued that panic among industry leaders and elected officials about the United States leaving Nafta is a false narrative designed to chip away at the White House\u2019s support for eliciting more favorable terms for America.\u201cThe Chamber of Commerce is playing this as status quo or pull out, that\u2019s the way they want to present this,\u201d said Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio who identifies as an ally of the administration on trade. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what this is about.\u201dYet the United States, Canada and Mexico remain deeply split over American proposals to rewrite rules that govern government purchases, automobile manufacturing, the settlement of trade disputes, and a \u201csunset clause\u201d that would cause the pact to automatically expire unless the members vote to continue it.Significant gaps also remain between the Nafta partners on topics that have been less in focus in the American administration, including labor standards and intellectual property.Canada and Mexico are still mostly refusing to engage on the United States\u2019 biggest proposals, which opponents have termed \u201cpoison pills\u201d for their potential to divide the Nafta partners and kill the pact entirely.There are signs that the United States is looking to Mexico, which is heavily dependent on the pact, to compromise first. Mr. Lighthizer dined with Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, on the sidelines of World Trade Organization meetings in Buenos Aires.Mexico and Canada have also been working to influence the United States to compromise on its negotiating positions.Arturo Sarukhan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Mexican diplomat, said Canada, Mexico and the private sector in all three countries had adopted an explicit policy of appealing to governors and mayors of both parties \u201cbecause of the political heft they can bring to bear on this White House.\u201dIn January, the prime minister\u2019s office created a new unit focused on Canada-United States relations and assigned certain ministers to focus on certain states, Canadian officials said. Navdeep Bains, the Canadian minister of innovation, who is responsible for the auto sector, was dispatched to Michigan. Transport minister Marc Garneau, the first Canadian in space, was sent to Florida, the home of NASA and Senator Bill Nelson, who has also served as an astronaut.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also joined the outreach, meeting with the governor of Texas in March and the governor of Iowa in July, and visiting the House Ways and Means committee in October.Mr. Sarukhan greeted the surge in visits of lawmakers and governors to the White House as potentially good news for the survival of the pact, but said that, in his view, the risk of the United States withdrawing remained high.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the proverbial too little too late, or it really has an impact on this administration,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we still have to wait and see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Iran-Saudi Arabia Rivalry Has a Silver Lining", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe escalating rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia has alarmed foreign policy experts who believe that it could further destabilize the region. But feminists have reason to rejoice. In the competition between the two regimes to earn the mantle of the more moderate Islamic alternative, women have been the beneficiaries.When Saudi women earned the right to vote, drive or run for office, Iranian women did not pay much attention. Women in Iran had always enjoyed those rights, and their Saudi counterparts were simply catching up. But when Saudi Arabia lifted the ban on women\u2019s presence in sports stadiums, Iranian women got angry at their own government. The timing of the Saudi announcement in late September was perfect \u2014 if inflaming Iran\u2019s civil society was the goal. Only a few weeks earlier, Iranian women were barred from attending the qualifying World Cup match in Tehran between Iran and Syria, while Syrian women were permitted to enter the stadium.\u201cWhen I see reforms in Saudi Arabia, I am doubly elated: happy for Saudi society and women especially,\u201d said Mariam Memarsadeghi, a co-founder of Tavaana, a website dedicated to civic education in Iran, \u201cbut also thrilled that the Iranian regime\u2019s false moral superiority is punctured, that the Iranian regime\u2019s laws and actions against women\u2019s rights are made to look backward even by a country long seen as the region\u2019s most backward.\u201dIranian activists have always looked to the West to pressure Tehran to respect human rights. But the appearance of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the scene could shift the attention to Saudi Arabia. Whatever his long-term intentions, he is robbing Tehran of narratives it has long relied on. Citing the Saudis\u2019 poor record in engaging and educating women, Iran has easily deflected Western criticism of its own practices.Which nation had the most oil, the richer elite, the greater influence or the mightier military may have occupied the headlines, but not the minds of ordinary citizens. The routines that make everyday life easier \u2014 driving, working, traveling \u2014 were what concerned people. No amount of oil reserves can make up for the limitations on women\u2019s movement and activities.Adjusting to this reality has been more difficult for Iranian women, who had experienced a feminist renaissance under the Pahlavi dynasty.In 1936, Reza Shah, an autocrat whose vision for Iran bore some resemblance to Prince Mohammed\u2019s Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, banned the hijab. Watching the women in his family go out without their heads covered, his relatives recounted in memoirs, had been painful for the shah, but he believed it an essential step toward modernity.By the time the Islamic revolution of 1979 swept through Iran, women had the experience of four decades of relative freedom. After the revolution, returning to a life without the right to divorce, to have custody of their children or legal protection to equal inheritance was hard on Iranian women. (Saudi women never had those rights.)One way to view the Middle East quagmire is that it is less a byproduct of mismanaged economies or radical religious views than a problem engendered by entrenched misogyny. The differences that distinguish Iran from Saudi Arabia, including the Shiite-Sunni divide, vanish in light of what they have in common: Their women live under abject conditions. When it comes to economic participation, health, political empowerment and access to education, both Iran and Saudi Arabia are among the 10 countries at the bottom of the World Economic Forum measures.Westerners often point to Iran\u2019s lax rules on the hijab to make the case that it is more tolerant. The truth is that after 40 years of resistance, the regime is simply tired. And with a population that grew to over 80 million from 40 million in that time, and an overstretched military, it has also lost some measure of control.Now a Saudi prince is following in the footsteps of the shah. This similarity is not lost on the Iranian leadership, which argues that Prince Mohammed will be likewise doomed because of modernist ambitions that go against his people\u2019s traditions. But Iranian feminists are seeing their country\u2019s rival do more for women\u2019s advancement than all of Iran\u2019s female-friendly laws have in the years since the 1979 revolution.Signs of \u201cSaudi envy\u201d are beginning to appear. An Iranian feminist and founder of a campaign against the mandatory hijab, Masih Alinejad, distributed posts by joyous Iranian women drawing inspiration from their Saudi counterparts, illicitly slipping the scarves off their heads, walking the streets of Tehran and recording video messages. To allay some of the anger, Tehran made this compromise recently: Female weight lifters will be allowed to compete internationally, a first for Iran.While the Saudi-Iranian hostility causes the world to worry, women have benefited. A timeless lesson proves true once again: Though governments may be enemies, sisterhood is global.Roya Hakakian is the author of \u201cAssassins of the Turquoise Palace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great American Tax Heist", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith their tax bill, Donald Trump and the Republicans are raiding the Treasury in plain sight, throwing crumbs to the masses as the millionaires and billionaires make off with the cake.America should be aghast not only at the looting but also at the brazenness of its execution.It seems that for as long as I can remember, Republicans have been wringing their hands about deficits. And yet in this budget, they willingly, willfully exploded the deficit, not for public uplift or rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure but rather on the spurious argument that giving truckloads of money back to businesses will spark their benevolence.But be sure, when this bill leads to these predicted deficits, Republicans will return to their sidelined deficit rhetoric armed with a sickle, aiming the blade at the social safety net, exacerbating the egregious imbalance of the tax bill\u2019s original sins.That\u2019s the strategy: Appease the rich on the front end; punish the poor on the back. Feed the weak to the strong.Make no mistake: No matter how folks try to rationalize this bill, it has nothing to do with a desire to help the middle class or the poor. This is a cash offering to the gods of the Republican donor class. This is a bill meant to benefit Republicans\u2019 benefactors. This is a quid pro quo and the paying of a ransom.Trump promised to drain the swamp. That was another lie among many. He and the Republicans are in fact feeding us to the gators.\u201cThis is not good for me. Me, it\u2019s not so \u2014 I have some very wealthy friends. Not so happy with me, but that\u2019s O.K. You know, I keep hearing Schumer: \u2018This is for the wealthy.\u2019 Well, if it is, my friends don\u2019t know about it.\u201dThat, too, was a lie.That was before the bill was passed and reconciled, when the deal got even sweeter for Trump.\u201cThe reconciled tax bill includes a new 20 percent deduction for so-called pass-through entities, business structures such as L.L.C.s, L.P.s and S corporations that don\u2019t pay corporate taxes, but instead \u2018pass through\u2019 income to partners who pay individual tax rates on that money. The Senate version of the bill included safeguards that would only allow businesses to take advantage of the new break if they paid out significant wages to employees. But the new provision, which wasn\u2019t included in either version of the bill passed by the House and Senate, and was only added during the reconciliation process, gives owners of income-producing real estate holdings a way around that safeguard, effectively creating a new tax break for large landlords and real estate moguls.\u201dAmerica must make an honest appraisal: Donald Trump is a plutocrat masquerading as a populist. He is a pirate on a mission to plunder.Trump is milking the American presidency for personal gain. If he can give the impression of compassion on his mission to cash out, all the better for him, but the general good, the health of the nation and the plight of the plebeians is not now nor has it ever been his focus.His ego is too big for egalitarianism, and his heart too small for it.So he sticks closely to what he knows, the brand of Trump: promoting it, positioning it, defending it and enriching it.Republicans in Congress rushed the bill through for other reasons: to combat the fact of their own legislative incompetence, to satisfy their donors and to honor their long-held belief that the rich are America\u2019s true governing force.The middle class and the poor were never at the heart of this heartless bill. They are simply a veneer behind which a crime is occurring: the great American tax heist.Advertisement"}

Just listen for the low whine of tiny propellers.And look up.At the World Fly-In Expo, an air show held in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month, jets, hot air balloons, autogiros and ultralight planes were upstaged by Chinese-made drones.Remote-controlled flying machines drew crowds at exhibition booths and performed in tight formation, high above the ground. Teams in brightly colored jackets raced industrial drones and competed in events like delivering parcels and spraying plumes of mock pesticide.Special drones even helped clear the skies of birds before performances by manned aircraft, using loud blasts of noise.China\u2019s drone economy is not just about selfies and aerial video, however.Drones in China inspect power lines, survey fires and disaster zones, spray crops, and monitor air pollution around factories. In some remote areas, they have delivered packages. Online retailers and logistics companies are aiming to expand drone deliveries by signing more agreements with local governments.But as D.J.I. courts more industrial customers such as utilities and developers, the company\u2019s drones \u2014 and the vast quantities of footage taken by their cameras \u2014 have come under scrutiny.D.J.I. \u2014 formally named Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Company \u2014 denied the allegations, saying the memo was \u201cbased on clearly false and misleading claims.\u201dSuch concerns have scarcely dampened the public\u2019s enthusiasm for drones in China.In Wuhan, the Ewatt Aerospace Flight Academy is expanding.

{"Headline": "Builders Said Their Homes Were Out of a Flood Zone. Then Harvey Came.", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE WOODLANDS, Tex. \u2014 Leslie Martinez heard the floodwaters before she saw them. They rushed across the lawn, seeped around the doors and into the house. It was 2:15 a.m. on Aug. 28, three days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. Her young daughter was asleep in her arms. Ms. Martinez\u2019s first reaction was to spread towels around the floor.After all, Ms. Martinez recalled, the home builder had assured her that \u201cflooding was not even a possibility\u201d when she and her husband purchased the house in this suburban enclave north of Houston in 2011. They would never have bought here otherwise. Flood insurance, of course, was neither required nor needed.Now, with the rains outside lashing and the water inside rising, the family and their terrified pet, a one-eyed goldendoodle named Coco, took refuge on the second floor. Later that day, rescue boats came and ferried them to safety.The flooding forced Ms. Martinez and her husband, John Ahearn, to borrow money from their parents and accept a donation from their daughter\u2019s school. It left them feeling furious and betrayed. \u201cI\u2019m scared that it\u2019s going to continue happening,\u201d Ms. Martinez said, even as she wondered how they had become the victims of something they had been told had a vanishingly small chance of coming to pass in such a short time since the purchase.What they did not know was that their home, and those of many of their flooded-out neighbors in this new section of The Woodlands, had been built on land that not long ago lay squarely, and sometimes soggily, in a flood plain.A New York Times examination found that in the years leading up to Hurricane Harvey, with a surging local economy fueling demand for new upscale housing, the developers of The Woodlands had used a wrinkle in the federal flood-mapping system \u2014 along with many dump trucks\u2019 worth of dirt \u2014 to lift dozens of lots out of the area officially deemed prone to flooding. What they had done, in effect, was create gerrymandered maps of risk.In Ms. Martinez\u2019s case, documents show, the land was raised less than 10 inches above the level that, under federal flood-insurance rules, would have required the family to be notified of their risk and purchase insurance. Other lots in their area were raised as little as 1.2 inches above that height.No one has suggested that the developers broke any laws, and the company that owns The Woodlands says it followed all applicable regulations and standards. But the experiences of the family of Ms. Martinez and their neighbors show that even when the mapping rules are followed to the letter, the results can be disastrous.Across the country, documents show, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the insurance program, has granted more than 150,000 map changes in the last five years. In some cases, lots were raised, and in others, levees, drainage systems, water-detention ponds and other methods changed the calculated flood risk for a swath of land.Many of these changes were unquestionably appropriate. But in the Houston area, a Times analysis of FEMA documents shows, at least 6,000 properties in redesignated zones were damaged during the flooding caused by Harvey.What happened in The Woodlands underscored one of the great lessons of Harvey\u2019s assault on Houston: the profound vulnerability of a metropolis with an ethos of untrammeled development built, essentially, on a swamp.Don Hickey, a 37-year resident of The Woodlands who was an early employee of Mr. Mitchell, said people paid more to live here in part because they felt they would be safe. Mr. Hickey, who works in real estate finance and is collaborating with fellow homeowners to get their flooding problems fixed, summarized the situation in caustic terms, saying, \u201cThe developer had an economic benefit to more aggressively develop land around the flood plain or spend less money on flood control.\u201dThe company says there has been no slippage of quality through the transition of ownership.\u201cSince development began at The Woodlands more than four decades ago, it has strived to be a model master-planned community. While ownership has changed, what has never changed \u2014 nor will ever change \u2014 is our strict adherence to standards and our commitment to our communities,\u201d said Grant Herlitz, president of the Howard Hughes Corporation.Hurricane Harvey, the company argues, was an exceptional flooding event, and all map revisions followed federal and local guidelines. \u201cTo the extent that standards are re-evaluated, we will do as we have always done and act in accordance with any new regulations,\u201d Mr. Herlitz said.The risk is defined by law, not nature: FEMA and the flood insurance program look to what is known as 100-year flood elevation to determine who needs to buy insurance. Anything lower than that is considered to be in the flood plain. Above that level, supposedly, is safety.To Mr. Blackburn, the 100-year line is too arbitrary for comfort. What\u2019s more, the flood maps have long been considered highly inaccurate.This led to a lot of unhappiness among homeowners forced to pay perhaps $5,000 annually for insurance that would cost less than a tenth of that outside the official flood plain.\u201cPeople started to come in and argue and said, \u2018You showed me in a flood plain and I\u2019m 40 feet above that level.\u2019 Because FEMA\u2019s topography was so inaccurate,\u201d said Larry A. Larson, director emeritus of the Association of State Floodplain Managers in Madison, Wis.By the 1980s, he said, the agency, too overwhelmed and underfinanced to make all the corrections itself, instituted new procedures for accepting revised elevation data from engineers hired by aggrieved citizens.Developers have taken advantage of the new system as well, FEMA documents show, with a range of techniques from hiring surveyors to correct elevations to building structures like levees and drainage channels. In one of the most common methods, developers truck in tons of soil \u2014 known as \u201cfill\u201d in the building trade \u2014 and dump it over wide areas to raise the elevation above the flood plain. Mr. Larson called changes that lifted the ground only slightly above the flood plain \u201ca bad idea\u201d because such areas generally remain prone to flooding.\u201cOnce a flood plain, always a flood plain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still got risk.\u201dHis observation was borne out in striking fashion in the neighborhoods covered by the two map revisions examined by The Times: Eighty of the 81 homes within those areas near Spring Creek \u2014 which flows through The Woodlands \u2014 sustained some degree of flooding, according to FEMA statistics.Harris County, home to large parts of suburban Houston, including the newer sections of The Woodlands, is one of a handful of districts around the nation that FEMA has granted a sort of shared authority in approving map revisions. Although the conditions of this authority are complex, and vary from district to district, others have used it to enforce standards that are more stringent \u2014 for example, generally requiring higher elevations for any change and pushing developments further from creeks than FEMA does.For its part, Harris County has stuck with FEMA\u2019s elevation standards. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to touch the FEMA process; we want to keep it intact,\u201d said Ataul Hannan, planning division director for the Harris County Flood Control District.What the county has done is put a great deal of effort, and expense, into creating special software model for more accurately calculating flooding risks and the wider effects of development in the relatively flat terrain of the Houston area, Mr. Hannan said. Comparing Harris County\u2019s regulations to those in other parts of the country is unfair, he added, because the topographies are so different.\u201cThe shrinkage of the flood maps,\u201d she said, \u201cis always treated in a very positive way.\u201dAs early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing \u201cwooded areas and a few rural home sites,\u201d according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market.That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve.\u201cThis would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,\u201d Mr. Gilmer said.FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek \u2014 including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t flooded.\u201dBy bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show.The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place \u2014 Ms. Martinez\u2019s street \u2014 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place \u2014 Mr. Hickey\u2019s street \u2014 and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas.The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Sea\u00f1ez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, \u201cThey said, \u2018You don\u2019t even have to purchase it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sea\u00f1ez recalled.Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey\u2019s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. \u201cWe see that the flood plain was revised recently,\u201d the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck.Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent \u2014 a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent.In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Sea\u00f1ez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected \u2014 a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns.\u201cThey\u2019ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody\u2019s business,\u201d he said. \u201cOur name for it is not The Woodlands, it\u2019s Concrete Land.\u201dThe company stated that \u201cthe senior development team is \u2018essentially the same team\u2019 that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.\u201dTim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm\u2019s waters. \u201cWe met the standard,\u201d he said. \u201cThis event exceeded the standard.\u201dStill, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey \u2014 and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.Steve English, 71, said the value of his house has dropped to $400,000 from $800,000 after the two floods. Hurricane Harvey brought 30 inches of water into his home.\u201cDo we all have to get to where our house is down to $50 and we have to walk out of here naked before you do anything?\u201d he said.Any fixes could take years, and are quite likely to require coordinating efforts among communities and the state of Texas. Until then, homeowners stew, fret and wait for the next big storm. Raul Giorgi, a real estate agent in The Woodlands for 35 years, owns a home near the Soeders that also was damaged.He made the same decision to buy there that his customers make \u2014 and, like his clients, his ability to dig through years of regulatory decisions and paperwork is limited. They look to real estate agents like him, he said, for information about risks, and he looks to the developers. \u201cWho am I? I\u2019m not an engineer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can do is trust the experts.\u201dNow, he says, \u201cI personally believe, in hindsight, this should not have been developed.\u201dJohn Schwartz and James Glanz reported from The Woodlands, and Andrew W.

{"Headline": "Tax Plan Aims to Slay a Reagan Target: The Government Beast", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneAnd yet to a Republican Party embroiled in a fundamental debate on how to shrink the government, it was an idea hard to resist: a direct shot at states\u2019 capacity to spend. Bruce Bartlett, then a conservative tax expert who would go on to serve under Reagan and his successor, George Bush, estimated that without federal deductibility, state and local spending would fall 14 percent.Reagan ultimately failed to kill the deduction. Mr. Bartlett, who often contributes to The New York Times, has come full circle to reject the Republican project to shrink the government at all costs. Still, his words from over 30 years ago provide an apt description of what drives Republican thinking in Congress today.High earners in Democratic counties are the most likely to receive a tax increase as a result of the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.But there is more strategic vision than is immediately evident. The plan to starve the beast of government by depriving it of money, it seems, is back in the saddle. This time around it might succeed where Reagan failed: Barring taxpayers from deducting state and local income taxes and limiting the property taxes they can deduct on their federal returns, the Republican bills could, for the first time, force high-tax states run by Democrats to capitulate.Excluding payroll taxes \u2014 which pay for Social Security and Medicare \u2014 federal tax revenues declined to 11.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 12.1 percent in 1980, when Reagan was elected, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a policy group of industrialized nations. That is a difference worth some $170 billion a year, in today\u2019s money.This bucks the trend among the rest of the countries in the group, with central government revenue increasing by about two percentage points of G.D.P., on average. But it also rows against the current of states and municipalities in the United States. From 1980 to 2016, state and local revenues increased to 8.5 percent of G.D.P., from 7.8 percent, the O.E.C.D. says \u2014 a rise worth $130 billion a year.That alone will call on states to fill the gap. \u201cA lot of responsibility for social programs is going to shift to the states,\u201d said Kim S. Rueben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. This doesn\u2019t apply only to, say, New York or California \u2014 states with higher taxes funding more generous social programs. It applies to Mississippi, a poor, low-tax state that provides very little in social insurance and relies heavily on the federal government to provide a safety net.\u201cThis is one of the more strategic efforts in the starve-the-beast mode,\u201d said Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cNobody can be a blue state anymore. They are going after the flexibility of states to do things.\u201dIndeed, Republicans\u2019 new tax proposals seem to be taking the country a few decades back.Think about unemployment insurance. It didn\u2019t exist until 1935, when the Great Depression inspired Congress to write it into law, funded by a levy on businesses and granting states great leeway in carrying out the program. But states had been talking about it for two decades, and seven had already passed unemployment insurance provisions when Congress got involved. \u201cThis is the best example of the laboratory of democracy,\u201d said Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard.This is not to say that the state and local tax deduction is the ideal mechanism to bolster the finances of state and local governments. It is loaded heavily to benefit the rich, who pay the highest federal tax rates and are the most likely to itemize their deductions.It is unclear, moreover, to what extent the provisions in the Republican bills will, in fact, hinder state finances. Eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes raises their \u201cprice\u201d for taxpayers: Those paying a top federal rate of 35 percent get 35 percent off their state and local contributions. But the Republican bills \u2014 which still have to be mushed together into one piece of legislation \u2014 do other things, too.They expand the standard deduction, so fewer people will itemize their deductions in the first place. They also pare back the alternative minimum tax, which prevented some taxpayers from benefiting from the state and local deduction. Both these provisions could mute the effect of the changes in deductibility.\u201cThis will mitigate the effect in some ways,\u201d Ms. Rueben said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t eliminate it.\u201dToday, it seems inevitable that the federal government will shrink into an earlier version of itself. As Professor Goldin noted, it looks a bit the way it did in the early years of the 20th century, when the government had little money to pay for social policy.\u201cStates were the only place where social policy could be conceived of,\u201d she told me.Republican efforts to starve the beast imagine state governments falling in line with federal austerity. But as wages stagnate, inequality widens, and new social challenges like opioid addiction arise, that seems at odds with what the moment calls for.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren and Sanders: Who Is Congress Really Serving?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWASHINGTON \u2014 Over the past year, Republicans have made their priorities clear. Their effort to repeal Obamacare would have left tens of millions of people without health insurance. Now Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, wants to ram through an enormous tax giveaway to the wealthy before seating Doug Jones, Alabama\u2019s newly elected Democratic senator.The Republican agenda on health care and taxes may be popular with wealthy campaign donors, but it is widely disliked by the American people. It\u2019s no wonder why. Despite a booming stock market and record corporate profits, workers in this country are being squeezed by flat wages, soaring household expenses and declining savings. They want Washington to start working for them and to spend tax dollars investing in our future \u2014 not bankrupting it.With a government funding deadline looming on Friday, congressional Republicans face a choice. Will they spend this week just trying to deliver partisan tax breaks for the rich? Or will they work with Democrats to pass a budget that supports working people?Right now Congress\u2019s to-do list is long. Before we even get to the budget, we must take care of several urgent, overdue responsibilities that Republicans have ignored. We must fulfill our promise to 800,000 Dreamers \u2014 aspiring young Americans who will lose their legal immigration status if we don\u2019t act. We also need to renew expired funding for community health centers and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program so that tens of millions of families and nine million children don\u2019t lose access to affordable health care.These are basic responsibilities and they cannot wait. But our vision is bigger. We must look beyond the bare minimum, to stop lurching from crisis to crisis trying desperately to keep the lights on. This is the moment to focus on our core values and to carefully choose what we will invest in.At a time when the American economy is rigged in favor of the rich and giant corporations, the coming federal funding bill is a chance to show that our country still respects hard work. We recognize that we cannot do everything we\u2019d like to do before the end of the year, but there is room in the budget to take real, immediate steps in this direction \u2014 by easing household costs for working parents and students, by protecting workers\u2019 pensions and Social Security, and by improving access to health care for veterans and for people who need mental health services.Over the past generation, the costs of child care have jumped nearly 1,000 percent. That puts a lot of financial pressure on working parents, and it forces many to make difficult compromises on the quality of care they can afford. If Congress doubles federal support for child care in this year\u2019s spending bill, we could guarantee high-quality care for nearly a quarter of a million more children.Student loan debt is another major burden for many people, including those in lower-paying public service jobs, like teachers, nurses, firefighters, police officers, social workers and military personnel. Ten years ago, Congress created a program to help wipe out student loan debt for these public servants, hoping it would encourage more people to give back to their communities. But because of failures in student loan servicing and a lot of bureaucratic nonsense, many might not get the forgiveness they\u2019ve earned. Congress can easily fix this in the funding bill and help tens of thousands of people.To strengthen Americans\u2019 economic security, it\u2019s not enough to reduce basic expenses. We must also protect retirement \u2014 and that means pensions and Social Security. It was Wall Street greed that made our economy crash in 2008, not America\u2019s truckers, warehouse workers, retirees and widows. But as a consequence of that crash, the pension funds of many workers are now on the brink of failure. Congress can use this funding bill to shore up these retirement plans and make sure nearly 1.5 million American workers aren\u2019t left holding the bag for Wall Street\u2019s mistakes.For millions of others, Social Security is a lifeline in retirement. But many older people and Americans with disabilities are now struggling to get their benefits because budget cuts have forced the agency running Social Security to cut thousands of jobs and close 64 field offices since 2010. Congress should restore funding to the agency and help fill the gaps in service so that people can get the benefits they have earned.This year\u2019s debate over Obamacare was a powerful reminder about the enormous economic burden posed by health care in America. We must keep working to protect the availability of critical, affordable health care for families. This is a huge task, but there are a couple of specific, obvious ways we can make a difference right now in the federal budget.Mental health care is one. Half of all Americans will experience addiction or a mental health problem in their lifetime. These problems can devastate families emotionally and financially, especially without treatment. The federal government has several programs that support mental health services, but we\u2019re just not doing enough to ensure people get the care they need.More mental health care is also critical to fighting the opioid epidemic, which is raging across the country without regard to politics \u2014 devastating workers and families in our home states of Massachusetts and Vermont, but also in Senator McConnell\u2019s Kentucky. If Congress doubled its funding for key mental health priorities, an extra billion dollars would go to programs that now help support treatment for more than seven million people.We can also protect and improve health care for America\u2019s veterans. Our service members risked their lives to defend us all \u2014 and there is no excuse for nickel-and-diming their health and long-term care. Congress should protect the ability of the Veterans Affairs department to employ thousands of doctors and nurses and to build and maintain extended-care centers for our veterans.The task in front of Congress over the coming week boils down to a basic question: Does Washington work for all of us or just for those at the top? Congress has a chance, right now, to take steps that will make life a bit better for millions of working people immediately and in the years to come. We should seize it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Smiling While Exercising Improve Performance?", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWell Many athletes have been told that smiling while sweating will make our efforts feel easier. In May, Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan marathon runner, periodically grinned through the final miles of his fastest-ever marathon, which he completed in 2 hours 25 seconds; afterward, he said that he had hoped that the smiling would ease him to the finish line. But there has been little solid scientific evidence to support this idea. Several past studies have examined whether deliberately smiling can alter how people feel psychologically during races, but few have looked at the physiological impact on sports performance.First, the researchers tested the volunteers\u2019 usual running economy by having them don a facial mask to measure their respiration and then run on a treadmill until they were exhausted. As they ran, the scientists asked them to rate how they felt and describe what strategies they were using to keep going, such as ignoring their bodies\u2019 discomfort or tuning in to it.Then, on a separate lab visit, each volunteer completed a series of four six-minute runs, during which they were assigned four approaches: to smile continuously but sincerely, to frown, to relax their upper body by imagining they gently held a potato chip between loose fingers or, as a control, to use their normal get-me-through-this-run mental techniques.There were variations in the results. A few runners were most economical when they frowned; the researchers speculate that their grimaces, like ferocious \u201cgame faces,\u201d increased their determination to outdo their normal performance. But the runners turned out to be most economical when they smiled. As a group, their economy then was as much as 2.78 percent more efficient than during the other runs, a meaningful difference in competitions. Smiling probably aided economy by prompting a \u201creduction in muscular tension,\u201d says Noel Brick, a lecturer in sport and exercise psychology at Ulster University, who led the study.Many of the runners found it difficult to smile throughout the six-minute session, though: Their grins became increasingly fixed and unnatural. Such false smiles activate fewer facial muscles than the sincere version, Brick said, and most likely result in less relaxation and performance enhancements. So the key to using a happy smile to make you a better runner, he says, may be to grin sincerely and often near a race\u2019s end, but in 30-second bursts, rather than continuously. \u201cThis is what Eliud Kipchoge seems to do,\u201d Brick said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Climate Change Becomes a Credit Problem", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorClimate change is now a credit issue for city and state governments vulnerable to extreme weather events and natural disasters made worse by global warming. And that will make a complicated problem a lot easier for people to understand, because it could hit them where they feel it: in their wallets.That could mean higher taxes for the people who live in those communities. Even for governments that act to reduce their exposure to climate risks, the costs of doing so \u201ccould also become an ongoing credit challenge,\u201d Michael Wertz, a Moody\u2019s vice president, said.And there are many communities in harm\u2019s way: Just in terms of coastal flooding, for instance, Moody\u2019s reports that 43 percent of coastal homes in Georgia lie in floodplains vulnerable to inundation; in Florida and Mississippi, the number is 38 percent; in Louisiana, 34 percent and in Texas, 26 percent.In short, Moody\u2019s is making it clear that there is a potential climate risk bubble in which an extreme weather event causes damages so catastrophic that taxpayers, insurers, lenders, states and municipalities suffer damages or losses of hundreds of billions of dollars and local and state government face downgrades in their credit worthiness, affecting their ability to borrow money.Smaller credit-rating and bond investor firms are already taking climate risks into account. But the Big Three rating agencies (the other two are Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings) have been slow to take climate risks seriously.Moody\u2019s is trying to get ahead of the curve. The company and the other major credit-rating firms badly missed the subprime housing bubble that helped push the economy into recession and were widely criticized for it.Moody\u2019s warnings go beyond the risks of coastal storm damage, more frequent and severe droughts, wildfires and heat waves.The company put it this way: \u201cIn addition to loss of life and threats to public health and safety, these events present a multitude of challenges in the form of compromised crop yields, economic disruption, damage to physical infrastructure, increased energy demand, recovery and restoration costs, and the cost of adaptive strategies for prevention or impact mitigation. These challenges can result in lower revenue, increased expense, impaired assets, higher liabilities and increased debt, among other effects.\u201dAs one of the Big Three credit rating agencies, Moody\u2019s credit advice to individual and institutional investors carries enormous weight in the lending and capital markets.If the other major ratings agencies follow, the pressure will be on municipal and state governments around the country to address the underlying climate risks they face or confront the very real possibility that the costs of borrowing money will suddenly become a lot more expensive.And that\u2019s not something taxpayers will like.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Promised to Kill Carried Interest. Lobbyists Kept it Alive.", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s signature on the Republican tax bill marks his most important legislative achievement to date. It also represents the breaking of a signature promise that helped propel his populist presidential campaign.This week, as senior White House officials acclaimed passage of the tax overhaul in Congress, they also expressed one regret: failing to close the so-called carried interest \u201cloophole\u201d that benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity executives. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to eliminate a tax rule that allows some rich business leaders to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries, the president in this case was no match for the powerful lobbyists protecting the status quo.\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the conservative economist who crafted Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign tax plan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that thing survived,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI\u2019m sure the lobbying was intense.\u201dCarried interest is the percentage of an investment\u2019s gains that a private equity partner or hedge fund manager takes as compensation. At most private equity firms and hedge funds, the share of profits paid to managers is about 20 percent. Under existing law, that money is taxed at a capital-gains rate of 20 percent, which is about half of the top individual income rate, which is currently 39.6 percent and will fall to 37 percent under the final tax bill.Critics of the existing practice, which include both Democrats and Republicans and the billionaire Warren Buffett, argue that this money is effectively income and should be taxed as such at the ordinary individual income tax rate.Mr. Trump used to be one of those critics.\u201cThey make a fortune, they pay no tax,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to pay taxes.\u201dA year later, in a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Trump was more explicit about what he planned to do about it if elected.\u201cWe will eliminate the carried interest deduction, well known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors and for people like me but unfair to American workers,\u201d Mr. Trump said, incorrectly referring to the special treatment of carried interest as a tax deduction.So what happened?Gary D. Cohn, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said on Wednesday that the administration tried more than two dozen times to eliminate the carried interest loophole and that, as recently as this week, Mr. Trump asked why it was not gone.Mr. Cohn, a former top Goldman Sachs executive, said opposition from lobbyists and lawmakers on Capitol Hill was intense and that the best that could be done was to extend the \u201cholding period\u201d for investments that qualify for the tax break to three years from one.\u201cThe president strongly believes, and he ran on this, that carried interest is a loophole,\u201d Mr. Cohn said at an event sponsored by Axios. He said the president continues to believe that venture capitalists and hedge fund managers are getting a preferred rate of return on someone else\u2019s capital.While the president managed to get much of what he wanted in the tax bill, including a lower corporate rate and a lower top individual rate, Mr. Cohn suggested that Mr. Trump had met his match when it came to those carrying water for carried interest.\u201cThe reality of this town is that constituency has a very large presence in the House and the Senate, and they have really strong relationships on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said.Critics pounded on that explanation, saying that Mr. Trump could have done away with it had he publicly intervened. Unlike the other provisions Mr. Trump advocated, eliminating the carried interest loophole would have actually raised revenue for the Treasury.\u201cEnding this specific Wall Street giveaway was a defining economic promise that Donald Trump made to the American people, claiming that it set him apart from other Republicans,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Democratic political action committee American Bridge. \u201cThis is the latest proof that Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail was nothing but empty.\u201dLobbyists for private equity, venture capital and real estate groups, aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to carried interest, mobilized their forces early this year to prevent the carried interest tax break from being eliminated. In particular, they sought to ensure that tax preferences for long-term investment were not scrapped as part of an effort to punish hedge fund managers, who typically turn over investments more quickly.The groups appealed to lawmakers as engines of job creation, saying their industries were responsible for creating millions of jobs across the country. They pressured Republicans, particularly in the House, to fight to keep their taxes from going up. They also took their battle to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary and former hedge fund manager, who has publicly sympathized with their arguments.To the industries that enjoy the tax break and the lawmakers who do their bidding, the stakes were clearly high.During the last few months, lawmakers who were central to the process of rewriting the tax code would often dodge the question and say they did not know what was happening with carried interest when asked about it in the halls of the Capitol.Ultimately, it was largely left alone.\u201cThe private equity, venture capital and real estate industries won on carried interest because they stressed the critical role that long-term investment plays in the U.S. economy, and they pushed all the right levers along the way,\u201d said Ken Spain, a Washington-based consultant who has worked with the private equity industry on tax issues.While Mr. Sommers was generally pleased with the outcome of the tax bill, he said it was still disappointing that the term \u201ccarried interest\u201d is now being written in the tax code for the first time. This makes it more likely that future lawmakers will try to raise taxes on private equity funds. Also, while the three-year holding period will not affect many firms that hold onto assets longer, he said it could scuttle some deals that might have otherwise happened more quickly.Mr. Sommers said that there was tension both within the White House and among Republicans in Congress throughout the year on how carried interest would be handled. He said that Mr. Mnuchin was often the mediator who pushed to protect private equity.\u201cWhat came out of this is what I would call the Mnuchin compromise,\u201d Mr. Sommers said. \u201cHe wanted to make sure that we weren\u2019t discouraging the kind of investment that we provide. Secretary Mnuchin certainly would be an all-star on this in terms of our perspective.\u201dEven with all of the investment industry\u2019s lobbying muscle, Mr. Sommers said that the wild card was the person living in the White House, and that he could never be too sure how things would play out. Mr. Trump made a habit throughout the process of wading into the tax debate through Twitter, sending lawmakers scrambling.\u201cWe of course were concerned about an errant tweet from President Trump on this, or him doing something,\u201d Mr. Sommers said.In this case, the tweet never came.Advertisement"}

Proponents of the bill argue that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent will lead corporate America to invest more in their businesses and hire more workers.

{"Headline": "From Farm to Farm With the King of \u2018Bro-Country\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "FeatureLuke Bryan has been testing the sonic limits of country music for a decade. Just how much novelty can the genre take?Supported byIt was a Thursday night in October, and Bryan was midway through his ninth annual Farm Tour. More than 10,000 people had trekked from all over Indiana and the rest of the Midwest to see him perform on this geographically remote patch of earth. The tour, Bryan\u2019s lead guitarist and longtime friend, Michael Carter, told me, was an attempt to recreate the shows they played while in community college in southern Georgia, when they would enlist a friend with some land and \u201cset up on a flatbed trailer or on a porch or in a barn.\u201dThe scale of the operation has changed drastically in the intervening years. Bryan has been in the spotlight for a decade \u2014 a career that has included having three albums top the Billboard 200, singing the national anthem at this year\u2019s Super Bowl and co-starring in ABC\u2019s coming reboot of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d The Farm Tour now employs well over a hundred crew members (including cooks and a full-time massage therapist), who construct a high-capacity concert arena from scratch every morning and then break it down each night after Bryan\u2019s encore with a kind of supernatural efficiency, leaving the fields empty and clear as the circuslike convoy of more than 60 buses and tractor-trailers heads on to the next farming community. They go to sleep on their respective buses and wake up in a new town they\u2019ve often never heard of. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where I am right now,\u201d one roadie told me that day in Fort Wayne. \u201cWhat state or nothing. It\u2019s a blur.\u201dThe farms change, but Bryan\u2019s preshow ritual does not vary. Before taking the stage each night, he spends an hour riding a propped-up bicycle. Then he mixes himself a salty dog \u2014 grapefruit juice and vodka, with a generous pinch of salt. His stylist, Cheryl, presents him with the evening\u2019s outfit, almost always some variation on a solid-color V-neck, baseball cap and jeans. She rubs his arms with moisturizer until they glisten. Finally, he throws on his cowboy boots, which he secures tightly to his ankles with tape. He needs the extra protection when, in his words, he\u2019s \u201cin the heat of the battle up there.\u201dIf you haven\u2019t seen a mainstream country concert in recent years, you might not know what he means by this, but a Luke Bryan show is a deeply athletic affair. As his band begins its opening licks, he emerges from the darkness to raucous screams from the crowd. He jogs down the catwalk, grabbing hands and beaming. Onstage, he is more Freddie Mercury than George Strait \u2014 he leaps into the air and growls sensually and is known for his unique brand of hip-shaking, which seems both earnest and self-effacingly ridiculous. He lines up tequila shots on the lid of a piano and lobs cans of Miller Lite (a sponsor) out to the audience from a cooler wheeled out for this express purpose.Bryan\u2019s 2015 album, \u201cKill the Lights,\u201d was the first in history to have six singles reach No.1 on the Billboard Country Airplay charts, and his crowds know every word to all of them. He also makes a point to mine his earlier records for fan favorites like \u201cCountry Man\u201d (\u201cI can grow my own groceries and salt-cure a ham/Hey, baby, I\u2019m a country man\u201d) and the self-explanatory \u201cRain Is a Good Thing,\u201d both of which resonate powerfully with the farm-town audiences. Generally unburdened by a guitar, Bryan caps off every song he performs in a kind of triumphant superhero pose, pumping his fists or pointing up at the sky.For years now, Bryan and his generation of pop-country artists have been testing the sonic integrity of country music \u2014 a genre with a reputation for being highly inelastic \u2014 bending it to the larger demands of the marketplace by incorporating influences from the worlds of rap, R&B, EDM and arena rock. Bryan grew up listening to 2 Live Crew and Eazy-E alongside Ronnie Milsap and Reba McEntire, and his catalog bears their imprint. His new album, \u201cWhat Makes You Country,\u201d which will be released this week, acts as a statement of purpose from its opening track: \u201cYou do your kind of country,\u201d he sings. \u201cThey doing their kind of country/I do my kind of country.\u201dThe term most often used for the music made by artists like Bryan is \u201cbro-country,\u201d coined by the critic Jody Rosen in 2013. \u201cMusic by and of the tatted, gym-toned, party-hearty young American white dude,\u201d Rosen wrote, calling Bryan the \u201cking of the genre.\u201d Bryan has indeed made it clear that he\u2019s not interested in baring his soul, or in emulating earlier country aesthetics. His guiding principle is that his music should please as many people as possible \u2014 ideally stadiums full of them \u2014 and to that end, he\u2019s willing to use whatever tools (from whatever genres) he deems helpful. If that means making what is essentially a rap song about clubbing in a cornfield (\u201cKick the Dust Up\u201d) or an R&B sex jam with lyrics like \u201cFeel my belt turn loose from these old bluejeans\u201d (\u201cStrip It Down\u201d), then so be it.But like all great country catalogs, Bryan\u2019s music at its core evinces a careful balance of the hedonistic and the reverent \u2014 at ease in the space between the dive bar and the church, between spring break and the farm. It still came as a surprise, though, in Fort Wayne when he was able to bring the wild proceedings to a sudden halt to address the mass shooting in Las Vegas, which had occurred over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough week for me personally,\u201d he said to the crowd, wiping the sweat from his brow, \u201cand probably the worst week in the history of country music.\u201d The audience knew exactly what he meant, and the volume fell to a hush. Like a preacher at a tent revival, he asked us to put our arms around one another and bow our heads, to keep praying about the problems our country faced. \u201cLet\u2019s get to working on this, y\u2019all,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s try to learn from it and make a change.\u201dIn the moment of silence that followed \u2014 15 seconds that seemed much longer \u2014 it became suddenly apparent again that we were in the middle of the Indiana woods. Then the moment passed, and the crowd was chanting: \u201cU.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d Bryan gave a shout-out to police officers and firefighters, soldiers and schoolteachers. And just like that, his swagger was restored. \u201cLet\u2019s do some party crashing on a Thursday night,\u201d he shouted. The crowd roared its approval, and the band came back to life.I heard stories like this for years, as Bryan evolved from a local phenomenon \u2014 he grew up in Leesburg, just upriver from my hometown, Albany \u2014 to arguably the biggest star in Nashville. His songs are largely about trying to carve out a good time in dull, desolate places; the images you get from his lyrics are of vast, rural stretches of eerie nothingness. It\u2019s a landscape I recognize from our corner of Georgia \u2014 the pecan trees and cotton fields punctuated by boiled-peanut stands, the occasional collection of cows and every conceivable variety of grain elevator.Bryan is an enthusiastic ambassador for the area, and in his capricious approach to country, he is channeling the diverse mix of sounds that kids in his town, and others like it, were listening to. In many respects, country and hip-hop are sister genres, the pop styles that most reliably make room for God and work, black-market economies and regional pride. In the media, and particularly in the South, they have often found themselves pitted against each other, an opposition born of the culture wars and of the region\u2019s catastrophic racial history. But my own experience was that most teenagers who listened to country (or jam bands or nu-metal) were just as likely to be familiar with the songs in regular rotation on rap radio. Rap was ubiquitous \u2014 it was the soundtrack at football pep rallies and, as Bryan has pointed out, at the same dive bars that hosted artists like him. He has a visceral understanding of places like this, whether Leesburg, Ga., or Fort Wayne, Ind.So why, I asked Bryan the next afternoon aboard his tour bus, did he leave southern Georgia for the big city? I know why I left, I said \u2014 I never especially liked it there to begin with. What was his excuse?He hesitated. We were now in Springfield, Ill., and the ground outside was unmanageably muddy. Taking pity on my tennis shoes, he had lent me a pair of his boots. He seemed oblivious to the mud himself, stretching out his own grimy pair on the black leather couch lining the wood-paneled interior of the bus. He kept running a hand through his disheveled hair, where a backward ball cap should have been, as if he were feeling for a phantom limb. \u201cI\u2019m interesting in that, at any point, I could have taken the slightest deviation and never moved to Nashville,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think I would have still been smiling through every day. I would have been fine working at my dad\u2019s peanut mill.\u201dHis father ran not only a peanut mill but also a fertilizer-chemical company and, along with a partner, was responsible for 3,000 acres of farmland. His mother \u2014 who had joined him for the tour, posting up in a lawn chair outside his bus and chain-smoking Salems \u2014 worked for the county utilities department. The youngest of three siblings, Bryan sang in his church choir as a teenager and led a praise band on Wednesday nights. On Fridays, he would be down the street playing at bars, often to the same crowd. \u201cI would play a David Allan Coe song, and then I\u2019d do a gospel medley of \u2018I Saw the Light\u2019 and \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people would be like, \u2018Don\u2019t you feel weird playing those songs in a honky-tonk?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know. Would Jesus feel weird walking into a honky-tonk?\u2019\u2009\u201dBryan had long planned on moving to Nashville, but a year after graduating from Georgia Southern University with a business degree, he was still in his hometown, pulling peanut wagons for a living. \u201cMy dad felt like he needed to nudge me a little out of the nest,\u201d he said, and so the elder Bryan threatened to fire his son, who finally moved to Nashville in late 2001. After a few months of waiting on tables, he was put on contract by a publishing company to write tracks for other artists.In 2005, he met the songwriter Jeff Stevens, who had written hits for George Strait and Tim McGraw and immediately recognized Bryan\u2019s potential as a performer. He produced Bryan\u2019s 2007 debut, \u201cI\u2019ll Stay Me,\u201d which reached No.2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and scored a modest hit with \u201cAll My Friends Say,\u201d sung from the perspective of a man piecing together a drunken blackout \u2014 presaging the college-bro image that would come to define his sound. But otherwise, his first release was relatively traditional, with lots of fiddle and mandolin; Bryan now calls it \u201ccountry as cornbread\u201d and says it\u2019s slightly embarrassing for him to listen to.What you might not guess from his music is that Bryan\u2019s life has been marked by tragedy. His older brother, Chris, was killed in a car accident in 1996, and his older sister, Kelly, died of uncertain causes in 2007 while doing the laundry. (Her husband, Ben Lee Cheshire, died in 2014; Bryan and his wife, Caroline, took in their three children.) It occurred to me to wonder, given the contours of his life, why Bryan\u2019s music wasn\u2019t sadder, and so I asked him. \u201cI\u2019ve written some sad songs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 10 or 15 songs I\u2019ve got that will break you down, like gut-punch you.\u201d But these more personal songs, he said, have never felt right for his albums. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they \u2014 if they ever show up, they show up,\u201d he said. He has claimed that his 2013 hit \u201cDrink a Beer\u201d is a sort of tribute to his siblings. But Bryan didn\u2019t write the song himself, and there\u2019s something vaguely disheartening about his linking these very real calamities of life to such a trite premise: Faced with the loss of a loved one, a man shrugs it off and cracks open a cold one.Sitting in the front seat of Jeff Stevens\u2019s pickup truck one evening on the tour, I asked him what he thought of the criticism Bryan has taken over the course of his career: that he mostly sings about his truck and bluejeans and boots, that he\u2019s shallow or opportunistic. Stevens, who has worked with Bryan on all his albums, sat back and laughed. \u201cI love it,\u201d he said. Whenever he sees Bryan perform, he went on, \u201cI look over a sea of people who are forgetting everything. And that is the biggest gift that we can give to somebody \u2014 an hour and a half where they haven\u2019t thought about their job, they haven\u2019t thought about their troubles. They\u2019re just here for pure fun. I personally feel that purely fun music is cathartic. It\u2019s like being a goddamn doctor. And it\u2019s important. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s not important to have a message \u2014 a message is great. But people love to not think in today\u2019s world. They got enough to think about. When they go back to their cars, they\u2019ll start thinking again.\u201dCountry singers aren\u2019t often thought of as having the ability to change. They\u2019re supposed to be reactionary and creatively static, to play the role that was written for them decades ago. Their continued cultural relevance can baffle observers unfamiliar with the form. In the early 1990s, when Billboard started using Nielsen SoundScan to more accurately calculate music\u2019s commercial performance, one of the biggest surprises to industry insiders was the extraordinary popularity and reach of artists like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Tim McGraw. Disdain for country music is as old as the genre itself, and appropriately, mainstream critics have disliked Bryan from the beginning and have tended to treat him with some combination of amusement and animosity.But Bryan \u2014 with his references to Drake and T-Pain and to the size of his rims, his occasional tendency to break out into rapping onstage, the smooth R&B production of his ballads \u2014 has also become an avatar of a deep fissure within country music and the object of the undying enmity of traditionalists. The commercial dominance of Bryan and his peers \u2014 artists like Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Florida Georgia Line \u2014 has often led Nashville\u2019s more critically acclaimed Americana wing, which includes artists like Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, to distance themselves from identifying with country altogether. (Musgraves has said, \u201cMy favorite compliment ever is when someone says, \u2018I hate country music, but I love your music.\u2019\u2009\u201d)Bryan defends his own approach as a fundamentally generous and populist one. \u201cListen, at the end of the day,\u201d he told me, \u201cI write, record and sing about what I see my fans reacting to. If I roll into a concert and I tell everyone I have written the world\u2019s greatest song, and I walk out there and play it and nobody really gives a [expletive] about it, it ain\u2019t the world\u2019s greatest song anymore. That\u2019s how I go about it. I am not stubborn enough.\u201dI asked Bryan about Sturgill Simpson, who won this year\u2019s Grammy for best country album (Bryan has never been nominated) and has been an outspoken opponent of the Nashville establishment. Did it frustrate him that critics often focused their attentions on artists whose fans actively dislike most contemporary country? Bryan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to go have coffee with Sturgill,\u201d he said. \u201cI am utterly amazed at what he does.\u201d (I asked Simpson to comment for this article, and he responded quickly by email: \u201cI don\u2019t know Luke, I don\u2019t think about Luke, and I\u2019ve honestly never heard a single note of his music.\u201d)Simpson\u2019s retro purity and projection of artistic integrity may win him awards and make him palatable to country outsiders, but Bryan\u2019s omnivorous approach to country production is arguably more ambitious and musically progressive; it\u2019s certainly more in tune with the genre\u2019s younger listeners. Bryan\u2019s own epiphany in this respect arrived in his early years on the road, when he noticed D.J.s playing hip-hop immediately after his sets and noticed too that his fans were happy to hear it. That taught him, he told me, that \u201cit\u2019s not always all about the twangiest of the twang\u201d and that a hybrid like \u201cCountry Girl (Shake It for Me)\u201d could be accepted. Others picked up on this as well, from Florida Georgia Line to Sam Hunt \u2014 from the lowbrow, in other words, to the ostensibly cosmopolitan \u2014 and this kind of stylistic flexibility has become one of the dominant narratives of pop-country in recent years. These days, Bryan said with a laugh, \u201call my nieces and nephews are listening to Future.\u201d Kids no longer make the same hard-and-fast genre distinctions as their parents. So why should he? (Up to a point; he told me tries to keep his albums \u201c80 percent country.\u201d)But Bryan remains well aware of his responsibilities to his base; country has always been primarily a white, blue-collar music. Which is why the fascinating quandary of his career has been the question of how much he can tweak the country sound \u2014 how much sonic and thematic borrowing the genre can sustain \u2014 while still remaining identifiably country. Paradoxically, in a deep-historical sense, to do so is to be more faithful to country\u2019s roots than the nostalgists. \u201cFrom its inception,\u201d Nick Tosches wrote in \u201cCountry: The Biggest Music in America,\u201d his classic history of the genre, \u201ccountry and western was as mongrelized a style as any of earth,\u201d describing its origins as an amalgamation of blues and jazz, minstrel comedy, yodeling, Tin Pan Alley and Hawaiian slide guitar. Bryan, along with the artists who have emerged in his wake, are proof that this is still the case, that country is still mutable, still in flux. If you\u2019re wondering whether the results are cynical or forward-thinking, the answer is that they\u2019re both \u2014 they\u2019re also pretty fun. Bryan\u2019s form of genre fluidity doesn\u2019t, however, seem to be actually diversifying the country audience: His crowds, like the genre\u2019s fans over all, are overwhelmingly white.Bryan\u2019s relationship to the rural working class is at this point more imaginative than direct. What grounds him in the country ethos is largely a set of signifiers, those almost algorithmically predictable references to the trappings of heartland American life \u2014 to the right kinds of beer and trucks, to the primacy of, as one Bryan hit has it, \u201cHuntin\u2019, Fishin\u2019 and Lovin\u2019 Every Day.\u201d When I asked Stevens what kept Bryan tethered to country music rather than to the broader pop arena, his answer was comical in its minimalism. \u201cHave you heard him sing?\u201d he asked, with a confused expression. \u201cHe\u2019s a [expletive] hillbilly.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe feel like we can do anything, and as long as you put that hillbilly voice on top of it, it\u2019s going to sound country.\u201d As a barometer of country identity, Bryan\u2019s vision is a testament to its adaptability but also to its deep-rooted insularity. Say the right things in the right accent, and Stevens is right: Country can be anything.An earlier version of this article misspelled the middle name of a country music artist.

{"Headline": "Tax Cuts Buoy Republicans, but They\u2019re Swimming Against an Undertow", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The sweeping tax overhaul approved by Congress this week hands Republicans a long-sought achievement they believe will bolster their defenses in next year\u2019s midterm campaign, but party officials concede the measure may only mitigate their losses in what is shaping up to be a punishing election year.While the tax legislation is broadly unpopular as it reaches President Trump\u2019s desk, the bill offers Republicans the sort of signature accomplishment they have been lacking to galvanize their demoralized donors and many of their voters.Republican lawmakers, who spent much of this year forced to explain or defend Mr. Trump\u2019s erratic behavior, now have an opportunity to go on the offensive with an issue that unites their increasingly fractious party. And they hope that up-for-grabs voters will reward them should the economy keep growing while their tax bills are falling.\u201cOnce the withholding tables change in January, voters will realize their paychecks are bigger as a result of tax reform,\u201d said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, who runs the House Republican campaign arm. But, alluding to past midterm defeats for the party in power at the White House, he acknowledged that \u201chistory is against us.\u201dTo reinforce the party\u2019s message, the primary House Republican \u201csuper PAC,\u201d the Congressional Leadership Fund, is planning a $10 million advertising and grass-roots campaign beginning next month in some of their most competitive districts to highlight the rate reductions, higher standard deduction and child tax credits in the bill. Corporations such as AT&T and Wells Fargo delivered Republicans an immediate gift by announcing they would reward employees financially because of the tax cut.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said in an interview that Senate Republicans next year would batter the many Democrats who are on the ballot in states won by Mr. Trump, such places as North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana, for opposing the bill.Yet with voters indicating by wide margins they prefer Democrats to control Congress and bestowing Mr. Trump with historically low approval ratings, the tax plan is hardly a panacea for Republican lawmakers on the ballot in 2018. At best, it is the political equivalent of tacking up plywood against exterior windows to lessen the inevitable damage of an impending storm.Officials in both parties believe Democratic gains in the House, where Republicans enjoy a 24-seat majority, could reach as high as 40 seats if the political environment does not improve for the Republicans.And, as of now, it only appears to be worsening.A CNN poll released on Wednesday found that 56 percent of registered voters said they would vote Democratic next November, compared to 38 percent who favored the Republicans, a yawning 18-percentage-point gap that was only slightly bigger than other recent polls. Through that lens, impressions of the new tax law could be warped by partisan feelings.This advantage is showing up in fund-raising, where Democrats are harvesting small-dollar contributions. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced on Wednesday that it raised $6.9 million in November, outraising its Republican counterpart for the seventh month in a row. In November, the National Republican Congressional Committee raised only $3.8 million.House Republicans, however, still have more money on hand and the Republican National Committee has far more cash than the Democratic National Committee. In the Senate, the Democratic campaign arm has slightly more money in the bank than the Republicans.Beyond the raw numbers, Democratic enthusiasm is soaring. And the sort of centrist voters that both parties covet are contemptuous of Mr. Trump because of his behavior and character, elements that are highly unlikely to change by next fall no matter what policies emerge from Washington.\u201cThe downside of doing nothing was much higher,\u201d former Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who previously led the party\u2019s House campaign efforts, said of the tax bill. \u201cBut the major problem for Republicans is not that they haven\u2019t delivered \u2014 it\u2019s the way he conducts himself.\u201d\u201cRepublicans have a big storm coming at them,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bad wind storm or a Category Five hurricane.\u201dMr. Trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president this soon into his tenure, and midterm elections are inevitably referendums on the party that controls the White House. He is especially unpopular among women, who in this year\u2019s statewide and special elections have overwhelmingly supported Democrats. According to a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 62 percent of female voters disapproved of Mr. Trump.So Democrats, some of them still bearing wounds from President Barack Obama\u2019s midterm losses, believe the tax measure will ultimately be of little consequence compared to the man who occupies the Oval Office.\u201cYou can\u2019t run from the top of your ticket,\u201d said Representative Rick Larsen of Washington, who got a scare in the Affordable Care Act-fueled backlash of 2010. \u201cThat\u2019s been proven to me over and over again. And the driver won\u2019t be the tax cut vote. It\u2019ll be the unpopularity of the president.\u201dThere is also scant evidence large-scale tax bills offer much in the way of a political lift. Republicans suffered losses in 1982, a year after President Reagan\u2019s first tax bill, and in 1986, just a few months after Congress passed the last tax overhaul. The 2002 gains by Republicans were more the result of a rallying around the commander-in-chief in the months after the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, than the tax cuts that the party passed a year earlier.Mr. Obama\u2019s economic stimulus plan of 2009 included tax cuts that went straight into paychecks \u2014 and were hardly noticed ahead of the Republican Tea Party tidal wave in 2010.Complicating matters for Republicans, some of their House seats that are most in jeopardy are in high-income and high-tax states where many voters will feel little benefit from a bill that limits mortgage interest deductions and state and local tax write-offs. Eleven of the 12 House Republicans who opposed the bill hail from California, New York and New Jersey, most of them from affluent districts that are already uneasy with Mr. Trump.\u201cI think each individual congressman will be judged on how they voted,\u201d said Representative Dan Donovan, the only Republican who represents New York City, who opposed the measure because of the limitations on local tax deductions. \u201cThe voters will know how hard we fought.\u201d\u201cThe wave starts in those districts whether they voted for or against the tax bill,\u201d said former Democratic Representative Steve Israel of New York, calling this moment \u201cpolitical d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201dNotably, the House Republicans who opposed the bill also will not be the beneficiaries of the Super PAC\u2019s spending.\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on those who kept their promise to their constituents,\u201d said Corry Bliss, who runs the group.Veteran Republicans are sober about how daunting 2018 is shaping up to be, and hope that a clash on taxes at the very least offers the prospect of shifting the political debate onto more favorable terrain.\u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican and you think about what\u2019s coming, and the range of things you could be fighting about, to have a fight about this tax bill is among the better things they can fight over in 2018,\u201d said Bill McInturff, a G.O.P. pollster, conceding that Republicans are facing \u201cvery tough numbers.\u201dMr. McInturff, who recently conducted a survey showing Republicans trailing Democrats by 12 points on the so-called generic ballot, said his party could not change the minds of those with fixed views about Mr. Trump, but that the tax bill offered an argument for those willing to hear them out.\u201cYou better have something to say that the 60 percent is willing to listen to,\u201d he said, noting polls that show 40 percent of voters want to impeach Mr. Trump.Mr. Stivers acknowledged the partisan preferences of voters at the moment were tilting away from Republicans. \u201cRight now there are people that don\u2019t like the president, and they\u2019re expressing it in that way,\u201d he said of the generic ballot. But he suggested that voters uneasy with the president are still willing to support Republican congressional candidates, pointing to the Atlanta-area special House election the party won earlier this year despite a massive influx of money for the Democrats.And he said he had urged his members to make taxes central. \u201cEverybody needs to be talking about the tax bill, what it means for their communities,\u201d said Mr. Stivers.Democrats, though, said no piece of legislation could address the depth of the Republican challenge.\u201cIt is unfixable,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \u201cAnd by November, tax reform could be a nonissue because what\u2019s driving people to come out to vote is they don\u2019t like the way the country is being run and the comportment of the president.\u201dJim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Tax Bill That Inequality Created", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialMost Americans know that the Republican tax bill will widen economic inequality by lavishing breaks on corporations and the wealthy while taking benefits away from the poor and the middle class. What many may not realize is that growing inequality helped create the bill in the first place.As a smaller and smaller group of people cornered an ever-larger share of the nation\u2019s wealth, so too did they gain an ever-larger share of political power. They became, in effect, kingmakers; the tax bill is a natural consequence of their long effort to bend American politics to serve their interests.Most political campaigns now rely on a small group of wealthy donors who give tens of thousands of dollars or more per election cycle. About 40 percent of contributions to campaigns during the 2016 federal election came from an elite group of 24,949 donors, equivalent to 0.01 percent of the adult population. In 1980, the top 0.01 percent accounted for only 15 percent of all contributions, according to an analysis by Adam Bonica, a Stanford professor, and his collaborators.Of course, the growing importance of wealthy donors is not exclusively a Republican phenomenon. Democratic candidates have also benefited from the largess of wealthy donors like George Soros, Tom Steyer and James Simons. But on economic and tax issues, big-money liberal donors have not really shoved their party to the far left. Donations from Wall Street and corporate America have, in fact, pushed many Democrats to the center or even to the right on issues like financial regulation, international trade, antitrust policy and welfare reform.Further, liberal donors have been nowhere near as skillful at coordinating their giving as conservative donors have been. No liberal organization comes close to rivaling the network of donors and political activists created by the conservative Koch brothers, says Theda Skocpol, a professor at Harvard, who has written extensively about these issues. The Koch network has spent years methodically pushing state and federal lawmakers to cut regulations, taxes and government programs for the poor and the middle class. The leading donor network on the left, the Democracy Alliance, is smaller and much less successful.But the cuts have done little to bolster the economy or the working class. In fact, incomes have stagnated, and workers have been forced to part with a larger share of their pretax earnings in the form of payroll taxes.Inequality in America does not have to be self-perpetuating. When people turn up at the polls, as they did recently in Alabama, they can produce unexpected results. That\u2019s why Republican lawmakers might want to think again about whether they want to be the means through which their wealthy donors pull off this heist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma and the Theft of South Africa", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJOHANNESBURG \u2014 South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress will meet on Dec. 16 to elect a new party president. It will do so in the throes of a debilitating crisis. A decade of President Jacob Zuma\u2019s leadership has seen Africa\u2019s oldest liberation movement become a caricature of corruption and factionalism.At the center of the party\u2019s troubles is a business family, the Guptas. Led by three brothers \u2014 Ajay Gupta, Atul Gupta and Rajesh Gupta \u2014 the family moved to South Africa in 1993 from Saharanpur, a small, impoverished town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.President Zuma had more than 700 charges of fraud and corruption pending against him, but a top prosecutor withdrew the charges in 2009. Earlier this year, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that the decision not to charge him was irrational. In October, the Supreme Court of South Africa upheld the High Court decision.For the A.N.C., which has for decades presented itself as a unifying force for democratic change and development, the country\u2019s economic stagnation is an existential threat. The reasons for the country\u2019s economic decline are varied and complex. But policy complexity doesn\u2019t play well in politics.President Zuma has served his two terms as the president of the A.N.C., and his tenure as the president of South Africa ends in 2019. The next president of the A.N.C. will be the president of the country if the party wins the national elections. The front-runners in the race for the A.N.C. president are Cyril Ramaphosa, the former unionist turned businessman and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the former head of the African Union and President Zuma\u2019s ex-wife.Apart from personalities, the choice ultimately comes down to whether voting delegates believe that the country\u2019s direction under President Zuma represents the best future for South Africa.If they do not, there is at least a chance of a democratic opening in the A.N.C. Maybe then South Africans can begin to look for solutions to their daunting problems that are not based on crude nationalism and racial essentialism.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the relationship between the consulting firm McKinsey and a company linked to the Gupta family, Trillian. They cooperated on work for the South African utility Eskom; McKinsey did not pay Trillian.Ivor Chipkin is the executive director of the Public Affairs Research Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.Advertisement"}

Accordingly, over the years Nevada has set the gold standard when it comes to sports betting, gambling regulation and consumer protections.Those of us who have been involved in the industry know that a regulated market is better than an illegal one. Unfortunately, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act has spawned an estimated $150 billion annual illegal sports betting market that lacks consumer protections, is ripe for manipulation, fuels other illicit activities and jeopardizes the integrity of sports leagues.Allowing states and tribal sovereign governments to legalize sports betting could boost local economies, increase state revenues, and better protect both consumers and the industry, with Nevada showing the way.DINA TITUS, LAS VEGASTo the Editor:It is infuriating to me that most Americans can legally bet on the future price of soybeans or a company\u2019s future profits, but not a sporting event.CHRIS BENNETT, MINNEAPOLISThe writer formerly worked in a sportsbook in Las Vegas.To the Editor:Generally I believe that governments should not be in the business of protecting adult citizens from themselves. But there are exceptions, and gambling is one of them. Gambling destroys people, devastates families and has no redeeming qualities.So, no, don\u2019t legalize sports betting. In fact, it\u2019s high time we as a society banned all gambling, including casinos and state lotteries. It\u2019s time to end states\u2019 addiction to gambling revenue, which is nothing more than a tax on the poor.And it\u2019s high time we cracked down on online gambling. We can levy large fines against violators and use the money to fund enforcement, offset state revenue losses, and train laid-off casino employees for desperately needed and much more productive infrastructure work.LAWRENCE REICHARD, BELFAST, ME.To the Editor:It\u2019s hard to believe that this argument is still going on. When it\u2019s clear that people will do a certain thing \u2014 and this runs the gamut from betting through drugs and liquor \u2014 we need to stop criminalizing the behavior and find ways to make it fairer, safer and cleaner.One would think that Prohibition was the ultimate lesson in this regard. Wasn\u2019t anyone paying attention?Recognizing that a behavior is inevitable at some level is not the same as condoning it. Making people who do these things into criminals doesn\u2019t benefit anyone.

Anti-gambling laws are completely unenforced, and no one is scared to place \u201cillegal\u201d bets. I am not a gambler, but I remember as a child hearing my grandfather whispering in the phone as he made bets on horse racing.It\u2019s a far cry from that today, when people talk openly about gambling. There are more important things to worry about.STEVE SANDMAN, SOUTH BEND, IND.To the Editor:As with many other policy decisions in the United States, we are behind our European and Canadian counterparts when it comes to sports betting. In addition, many states have some sort of legalized gambling, from state lotteries to horse racing.The vast majority of Americans who want to bet on sports are already doing so through offshore websites. People are going to bet on sports one way or another; why not collect some tax on it? Legalized betting will also increase ratings for sports events, as people who have bet on a game have a vested interest in watching.Sports betting has been legal in many other countries for a long time and has not compromised the integrity of the sport. It\u2019s time the United States plays catch-up with the rest of the world.To the Editor:Sports betting should be legalized. Online sports betting has become an addiction much like gambling for teenagers and college students. This was recognized in 2013 when the American Psychiatric Association reclassified pathological gambling from an impulse control disorder to an addiction in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.Sports fantasy sites openly target young men and are not held to the same legal standards as many casinos and other gambling institutions. Many casinos display brochures of Gamblers Anonymous and other treatment resources.By legalizing online sports betting we will be able to ensure that those walking the line of addiction receive proper resources in order to enjoy their hobby in safe, regulated ways that do not overtake their lives.SARA SHAH, NEW YORKTo the Editor:Sports gambling should be legalized. First, it could be an important source of government revenue like the many state lotteries that have flourished under this form of voluntary taxation.

{"Headline": "With New Focus on Sexual Misconduct, Democrats Take Aim at Trump", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats have been leery of any mention of the I-word. Clamoring for the impeachment of President Trump, they fear, could backfire and alienate independent voters and unhappy Republicans they hope to attract in next year\u2019s midterms. But demanding congressional hearings into accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior by the president is another thing altogether.\u201cIf you look at the mood of the country and the \u2018Me Too\u2019 movement, the time is really right to get to the truth of the matter,\u201d said Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women\u2019s Working Group. The group has collected more than 150 signatures from Democratic lawmakers on a letter demanding that Republicans convene hearings on the issue.They are highly unlikely to get satisfaction on that front. Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who leads the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, quickly rejected the request for a hearing and said he would refer the matter to the Justice Department.Democrats are taking varied approaches to try to make their case. Representative Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, Democrat of Illinois, used a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday to recount some of the accusations against the president while pressing Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on whether the episodes merited investigation by the federal authorities.\u201cI will invite you to submit the evidence and the department will review it if you believe there\u2019s a federal crime,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein responded. \u201cThat applies to any alleged violation by any person. That\u2019s all I have to say about that.\u201dAlso on Wednesday, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, joined Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, in asking the independent Office of Government Ethics to look into what they described as credible claims by at least 19 women.\u201cWe believe public officials must set the gold standard for professional behavior, particularly those who hold the high offices of representative, senator, and \u2014 especially \u2014 president of the United States,\u201d they said in a letter.The tough Democratic line is a departure from the careful approach that leading Democrats have taken on the subject of impeachment. The majority of House Democrats opposed an attempt last week to initiate impeachment proceedings. Ms. Pelosi and Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, issued a joint statement pointing to the special counsel looking at the Trump administration and campaign as well as current congressional investigations.\u201cThose inquiries should be allowed to continue,\u201d their statement said. \u201cNow is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\u201dBut Ms. Pelosi has strongly endorsed the push for new hearings on the sexual misconduct complaints against the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a person who has been a sexual harasser should be president of the United States,\u201d she told CNN.At this stage, party strategists don\u2019t expect Democratic congressional candidates to make the president\u2019s past sexual behavior a central theme of next year\u2019s campaigns. They prefer that the focus be on the economy, the Republican tax bill, health care and other issues with a more direct effect on voters. But they say that keeping the accusations front and center helps Democrats create an overarching atmosphere that plays to their advantage and particularly turns female voters against Republicans.The White House and other Republicans say that Democrats should just accept the fact that voters knew of the allegations against Mr. Trump during the campaign and elected him anyway. But that was before the current furor over sexual harassment, and Democrats say the president, like other politicians, needs to be held accountable.Though Republicans seem unwilling to convene a hearing that would put the president under harsh scrutiny, Democrats have no intention of dropping the subject.\u201cWe are not going to let up,\u201d Ms. Frankel said. \u201cThis is so much bigger than us.\u201dThere is one sure way for Democrats to get the hearings they want \u2014 win back the House or Senate next November, install Democratic committee leaders and call witnesses. Democrats believe that a concentrated and persistent emphasis on longstanding accusations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Trump will help them do just that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: A Tax Challenge for Sacramento", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The Republican tax bill moving through Congress eliminates the deduction for state income taxes and limits the deduction for property taxes. Californians write big checks for both, which is why there so much concern about the bill.Here\u2019s why. Because of Proposition 13, California homeowners (or at least those who have lived in the same house for a while) tend to pay less in property taxes than incomes taxes. So given the changes under consideration in Washington, it might make sense for state lawmakers to figure out a way for Californians to pay more in property taxes, where they can take a federal deduction, and less in income taxes. (This presumes that one of the compromises floating around in Washington \u2014 to count both property taxes and income taxes against the $10,000 limit \u2014 does not become law).Joe Mathews, a longtime critic of this state\u2019s governance system, said the Republican proposal could stir enough concern among Californians to embolden elected officials to grab the rail. But he isn\u2019t counting on it.Still, he said, \u201cIt would be great if Donald Trump did us the favor of making us do tax reform.\u201dOne person who agrees with the \u201cit won\u2019t happen\u201d argument is Gov. Jerry Brown, who lived through the Proposition 13 wars. In an interview, Mr. Brown made clear he had no intention of taking on the state tax code, in no small part because Proposition 13 requires a two-thirds vote to raise taxes in most cases.\u201cVery implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a two-thirds vote. No way, no how. Moderate Democrats? Do you really think that\u2019s a viable possibility?\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)In case you were wondering just how politically fraught these times have become, consider this: A chocolatier from Oakland is now using a box of chocolates to protest President Trump\u2019s travel ban.\u201cIt\u2019s a little six-piece box,\u201d said Karen Urbanek, an artist who has been making hand-painted artisan chocolates for seven years. \u201cI was just so chagrined at Trump\u2019s continuing attempts to keep out not just Muslims but anyone he doesn\u2019t like. We need more diversity, not less. I just wanted to make a statement about it.\u201dThe other three countries vary a bit from the travel ban theme: Mexico, China and Sweden.Sweden? \u201cRemember when he said that Sweden has terrorists?\u201d she said.\u201cI haven\u2019t been given to making a lot of political statements,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I sure felt I had something to say in a quiet way.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Hunger in North Korea Is Devastating. And It\u2019s Our Fault.", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOne cool morning last April in Pyongyang, North Korea, I watched a woman squat over a patch of grass along the Daedong River. A large handkerchief covering her head was knotted below her chin, encircling her sunburned and wrinkled face. As a van passed by blaring patriotic hymns from the oversize speakers on its roof, she weeded the riverbank. In North Korea, keeping the neighborhood clean is a civic duty. But she was far from any neighborhood. She was gathering the weeds for food.As these stories show \u2014 and as I have seen during my 16 visits to North Korea in the past decade \u2014 hunger remains a way of life there. Forty-one percent of North Koreans, about 10.5 million people, are undernourished, and 28 percent of children under 5 years old have stunted growth. When my 4-year-old daughter visited Pyongyang in 2013, she, all of three feet, towered over children twice her age.The hunger is devastating. And it\u2019s our fault.Led by the United States, the international community is crippling North Korea\u2019s economy. In August and September, the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions banning exports of coal, iron, lead, seafood and textiles and limiting the import of crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United States, Japan and South Korea have each imposed bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang to further isolate the country.We are trying to inflict pain on the North Korean regime to stop the development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That\u2019s understandable. But in the process, we are also punishing the most vulnerable citizens and shackling the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to them.That North Korea cannot feed its people on its own is not new. It was the catastrophic famine in the 1990s that caused the reclusive government to open itself to international aid. Despite recent improvements in the nation\u2019s food-production capacity, frequent natural disasters such as floods and droughts still cause severe food shortages.It should be no surprise that around 60 percent of North Koreans buy food at informal markets to supplement their diets. To do that, they need money.Last year, former President Park Geun-hye of South Korea shut down a joint project in the border town of Kaesong that employed 53,000 North Korean factory workers. This year, with the United Nations Security Council ban on textile exports, countless factory workers \u2014 far more than the tens of thousands from last year \u2014 will no longer have jobs. The ban on seafood exports means that fishermen will no longer be able to sell their catches to the Chinese. The reduction in how much oil North Korea can import will also cause food prices to rise. The impending loss of income from the sanctions will mean that people will go without food.The sanctions have also crippled humanitarian help. In one troubling example, Tomas Ojea Quintana, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, has written that cancer patients may not get access to chemotherapy because of the sanctions. Just last month, Britain announced it was cutting off all humanitarian aid to North Korea.Their effectiveness is also limited because North Koreans are used to shortages and hardship, and the country can survive without exports. (Sanctions on Iran, often cited as an example to justify sanctions on North Korea, were more effective because the country is much more dependent on exports.) Even President Trump acknowledged recently that he doesn\u2019t know if sanctions will work in North Korea.The North Korean regime could halt its costly nuclear and missile program and use the money to feed its people. But the leaders have made it clear that they will never give up their quest for nuclear weapons as long as the United States continues its \u201chostile policies.\u201dThis is a chicken and egg game. While we are playing, people starve.Kee B.

{"Headline": "City of the Future? Humans, Not Technology, Are the Challenge in Toronto", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 For a city striving to become a major technology center, it was a prize catch: A Google corporate sibling would spend the coming year planning a futuristic metropolis in a derelict part of Toronto\u2019s waterfront.When announcing this fall that the company, Sidewalk Labs, would create a city of tomorrow, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada promised the project would create \u201ctechnologies that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive\u201d communities. Even the nasty weather off Lake Ontario would be tamed, the developer pledged.But tempering the excitement of some Toronto residents are concerns that are perhaps inevitable when it comes to a company renowned for collecting and analyzing data.Quayside, as the project is known, will be laden with sensors and cameras tracking everyone who lives, works or merely passes through the area. In what Sidewalk calls a marriage of technology and urbanism, the resulting mass of data will be used to further shape and refine the new city. Lifting a term from its online sibling, the company calls the Toronto project \u201ca platform.\u201dBut extending the surveillance powers of one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies from the virtual world to the real one raises privacy concerns for many residents. Others caution that, when it comes to cities, data-driven decision-making can be misguided and undemocratic.\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of interest and also quite a bit of concern,\u201d said Shauna Brail, the director of the University of Toronto\u2019s urban studies program. \u201cIt will be a political issue no matter what.\u201dMr. Doctoroff, who peppers conversations about Quayside with references to \u201cconsultation\u201d and \u201ctransparency,\u201d came to Toronto fully expecting concerns and criticism.\u201cIf you\u2019re going convince people about new ideas, they have to be a part of it,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cThe whole notion of this place as a platform is apparently more democratic than, we think, traditional place-making has actually been.\u201dDuring its first two years in operation, Sidewalk looked at 52 places in the United States and several others around the world for a site to begin building cities of the future, Mr. Doctoroff said. But in Toronto, the company\u2019s interests found a match. An agency that included the federal government, the city and the province of Ontario was looking for a developer for about 800 acres of federally owned waterfront just east of downtown.It was last developed during the 1950s, when officials hoped that the St. Lawrence Seaway would allow trade with Europe to become an integral part of Toronto\u2019s economy.Little of that vision came to fruition. The area is now home to overflow parking for car dealerships, an abandoned grain elevator and docks lined with small, slightly shabby cruise boats where high school prom parties are held. No one calls it home.The current agreement between Sidewalk and the three government entities covers only 12 acres, for an initial experiment.Pretty much everything in Quayside will be reimagined. Buildings will be prefabricated for the most part, and will be highly energy-efficient; breaking with traditional zoning rules, they will not have fixed uses. A Sidewalk drawing shows a low-rise structure in which office workers and apartment dwellers share space with what appears to be a large distillery. Packages will be delivered by robot; other robots will pick up the garbage.Private cars will be restricted in favor of self-driving cars (another area of interest for Alphabet), walking, cycling and mass transit. The wires and pipes that are the connective tissue of every city will sit inside tunnels fitted with access panels that Sidewalk claims will eliminate the need to dig up streets. Neighborhood mini-grids that do not rely on fossil fuels will supply electricity.When it rains, or the hot summer sun beats down, massive awnings will unfold; heated paths will melt the snow to make way for cyclists in winter.But its data-collection capability may be the greatest distinction, and source of opposition, for the Sidewalk plan.Sensors inside buildings will measure such things as noise, while an array of cameras and outdoor sensors will track everything from air pollution to the movement of people and vehicles through intersections.Nothing is too prosaic to analyze: Toilets and sinks will report their water use; the garbage robots will report on trash collection. Residents and workers in the area will rely on Sidewalk-developed software to gain access to public services; the data gathered from everything will influence long-term planning and development.To Mr. Doctoroff, that marriage of data and urbanism holds the key to the project\u2019s success.\u201cWe looked at literally about 150 different attempts to create urban innovation districts, cities of the future, smart cites.\u201d he said. All of them, in Sidewalk\u2019s view, failed because they could not bridge the gulf between technology and traditional urban planning.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like this at this scale before,\u201d Ms. Robinson said.Ms. Robinson expressed concern that Sidewalk\u2019s vast data might not reflect the city as a whole. Quayside\u2019s current plans promise housing for people of all income levels. But the only company so far committed to moving there is Google Canada, suggesting an influx of young, affluent workers.The data, Ms. Robinson warned, might be used to limit or discourage the otherwise legal use of public spaces by homeless people, teenagers or other groups.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create what\u2019s effectively a gated community,\u201d she said.Like many other skeptics, Ms. Robinson noted that people online can avoid the all-seeing eye of technology companies by, for example, opting not to use social media sites. No obvious way to opt out of Quayside\u2019s surveillance systems exists, except by staying out of the area.\u201cDemocracy and the rights of citizens is inherently political; it\u2019s not something you should shy away from,\u201d said Ms. Sieber, who studies the use of data by citizen groups. \u201cGovernments need to be all about fairness.\u201d If city government were concerned only with efficiency, she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t send buses where it\u2019s rural or poor.\u201d\u201cWe believe there\u2019s enormous potential but we also are very sensitive to the fact that there\u2019s going to have to be an intense community conversation,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to commit the money to do the planning over the course of the next year and leave it to the people of Toronto as to whether or not they are excited by the vision.\u201dFollow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianraustenAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China Can Teach Developing Nations About Building Power", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsIn 2018, China will mark the 40th anniversary of its transition from a planned to a market economy. It comes at a unique moment in history: The United States\u2019 apparent retreat from globalization offers a distinct opportunity for China to accelerate its ascendance as a guardian of the global trading system.Meanwhile, the nation\u2019s rise from poverty to a world power in the last few decades can provide valuable lessons for other developing countries, especially as the Trump administration continues to pursue anti-globalization policies.In 1978, China\u2019s per capita gross domestic product was $154, less than a third that of the nations in sub-Saharan Africa. China was an inward-looking country with a trade-to-G.D.P. ratio of only 9.7 percent, versus 32.7 percent today.Today, China is an upper-middle-income country where per capita G.D.P. is close to $9,000 a year, and that figure is likely to cross the $12,700 threshold, the hallmark of a high-income country, around 2025. China is also the world\u2019s largest producer of goods, and one of the most competitive countries in the world.It is worth noting that after embarking on their own economic transitions, the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe both suffered economic collapses, while China has seen much more success. The primary reason has been a difference in approach.In the transition\u2019s early years, China had a large number of nonviable state-owned enterprises in capital-intensive industries, such as heavy-equipment manufacturing and steelmaking. In the open and competitive market, such industries could not have survived without protection and subsidies. Therefore the Chinese government subsidized these enterprises, but opened up investment in labor-intensive industries, in which China enjoyed comparative advantages. This dual-track approach allowed China to maintain stability and achieve rapid development.A similar strategy was applied to opening up China\u2019s broader economy. China restricted the inflow of foreign capital to capital-intensive industries, which consisted mainly of state-owned enterprises. Labor-intensive industries, on the other hand, were opened up to attract foreign investment.As China\u2019s economic clout grows, so will its influence in global governance. During China\u2019s 19th Communist Party congress in October, Xi won a second five-year term and emerged as the country\u2019s paramount leader. He is now tasked with completing China\u2019s transition into an efficient open market economy and contributing to a new order of international peace and development.The nation will continue to pursue programs that eliminate poverty and hunger, not only within its own borders but also around the world. Instead of following the Western practice of imposing its values and ideologies on other developing countries as a precondition for humanitarian aid, China will continue to offer aid, trade and investment opportunities to developing countries while adhering to a principle of noninterference.Since the late 1970s, China has been able to achieve dynamic growth through a combination of strong leadership and pragmatism. With continued foresight and openness, China is positioned to resume its historical role as a leading power in the world.Justin Yifu Lin is director of the Center for New Structural Economics and dean of the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development at Peking University.

{"Headline": "At E.U. Meeting, a Hobbled Merkel and a Stalled Agenda", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 For the past decade or more, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has commanded the stage at European Union summit meetings. But as she strode through the red carpeted entrance at the start of this week\u2019s meeting, her usual aura was missing.Everyone understands that her era is ending. Even so, it was telling that as leaders arrived on Thursday for this meeting, France\u2019s energetic young president, Emmanuel Macron, was already there, responding to reporters. Smiling indulgently, Ms. Merkel went over to his side and said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s answering all the questions.\u201dThe paralysis in Berlin, however, with a new government not expected until March and Ms. Merkel weakened, has delayed what was meant to be the central task of the bloc \u2014 figuring out how to reform itself institutionally to ensure that the euro is weatherproof and sustainable, to avoid new shocks from member states like Greece, Spain and Italy.This was the summit meeting where European leaders were supposed to grapple with Mr. Macron\u2019s sweeping proposals for institutional change. But Ms. Merkel cannot move without a mandate. And while she participated in a relatively acrimonious dinner discussion Thursday night over migration, defending past policy about the need for bloc solidarity in distributing refugees, she has been noticeably media-averse, canceling her normal after-dinner news briefing.\u201cThere is a strong sense in Europe that something has to change and Germany will have to be at the center of that,\u201d said Jan Techau, a German political analyst. \u201cBut whether the issue is the economy or defense, I\u2019m not sure Germans feel that they can get it done, given Merkel\u2019s declining political capital. The problems are huge, but Germans are not sure we\u2019re up to it.\u201dEven more, Mr. Techau said, \u201cGerman and French ideas on European governance are very far from each other.\u201dWith Germany\u2019s caretaker government unable to make new policy, Mr. Macron and the commission cannot get a considered response, blocking progress. So the summit meeting discussed migration, with no decisions expected before June at the earliest, and nascent moves toward more cooperation and efficiency on European defense and procurement.In a symbolic gesture, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron gave a joint news conference at the conclusion of the meeting. She thanked him for his \u201cclose relations with us,\u2019\u2019 and said that French-German agreement was important for European solutions.But Mr. Macron noted, a touch wistfully, that \u201cGermany, which has constraints that go with its political system, just had its elections and is in the process of forming a government.\u201d He added, \u201cWe need a strong and stable German government to move forward.\u201dHe added that Ms. Merkel was busy building a coalition, \u201cbut we can still talk to one another, and we have the aim of converging in March\u201d their positions on eurozone reforms, so that the bloc could agree on a \u201croad map\u201d in June.On real substance, though, Europe waits for the Germans. The Social Democrats, who had originally refused to form a government with Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, are beginning to negotiate just such a return. To enhance their profile, Social Democratic leaders have been pressing for a bigger role for Europe to stabilize the eurozone and carve out a clearer global role in the era of President Trump, when Washington has retreated from its traditional leadership of multilateral alliances, institutions and global trading systems.Both trial balloons, which were perceived as slightly desperate, were quickly shot down, and for good reason.The lesson of recent European elections \u2014 in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and Central Europe \u2014 is one of increased nationalism, populism and skepticism about \u201cmore Europe.\u201d Mr. Macron\u2019s election, which depended on the collapse of the two main parties from infighting and scandal, seems more like an outlier than the herald of a new European commitment.With impending European parliamentary elections and a change in European leadership in Brussels in 2019, the window for pushing through any serious change in European structures is very tight and closing \u2014 essentially the same window for getting an agreement on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc in March 2019.Simon Fraser, a former senior British diplomat with long experience in Brussels, sees positive energy in Mr. Macron\u2019s proposals and in his commitment to reform France\u2019s labor market.\u201cMacron wants to re-energize the E.U.,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cBut he\u2019s being left a bit high and dry by the Germans, and what Macron proposes won\u2019t get a lot of traction with Berlin. His big risk, with only about six months left to this European Commission, is to push too hard. He has a lot of cards, but he needs to play them very carefully.\u201dTo show that this time, NATO is on board with this new European initiative, NATO\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, made a rare appearance on Thursday at the meeting of European leaders.Elmar Brok, a conservative German member of the European Parliament, saw great progress now that British anxiety about European defense harming NATO has evaporated.\u201cWe\u2019ve advanced in 12 months more in defense than in the last 12 years, because the British no longer stopped us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the answer to spending more and more efficiently on defense.\u201dWhile the German elite talks of embracing Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas, only 12 percent of Germans regard the French-German partnership as crucial to the European Union, and 54 percent oppose Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal for a eurozone finance minister.German mistrust of Mr. Trump is high, with 88 percent believing Germany\u2019s security is best protected in the context of Europe, but only 32 percent want to spend any more money on defense. And three times as many Germans see refugees, and not Russia, as their biggest security concern. (The telephone poll of 1,005 people has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.)\u201cIn Germany there is a fin de si\u00e8cle quality around Merkel,\u201d he said, \u201cbut without an obvious successor, and there is none of the usual sense of power moving smoothly from one party to another. There\u2019s deep skepticism about political parties and what they have been delivering; populism survives and the uncertainties are stretching into 2018 \u2014 with new ones, like migration and worries over Italy.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Brexit, Phase 2.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Holiday Stories Matter", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorScientists are fascinated by the few groups of hunter-gatherers remaining on the planet, since it is thought that they reflect our species\u2019 earliest successful way of life, before the invention of agriculture. They are closely studied to solve a riddle that has long puzzled evolutionary biologists: How did humans learn cooperative behavior such as food-sharing, the care of others, the coordination of tasks, the acceptance of social norms? The answer, it seems, has everything to do with the stories we tell.As is typical among bands of foragers, Agta stories emphasize the values of gender equality, friendship and the social acceptance of difference. Consider the following myth: \u201cThere is a dispute between the sun (male) and the moon (female) to illuminate the sky. After a fight, where the moon proves to be as strong as the sun, they agree in sharing the duty \u2014 one during the day and the other during the night.\u201d The research established that individuals who live in camps with a greater proportion of skilled storytellers cooperate more readily with one another and are therefore more successful in their foraging.The Agta themselves are fully aware of the benefits conferred upon them by the best makers and performers of stories. When asked to choose with whom they would most like to live, they overwhelmingly favored gifted storytellers over those who were known for their skill in hunting, fishing, tuber gathering or medicine. Life, most of those polled agreed, is simply better in the company of good stories.The Agta are evidently willing to reward the gift they most value. Data collected in the course of the study show that the best storytellers have better fitness and higher reproductive success. (\u201cSkilled storytellers,\u201d the paper reports, \u201chad an additional 0.53 living offspring compared to non-skilled storytellers.\u201d) The scientists concluded that by providing a service that enhances social cooperation, skilled storytellers receive increased support from others and are thus rewarded for their outstanding contribution to the group\u2019s overall success.This time of year, the stories that most unite us are fantasies in which we are not (except as small children) asked to put our faith. Unlike, say, the biblical accounts of Adam and Eve and the birth of Jesus, these festive tales generally do not draw masses of faithful who insist as a point of dogma on their literal truth. On the contrary, either our playful seasonal stories are clearly understood from the start to be fictional or, in the case of Santa Claus, they become fictional in time.Indeed, for millions of people, generation after generation, awakening at some point in childhood to the fact that Santa Claus is an invention is their primary early experience of disillusionment. If there is a lingering sadness in this literal loss of an illusion, the loss serves also as a powerful ritual of maturity, a threshold across which we are all expected to cross, an acceptance of the distinction between reality and make-believe.The American cult of Santa Claus, with his rosy cheeks and his sleigh full of toys, can be traced back to the poem \u201cA Visit From St. Nicholas\u201d (better known as \u201c \u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u201d), first published in The Troy Sentinel on Dec. 23, 1823. If we were the Agta, we would have conferred honor and wealth upon the poem\u2019s spectacularly gifted storyteller, but in fact it was published anonymously, and the identity of the author is still the subject of debate.Many scholars attribute it to Clement Clarke Moore, a professor of literature and divinity at New York\u2019s Episcopal General Theological Seminary. Others argue that it was written by the Poughkeepsie poet Henry Livingston Jr. The author, whoever it was, is unlikely to have received more than a pittance for his effort.But as a culture, we make up for our failure to have rewarded the poet directly by pouring out our riches in an annual frenzy of gift-giving. This gift-giving has become a crucial element in our national economy and hence our well-being as a commercial society. This season, even in a bitterly contentious time, the storyteller has once again done the key work of fashioning cooperation among us. The Agta are clearly right.Stephen Greenblatt is a professor of the humanities at Harvard and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican War on Children", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet me ask you a question; take your time in answering it. Would you be willing to take health care away from a thousand children with the bad luck to have been born into low-income families so that you could give millions of extra dollars to just one wealthy heir?You might think that this question is silly, hypothetical and has an obvious answer. But it\u2019s not at all hypothetical, and the answer apparently isn\u2019t obvious. For it\u2019s a literal description of the choice Republicans in Congress seem to be making as you read this.But Republicans still consider this tax an unacceptable burden on the rich. The Senate bill would double the exemption to $22 million; the House bill would eliminate the estate tax entirely.As you see, then, my question wasn\u2019t at all hypothetical. By their actions, Republicans are showing that they consider it more important to give extra millions to one already wealthy heir than to provide health care to a thousand children. Meanwhile, here\u2019s the funny thing: While there is zero evidence that tax cuts pay for themselves, there\u2019s considerable evidence that aiding lower-income children actually saves money in the long run.But such results, while interesting and important, aren\u2019t the main reason we should be providing children with health care and enough to eat. Simple decency should be reason enough. And despite everything we\u2019ve seen in U.S. politics, it\u2019s still hard to believe that a whole political party would balk at doing the decent thing for millions of kids while rushing to further enrich a few thousand wealthy heirs.That is, however, exactly what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s as bad, in its own way, as that same party\u2019s embrace of a child molester because they expect him to vote for tax cuts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan Crowns a Big Winner: Trump\u2019s Industry", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe real estate industry ended up with an even more generous depreciation timetable, allowing owners to shelter more income.And in a break from previous practice, rental and mortgage-interest income qualifies for a lower tax rate, the kind of special treatment traditionally reserved for long-term capital gains and certain qualified dividends.Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs, have extra cause for celebration. They are companies that make money by owning, financing and operating real estate. Both the Trump Organization and Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Mr. Kushner, have important deals with such trusts.A REIT functions like a mutual fund, but instead of assembling a portfolio of stocks, it allows people to invest in a bundle of real estate assets, both buildings and mortgages. More important is the way they are taxed. They pay no separate business tax and instead are required to pass along virtually all of their taxable income to shareholders, who pay the tax when they file individual returns.That\u2019s a big savings, and a big advantage. Those receiving mortgage-interest income outside a REIT would have to pay taxes based on ordinary rates.Kushner Companies has teamed up with another New York-based REIT, SL Green Realty Corporation, in several deals. They are collaborating on a development in Brooklyn, and SL Green lent Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm $85 million in 2016 to refinance its slice of the former headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said the firm had not done any lobbying on the tax bill.Kurt Koegl, a partner at the national accounting firm Marcum, noted that a lower corporate tax rate would enable other kinds of companies to better compete with REITs.But REITs are favored in other ways. Individuals who borrow money to invest in a REIT will be able to deduct the interest they pay on the loan at the top individual rate. When it comes to paying taxes on the interest income they earn from that REIT investment, however, the new, lower pass-through rate would apply.\u201cThat\u2019s a great deal, and it\u2019s going to create giant new tax shelters,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax code generally tries to prohibit this kind of tax rate arbitrage, he added.The REIT advantage is one example of a broader issue: different tax treatment for similar activities.Writers of the congressional bills promised that their overhaul would simplify the tax code, but the intricacies of the changes create countless opportunities for gamesmanship.\u201cSuddenly, there are a dozen different tax rates that apply to different businesses, in different industries, and to different investments,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. That means opportunities to come out ahead by making deals between these different groups or structuring businesses to take advantage of various provisions.That could lead to a flurry of restructuring and asset shifting that has no purpose other than lowering the tax rate. One business might borrow money to invest in another, or buy equipment and treat it as an expense and then lease it to another company.Ideally, the tax code is meant to encourage businesses to make sound economic decisions, and forgo activities whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes. But the proliferation of different business rates rewards loophole hunting and earnings shifting.\u201cThe speed with which they\u2019re doing this creates a level of ambiguity that will keep tax lawyers and tax professionals busy for 20 years,\u201d said Scott D. Michel, a tax lawyer with Caplin & Drysdale.For some industries, such accounting acrobatics may not be necessary. A Senate provision that is being marketed as an aid to small craft breweries would save money even for the largest beer, wine and liquor producers, whether they are in the United States or abroad.Foreign cruise lines that operate in the United States got a last-minute reprieve from a new tax that was in an earlier version of the Senate bill.Whistle-blowers and their attorneys are happy about a provision specifying that they can collect rewards based on criminal fines.Car dealers escaped the cap on interest deductions that apply to most other businesses. Private equity firms were not able to sidestep that cap, but they held on to most of the carried-interest benefit that allows private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay a lower rate on much of their income. Firms will have to hold an asset for three years instead of one, but the average hold time is already more than five years.The energy industry also did well. Coal and natural gas would potentially benefit from provisions that undercut their renewable-energy competitors. In a reversal of more than four decades of national policy, the Senate bill would open a pristine 1.5-million-acre expanse of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.House and Senate Republicans are still wrangling over the final version, and every comma is subject to change. But to some tax experts, an unlevel playing field that gives certain types of business and structures advantages over others is a bigger concern than a tax break for real estate or any other industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at the deals that are explicitly in the bill \u2014 like the special treatment of auto-dealer financing or whistle-blowers \u2014 and call out \u2018loophole,\u2019\u201d Mr. Looney of Brookings said. \u201cBut the big problems are the things that aren\u2019t specifically noted in the bill, but will arise because of tax planning.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ask Women at Ford", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "Decades after the company tried to tackle sexual misconduct at two Chicago plants, continued abuse raises questions about the possibility of change.CHICAGO \u2014 The jobs were the best they would ever have: collecting union wages while working at Ford, one of America\u2019s most storied companies. But inside two Chicago plants, the women found menace.Bosses and fellow laborers treated them as property or prey. Men crudely commented on their breasts and buttocks; graffiti of penises was carved into tables, spray-painted onto floors and scribbled onto walls. They groped women, pressed against them, simulated sex acts or masturbated in front of them. Supervisors traded better assignments for sex and punished those who refused.That was a quarter-century ago. Today, women at those plants say they have been subjected to many of the same abuses. And like those who complained before them, they say they were mocked, dismissed, threatened and ostracized. One described being called \u201csnitch bitch,\u201d while another was accused of \u201craping the company.\u201d Many of the men who they say hounded them kept their jobs.For Sharon Dunn, who sued Ford back then, the new lawsuit was a fresh blow. \u201cFor all the good that was supposed to come out of what happened to us, it seems like Ford did nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had that choice today, I wouldn\u2019t say a damn word.\u201dIn recent months, as women have spoken out about harassment \u2014 at media companies and technology start-ups, in the entertainment industry and on Capitol Hill \u2014 they have spurred quick action, with accused men toppling from lofty positions, corporations pledging change and lawmakers promising new protections.But much less attention has been focused on the plight of blue-collar workers, like those on Ford\u2019s factory floors. After the #MeToo movement opened a global floodgate of accounts of mistreatment, a former Chicago worker proposed a new campaign: \u201c#WhatAboutUs.\u201dTheir story reveals the stubborn persistence of harassment in an industry once the exclusive preserve of men, where abuses can be especially brazen. For the Ford women, the harassment has endured even though they work for a multinational corporation with a professional human resources operation, even though they are members of one of the country\u2019s most powerful unions, even though a federal agency and then a federal judge sided with them, and even after independent monitors policed the factory floors for several years.At a moment when so many people are demanding that sexual harassment no longer be tolerated, the story of the Ford plants shows the challenges of transforming a culture.Workers describe a mix of sex, swagger, suspicion and racial resentment that makes the factories \u2014 the Chicago Assembly Plant and the Chicago Stamping Plant \u2014 particularly volatile.The plants are self-enclosed worlds where employees pass on job referrals so relatives, classmates and longtime friends can work together. They share gossip and rumors, but also keep secrets that entrench bad behavior. Many feel deep loyalty to Ford and their union, and resent the female accusers, fearing they may damage the company and jeopardize good paychecks and generous benefits. Some women are suspected of gaming a system where sex is a powerful lever.Ford has worked to combat harassment at the plants, including recently stepping up disciplinary efforts and installing new leadership. But over the years the company did not act aggressively or consistently enough to root out the problem, according to interviews with more than 100 current and former employees and industry experts, and a review of legal documents.Ford delayed firing those accused of harassment, leaving workers to conclude that offenders would go unpunished. It let sexual harassment training wane and, women charge, failed to stamp out retaliation.The local union, obliged to protect both accusers and the accused, was divided, with a leadership that included alleged predators. And even the outsiders whom women turned to for help, including lawyers and the E.E.O.C., left some of them feeling betrayed.Ford officials say they view the harassment as episodic, not systemic, with an outbreak in the \u201990s and another beginning in 2010 as new workers flooded in. They say they take all claims seriously and investigate them thoroughly. Responding to the national outcry over sexual harassment, Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, released a video to employees last week about appropriate behavior. \u201cThe test would be if you go to work, have experiences, and go home and tell your family about it and be proud of what went on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not expect or accept any harassment in the workplaces here at Ford.\u201dShirley Cain, who arrived at the stamping plant five years ago and had to fend off advances from supervisors and co-workers alike, was skeptical. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reality,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even go on the floor, so they don\u2019t know what goes on.\u201dFrom the beginning, the women were targets. The first warning often came during orientation as new hires were paraded through the Chicago Assembly Plant. Shirley Thomas-Moore, a teacher who came to Ford to make better money, recalled the scene in the mid-80s: A man would hit his hammer on a railing, summoning the attention of the factory floor. \u201cFresh meat!\u201d the male workers hollered.\u201cWhen they come in, everybody\u2019s: \u2018Oh man, look at her. Nah, this is going to be mine,\u2019\u201d recalled her husband, Terrance Moore, who also worked at the plant.Men still stake their claims today, according to workers. Some women say they know how to shut down unwanted advances \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t play,\u201d they snap \u2014 while others say they have never encountered harassment. But James Jones, a union representative, said the problem should not be minimized, describing the attitude of many men at the factories: \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to eat that porterhouse steak.\u201dThe giant Chicago Assembly Plant sprawls like a low-slung fortress over an isolated stretch of Chicago\u2019s South Side near the Indiana border. The oldest continuously operating plant at a company that once revolutionized manufacturing with the Model T, it now churns out Ford Explorers and Tauruses.Women joined the work force during World War II, when the factory made M8 armored cars. But it was not until the 1970s that they routinely held permanent jobs on the line. By then, Ford had built a second factory, the Chicago Stamping Plant, to supply parts. Today, the two plants employ about 5,700; just under a third are women.As women were finding their way into Ford, the nation\u2019s manufacturing base was eroding, and overseas competition threatened the auto industry.Darnise Hardy, one of the first women to arrive, was told by male workers that she belonged at home in the kitchen. Ms. Thomas-Moore, who arrived a few years later, said some men felt that the newcomers were taking their jobs. Two decades later, a foreman told Suzette Wright that women should never have been hired.A job at Ford was considered a golden ticket. When Ms. Wright, a 23-year-old single mother, was offered a spot at Chicago Assembly in 1993, she was \u201ccrazy insane elated.\u201d She had been working part-time jobs as a hair salon receptionist and a data entry clerk. In an instant, her hourly wage tripled, to about $15. With overtime, workers could earn $70,000 or more a year, good money for those without a college degree \u2014 and an incentive to put up with a lot.Ms. Wright and others discovered a robust underground economy at the assembly plant: Everything from toys and televisions to drugs and guns were for sale inside, and sex outside. On the line, she would hear men regaling one another with stories about late-night parties with strippers in the parking lot. Ms. Thomas-Moore\u2019s father, who worked at the stamping factory, saw prostitutes and makeshift liquor trucks as he waited to pick her up from Chicago Assembly. \u201cBaby girl,\u201d she remembers him saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is part of Ford.\u201dAs Ms. Wright settled in, she asked a co-worker to explain something: Why were men calling out \u201cpeanut butter legs\u201d when she arrived in the morning? He demurred, but she insisted. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, peanut butter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wright recalled. \u201c\u2018Not only is it the color of your legs, but it\u2019s the kind of legs you like to spread.\u2019\u201dLike many of the female employees who eventually sued Ford, Ms. Wright is African-American; those accused of harassment include black, white and Latino men. Some of the women felt doubly victimized \u2014 propositioned and denounced as sluts while also being called \u201cblack bitches\u201d and other racial slurs. (The assembly plant\u2019s work force is predominantly African-American, while the stamping plant\u2019s is majority white.)As the affronts continued \u2014 lewd comments, repeated come-ons, men grabbing their crotches and moaning every time she bent over \u2014 Ms. Wright tried to ignore them. Veteran female employees warned that reporting the behavior brought only more trouble. The smallest infraction, routinely overlooked, suddenly merited a write-up. The very nature of factory work \u2014 the pressure to keep the production line going \u2014 gave bosses power to inflict petty humiliations, such as denying bathroom breaks.But after a man Ms. Wright had trusted as a mentor made a crack about paying her $5 for oral sex, she asked her union representative for help. He began what she calls a \u201cdon\u2019t-file-a-claim-against-Bill\u201d campaign: Her co-worker would lose his job, his benefits, his pension, she was told. Rumors spread, questioning their relationship. Then a union official delivered the final insult: \u201cSuzette, you\u2019re a pretty woman \u2014 take it as a compliment.\u201dThe same thing happened to Gwajuana Gray, who had followed her father into the assembly plant in 1991 and still works there. When she told her union steward that a manager had pressed his groin against her, he said she should be flattered. \u201cI was like, well, where do you go?\u201d she said.The accumulating misconduct took a toll. Some women quit. Others were emotionally spent.\u201cIt just was way, way, way, way too much,\u201d Ms. Wright said of the abuses. \u201cEach time that I was taking it, again and again, it just felt like more of me diminishing,\u201d she said, \u201cjust getting smaller until it was just like a shell of a person.\u201dShe and Ms. Gray both said they were overcome by anxiety and depression and took extended medical leaves. \u201cI was at rock bottom,\u201d Ms. Gray recalled.When their lawsuit was settled in 2000, Ms. Wright had to leave Ford. Ms. Gray was able to return. The harassment subsided for a while, she and others said, but soon came back. Louis Smith, a 23-year Ford veteran, could see some of the damage. \u201cI would never want my daughter to work in that environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as men have got to do better.\u201dThe latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.In the last five years, one woman said a male co-worker bit her on the buttocks. A supervisor told a female subordinate, \u201cI want to screw you so bad,\u201d she recalled. A laborer described in pornographic detail what he wanted to do to another woman, then exposed himself to her, she said; later, he pushed her into an empty room and turned off the lights before she fled.Those who complained said they faced retaliation from co-workers and bosses. Some women were frightened after harassers warned them to watch their backs. An Army veteran who accused a man of groping her was physically blocked by his friends from doing her work, she said. Later she found her car tires slashed in the parking lot.Ford officials say that they have a strict policy against retaliation, and that supervisors who exact retribution will be disciplined. But \u201cwhen you speak up,\u201d Ms. Gray said, \u201cyou\u2019re like mud in the plant.\u201dIn explaining why harassment became so ingrained, she and others described sex as a preoccupation at the plants \u2014 variously a diversion, a currency and a weapon. There were plenty of consensual affairs and flirtations, employees agree. Some women used sex to win favors from the overwhelmingly male hierarchy. Bosses rewarded those who acquiesced to their advances by doling out cushier jobs or punished those who spurned them, requiring them to do more taxing, even dangerous work.Miyoshi Morris gave in to a supervisor\u2019s leverage, and was filled with shame. She had been struggling to find day care centers for her children that were open early enough for her to make her 6 a.m. shift. By her account, a manager in the paint department told her she was in trouble because of tardiness. He could help her, she recalled him saying, if she came to his house on a day off he arranged.She agreed, and had sex with him.\u201cI was so lost, afraid, and realizing I had children to care for,\u201d she said. Afterward, she said, her attendance record was no longer a problem, and she received better assignments. She remembers thinking, \u201cWhere else are you going to go and make this kind of money?\u201dThe manager, Myron Alexander, who was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and fired in 2014, did not return calls and Facebook messages seeking comment.Today, Ms. Morris works as an aesthetician for a fraction of what she earned at Ford. \u201cNo person should have to endure that,\u201d she said of the inappropriate behavior at the plant. \u201cYou have to force yourself into a place of not feeling anything, of not having any emotion, to exist.\u201dThe first place workers in trouble are supposed to turn for help is their union \u2014 a family, some call it. But when one member formally accuses another of sexual harassment, solidarity splinters.Mr. Jones, the United Automobile Workers representative, recalled a recent meeting when he was advocating for both sides \u2014 a woman and the man she accused. Ford issued its decision: termination. The man shot a despairing look at Mr. Jones.\u201cHow do you know the woman is telling the truth and she didn\u2019t get her buddies together to come up here and say this?\u201d Mr. Jones remembers thinking.Union representatives are caught between women\u2019s pleas to stand with them and men\u2019s pleas to save their jobs. And the Chicago union itself is now divided between those who champion women and those accused of preying on them.\u201cThe union has got an impossible job,\u201d said George Galland, who acted as an independent monitor at the two Chicago plants for three years. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to protect their members. Unions are ill at ease helping management control sexual harassment. They tend to throw monkey wrenches where they can.\u201dSome women at the plants say the union, whose leadership is mostly male, often met their calls for help with hostility, resistance or inaction. One woman said a representative downplayed a co-worker\u2019s vulgar commentary about her body, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s just him \u2014 the man has no filter.\u201d Another was told not to bother filing a report against a union representative who forcibly kissed her, saying it was her word against his.Tonya Exum, the Army veteran who reported being groped, recalled a union representative saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not sexual harassment. He only did it one time.\u201d When she asked him how he would feel if that happened to his mother or sister, he just walked away.The current lawsuit against Ford, which involves about 30 plaintiffs, accuses multiple local union representatives of harassing women or obstructing their complaints.But women also single out some union representatives for praise, including one man who said he spent hours helping women fill out claims. \u201cAs a union, we\u2019re supposed to be all one,\u201d said the man, who insisted on anonymity because he feared losing his job. \u201cIt frustrates me to see that others do not conduct themselves like gentlemen.\u201dIn 1979, even as sexual harassment was not yet settled law or a familiar concept to many Americans, the autoworkers\u2019 union was one of the earliest to include a clause in its contracts with Ford and Chrysler allowing members to file a grievance if harassment occurred. Its constitution condemns sexual harassment. And the union cooperates with Ford in training; Chris Pena, president of Local 551 in Chicago, said he emphasized the anti-harassment policy with every new employee during orientation.The Times would like to hear more about the experiences of women facing sexual harassment, especially those who are hesitant to speak up for fear of losing their jobs.Share your storyBut as the Great Recession ravaged the auto industry, economic survival eclipsed everything. Chicago Assembly was \u201con life support,\u201d said Bill Dirksen, Ford\u2019s vice president of labor affairs. The plant laid off 700 employees in 2008 and slashed production. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have sexual harassment if you don\u2019t have a company to work for,\u201d Mr. Pena said.That near-death experience haunts workers to this day. Fear that their well-paying jobs could evaporate if the plants become a headache for Ford drives some of the hostility toward women who complain of harassment. Terri Lewis-Bledsoe remembers a union representative warning her to stop filing complaints: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be called a troublemaker,\u201d she recalled him saying. She shot back, \u201cThen a troublemaker I shall be.\u201dThe top union official at Chicago Assembly, Alan Millender, who is known as Coby, is a polarizing figure. Some women praise him for helping them, and he has won two terms. Others have accused him of harassment, including Ms. Morris. She lost her job in January 2014 and turned to him for assistance. But Mr. Millender told her that she would have to get on her knees if she wanted her job back, she said. She should act like another woman who, moments before their conversation, had been pressed close to him, standing between his legs, Ms. Morris recounted.\u201cI could not compromise myself anymore,\u201d Ms. Morris said. \u201cMy job was lost.\u201dMr. Millender declined to comment on the allegations. In a brief telephone conversation, he said: \u201cMy record at Ford Motor Company has always been impeccable. The truth is always going to be the truth.\u201dNational U.A.W. leaders declined interview requests, and Ford officials do not comment on specific cases. But, Mr. Dirksen said, the company does not hesitate to punish anyone who violates its sexual harassment policy, whatever the union rank, and punishments of union members in the past have not provoked plant protests.When Howard Stamps, a longtime Ford veteran, transferred to Chicago Assembly several years ago from a plant near Detroit, he was jolted by the anything-goes culture he encountered. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like Chicago all the days of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think the rules apply to them.\u201dBy 2015, half of all sexual harassment and gender discrimination complaints lodged with the E.E.O.C. about Ford\u2019s domestic operations originated in Chicago.The company is unique among the Big Three automakers, controlled by one family since the days of Henry Ford. Blue-collar employees used to say they \u201cwork at Ford\u2019s,\u201d and family members still talk of their close ties to workers. But from the factory floor, many workers viewed the company as defensive and tentative about a long-simmering problem, enacting its strongest measures against sexual harassment only after pressure from female employees and outside forces like the E.E.O.C. and lawsuits.After long negotiations, the lawsuit was dismissed in exchange for a toughened settlement with the federal agency in 2000; Ford would pay $22 million, with $9 million in damages to women. Mr. Galland recalled that at least 100 women received payments. As is typical in such agreements, Ford denied liability. The company also pledged to make changes, which would be overseen by outside monitors.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t like the way H.R. was investigating these complaints, we told them and made them start over,\u201d said Mr. Galland, the chairman of the three-member monitor panel. \u201cWe told them it\u2019s not the paper procedures that count. A firing is worth a thousand words.\u201dFiring workers demonstrated that harassment came with steep penalties. But many men did not view their behavior as improper. Ms. Thomas-Moore, the former teacher, was among those asked to conduct the classes. \u201cOnce you crossed into what we call Ford World,\u201d she said, \u201ceverybody was supposed to be treated as co-workers.\u201d There should be no hugging. When employees found themselves in uncomfortable situations, she taught them to say, \u201cYou\u2019re in the yellow,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re in the red.\u201dSome men scoffed or cracked jokes. Still, she felt the training was having an effect. One day, a man spoke up, saying he had wronged a co-worker by lying about having sex with her, Ms. Thomas-Moore recalled. He asked that the woman come upstairs, then apologized to her in front of his classmates.For a time, many women said, the plants seemed \u201cquieter.\u201d When the monitors ended their stint in 2003, they gave Ford high marks. But their final report warned of \u201csignificant risks that need attention,\u201d including staffers inexperienced in investigating complaints, the lack of a policy against fraternization and the practice of promoting people widely perceived to be harassers. The report was prescient: Ford would struggle in those areas in the coming years.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to backslide,\u201d Mr. Galland said in an interview.Back from the brink of economic catastrophe in 2010, Chicago Assembly doubled its work force in a couple of years. A mix of young, inexperienced hires and transfers who resented leaving their hometowns flooded in.In the rush to ramp up production, the training lagged \u2014 several workers recalled receiving only a piece of paper outlining the harassment policy, and managers often refused to excuse workers for class, according to Ms. Thomas-Moore. Ford said the training never stopped, but acknowledged it peaked in the early 2000s.Complaints of harassment at the plants started spiking in 2011. Ford officials in the Dearborn, Mich., headquarters said that they dispatched a team to Chicago to insist on prompt but thorough investigations, and that they added staffers to tackle the growing pile of complaints. Training took on new urgency.Still, there appeared to be a gap of expectations. Like most companies, Ford was bound by privacy protections and unwilling to communicate specific findings. But some women felt grilled as if they were lying and frustrated that they were not told if the company was meting out discipline. \u201cWe were told it\u2019s been handled,\u201d said LaWanda Jordan, referring to her complaint about a supervisor who was fired two years later. \u201cThe case has been closed; we can\u2019t discuss it.\u201dIn assessing complaints, Ford struggled with verifying what often boiled down to he-said, she-said accusations. Mr. Galland, the monitor, acknowledged that false accusations were a real problem in factories. But because there often are no witnesses \u2014 or none willing to cooperate \u2014 and no evidence, he added that investigators must assess credibility on both sides.An employee who investigated complaints said Ford was insistent on proof. \u201cOur policy at Ford, told to us by our bosses \u2014 that I didn\u2019t agree with \u2014 was if there are no witnesses, there is nothing you can do,\u201d said Grant Crowley, a former labor relations representative at the stamping plant. (Mr. Crowley said he was asked to leave Ford this year after he posted on Snapchat an emoji expletive about a departed co-worker who left him with extra work.) Ford said investigators also took credibility into account.Even if investigators could not verify some individual accusations, company officials often failed to consider patterns of behavior, workers and lawyers say. Keith Hunt, the lawyer who represented women in the 1990s and today, described cases of four men who were the subject of numerous complaints by women dating back years \u2014 in one instance three decades ago \u2014 but were fired only in the last few years. Julie Lavender, director of personnel relations and employee policies, said that Ford now gave more weight to multiple complaints.Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.And even when there were witnesses, assessing credibility was often hard.Christie Van arrived at Chicago Assembly with the influx of transfers in 2012. She said a supervisor who had been giving her easy jobs like placing radiator caps began asking her to \u201cplay hooky\u201d from work with him. She claimed that the man, Mike Riese, told her his preferred nickname: \u201cHe called himself White Chocolate. He said that he had a black man\u2019s dick.\u201dAfter another supervisor, Willie Fonseca, showed her a picture of his penis on his cellphone, she said, Mr. Riese laughed and asked if she wanted to see his too. \u201cThat was it for me,\u201d she said.Both men denied that happened. Ms. Van filed a complaint in 2012. She showed investigators text messages from Mr. Riese, she said. According to company records obtained by The Times, several co-workers denied her account and described her as disgruntled to Ford investigators.But two other employees, Mr. Stamps and a man who insisted on anonymity because he feared retaliation, said they witnessed Mr. Riese\u2019s advances toward Ms. Van and heard him boast of his nickname. Neither was questioned in Ford\u2019s inquiry, they said.The documents indicate that the company did not substantiate Ms. Van\u2019s complaint. But later, without specifying any episodes, the E.E.O.C. determined she had been subjected to sexual harassment, retaliation and gender discrimination. Several other women accused Mr. Riese of harassment, which he denied. Mr. Riese said he was fired in 2015. \u201cMy life was shattered,\u201d he said.Although they do not comment on individual cases, Ford officials said discipline could be invisible when pay or bonuses were docked. They also said they believed in giving employees a chance to remedy behavior, although the company has fired workers if a first offense is egregious. But many people drew the same conclusion as Ms. Gray: \u201cThey get a slap on the hand and come right back to work.\u201dStarting about six years ago, multiple women once again turned to the E.E.O.C. and lawyers. The agency opened an investigation in 2014, and that same year Mr. Hunt filed a lawsuit. Ford accelerated changes as both were unfolding. Company executives said they acted independently of the inquiry and legal action.Still, Grant Morton, a former top union official at the plant, filed a suit charging that Ford managers discouraged him from helping women submit complaints and retaliated against him when he did. His suit claimed that a senior executive told him, \u201cYour people better stop complaining.\u201d The manager denied his account.Mr. Morton reached a confidential settlement with Ford that bars him from commenting. But Mr. Crowley, who investigated complaints at the stamping plant, said his managers \u201cdidn\u2019t want to admit any wrongdoing or punish the supervisors because they didn\u2019t want to add on to the case.\u201dIn August, Ford and the E.E.O.C. announced the $10 million settlement. Because the law imposes strict confidentiality on the agency when it reaches an agreement with an employer, it does not reveal details of what it found, who those accused of harassment were and which workers were involved \u2014 something some Ford women want to know.The agreement requires more improvements at Ford, including holding managers more accountable. \u201cHow do we ensure sustainability?\u201d Ford\u2019s Mr. Dirksen said. \u201cWe have to keep asking ourselves that question.\u201dOnce again, monitors will be watching closely, this time for five years. \u201cIt\u2019s something we push for,\u201d said Julianne Bowman, the agency\u2019s Chicago district director, when \u201cwe\u2019re really trying to come up with a culture change in the company.\u201dMs. Gray does not regret taking on her employer by joining the lawsuit decades ago. \u201cIf one person doesn\u2019t stand for everybody,\u201d she said, \u201cthen it\u2019s just a continual cycle.\u201dBut this time, she said, things must be different.Many of the women back then felt betrayed by both Ford and their lawyers, and said they were pressured into giving up their jobs. Their lawyers told them Ford insisted they resign as a condition of the E.E.O.C. settlement, for an additional payment. Ford lawyers later told a judge that was optional. Ms. Gray resisted but many of the others gave up the largest paychecks they would ever earn.Ms. Dunn received $225,000 in the settlement, legal records show, but as a divorced mother raising two children, she said that was no substitute for a Ford job. In 2000, her last year there, she earned $23 an hour; at Bed Bath & Beyond, she got only one-third that pay. She worked as a home health aide at night and mowed lawns during the day, inching her way back to $17 an hour. \u201cI\u2019m 61 years old, and I cut grass for a living,\u201d she said.Ms. Dunn and the other plaintiffs were outraged to find that their lawyers had claimed one-third of their awards in addition to the $2.75 million in fees the judge had approved, so they protested. The judge accused the lawyers of deception and ordered them to return the money to the women. Several lawyers on the case, including Mr. Hunt, were disciplined. He said the fees were legal and there was no intent to mislead the judge.Workers have their own ideas about how to make lasting change in the culture \u2014 having the equivalent of undercover cops walking the factory floors, plastering signs all over the plants warning about sexual harassment, punishing Ford with a far more painful settlement than $10 million, one on the scale of a recall.Ford said it had absorbed some lessons. The company appears more willing to fire people; Ford has disciplined 27 Chicago employees for sexual harassment and terminated five managers since January 2015, Ms. Lavender said. Others have received lengthy suspensions.So far, there are some signs of progress: The proportion of complaints about harassment or gender discrimination from Chicago is now about a quarter of those reported in its domestic operations, down from half in 2015.But the company is still struggling to win workers\u2019 trust. Some women still dread coming to the plants, and cite misbehavior that continues to this day. Recently, Ford officials said they noticed a small uptick in complaints and sent reinforcements to Chicago.Women said that those accused of harassment who remain at the plants angered and worried them most; they reel off lists of men who seem untouchable.Like Chicago Assembly itself, Ms. Gray has struggled and survived.

{"Headline": "In Ohio, a Tax Bill With Uncertain Payoffs Is Met With Ambivalence", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCANTON, Ohio \u2014 The tax bill convulsing a bitterly divided Congress may seem like the ultimate high stakes political showdown in Washington. But on a rainy afternoon in a county that voted for Donald J. Trump, it feels like distant noise, an opaque battle in a faraway land whose meaning for everyday life is unknown.\u201cI heard a few things on the news, but you have trouble understanding it all,\u201d said Pat Turk, an instructor at the National Beauty College on Cleveland Avenue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will change things that much for us,\u201d she said. \u201cTaxes go up. That\u2019s what they do.\u201dFor Republicans in Washington the bill is an outsize and perhaps ungainly political bet. They are casting its passage as a matter of electoral survival \u2014 a last chance to show that the party can get something big done in President Trump\u2019s first year while it still has full control. Democrats see it as a clarifying moment when middle-class Trump voters might resent that their support for an anti-establishment billionaire has yielded budget-busting tax cuts for the rich.But in two days of interviews here in Stark County, a small patch of middle-class towns about an hour\u2019s drive south of Cleveland, there was little evidence that anybody even noticed it was happening. Few expected a tax cut to be significant enough to matter very much. Most said that other issues, like jobs that paid living wages, were more important.\u201cWe are focusing too much on this tax thing, frankly,\u201d said Gerry Noble, an electrician who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cThere are other things he could do that would be a whole lot better.\u201dStill, with midterm elections looming that will decide control of Congress, and both parties certain to try to define public opinion on the law, it is possible to get a sense of the debate to come in the barely formed reactions to the bill here. And the only thing clear is that, for now, voters are gripped by ambivalence and confusion that could yield unpredictable political results.\u201cRight now it\u2019s tough for a citizen to get his arms around it with so much noise and vitriol,\u201d said Daryl Revoldt, a North Canton City councilman. \u201cWhen the dust settles it\u2019s going to come down to two things: What does my 1040 look like and do I see economic improvement in my area?\u201dStark County voted twice for Barack Obama, and some Democrats are eager to compete here by sounding populist themes. Many feel the law will be an albatross for Republicans.Geoff Garin, a Democratic consultant advising groups on the tax debate, said his polling had found voters approximately twice as likely to say the Republican proposals favored the wealthy as to say they favored the middle class. Mr. Garin said he had detected no significant enthusiasm for slashing corporate tax rates.\u201cVoters believe that the wealthy are the primary beneficiaries of the bill, and very few voters expect that they, personally, will get much out of it,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cThe large majority of Americans don\u2019t think that either the wealthy or big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and the majority want both groups to pay more, not less.\u201dBut voters here appeared hesitant to condemn the measure mainly because it helps the rich. Cutting the corporate tax rate might help bring jobs, they said. And many middle-class conservative voters are not as angry at income inequality as Democrats want them to be.\u201cThe rich pay a hell of a lot of taxes in the country,\u201d said Mac McLaughlin, 71, a retiree. \u201cThey are bad-mouthed, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201dBut views were complicated. Many modest-income Republican voters said the use of loopholes by the rich violated a basic sense of fairness \u2014 almost as if they were stealing from the system.\u201cLower taxes for the rich, is that what they\u2019re talking about?\u201d asked Al Brancifort, a machine tool retailer who voted for Mr. Trump, as he sipped coffee with friends at a Panera Bread. He still liked Mr. Trump, and did not know enough about the tax bill to say whether he liked it. But he was angry about loopholes used by the rich.\u201cI think everyone thinks taxes should be fairer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rich should pay their fair share.\u201dBut that sentiment did not necessarily translate into thinking the rich should pay higher rates.\u201cI don\u2019t think someone who makes more money should have to pay more in taxes,\u201d said Samantha Reo, 18, a trainee at the National Beauty College. \u201cMy meal shouldn\u2019t cost more just because I make more. That\u2019s not fair.\u201dThe greater sense of anxiety and anger about the tax overhaul among Republican voters appears to stem not from concerns about economic inequality, but rather about losing specific tax deductions. And Democrats say there may be room for them to exploit the issue in educated suburban areas, where more voters rely on write-offs for local taxes, mortgage interest and tuition benefits.Mr. McLaughlin, a registered Republican, was worried about the college loan deductions for his grandson. He said he regretted voting for Mr. Trump, but not because of the tax bill. He doesn\u2019t like his style, which he called abrasive, something that bothered him from the very beginning.\u201cI thought he\u2019d get in there and get good people around him, but everybody around him seems to get fired,\u201d he said.For wavering independent voters, many of them high earners with college degrees, the bill would repeal a number of cherished tax deductions, imperiling Republican lawmakers in upscale suburban districts. If the bill would grant a degree of tax relief to many voters in places like Stark County in the short term, it does not include an eye-catching, imaginative component to persuade lower- and middle-income people that it would change their lives for the better.Mr. Noble, the electrician, said he did not expect the tax bill to help his family. But more important than a modest tax cut, he said, was for the government to be helping to create living wage jobs and training programs and thinking about how profound changes in the economy, like automation, would affect working-class people.\u201cI have no jealousy for the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right for me to be jealous of what they\u2019ve got. What is right is to try to give everyone an even shake.\u201dHenry Olsen, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, described the bill as a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for Republicans to show working-class voters that the party would champion their interests. He predicted Democrats would have an easier time demonizing the tax bill in 2018 than Republicans would have using it to stir voters.\u201cSome of them are going to see tax increases when they thought they were voting for tax cuts, and the ones who are going to see tax cuts are generally not going to see large ones,\u201d Mr. Olsen said of Republican-leaning voters. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to see who\u2019s going to be excited about it when they go to the polling booth.\u201dThat was the case for Tyler Sheets, a 24-year-old electrician in Carrollton. Every year he trudges off to H & R Block to file his taxes. It is about as fun as a trip to the dentist. But he takes it as a given \u2014 unpleasant but unchangeable. It has little to do with why he voted for Mr. Trump, or whether he will in the future.\u201cNothing has really happened to make me think, man I need my taxes reformed,\u201d he said, during a break in his electrical code class on Thursday night.There was another obstacle. He said he no longer trusted most news media sources and had given up trying to follow the debate, which seemed to come with more outrage and vitriol than he could bear. He spends time on Google before an important decision like a vote, but had pretty much tuned out day-to-day politics.\u201cUntil you came in here,\u201d he said about the bill, \u201cI never heard anybody bringing it up.\u201dMike Cammel, 48, the owner of Camellone, a pizzeria in Canton, said that between his restaurant and four children, he has had no time to look into the bill. But it seemed to arouse a vague weariness in him, a sense that Washington was a distant world that would never really change things in favor of the little guy.\u201cIt needs to change, but whether these are the right changes, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said of the tax code. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect us that much. It\u2019s going to be status quo.\u201dThe bill, which could add $1 trillion to the deficit, presents numerous risks for Republicans. But Representative Jim Renacci, a Republican who represents Stark County and voted for a version of the tax bill in the House, said he expects voters will support it.\u201cMost people back home want a tax cut and want a tax break and think Washington\u2019s taking too much of their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just concerned they\u2019re not going to get one.\u201dMs. Turk, at the beauty college, had a different view. Her daughter lives in Canada, where taxes are much higher, and she has come to appreciate the relatively lower rates in the United States. She voted for Mr. Trump, and she likes how he has been doing. But she doesn\u2019t hate taxes. She likes the services that they pay for, like schools and roads.\u201cSome people just want to fight it,\u201d she said, standing by a trainee who was learning how to do a permanent. \u201cThey say \u2018we pay too much in taxes!\u2019 That\u2019s not me. I guess I\u2019d have to say probably it\u2019s the least thing I\u2019m worried about.\u201dSabrina Tavernise reported from Canton and Alexander Burns from New York.

{"Headline": "Trump Took Office. Stocks Rose. Investors Are Still Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSome of President Trump\u2019s least controversial tweets involve him boasting about the stock market. It has certainly done well since he was elected a year ago, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 30 percent in that time.Few would have predicted a year ago that the market would do so well. Investors who had the fortitude to stay in have benefited mightily by the increase. But the wary ones put their money in more secure assets.Michael Sonnenfeldt, a New Yorker who made his fortune in real estate, is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for very wealthy people. When I talked to him last year, he revealed the uncertainty investors were facing.\u201cThe combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we\u2019ve had in our lifetime \u2014 it all adds up to many generic concerns,\u201d he said at the time.So how did the market rocket past expectations, and how should investors plan for 2018?Mr. Trump is not unique among presidents for taking credit for a strong stock market and the broader economy. Most do it, if they can \u2014 just as surely as they try to skirt responsibility when there is a slump.But the last 12 months of great returns lack the euphoria a person might expect after an increase in the Dow of nearly 30 percent.Advisers say that is because many individual investors remain afraid that the eight-year bull market is going to collapse, while others struggle to separate Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh political language from the strong fundamentals of American companies.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a year of record-low volatility, strong returns and strong macroeconomic indicators,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Sullivan, chief investment officer for international wealth management at Credit Suisse. \u201cBut politically \u2014 we\u2019re in a political recession. People have difficulty squaring the two.\u201dThe firm\u2019s global wealth report, released in November, showed that the world had grown wealthier in the last 12 months and not just at the top of the economic pyramid.\u201cThe markets are focused very much on the business cycle, which is picking up,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a positive surprise, given how badly many people would have said the economy would have fared.\u201dIn other words, the stock market is rising not because of Mr. Trump but in spite of him.\u201cOur view continues to be that politicians are not as important to investing as they would like investors to believe,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm. \u201cThat\u2019s always been our working model.\u201dMr. Bernstein said corporate fundamentals remained strong. \u201cCorporate profits remain healthy, liquidity remains abundant, and investors generally remain scared of stocks,\u201d he said.If presidential tweeting has not been driving the stock market, what should individual investors look for in equities? Analysts said investors should start by separating the political noise from the signals companies were sending out.For one, any corporate tax cut is not necessarily a short-term gain for the stock market. Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer with Eaton Vance, said a tax cut could actually result in a short-term drop in stock prices. And the companies that have been driving the stock market\u2019s growth, like health care and technology firms, will not benefit as much from a tax cut as smaller domestic companies that had not been able to take advantage of the loopholes and deductions under the current tax system.Other analysts argue that the prospect of tax cuts ceased being a factor in this rally a few months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, when he and the Republican Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cCorporate tax cuts are not priced into the market, because there is still skepticism toward the legislative process,\u201d said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.For 2018, analysts are predicting that the stock market will continue to do well but with greater swings.\u201cI always love corporate profits,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cWe can all get really geeky with these valuation measurements, but if you think about it, we have record profits growing slightly above historical rates. The Fed is tightening policy, and we\u2019re still growing. That\u2019s a pretty good recipe for equity investors.\u201dAnthony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said one difference in his strategy was a plan to use more active managers who pick stocks and to cut passively managed index funds. He said Wilmington Trust\u2019s research showed that active managers were outperforming the market as a whole.Or put another way: The skill that an active manager has is valuable in an environment when tweets about politics and people rattle less sophisticated investors.Today, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, he and the 580 members of Tiger 21, who have an average net worth of about $100 million, have nearly three-quarters of their money in private equity, real estate and publicly traded stocks.Over the last year, he said, the group\u2019s concern has not been with the political environment but with interest rates and wondering how long they will stay as low at they are. The group remains bullish on the advantages that American businesses have, like lower energy and transportation costs, over competitors in other countries.So what could end the stock market\u2019s run?CTBC Bank USA put that question to affluent investors in California, New Jersey and New York, all blue states that would be affected by a loss of deductions for state and property taxes. The poll found that they remained confident about the economic and investment landscape, but that they feared a political threat like a conflict with North Korea or a large terrorist attack in the United States.\u201cThe only thing we worry about is this geopolitical risk,\u201d said Noor Menai, president and chief executive of CTBC Bank USA. \u201cNothing gets amplified. Markets take it in stride.\u201dYet Mr. Menai said seasoned financial services professionals and institutional investors had a distinct advantage over individual investors.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through three crises over the past 25 years, and each time the market has reconstructed itself,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, the insiders such as me have come to understand what the hype is versus what can happen.\u201dBut individual investors do not have that knowledge. They still get scared about investing in a rising stock market because they fear it\u2019s going to collapse. When that happens, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, she asks clients to focus on what they can control.For example, if they are near retirement and cannot weather a 20 or 30 percent drop in their assets, she said, they should invest more conservatively.\u201cThere is anxiety and uncertainty about the political climate, but my sense is people are looking at their personal situation and asking how is all of this going to impact them,\u201d she said. And that, she said, can be summed up in one question: \u201cHow long can this bull market last?\u201dI\u2019ll bet you won\u2019t find that answer in a tweet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank, Lagging Behind Counterparts, Faces Eventful 2018", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A lot is happening in the world of central banks.It could be a watershed. The central bank\u2019s own economists substantially raised their estimates for eurozone growth, portending an end to the crisis measures that have been in place in the 19-nation common currency area since 2008. That would usher in a new era, with monetary policy returning to normal and the central bank beginning to gently push up interest rates.Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference on Thursday revolved around how soon the stimulus measures might end. While he said there has been \u201ca significant improvement in the growth outlook,\u201d he steadfastly avoided any statements that would change investor expectations. Still, Mr. Draghi offered a few clues about the central bank\u2019s evolving views.Here are some of the key takeaways.The Governing Council did not change its stance on Thursday, repeating that it can step up the stimulus measures at any time if the eurozone economy starts to flag. That\u2019s a sign that interest rate increases are still far in the future.But some members of the Governing Council have been suggesting that the bank should move more quickly. Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, said last month that he hoped the need for central bank bond buying would have run its course by September.Mr. Draghi declined to make any similar statements Thursday. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any change in the language or intentions,\u201d he said.The eurozone economy is humming. In new estimates published Thursday, the European Central Bank\u2019s economists said economic growth would accelerate to 2.3 percent in 2018. That compares to their estimate in September of 1.8 percent.At the same time, the central bank economists predict that inflation \u2014 the figure that influences central bank policy the most \u2014 will remain well below the official target of 2 percent through 2020. That is yet another sign the bank is in no hurry to begin raising interest rates.Mr. Draghi betrayed some concern Thursday about what will happen when the central bank is no longer flooding the eurozone with cash. He acknowledged that very low interest rates can lead to asset bubbles.\u201cThe ground is fertile for these risks,\u201d he said. But he added that evidence of overexuberant prices for real estate or other assets seem to be limited to a few local areas which are not a threat to the eurozone as a whole. \u201cWe are not seeing systemically important financial stability risks,\u201d he said.The European Central Bank exercises strong influence over interest rates in the eurozone but it is also at the mercy of financial markets, which react to a host of forces \u2014 not the least of which is what the Fed is doing.In effect, the European Central Bank is moving at a speed different from that of its two most important counterparts, even though their economies are closely intertwined. Currency exchange rates, for example, react strongly to central bank policy and have far-reaching economic consequences, determining how much people must pay for imported goods and also how cheaply companies can sell their products abroad.In fact, the euro spiked briefly as Mr. Draghi spoke Thursday but then retreated.Mr. Draghi said, in essence, that each central bank has to do its own thing depending on where its economy is. He said he hasn\u2019t detected any sign that the Fed\u2019s rate increases are hurting Europe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any effect.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Victims of the California Wildfires: Avocados and Lemons", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "The largest of the fires has damaged a portion of the harvest in the country\u2019s most productive region for both crops.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The fire that rampaged through the Brokaw Ranch in Ventura County last week was fast, furious and unstoppable, driven by winds gusting at 70 miles an hour.Flames raced through the chaparral, setting ablaze 60-foot-tall trees whose burning embers flew into the heart of the avocado orchard.\u201cWe lost about 80 percent of our avocado crop,\u201d said Ellen Brokaw, whose family farms 200 acres in Santa Paula and supplies restaurants and national supermarket chains.It is too early to know the full extent of the damage because much of the wildfire zone is still closed off or enveloped in haze. The fire is capricious and, as with the structures that it damaged, its flames often hurtle through one stretch of land while jumping over an adjacent plot.Avocado orchards are particularly vulnerable: They line hillsides, which were in the path of the fire, and their dropped leaves collect on the ground, providing perfect tinder.Lemon groves tend to be located on flatter ground, and the trees do not shed their leaves. But they were battered by the same winds that spread the fires, blowing loose or badly scarring the fruit. Lemons cannot be sold once they have hit the ground, and damaged lemons suffer in quality and value.\u201cIt will take days, weeks or longer to assess the loss,\u201d said John Krist, chief executive of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. \u201cWhat we know is, there\u2019s a lot of fruit on the ground.\u201dConsumers are unlikely to see a surge in the price of avocados from the fire because most avocados bought in the United States are grown in Mexico. A spike in lemon prices is unlikely to occur even though Ventura County produces more than 40 percent of the national output, Mr. Krist said, because any lost crop can be made up by increasing imports.Still, the wildfires happened just before some growers planned to start harvesting their avocados and lemons. And farmers who are relieved their entire crop was not wiped out are still worried about having enough workers when they will need them later in the season, because it is still unclear how many people lost their homes.\u201cEverything has been thrown up in the air,\u201d said Lisa Churchill, who grows avocados and specialty tangerines, like the pixie variety, in the Ojai Valley. Ms. Churchill said she believes she lost about half of her avocado crop and about 20 percent of her mandarins. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what impact this will have on our ability to put together a crew,\u201d she said.Many farmers said the devastation would have been considerably worse were it not for the workers on the front lines, frenetically spraying water from hoses and small water tanks mounted on their backs. Sometimes workers resorted to shoveling sand onto smoldering vegetation.Some 36,000 farmworkers, the majority of them immigrants, work in Ventura County. About nine out of 10 farmworkers in the area are illegally in the country, according to independent estimates.One Mexican worker, who gave only his first name, Fermin, evacuated his wife and 5-year-old daughter from their trailer park, then went to the farm where he works.\u201cThe fire was all around us, and I felt despair and sadness for my boss and the land as I saw it approaching,\u201d Fermin explained in Spanish during a break from clearing debris and repairing melted pipes.Fermin and his co-workers fought the blaze until firefighters arrived and ordered them to leave. He and others were back on the job at sunrise the next morning, according to his supervisor, Mike Sullivan, who manages several hundred acres of orchards for ranchers in the area.In southern Florida, tomato growers have faced delays and lower early yields because of the storm. And destruction to worker housing forced many field hands to double up in available units, according to Julia Perkins of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a labor-rights group.Thanks to its mild climate and rich soil, Ventura County produces a variety of crops all year. In the plains around Oxnard, Calif., the vast strawberry fields have been spared from the fires. But thousands of immigrants toiling in the fields initially lacked masks to protect them from the thick, acrid smoke that wafted across the county.Volunteers have descended on the fields to hand out masks since last week. \u201cWe have been moving mask distributors up and down the coast,\u201d said Lucas Zucker, policy director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, known as Cause.The California Strawberry Commission has urged workers to wear masks, and some growers have distributed them. One 44-year-old farmworker from Mexico who gave his name as Alfonzo said he worked without a proper mask before Cause gave him one. \u201cMy throat was aching, but I have my family to support and the rent to pay,\u201d said Alfonzo, who earns $10.50 an hour in the fields.Ventura County growers are used to Santa Ana winds, and many have lost crops before, mainly to frost. But they said they were surprised to see wildfires so close to the ocean and so late in the year, which highlights the severity of a yearslong drought.\u201cThis is a complete game-changer for a lot of us,\u201d said Leslie Leavens, a fourth-generation farmer whose family grows avocados and lemons on 800 acres in Ventura Country.As for Ms. Brokaw, she said she was confident that the majority of her trees would survive, even if there are barely any avocados for her to sell this year. \u201cThe orchard can be rejuvenated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are committed to this, long-term.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Houston is one of the nation\u2019s biggest and fastest growing regions, as well as one of its most affordable. The difference between Houston and the Bay Area, of course, is that Houston continues to sprawl outward \u2014 as do Atlanta, Phoenix and every other growing, affordable city.As the population grows, Mr. Romem said, there are three choices for how to accommodate more people. One is the Houston method: Keep growing outward. The second is the Bay Area method: Slow down sprawl while leaving existing neighborhoods alone, raising prices and pushing lower-earning households out of state. (In other words, slow growth by forcing people to move to Houston.)The third is what no U.S. city has yet accomplished: Grow upward and in place. This route is certainly possible, but, as my story on Berkeley shows, it requires a wholesale rethinking of how cities look.

Then take the money and put it toward people who have been left behind economically and causes that can help them.This tax bill officially makes us all data in a grand experiment on how big changes in tax incentives influence behavior and alter the economy. If nothing else, we should be deliberate and specific in how we want to be counted.Whatever you decide, declare your intentions on Twitter over the weekend using the #GiveItBack hashtag. I\u2019ll be following along.Meanwhile, here\u2019s more on how to do the giving.There is plenty of reason to believe that many large public companies won\u2019t give it back to workers. Their executives work for shareholders after all, so the default reflex may well be to use winnings from the new, lower corporate tax rates to buy back shares or do other things that will lift stock prices directly and immediately.If you\u2019re among the top earners, your tax winnings may be enough to tip the scales toward buying or replacing a car sooner than you might have otherwise. Buying an automobile is a relatively rare opportunity to make an outsize economic impact, given how much cars cost.Do you believe that the quality of American cars has finally caught up to those made by foreign companies? Buying one in 2018 that was made in America will let you play your part in moving the economic needle a bit. Don\u2019t want an American car? Perhaps you can support an American worker by purchasing a car that was still made here, like a Honda Accord or a Toyota Highlander.Any extra money, no matter your income, also presents an opportunity to spend more and more selectively on services. That new local restaurant that buys local food and employs local workers and pays rent to a local landlord? Perhaps you could treat yourself to dinner there a few times with your tax winnings, instead of buying imported food from a grocery store owned by an international conglomerate.Before you consider which charities you might want to give your newfound tax winnings, you\u2019ll probably think about a tax change that could affect philanthropy directly: the increase in the standard deduction. Now that it\u2019s going up, people who will no longer itemize deductions, including charitable contributions, may feel less incentive to give as much as they used to.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, lost his cool on Twitter in recent days over suggestions that the new tax law might fundamentally alter Americans\u2019 giving. I offered him the opportunity to take a pledge to give back his tax winnings but received no reply. Crickets also chirped when I asked for pledges from Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, Senator Susan Collins of Maine and President Trump, all of whom also supported the tax bill, via their representatives.I do hope Senator Cornyn is right about one thing: that we don\u2019t give merely or even primarily for the tax break. If you agree and are lucky enough not to need your tax winnings for yourself, perhaps you can find a way to support a cause that helps people who have been left behind by the improving American economy for whatever reason. Please note, however, that if you want to use the money to try to run your least favorite politician out of office, your campaign contributions are not tax deductible even if you are still able to itemize your charitable donations.Automating your contributions is a good way to capture your tax winnings, especially if those winnings are small enough that they\u2019ll add up to only double-digit dollar figures each paycheck that you might otherwise fritter away. Or if you\u2019re a beneficiary of the stock buybacks I mentioned above, consider giving away appreciated shares. That way, you get a deduction if you still itemize plus you avoid possible capital gains taxes on the increase in value.Meanwhile, think about what difference you hope to make with your tax winnings, if any. Then #GiveItBack if you possibly can.Natalie Kitroeff contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Company Actually Plans to Spend Its Tax Cut Money", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORO GRANDE, Calif. \u2014 Republicans have pitched their tax plan as an economic godsend that will offer deliverance from middling growth and set off a torrent of investment, hiring and raises. But at a quarry here in Southern California\u2019s high desert, the outcome doesn\u2019t look so straightforward.The pit of rock belongs to CalPortland, which mines limestone to create the cement that goes into some of the country\u2019s most iconic stadiums and hotels. The company would hardly object to keeping a chunk of profits that currently goes to the government. But the extra cash probably wouldn\u2019t be enough for CalPortland to expand immediately in ways requiring serious hiring.\u201cTen percent extra profit would be good,\u201d said Steven Regis, a senior vice president for corporate services at the company. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to fund big projects.\u201dLike executives across the country, Mr. Regis has spent the last few weeks scouring the House and Senate tax proposals for signs of hope for his industry \u2014 and new sources of pain.Mr. Regis\u2019s deliberations suggest why those executives \u2014 especially at manufacturers like CalPortland, the companies at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for the economy \u2014 may have muted expectations.Many welcome tax savings, but each industry and company will make different calculations about whether and how to spend that money. Much will depend on what customers and suppliers do and, of course, on the vicissitudes of the American economy.\u201cYou always have competing interests for that cash,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cDo you pay dividends? Do you buy new equipment? Do you buy out competitors? Do you add employees? Do you pay employees better?\u201dMany CalPortland drivers are unionized, and he expects a tax cut to produce demands for the wage increases that Republican sponsors said the tax plan would generate. Mr. Regis said he would like to oblige, but wasn\u2019t sure which of the company\u2019s priorities would win out.Mr. Regis, who says he \u201cleans to the right,\u201d said he believed in the economic logic of cutting corporate taxes to 20 percent from 35 percent. Yet he\u2019s worried about how the Republicans in Congress are pushing through their tax bills, quickly and without the support of Democrats. Can a business count on the provisions of a law that the other side might try to rewrite in a couple of years?\u201cI think it\u2019s bad news for the country to have one side make the rules,\u201d Mr. Regis said. \u201cIt was bad when they passed the health care bill; it\u2019s bad now if they pass the tax bill.\u201dThe uncertainty is particularly frustrating for a company like CalPortland, since its biggest spending commitments often have to be made far in advance. And the tax bills have fleeting components, like the idea of allowing companies to take the entire cost of equipment off their taxable income the year they start using it. In the House bill, that provision expires after five years. In the Senate version, it phases out gradually after five years and ends by the 10th year, 2027.In Washington, five or 10 years may be a lifetime. But CalPortland probably could not even get the permits for a new cement plant in that amount of time. The company, Mr. Regis noted, is not popping out iPhones \u2014 it is blowing up rocks in the desert.Workers at its quarry in Southern California blast limestone out of the ground once a week. They then load it into trucks, crush it, combine it with other minerals and heat it to 3,000 degrees in a giant kiln until it rains down like lava into a cooler.After being ground up, the cement that emerges travels to concrete plants, which operate a bit like massive bakeries \u2014 whipping the powder together with sand, more rock and water to form concrete. By law, the company has just 90 minutes to move that mud from one of its 100 concrete plants into the foundation of a building. CalPortland\u2019s proprietary mix has gone into the Hoover Dam, Los Angeles City Hall and the football stadium being built for the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers.Ryan Montgomery, whose father and grandfather worked here in Oro Grande, spends most days scooping limestone into a dump truck. \u201cIt may get a little bumpy,\u201d he says, before breaching a wall of boulders that shakes his cab, perched a healthy 30 feet from the ground.His loader \u2014 a sunflower yellow Caterpillar vehicle with an arm attached to an oversize shovel \u2014 costs $2.3 million. Replacing a pair of tires is a $50,000 expense, and the transmission goes for $130,000. The company leased the vehicle from a bank.Quicker expensing for tax purposes would not prompt CalPortland to make an upfront purchase of Mr. Montgomery\u2019s loader.\u201cGetting the money back faster definitely helps, but that\u2019s big money, and that big investment means we have to be able to have the cash or the financing available,\u201d Mr. Regis said. The company is slowly replenishing its bank account after six years \u2014 from 2008 to 2014, a period bridging a housing bust and a fragile economy \u2014 in which it did not turn a profit.On the rise once more, CalPortland is making new bets on its future that will take years to pan out. The company is planning, for example, to buy new equipment that will wash clay and dust off rocks so they can eventually be turned into concrete and asphalt.But regulatory permits for such a project, covering everything from land use to pollution, can take four years to materialize. Then, CalPortland has to buy and build the washers and crushers, which can take another year or so. By then, the House bill\u2019s five-year window for immediate expensing will have closed.\u201cIt takes businesses time to plan and time to envision and time to start building,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation, an independent group that typically finds tax cuts an economic boon. The foundation expects that making fast expensing permanent will stimulate growth. \u201cWhen the provision expires,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said, \u201cthe positive effects in the first years would go away.\u201dAnother sticking point for CalPortland is that the tax bills tie the amount of interest that companies can deduct to a measure of their earnings. For now, the threshold is high enough that it wouldn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s borrowing \u2014 it finances much of its spending with debt because the tools it needs are so costly. But Mr. Regis said he is worried that introducing any limit opens the door to further restrictions down the line, or even bigger changes, especially if the Republicans lose control of Congress.That is not to say the company won\u2019t make some shorter-term use of the extra cash \u2014 most likely to buy concrete trucks to augment and eventually replace an older fleet in the Northwest. That would also mean hiring two dozen new drivers, but they would stay on in the long term only if orders remain strong.That will be up to big builders like Turner Construction Company, one of its most voracious customers and a giant in the industry.Turner is optimistic about the future, but not because of lower taxes. \u201cOn the list of 200 things we worry about, that would be No. 300 right now,\u201d said Michael Kuntz, an executive vice president at Turner, which recently built the Wilshire Grand Hotel in Los Angeles \u2014 the tallest building west of the Mississippi. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonissue for us.\u201dConstruction is going gangbusters everywhere, Mr. Kuntz added, and the company already has billions in projects on its books for in 2018. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that the 35 percent corporate rate has held anyone back from building,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australian Tried to Sell Missile Parts for North Korea, Police Say", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The federal police said Sunday that they had arrested an Australian man who was charged with acting as an economic agent for North Korea by trying to help the isolated country sell its missile parts and other military technology abroad.The man, Chan Han Choi, 59, was arrested on Saturday in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood, where he lives. The police accused him of violating both United Nations sanctions and Australian law by attempting to conduct trade deals on behalf of North Korea \u2014 the first time such charges have been filed in Australia.The arrest comes as tensions in the region have risen over a series of North Korean nuclear and missile tests, which have defied international sanctions aimed at curtailing the weapons programs.Speaking to reporters, Neil Gaughan, the assistant commissioner for the Australian Federal Police, said Mr. Choi was charged with trying to broker the sale of missile components, including software for the guidance of ballistic missiles, and other unspecified North Korean military expertise to \u201cinternational entities,\u201d which he did not identify.He also said Mr. Choi was \u201cdiscussing the supply of weapons of mass destruction,\u201d in reference to the attempted sale of the missile components described by the police.Mr. Choi was a naturalized Australian citizen who had lived in the country for more than 30 years, the police said. They did not elaborate, but some Australian news media reports said he was born in South Korea.\u201cWe think he\u2019s acting as an economic agent on behalf of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Gaughan said at a news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s doing it out of a patriotic purpose. I think at the end of the day, he\u2019d sell whatever he could to make money back for the North Korean government.\u201dThe police said evidence suggested that Mr. Choi had been in \u201ccontact with high-ranking officials in North Korea\u201d but would not comment further.Mr. Choi was also charged with attempting to sell North Korean coal in countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the police said, adding that there was no evidence of involvement by those countries\u2019 governments or officials. Such sales would violate international sanctions aimed at cutting off North Korea from the global economy.The investigation started this year after the police received information from a foreign law enforcement partner about a different matter.After months of \u201ccareful and methodical\u201d investigation, the police said, they uncovered evidence that led them to believe that Mr. Choi was working to generate income for the North Korean government from abroad as recently as this year.If he is found guilty, Mr. Choi could face up to 10 years in prison.\u201cHe seems to be a fellow traveler willing to take the risk to try and exploit whatever loopholes exist with surveillance and sanctions,\u201d said Euan Graham, the director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute. \u201cIt means the North Koreans are still trying to access whatever componentry they can, even in a high-risk country like Australia.\u201dFor years, North Korea has found ways to skirt sanctions to obtain technology and earn hard currency by selling not just weapons but also counterfeit money and drugs.North Korea no longer has an embassy in Australia in part because of one such moneymaking mission gone wrong: In 2003, the Pong Su, a North Korean cargo ship that ran aground on an Australian beach, was found to be filled with about 275 pounds of heroin. The crew was arrested and later deported, and the North Korean embassy closed five years later.Mr. Gaughan, the police official, called Mr. Choi\u2019s arrest a sign of Australia\u2019s commitment to upholding international sanctions on North Korea.\u201cThis investigation shows that the United Nations and Australian sanctions will be rigorously enforced in Australia,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Trump a Blessing or Curse for Religious Conservatives?", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsHow are religious conservatives doing in the polarizing and often stumbling presidency of Donald Trump? Ross Douthat, a Times columnist, hosts a \u201cround table\u201d with David French, a senior writer at National Review, and John Zmirak, senior editor of The Stream and author, most recently, of \u201cThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Catholicism.\u201dA year in, Trump has delivered on many of his specific promises, particularly where judicial appointments are concerned. At the same time, there\u2019s a great deal of angst within religious circles about what his personal moral defects and his administration\u2019s deep unpopularity mean for Christian cultural witness, and (among evangelicals, especially) whether the Trump era is setting up a kind of generational schism that will contribute to institutional Christianity\u2019s crisis going forward.David, you\u2019re a prominent anti-Trump evangelical. John, you\u2019ve been a fairly consistently pro-Trump Catholic. Can you each give me your view of what the Trump presidency has meant for religious conservatism?What we saw in 2016 is that a small group of \u201crespectable\u201d ministers or lobbyists no longer has the power to \u201cdeliver\u201d Christian voters. And I think that\u2019s a good, healthy thing. It gives us more leverage, as we seem to have with Trump.Furthermore, and I have this from pastors who met with Trump for many hours: He genuinely listens to them. They\u2019re the kind of people most playboys from Queens never encounter. He connected with some of them personally. He saw their concern for his soul. And he took and takes their concerns seriously.Trump sees that the church is a big part of what made America great, and he sees that the state persecution that President Obama began hurts the country. I hope that he sees more, sees Christ as his savior. But in his role as Caesar, protecting our rights is quite enough.I belong to the camp of Christians who are grateful when Trump makes good decisions but also quite mindful that our political witness is inseparable from our Christian witness. Thus, we have no option but to condemn his worst impulses and work to counteract his toxic influence on our larger culture. While policy positions are important (though Trump\u2019s real impact is often vastly overblown), a nation is ultimately shaped far more by its culture than its policies, and we can never forsake the greater power for the lesser win.We supported Constantine, and Harry Truman, and many other imperfect men who were better than the alternatives. I don\u2019t even expect saintly behavior of popes, much less of presidents. If the circumstances in which God saw fit to place us make us choose between the \u201csqueaky clean\u201d persecutor of the unborn and the Little Sisters of the Poor, or between Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the choice is obvious. If we pick the persecutor because he pleases us more aesthetically, better fits our internal self-image, then we will answer for that on the Day of Judgment.The Hollywood that was howling for Trump\u2019s head over the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, we now know, had been mopping up for Harvey Weinstein for decades. I don\u2019t expect Christians to be na\u00efve or prissy. We know more about sin than most people, since we believe it in fact exists. And can be repented.However, for the sake of encouraging or even achieving these policy wins, Christians cannot be seen to excuse lies, rationalize incompetence or impose double standards. A person can simultaneously say that Trump has accomplished good things while also seeking to hold him to a proper standard of conduct. My great disappointment during this first year of the Trump presidency is not with evangelicals who have rightly lauded, say, the Neil Gorsuch appointment, but rather with Christians who\u2019ve defended, rationalized and excused conduct they\u2019d never, ever condone in a Democrat. There are not two standards of morality depending on judicial appointments or regulatory reform.In Syria, Trump aided the Kurdish militias allied with Syrian Christians. Now instead of a massive catastrophe for an ancient Christian community, there are Christmas trees going up in Damascus again. Christian pastors in America who helped Trump during the campaign have been keeping Trump apprised of the real-world, on the ground concerns of Syrian Christians. None of that happened under Bush.I don\u2019t think the savage hatred of Donald Trump is mostly driven by his genuine excesses. Trump is serving as a catalyst to expose just how unhinged, anti-Christian, anti-Western, and frankly anti-rational the dominant factions on the left have become.Many of us, however, looked at these accommodations and asked a simple question. Where is your faith? Christians were acting as if not just the nation \u2014 but the church itself \u2014 was in peril based on the outcome of a single election. Yet is God not sovereign over all the nations, including our own? Doesn\u2019t scripture repeatedly condemn the exact kinds of moral compromises that so many Christians made? Don\u2019t we believe those scriptures?There is nothing more dangerous to the church than a lack of faith. I don\u2019t at all mind it when Christians cheer the good things that Donald Trump has done. I join them. I do mind when they rationalize and excuse bad acts out of a completely misguided and faithless sense of cultural and political necessity.Ross Douthat is a New York Times columnist.

An election-eve political rally had become an emotional family gathering where all were in agreement.Speaker after speaker rose to proclaim what the crowd already believed: Corsica\u2019s nationalists would win big in territorial elections on Sunday, they were unstoppable, and the mainland had better take notice.But whether or not the French government is ignoring the Corsican movement at its own peril, the reaction from Paris has been virtually uniform: Nothing.There are few headlines in the French press, no statements from the French government, nothing to indicate there is much concern.Corsica, with its strong indigenous culture and language, closer to the Italians who ruled it for centuries than to the French, has always had an ambivalent relationship to the mainland. Over the decades, Paris has cultivated a policy of purse-lipped silence, punctuated by irritation, faced with the island\u2019s demands for more autonomy.Yet Sunday\u2019s first round of elections to the territorial assembly in Corsica is predicted to be a crowning moment for over 40 years of Corsican nationalism.In that time, the nationalist movement has passed through all the classic stages: anti-government violence, the political consolidation of \u201cautonomists\u201d and \u201cindependantists,\u201d and now likely electoral victory for the combined P\u00e9 a Corsica (For Corsica) list of nationalists in a newly created, more powerful assembly.Such a victory would be the second in a row for the nationalists, who first came to power in 2015, and now seem set to consolidate their hold.\u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten nothing about taking our country out of the night into which France has plunged us!\u201d the nationalist leader Jean-Guy Talamoni threatened on Wednesday to the fervent and youthful crowd in this university town, high up in the vertiginous Corsican mountains.Mr. Talamoni, president of the Corsican assembly, believes independence is the restive Mediterranean island\u2019s destiny and speaks proudly of going to Barcelona \u201ca few times a year.\u201dThe French government has shown no sign of fearing a domino effect set off by Catalonia, even though Mr. Macron\u2019s own party appears to be trailing the nationalists in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s vote.The nationalist rallies are packed. Even Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front \u2014 she took Corsica in the first round of presidential voting last spring \u2014 struggles to attract sympathizers.Even so, Mr. Talamoni recognizes that an immediate referendum on independence would be a non-starter in Corsica, with its weak, tourism-dependent economy.\u201cWe\u2019ve been impoverished by the policies that they\u201d \u2014 meaning Paris \u2014 \u201chave imposed,\u201d said Mr. Talamoni, who doubles as a literature professor at the university, in an interview at a cafe here.Corsicans will likely vote for the nationalists, \u201cbut they won\u2019t vote for independence until they are assured of material stability,\u201d said Mr. Talamoni, a pensive stubble-faced expert on Pascal Paoli, the 18th-century hero of Corsican independence, whose experiment in constitutional government influenced contemporary Americans.Still, the lack of reaction from the mainland is intensely frustrating to the nationalist leaders here, spurring them to redouble their campaign efforts so that Paris will notice a large victory.For nearly four decades, the conflict has been marked by bombings, shootings, hundreds of arrests, and \u201cblue nights\u201d when police lights illuminated the wild Corsican maquis, as the island\u2019s fragrant scrub is called.Now, it seems, there will be ballot-box validation. Could the result of it all be no more than a yawn from Paris? It seems so.\u201cIt\u2019s not indifference, it\u2019s hostility,\u201d said Gilles Simeoni, head of Corsica\u2019s executive council, and leader of the nationalists\u2019 \u201cautonomist\u201d wing.An ex-mayor of one of the island\u2019s two major cities, Bastia, Mr. Simeoni is the former lawyer for Yvan Colonna, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of a government-appointed prefect, Claude Erignac.The killing was considered the gravest act of anti-state violence in the four-decade conflict. To this day the nationalists regard Mr. Colonna as a \u201cpolitical\u201d prisoner\u201d \u2014 a category not recognized on the mainland.\u201cThere\u2019s no room for demands like ours in the French framework,\u201d Mr. Simeoni said.Those demands \u2014 more fiscal autonomy, control over the island\u2019s education system, a greater say in developing the underpopulated, impoverished interior \u2014 seem very far from being realized, for now. \u201cThe state is silent and paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Simeoni said.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018At least when we had bombs, they listened to us,\u2019 \u201c Mr. Simeoni said, only half joking. Some 30 militants remain in French prisons, he said.Mr. Simeoni is credited with pulling in centrist voters by giving the nationalists a moderate face, and ending the patronage and clientelism that had dominated the island\u2019s politics for decades.\u201cThere\u2019s been a \u2018massification\u2019 of nationalism, it\u2019s a nationalism that is now inclusive,\u201d said Thierry Dominici, a Corsica expert at the University of Bordeaux. \u201cEveryone seems to be able to recognize themselves in it. And all the state can do is acknowledge this.\u201dHe called Mr. Simeoni the \u201cCorsican Macron, Macron with Corsican sauce\u201d for having marginalized the traditional political parties.But Mr. Simeoni, at the rally here this week, was careful to pay tribute to the militants who sustained the movement for years, implicitly saluting those who planted the bombs and blew up the villas of the \u201ccontinentals.\u201dSome were in the audience listening to him, like a grizzled, pony-tailed 65-year-old nurse named Dum\u00e9, who said he was proud of all the houses he had brought down (and did not want his full name used because of it).\u201cSure, we did a lot against the colonizers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur slogan was, \u201cFrench Get Out!\u201d\u2019 \u2014 a slogan still scribbled in Corsican on the walls of the university here, \u201cIFF,\u201d I Francesi Fora.\u201cWe were impregnated with that struggle,\u201d Dum\u00e9 said. That night\u2019s rally at Corte was \u201ca lot of emotion for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows that 40 years of struggle were not in vain.\u201dThe crowds at these nationalist rallies are varied, from ex-bankers to wine growers to roadway maintenance workers to teachers. But in striking contrast to the National Front rally crowd, there are many young as well.Their presence bolsters the argument of the nationalist leaders that their politics represents a wave Paris will have to reckon with in the years to come.\u201cThey have all the young people behind them,\u201d said Alexandra Bischof, a 22-year-old communications student at the rally in Corte. \u201cThey incarnate Corsica, and they incarnate the future.\u201d\u201cSure I\u2019m for independence,\u201d she added. \u201cI want to be free. To no longer be French. We\u2019re Corsican. We\u2019re not French, not at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great American Single-Family Home Problem", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "Building more housing, more densely, could help address a widespread economic challenge. A fight over one lot in Berkeley, Calif., shows how tough that could be.Supported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 The house at 1310 Haskell Street does not look worthy of a bitter neighborhood war. The roof is rotting, the paint is chipping, and while the lot is long and spacious, the backyard has little beyond overgrown weeds and a garage sprouting moss.The owner was known for hoarding junk and feeding cats, and when she died three years ago the neighbors assumed that whoever bought the house would be doing a lot of work. But when the buyer turned out to be a developer, and when that developer floated a proposal to raze the building and replace it with a trio of small homes, the neighborhood erupted in protest.Most of the complaints were what you might hear about any development. People thought the homes would be too tall and fretted that more residents would mean fewer parking spots.Other objections were particular to Berkeley \u2014 like a zoning board member\u2019s complaint that shadows from the homes might hurt the supply of locally grown food.Whatever the specifics, what is happening in Berkeley may be coming soon to a neighborhood near you. Around the country, many fast-growing metropolitan areas are facing a brutal shortage of affordable places to live, leading to gentrification, homelessness, even disease. As cities struggle to keep up with demand, they have remade their skylines with condominium and apartment towers \u2014 but single-family neighborhoods, where low-density living is treated as sacrosanct, have rarely been part of the equation.If cities are going to tackle their affordable housing problems, economists say, that is going to have to change. But how do you build up when neighbors want down?\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous problem, and it impacts the very course of America\u2019s future,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard who studies cities.Even though the Haskell Street project required no alterations to Berkeley\u2019s zoning code, it took the developer two years and as many lawsuits to get approval. He plans to start building next year. The odyssey has become a case study in how California dug itself into a vast housing shortage \u2014 a downside, in part, of a thriving economy \u2014 and why the State Legislature is taking power from local governments to solve it.Mary Trew, a retired graphic designer who fought the project, drew the same conclusion with a different spin: \u201cMunicipalities are losing their authority.\u201dThe affordable-housing crunch is a nationwide problem, but California is the superlative. The state\u2019s median home price, at just over $500,000, is more than twice the national level and up about 60 percent from five years ago, according to Zillow. It affects the poor, the rich and everyone in between.The problem is that smaller and generally more affordable quarters like duplexes and small apartment buildings, where young families get their start, are being built at a slower rate. Such projects hold vast potential to provide lots of housing \u2014 and reduce sprawl \u2014 by adding density to the rings of neighborhoods that sit close to job centers but remain dominated by larger lots and single-family homes.Neighborhoods in which single-family homes make up 90 percent of the housing stock account for a little over half the land mass in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles metropolitan areas, according to Issi Romem, BuildZoom\u2019s chief economist. There are similar or higher percentages in virtually every American city, making these neighborhoods an obvious place to tackle the affordable-housing problem.\u201cSingle-family neighborhoods are where the opportunity is, but building there is taboo,\u201d Mr. Romem said. As long as single-family-homeowners are loath to add more housing on their blocks, he said, the economic logic will always be undone by local politics.California is trying to change that. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a sweeping package with 15 new bills designed to tame rental costs and speed construction.\u201cWe can\u2019t just plan for growth, we have to actually build,\u201d said Ben Metcalf, director of the California Department of Housing and Community Development.But the bigger, thornier question is where all these new residences will go, and how hard neighbors will try to prevent them. The Haskell Street fight shows why passing laws is one thing and building is another, but also gives a glimpse of what the denser neighborhoods of the future might look like \u2014 and why lots of little buildings are more important than a few skyscrapers.The 1300 block of Haskell Street sits in a kind of transition zone between the taller buildings in downtown Berkeley and the low-rise homes scattered through the eastern hills. The neighborhood has a number of single-family homes, and the street is quiet and quasi-suburban, but there are also apartment buildings and backyard cottages that nod to the city\u2019s denser core.A little under three years ago, a contractor named Christian Szilagy bought the property and presented the city with a proposal to demolish the house and replace it with three skinny and rectangular homes that would extend through the lot. Each would have one parking spot, a garden and about 1,500 square feet of living space.On paper, at least, there was nothing wrong with the proposal. The city\u2019s zoning code designates the area as \u201cR2-A,\u201d or a mixed-density area with apartments as well as houses.Berkeley\u2019s planning staff recommended approval. But as neighbors wrote letters, called the city and showed up at meetings holding signs that said \u201cProtect Our Community\u201d and \u201cReject 1310 Haskell Permit!,\u201d the project quickly became politicized.One focal point was Kurt Caudle\u2019s garden. Mr. Caudle is a brewpub manager who lives in a small house on the back side of Ms. Trew\u2019s property (that lot has two homes, or one fewer than was proposed next door). Just outside his back door sits an oasis from the city: a quiet garden where he has a small Buddha statue and grows tomatoes, squash and greens in raised beds that he built.\u201cWhen you completely shadow all of the open space,\u201d Ms. Hahn said during a hearing, \u201cyou really impact the ability for anybody to possibly grow food in this community.\u201dHome prices in the ZIP code surrounding the 1300 block of Haskell Street have just about doubled over the past five years, to an average of about $900,000, according to Zillow. Those numbers are terrifying to people like L.C. Stephens, 67, who is retired from the state corrections department.Mr. Stephens pays $1,600 to live in a modest apartment complex that was built in 1963 and sits just a few lots down from the project site. His building was recently purchased by investors and is being painted and renovated. The rehabilitated units go for $2,400 and up.\u201cPeople are getting priced out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about \u2018We need more housing.\u2019 Yeah, we can use it, but it needs to be affordable.\u201dThe proposed homes are not that. They are estimated to sell for around $1 million. But this is an illustration of the economist\u2019s argument that more housing will lower prices. The cost of a rehabilitated single-family home in the area \u2014 which is what many of the neighbors preferred to see on the lot \u2014 runs to $1.4 million or more.\u201cThis issue is bigger than Haskell Street,\u201d Mr. Arreguin said. \u201cThis project sets a precedent for what I believe is out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods throughout the city of Berkeley.\u201dThe city\u2019s denial won applause from the crowd. It also drew a lawsuit.Not-in-my-backyard activism has been a fixture of California for long enough that the state already has a law about it. In 1982, Mr. Brown, during his first run as governor, signed the Housing Accountability Act, colloquially known as the \u201canti-Nimby law.\u201dThe law bars cities from stopping developments that meet local zoning codes. In other words, it\u2019s illegal for cities to ignore their own housing laws. The act is rarely invoked, however, because developers don\u2019t want to sue cities for fear it will anger city councils and make it harder for them to gain approval for other developments.Shortly after Berkeley denied the Haskell Street permit, Ms. Trauss sued the city \u2014 and won.Berkeley agreed to give the project a new hearing and consider the Housing Accountability Act when reviewing future development. Neighbors, still incensed, continued to put pressure on the city to deny it. And the city did, this time refusing a demolition permit.Ms. Trauss sued again, and in July a Superior Court judge for Alameda County ordered the city to issue the permit.\u201cOrganizing alone doesn\u2019t get us out of the crisis,\u201d said Ryan J. Patterson, Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawyer and a partner at Zacks, Freedman & Patterson in San Francisco. \u201cYou have to have a fist people fear.\u201dNat Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who became a vice president at Microsoft after selling his company to the software giant last year, has helped California Yimby raise close to $1 million for its efforts to lobby the state on housing issues.\u201cThe smaller the unit of government, the harder it is to solve this problem,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.\u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating for anybody trying to build housing is that they try to play by the rules and they still get told \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Ms. Skinner said.Ms. Skinner\u2019s law takes effect next year, so the long-term impact is unclear. But just a few weeks before it was signed, the Zoning Adjustments Board had another contentious housing project.Neighbors had familiar complaints: The homes were too tall, had long shadows, and more residents would make it harder to find parking. The board\u2019s chairman responded that he understood the concerns but couldn\u2019t risk another lawsuit.California isn\u2019t going to solve its housing problem in the courts. But the basic idea \u2014 big-footing local government so that cities have a harder time blocking development \u2014 is central to the solutions that the state is pursuing.This is a state of great ambition. It wants to lead the country on actions to reduce carbon emissions, and has enacted legislation mandating a $15 minimum wage by 2022. But housing is undermining all of it.In a brief speech before signing the recent package of housing bills, Mr. Brown talked about how yesterday\u2019s best intentions become today\u2019s problems. California cities have some of the nation\u2019s strictest building regulations, and measures to do things like encourage energy efficiency and enhance neighborhood aesthetics eventually become regulatory overreach.\u201cCity and state people did all this good stuff,\u201d Mr. Brown said to a crowd of legislators. \u201cBut, as I always say, too many goods create a bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The form in which the husband-and-wife team of Shaun and Abigail Bengson couch their response is a sort of luxuriant, sentimental-cool folk rock, in which fatalistic and angry drumming figures prominently, along with sweet, swirling chords.They were so sure that each was \u201cthe one\u201d for the other that they married three weeks after they met, having summarily displaced a pre-existing boyfriend (in her case) and roommate (in his). But three weeks is a long time in the newly discovered country of young love. And Ms. Bengson, in particular, finds herself opening baggage from her past that would seem to make happiness with someone else impossible.As you may gather from the fact that they are now married and performing together, the Bengsons got over their crisis of faith long enough to commit to a relationship that, life being what it is, will never be a sure thing. But their self-portrait of a show, which was written in collaboration with Ms. Gancher, spends most of its time in the light-devouring shadows of doubt.A cross-country road trip that occupied the show\u2019s center 11 months ago has been jettisoned. \u201cHundred Days\u201d now takes place entirely in New York City (mostly in Astoria, Queens), with lots of internal detours into the twisty corridors of each partner\u2019s mind. The shift in focus from outside to inside clarifies and intensifies what was already an affecting piece.Mr. Bengson, who exudes a defensive deadpan calm that hints at demons scrambling beneath, sums up their chronicle with the jaunty disclaimer, \u201cSo here it is, the sound of introverts pining!\u201d That may not sound like much fun. But accompanied by a wonderfully droll quartet of singing musicians \u2014 Colette Alexander, Jo Lampert, Dani Markham and Reggie D. White \u2014 the Bengsons are stirring, and surprisingly witty, company.The Bengsons\u2019s distinctive stage presence matches the story they tell. They begin awkwardly and self-consciously, as if reluctant to commit even to performing. But as the show picks up momentum, their own music sweeps them into galvanizing eruptions of passion and existential anger. And the sound of Ms. Bengson wailing like a banshee as she considers the mangling trap that is love will echo in your ears for days to come.The physical production is austere, with little in the way of scenery beyond a constellation of light bulbs. Which turns out to be all that\u2019s needed for a show that celebrates and laments the elusive radiance of a shared life.Advertisement"}

As it does, the offer is still available.Such deals may be gaining momentum in the United States.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on Thursday to roll back the net neutrality rules in the United States. While the European Union has such rules in place, telecom providers have pushed the boundaries at times in Sweden, Germany, Portugal and elsewhere, offering a glimpse at the future American companies and consumers may face if protections are watered down.For the European Union\u2019s sprawling market of over 500 million citizens, the rules have mostly helped prevent bad behavior.That\u2019s largely because unlike in the United States, Europeans have plenty of choices for internet access at home and on their mobile phones. France has four major mobile and internet operators and nine low-cost offshoots. Britain has more than 50. And there aren\u2019t dominant giants born of megamergers, like the ones between Comcast and NBC Universal, and Verizon and AOL.Even so, telecom operators in Europe have tried to take advantage of some of the gray areas in the rules.That doesn\u2019t necessarily bother consumers.\u201cFrom a user perspective, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem and I think most consumers don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Magnus Haglunds, a Stockholm-based independent music producer who uses the Telia service. \u201cThere are those who may have to change from Apple Music to Spotify.

Telia continues to offer the service in Sweden and other Nordic countries.

{"Headline": "We Catalans Owe the World an Explanation", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Many readers probably have a cursory notion of the recent turmoil plaguing the autonomous Spanish region of Catalonia. They will have seen large demonstrations by both separatists and unionists. They may know, too, that following the illegal referendum on independence, Catalan separatist politicians, with 47 percent of the votes and a majority in the Catalan Parliament, decided to suspend the laws concerning the region\u2019s relationship with the central government. They then fraudulently approved a transitory constitution and an act calling for an illegal plebiscite on a plan for secession.Readers probably do not, however, have a clear understanding of how this has come to pass in a prosperous European democracy known for its freedom, tolerance and largely self-governed autonomous regions. We Catalans owe the world an explanation.I was born in Barcelona in 1979. My father is Catalan, the son of a family of merchants, and my mother was born in Andalusia to a humble and hard-working family. In the early 1970s, like millions of Andalusians, they moved to Catalonia in search of opportunities and to pursue their dreams. My parents met in Barcelona, where they married. In 1989, they started their own business, which allowed them to live comfortably. Three years ago, the economic crisis drowned the family company, and today my mother and aunt raise every day the shutter on a smaller homemade food venture. In recent weeks, my parents\u2019 business has suffered attacks by separatist radicals.Origin and socioeconomic status are the variables that best explain secessionism in my region: The higher the income and deeper the Catalan roots, the greater the separatist support; the lower the income, particularly among those with strong links to the rest of Spain, the greater the preference for a united Spain. This turns Catalan nationalism, traditionally conservative and oligarchic, into a movement through which those who have more want to emancipate themselves from the rest.Still, Catalan separatists have been very smart. The movement has taken the old exclusionary nationalism, founded on the thesis of a cultural, economic and linguistic difference, and rebranded itself as peace-loving and democratic.Behind this makeover a sense of supremacy defines this movement. It is seen in the use over the past three decades of propaganda in the public media and in the education system, which has been used as a brainwashing machine for the separatist movement started five years ago.All this has been exacerbated by both Socialist and conservative governments in Madrid. To obtain the support of the nationalist parties in the Spanish Congress of Deputies, they gradually ceded privileges and authority to the nationalist governments in Catalonia without supervision or coordination.Catalan nationalists have also persistently promoted the idea of a referendum. Those of us opposed to the plebiscite believe that not all democratic principles can be put to popular vote. Civil rights are not negotiable. Millions of Catalans cannot be deprived of their Spanish and European citizenship while national sovereignty is dissolved, and with it the right of all Spaniards to decide together on the future of Spain.On occasion, the federal government of the United States has also had to intervene to safeguard the rights of minority groups who have been trampled underfoot. President John F. Kennedy said in 1962, also in a context of disobedience and rights violations by local government, that citizens are \u201cfree to disagree with the law, but not to disobey it,\u201d and that, in a country where the courts and the Constitution are challenged, \u201cno law would stand free from doubt, no judge would be sure of his writ, and no citizen would be safe from his neighbors.\u201dThis is what is happening in Catalonia.Fortunately, the Constitution allows the national government to hold democratic elections on Dec. 21. We Catalans will be able to vote in legal regional elections to put an end to this madness. Never before has a regional government done so much economic, social and moral damage to Catalonia as it has with Mr. Puigdemont and the deposed vice president Oriol Junqueras at the helm.Ciudadanos, the party I preside over, began from a Catalan civil movement representing a majority of Catalans silenced by Catalan nationalism. Today we are the leading opposition party in Catalonia, and a national and European party aspiring to govern Spain.As most Spaniards do, a majority of Catalans want to participate in a common project for the future of Spain. I cannot resign myself to seeing an isolated Catalonia in a globalized world, nor can I resign myself to seeing more borders in the era of open societies.Faced with those who promote rupture, I demand dialogue. Faced with exclusion, I ask for coexistence; federalism and union, not provincialism and division; the rule of law, not arbitrariness; and pluralism and freedom against dogma and imposition.I was born in Barcelona. Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country, and Europe is our future.Albert Rivera is the president of the Ciudadanos party and a candidate for prime minister of Spain.Advertisement"}

Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel\u2019s Wishes for 2018: More Empathy and a New Government", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Angela Merkel of Germany, addressing her country as an acting chancellor, pledged in her annual New Year\u2019s address on Sunday to work for all Germans and to swiftly form a new government to help ensure success into 2018 and beyond.Here is a guide to the issues and events behind some key lines from Ms. Merkel\u2019s address.\u201cFrom numerous conversations and meetings this year, I know that many of you are worried about social cohesion in Germany. For a long time, there have not been so many differing opinions. Some even speak of a rift in our society.\u201d\u201cSome say Germany is a wonderful country, in which the values of our Constitution are lived actively. A country that is strong and economically successful, in which more people have work than ever before.\u201d\u201cThe others say, \u2018There are too many people who are not part of this success.\u2019\u201dGermany remains one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, home to four of the globe\u2019s largest companies by revenue, according to Forbes, with one of the highest average incomes in the European Union and one of the lowest unemployment rates, 5.6 percent.Ms. Merkel said that there were \u201ctoo many who worry that there is too much crime and violence, who wonder how we can regulate and organize immigration to our country.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, Germany\u2019s future is bound to the future of Europe. The 27 nations in Europe must be called upon more than ever to stick together as community. This will be a decisive question for the coming year.\u201d\u201cMy wishes for the New Year are for us to become aware again of that which holds us together at heart; that we focus again on what we have in common; and for us to strive to have more consideration for others. I mean consideration in the broadest sense: paying attention, truly listening and showing understanding for others.\u201dUnder a new law that takes effect on Monday, social media companies must erase comments flagged as hateful within a set period of time, or face fines that start as high as 5 million euros, or $5.7 million, and can rise to \u20ac50 million.Observers are watching closely to see if that will help the chancellor get the internet on her side.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of votes the Alternative for Germany party won in parliamentary elections in 2017. It was about 5.8 million votes, not more than one million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran Confronts 3rd Day of Protests, With Calls for Khamenei to Quit", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIran\u2019s leaders were confronted by unauthorized protests in major cities for the third straight day on Saturday, with crowds aiming their anger at the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and some demanding that he step down.The demonstrators first took to the streets of Mashhad, one of the holiest places in Shiite Islam, on Thursday. By Saturday, dozens of people had been arrested and the police had fired tear gas to disperse crowds.But the pro-government rallies, planned for 1,200 cities and towns, according to the state media, were overshadowed in intensity by Iranians in Tehran shouting, \u201cDeath to the dictator\u201d and \u201cClerics should get lost,\u201d witnesses said.Others chanted: \u201cShame on you, Seyyed Ali Khamenei,\u201d using an honorific for the supreme leader. \u201cLet the country go.\u201d Some protesters burned a banner with an image of his face.Video shared on social media on Saturday showed Iranians directly calling for Mr. Khamenei to step down, and also chanting, \u201cReferendum, referendum, this is the slogan of the people.\u201d (After the 1979 revolution, the Islamic Republic was established with a referendum.)Overtly political demonstrations are rare in Iran, where security services are omnipresent, and officials called on the crowds to halt them.The Revolutionary Guards, which along with its Basij militia spearheaded a crackdown against protesters in 2009, said in a statement carried by state news media on Saturday that efforts were underway to replicate that unrest, and that Iran \u201cwill not allow the country to be hurt.\u201dLater in the evening, the police fired tear gas to disperse crowds protesting at Tehran\u2019s central Vali-e Asr Square, a witness said.About 4,000 people, meanwhile, turned out for the annual pro-government rally in the capital, state media reported. State television stations showed marchers carrying banners in support of Mr. Khamenei in Mashhad, Iran\u2019s second-largest city.Typically, pro-government demonstrations are orchestrated by the state, and many of those attending are bused in. The rallies took on added significance after the unauthorized demonstrations \u2014 the largest protests in years \u2014 began over the rise in the price of food supplies.\u201cYoung people are angry and frustrated, without a hope in the future,\u201d said Nader Karimi Juni, a reformist journalist. \u201cIf they join these small groups of determined students, there could be a real problem.\u201dPresident Trump tweeted support for the protesters, saying the government should respect the people\u2019s right to express themselves. \u201cThe world is watching!\u201d Mr. Trump said.As some social media users called for more antigovernment rallies in Tehran and other cities later Saturday, demonstrations broke out in cities like Karaj and Zanjan, where a crowd tore down a billboard with a portrait of Mr. Khamenei.On Saturday night, the messaging app Telegram closed the account of the Iranian channel Amad News after government officials complained directly to the company\u2019s chief executive that the channel was encouraging violence.The messaging app is widely used in the country and some analysts said the protesters were organized in part on the platform and others like it.Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, Iran\u2019s Minister of Information and Communications Technology, in a tweet urged the head of Telegram, Pavel Durov, to shut down the channel.The channel was shut down, and Mr. Durov offered an explanation, also on Twitter, saying that Amad News had broken the messaging app\u2019s rules against encouraging violence.Early Saturday afternoon, about 30 students standing behind the fences of Tehran University shouted at passers-by, asking them to join in the protest, witnesses said. The students chanted a slogan against both reformists and hard-liners:\u201cThis is the end of their adventure,\u201d meaning the Islamic Republic.Security forces arrested a few people from a crowd of hundreds that had gathered on sidewalks in the capital. Some protesters threw stones.The protests were the first major demonstrations since the 2009 demonstrations, and they appeared to be steered by reformist politicians who had challenged the re-election of Mr. Ahmadinejad.The results of the vote set off more than six months of protests, with three million people protesting in the early days. Pro-reform groups, including the grass-roots Green Movement, said the vote had been rigged.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s re-election has emboldened Iranians seeking reforms. But his pledges to improve the economy have been hampered by the cumulative effect of sanctions and decades of government mismanagement.At the pro-government rally on Saturday, one demonstrator, Ali Ahmadi, 27, blamed the United States for Iran\u2019s economic problems, according to The Associated Press.\u201cThey always say that we are supporting Iranian people, but who should pay the costs?\u201d he said.Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, a reformist ally of the president, said that hard-line conservative opponents of Mr. Rouhani might have galvanized the first protests but lost control of them.\u201cThose who are behind such events will burn their own fingers,\u201d the state media quoted him as saying.Tehran\u2019s deputy governor-general for security and law enforcement, Mohsen Hamedani, dismissed reports that officials planned to impose a curfew in Tehran, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported.Analysts said that the general discontent could spur more protests in coming days, or that the demonstrations may die down.In the capital, where middle-class Iranians tend to set the tone, many residents strongly disapprove of some of Iran\u2019s leaders and have been hurt by the bad economy. But they fear insecurity and unrest even more, experts say.\u201cThe middle-classes like me are scared of losing what they have,\u201d Mr. Juni said. \u201cThey won\u2019t join the protests, I think.\u201dThomas Erdbrink reported from Niseko, Japan, and Yonette Joseph contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Pass Sweeping Tax Rewrite 51-49", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive Briefing\u2022 Republicans passed the nearly $1.5 trillion tax rewrite along party lines. One Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted against the bill.\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence provided a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment offered by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, which would allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts to fund tuition at private and religious K-12 schools or certain educational expenses for home-schooled students.\u2022 Democrats are crying foul over getting a revised, nearly 500-page bill just hours before being asked to vote on it.\u2022 The Senate rejected an amendment offered by Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans, that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income families and pay for it by nudging up the corporate tax rate.The Senate passed the Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax overhaul with several holdouts throwing their support behind the bill.Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who was the last big holdout, said she would support the bill after changes she wanted were made to the legislation.Mr. Corker voted against the bill, the only Republican senator to object to the legislation.Party leaders also picked up the votes of three other holdouts: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Steve Daines of Montana and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Friday morning that Republicans had the 50 votes they need to pass the tax bill.Republicans appeared increasingly confident as they milled into the Senate\u2019s ornate Strom Thurmond Room to hash out the remaining details of a tax bill that has been a moving target.Among the changes Ms. Collins secured was adding in a $10,000 property tax deduction into the Senate bill. Ms. Collins tweeted that she was \u201cdelighted\u201d with the move.Mr. Corker had pushed to scale back the tax cuts in the Senate bill in the wake of a report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that projected the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over the course of a decade, even after accounting for economic growth. On Thursday night, Republicans were discussing several possibilities for changing the bill to address deficit concerns, including gradually raising the corporate tax rate in later years.But other Republicans resisted the idea of raising taxes, and on Friday, that idea was off the table.The Senate approved the final bill, 51-49. A list of every senator\u2019s vote on the bill and selected amendments.\u201cThis is yet another tough vote,\u201d Mr. Corker said in a statement. \u201cI am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations.\u201dPresident Trump sounded optimistic on Friday morning, in a tweet taunting Democrats over the bill\u2019s prospects.Democrats took to the Senate floor and social media to attack Republicans over the speed of the bill and the last-minute changes being made, saying it was irresponsible to approve such significant legislation with little time to review it.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said the Republican bill had been worsened by changes made \u201cunder the cover of darkness.\u201d He added that those provisions would \u201cstuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.\u201d\u201cWe understand they have the votes to pass their bill,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, \u201cdespite a process and a product that no one can be proud of and everyone should be ashamed of.\u201dSenator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it \u201cWashington D.C. at its worst\u201d in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with handwritten changes scribbled in the margins.\u201cThis is unbelievable, we\u2019re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to affect everybody in this country.\u201dSenator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, posted a list of amendments to the bill on her Twitter account and cried foul over the fact that she got it from a lobbyist, not from her colleagues across the aisle.Many of the last-minute changes were included to help convince a handful of holdout Republican senators, including Ms. Collins and Mr. Johnson, to throw their support behind the legislation. Others were included for reasons that left many Democrats crying foul.In a closely watched vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income families while raising the corporate tax rate to 20.94 percent, from 20 percent as proposed in the tax bill.Mr. Rubio, who implored senators earlier in the day to allow the change since it would still be a reduction from the current corporate rate of 35 percent, was rebuffed by fellow lawmakers, who rejected the amendment in a 29-to-71 vote.A controversial provision that would have allowed parents to begin saving tax-free for the college education of an unborn child has been stripped from the Senate tax bill.Republicans appear to have removed the provision after it was challenged by Democrats on parliamentary grounds, a Senate Democratic aide said.Two less-controversial provisions were nixed or forced to be changed by the parliamentarian, who has broad power to determine which parts of a bill comply with the Senate budget reconciliation process.Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson had objected to the bill because of how it treated pass-through businesses, whose profits are distributed to owners and taxed at individual rates.The Senate tax bill will now allow pass through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes, up from 17.4 percent in the original Senate bill.\u201cAfter weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana\u2019s farmers and ranchers, I\u2019ve decided to support the Senate tax cut bill, which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,\u201d Mr. Daines said in a statement on Friday morning.The Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?Mr. Johnson said in a statement he also supports the bill.Mr. Flake, in a statement, said he would support the tax bill after getting changes to a budget \u201cgimmick\u201d and a commitment that Senate leaders and the Trump administration would work with him on a legislative solution on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.On Friday, Republicans rejected the idea of putting in place tax increases that would take effect some years from now, a step that would soften the deficit effects of the legislation.\u201cLarding the bill up with new tax increases would have been going the wrong direction,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.But lawmakers still need to find ways to pay for the changes being made and congressional aides said it will likely be a combination of things including:\u2022 Retaining the alternative minimum tax for corporations, which would raise $40 billion over a decade.\u2022 Retaining a modified version of the individual A.M.T., which would raise $133 billion over a decade.\u2022 Slightly increasing the tax rate on offshore assets under the \u201cdeemed repatriation\u201d provision, which would raise $97 billion over a decade.We modeled taxes for 25,000 middle-class families. Here\u2019s how the Senate bill would affect each of them.Republican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases.This bill has been promoted as a boon for the middle class. Does it fulfill that promise?Douglas Holtz-Eakin:Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.Kimberly A. Clausing:This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.The independent Tax Policy Center said on Friday that the Senate tax bill would add $1.2 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, even after accounting for increased economic growth. That deficit estimate was slightly higher than the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected on Thursday.The so-called dynamic score from the center found that the bill, as approved in the Finance Committee, would increase economic growth by 0.7 percent next year, but that its growth boost would fade over a decade, as deficits and federal debt increase. The center said those benefits would be larger if the economy was struggling, and not operating under low unemployment: \u201cBecause the economy is currently near full employment, the impact of increased demand on output would be smaller and diminish more quickly than it would if the economy were in recession.\u201dRepublican senators have criticized the center\u2019s previous findings and largely dismissed the Joint Committee\u2019s analysis on Thursday. They say they expect much larger growth effects than the analyses have found.The independent Tax Foundation, which typically finds higher growth effects from tax cuts, has not yet released an analysis of the bill after it underwent significant amendments in committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jakarta Is Sinking So Fast, It Could End Up Underwater", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "JAKARTA \u2014 Rasdiono remembers when the sea was a good distance from his doorstep, down a hill. Back then he opened the cramped, gaily painted bayside shack he named the Blessed Bodega, where he and his family sell catfish heads, spiced eggs and fried chicken.It was strange, Rasdiono said. Year by year, the water crept closer. The hill gradually disappeared. Now the sea loomed high over the shop, just steps away, held back only by a leaky wall.With climate change, the Java Sea is rising and weather here is becoming more extreme. Earlier this month another freakish storm briefly turned Jakarta\u2019s streets into rivers and brought this vast area of nearly 30 million residents to a virtual halt.Jakarta Is Sinking10 milesMore than 2 inches per year Less than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEA1984-19912010-2015Approximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTAJakarta Is Sinking10 milesMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEA1984-19912010-2015Approximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA10 milesJakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearApproximate extent of built-up areaJAVA SEAJAKARTA1984-19912010-2015Jakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per year Less than 2 inches per year1984-1991JAVA SEAApproximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA10 miles2010-2015Jakarta Is SinkingMore than 2 inches per yearLess than 2 inches per yearJAVA SEAApproximate extent of built-up areaJAKARTA1984-199110 miles2010-2015Subsidence data courtesy of Irwan Gumilar of Geodesy Research Group of ITB | Satellite images via Landsat 5 and Landsat 8By Jugal K. PatelOne local climate researcher, Irvan Pulungan, an adviser to the city\u2019s governor, fears that temperatures may rise several degrees Fahrenheit, and the sea level as much as three feet in the region, over the coming century.That, alone, spells potential disaster for this teeming metropolis.But global warming turned out not to be the only culprit behind the historic floods that overran Rasdiono\u2019s bodega and much of the rest of Jakarta in 2007. The problem, it turned out, was that the city itself is sinking.In fact, Jakarta is sinking faster than any other big city on the planet, faster, even, than climate change is causing the sea to rise \u2014 so surreally fast that rivers sometimes flow upstream, ordinary rains regularly swamp neighborhoods and buildings slowly disappear underground, swallowed by the earth. The main cause: Jakartans are digging illegal wells, drip by drip draining the underground aquifers on which the city rests \u2014 like deflating a giant cushion underneath it. About 40 percent of Jakarta now lies below sea level.Coastal districts, like Muara Baru, near the Blessed Bodega, have sunk as much as 14 feet in recent years. Not long ago I drove around northern Jakarta and saw teenagers fishing in the abandoned shell of a half-submerged factory. The banks of a murky canal lapped at the trestle of a railway bridge, which, until recently, had arched high over it.Climate change acts here as it does elsewhere, exacerbating scores of other ills. And in Jakarta\u2019s case, a tsunami of human-made troubles \u2014 runaway development, a near-total lack of planning, next to no sewers and only a limited network of reliable, piped-in drinking water \u2014 poses an imminent threat to the city\u2019s survival.Sinking buildings, sprawl, polluted air and some of the worst traffic jams in the world are symptoms of other deeply rooted troubles. Distrust of government is a national condition. Conflicts between Islamic extremists and secular Indonesians, Muslims and ethnic Chinese have blocked progress, helped bring down reform-minded leaders and complicated everything that happens here, or doesn\u2019t happen, to stop the city from sinking.\u201cNobody here believes in the greater good, because there is so much corruption, so much posturing about serving the public when what gets done only serves private interests,\u201d as Sidney Jones, the director of the local Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, put it. \u201cThere is no trust.\u201dHydrologists say the city has only a decade to halt its sinking. If it can\u2019t, northern Jakarta, with its millions of residents, will end up underwater, along with much of the nation\u2019s economy. Eventually, barring wholesale change and an infrastructural revolution, Jakarta won\u2019t be able to build walls high enough to hold back the rivers, canals and the rising Java Sea.And even then, of course, if it does manage to heal its self-inflicted wounds, it still has to cope with all the mounting threats from climate change.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.How climate change is challenging the world\u2019s urban centers.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.As far the eye can see, 21st-century Jakarta is a smoggy tangle of freeways and skyscrapers. Spread along the northwestern coast of Java, this capital of the nation with the world\u2019s largest Muslim population used to be a soggy, bug-infested trading port for the Hindu kingdom of Sunda before local sultans took it over in 1527.They named it Jayakarta, Javanese for victorious city.Dutch colonists arrived a century later, establishing a base for the East India territories. Imagining a tropical Amsterdam, they laid out streets and canals to try to cope with water pouring in from the south, out of the forests and mountains, where rain falls nearly 300 days out of the year. Thirteen rivers feed into the city.\u201cLiving here, we don\u2019t have other places to go,\u201d said Yudi and Titi, a young professional couple who one recent Sunday had made the roughly hour\u2019s round trip from western Jakarta to the center of the city just to spend a few minutes walking up and down a chaotic, multilane freeway briefly closed to traffic. \u201cWithout cars, at least you can breathe for a few minutes,\u201d Titi said.The most urgent problems are in North Jakarta, a coastal mash-up of ports, nautically themed high-rises, aged fish markets, abject slums, power plants, giant air-conditioned malls and the congested remnants of the colonial Dutch settlement, with its decrepit squares and streets of crumbling warehouses and dusty museums.Some of the world\u2019s most polluted canals and rivers weave a spider\u2019s web through the area.It is where the city is sinking fastest.The aquifers aren\u2019t being replenished, despite heavy rains and the abundance of rivers, because more than 97 percent of Jakarta is now smothered by concrete and asphalt. Open fields that once absorbed rain have been paved over. Shores of mangroves that used to help relieve swollen rivers and canals during monsoons have been overtaken by shantytowns and apartment towers.Climate change is threatening to push a crowded capital toward a breaking point.Sign up to receive our in-depth journalism about climate change around the world.Graphics by Derek Watkins and Jeremy White. Design by Matt Ruby and Rumsey Taylor.And many of the rural poor have settled in Jakarta in informal developments, or kampungs, that cluster along canals, their houses teetering above the water on stilts, the waterways underneath becoming default sewers.All of these homes, all of this sewage and garbage now jam pumping stations that the city has had to build because gravity no longer drains the rivers and canals naturally.To halt the sinking, the city needs to stop the digging of wells, which means Jakarta must provide residents with reliable, clean, piped-in water and, to clear the waterways, somehow \u2014 at a cost of untold billions \u2014 retrofit one of the world\u2019s biggest cities with a sewer system, or something approaching it.Cleaning the canals and rivers will also require policing the factories that dump chemicals, which means grappling with corruption \u2014 and resettling many of the informal communities. But resettlement depends on finding land and then building thousands of new homes for displaced residents, most of whom don\u2019t want to move in the first place.That was before the bulldozers arrived. The Akuarium I found had been reduced to mounds of broken masonry and concrete.\u201cThe government said the eviction was about cleaning the river, but I believe it was about politics and development,\u201d Topaz told me, reflecting a belief widely held among residents. He showed me around the tattered, windswept tent he shares with a dozen other squatters not far from where his family home used to be. Over his shoulder, several luxury waterfront apartment towers were under construction. \u201cI saw promotions for those towers that showed Akuarium turned into a park,\u201d Topaz said.And he cleared out some of the kampungs that obstructed waterways. The efforts began to make a difference. Rains that once caused days of floods drained within hours.But many people forced out, like Topaz, resisted the moves, convinced that the evictions were really intended to enrich developers, not improve drainage. Akuarium became a hotbed of protest against the governor.At another evicted settlement called Bukit Duri, I met Agus Fadilah, 34, a motorbike-taxi driver, gazing at the rubble of what used to be his house on the banks of the Ciliwung, one of the city\u2019s main rivers. Bulldozers were still moving piles of debris, and a few women were scavenging for family belongings.Upstream, several other kampungs had already been cleared, the river widened, its banks lined with concrete and surrounded by high concrete walls, now tagged with graffiti. The river there looks imprisoned, but water flows more easily.\u201cI was raised here, my job was here,\u201d Mr. Agus said, noting that he, his wife and two young children had been relocated to a new apartment building hours away. They make long daily commutes because they want to keep the children in their old schools.\u201cI know why they did this,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt had to do with the river. I know this was not legally our land. But it was my home.\u201dResidents of Bukit Duri filed a class-action lawsuit against the government to protest the evictions. Recently, a district court judge ruled in their favor.\u201cIt\u2019s not that nobody should move,\u201d argues Elisa Sutanudjaja, a kampung advocate and the executive director at the Rujak Center for Urban Studies. \u201cThese poor communities don\u2019t all want to stay in place, but they do want to stay together and near their jobs, and they want legal status.\u201cMostly, they want to be consulted,\u201d she said.They also want to show, where possible, that moving isn\u2019t the only solution. In a leafy kampung called Tongkol, residents during the last couple of years have installed their own septic tanks and kept their stretch of the Ciliwung clean. A young architect named Kamil Muhammad, from Architecture Sans Frontieres-Indonesia, designed a low-cost home made of concrete, bamboo and reused brick. It stacks seven tiny apartments under a covered communal roof deck.The project is a template for cheap, do-it-yourself housing that can free up space along Jakarta\u2019s waterways critical for flood control.\u201cWe want to demonstrate to the government that kampungs can actually be beneficial to the river,\u201d Kamil told me as we looked over the river from the roof deck. Below, banana and star fruit trees shaded a riverside promenade of colorful facades and vegetable gardens.\u201cWe need big steps now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all the discussions get tied up with fishermen and development, there will eventually be a massive calamity and deaths and no choice but to give up on whole parts of Jakarta.\u201dThere is occasional talk here about the Indonesian government moving its capital elsewhere, to shrink the city. Politicians issue decrees prohibiting developers from digging wells and imploring residents to store rainwater. Enforcement is negligible.Mr. Brinkman drove me one morning to the city\u2019s new 16-mile Eastern Flood Channel, its banks lined with parkland. The channel has helped relieve flooding. From there we toured a century-old water gate, also recently repaired. \u201cA few years ago this was solid waste,\u201d Mr. Brinkman said, gesturing across the wide, murky water. On the opposite bank, sanitation crews in bright orange outfits gathered around garbage trucks. They belonged to Ahok\u2019s Orange Army.\u201cThis gate is nothing like it used to be,\u201d Mr. Brinkman said. \u201cYou used to be able to walk across the water, it was so clogged with garbage and sediment.\u201dAs he spoke, one of the orange-clad sanitation workers leaned his head back, polished off a bottle of water and tossed the empty plastic container over one shoulder into the river.Real progress is often thwarted here. The most ambitious move by the city is the construction of what\u2019s called the Coastal Wall, now rising like a black cliff from Jakarta Bay. It\u2019s a quasi-temporary barrier to hold back the rising sea and compensate for subsidence \u2014 built extra high because, like the rest of North Jakarta, it is expected to sink, too. With subsidence at the current rate, the Coastal Wall itself may be underwater by 2030.Even more alarming, Mr. Brinkman showed me one spot along the waterfront where the wall ends and all that holds back the sea is a low, crumbling concrete rampart. The water was only a couple of feet below the top when we peered over the embankment.\u201cIf this wall breaks, there\u2019s simply no holding back the Java Sea,\u201d said Mr. Brinkman, gesturing from the rampart toward the city. \u201cJakarta will flood all the way to the center of town, six kilometers from here. I could take you to 20 other places just like this.\u201dThe dike would not just block rising waters. According to the original plan, it would also become the spine for an immense new megadistrict and ring road, a $40 billion development \u2014 and a windfall for real estate moguls and Dutch consultants \u2014 designed in the shape of a garuda, the national bird.The Great Garuda, as it came to be called, was Jakarta\u2019s Big Idea.The government has now backtracked on the megadistrict idea, while still envisioning the dike itself \u2014 the very notion of which has provoked understandable skepticism. As environmentalists have pointed out, if the city doesn\u2019t first clean up its rivers and canals, a dike will turn an enclosed Jakarta Bay into the world\u2019s largest cesspool.The development scheme was also linked to discredited plans for reclaimed islands inside the bay. Delayed for years by recession and legal wrangling, the islands started to get built in 2013, marketed as posh oases of condominiums, yacht marinas and golf courses primarily to customers in places like Malaysia and Singapore.Enraged fishermen sued, claiming that the islands destroyed their traditional fishing grounds. When one developer was exposed for bribing local officials, a scandal erupted and construction was halted.At the same time, the islands had become tied up with the Great Garuda. Officials, including Ahok, realized that a tax on the islands\u2019 developers could help Indonesia pay for the giant dike, along with other costly initiatives to clear waterways and stop the sinking.In essence, a plan that environmentalists and many poor fishermen agreed would wreak environmental havoc on the bay and North Jakarta was being touted by Jakartan leadership as a means to save the city itself \u2014 and from climate change.From Mr. Brinkman\u2019s perspective, just \u201ccounteracting subsidence will account for 90 percent of what this city needs to do to deal with climate change.\u201dTokyo was in a similar predicament after World War II, he likes to point out. It had sunk about 12 feet since 1900. But the city poured resources into new infrastructure and established stricter rules about development, and within a decade or two made itself a global model of urban innovation, better able to cope with the effects of climate change.\u201cJakarta could become a 21st-century version of Tokyo in the 20th century, an example for urban redevelopment,\u201d Irvan Pulungan, the climate change adviser to the city\u2019s new governor, imagined.But \u201ca city that can\u2019t deliver basic services is a failed city,\u201d he added. \u201dOn top of conventional issues like flooding and urbanization we now have climate change, tipping the scale. And at this rate, people will be fighting in the streets for increasingly limited resources like clean water and safe living spaces.\u201dLike Tokyo half a century ago, Jakarta is at a turning point, he said: \u201cNature will no longer wait.\u201dRestidia Putri contributed research.Map by Jugal Patel.

{"Headline": "The Troubled Rise of Rahul Gandhi", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW DELHI \u2014 On Saturday, Rahul Gandhi, the heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, is to formally take over as the president of the Indian National Congress. His family has run the Congress party for four generations. His father, Rajiv Gandhi; his grandmother Indira Gandhi; and his great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru governed India as prime ministers for a combined total of 38 years.Mr. Gandhi, 47, is succeeding his mother, Sonia Gandhi, who has been at the helm of the party for the past 19 years. The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty outrivals the Kennedys\u2019 for longevity. Mr. Gandhi is taking over at a time of decline in the fortunes of the Congress party, which suffered a devastating defeat by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014 and controls a mere five out of 29 state governments.With his party\u2019s repeated failures to win elections in the face of the combination of charisma and aggressive Hindu nationalism that fuels Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s politics, Mr. Gandhi has settled on a carefully devised departure from the party\u2019s past by openly and visibly embracing his Hindu identity.That abandonment became glaringly obvious during the recently concluded election for the Legislative Assembly in the western Indian state of Gujarat \u2014 the home state of Mr. Modi.Before he became prime minister in 2014, Mr. Modi led his Bharatiya Janata Party to three consecutive and comfortable victories in Gujarat. His move to New Delhi left the B.J.P. in Gujarat with a weak leadership, and the election in Gujarat came as Mr. Modi was facing popular criticism over the state of India\u2019s economy and, for the first time, seemed nervous.Mr. Gandhi led his party\u2019s vigorous campaign in Gujarat. The results will be announced on Monday, but even if the Congress party doesn\u2019t win the election, it is expected to gain seats and improve its standing.The B.J.P. campaign, marked by Islamophobic speeches, was aimed at intensifying Hindu majoritarian impulses. Mr. Modi even accused several leaders of the Congress party, including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, of working with Pakistan to defeat his party in Gujarat.The Constitution of India, adopted in 1950, envisaged a state that remained equidistant from all religions while protecting the rights of minorities. In practice this meant that most political leaders visited temples, mosques, gurudwaras and churches with equal ease.Rather than stand against majoritarian and Islamophobic politics, Mr. Gandhi chose to fight the electoral battle on the terms set by the Hindu right. Mr. Gandhi stayed silent about the violence and hostility encountered by India\u2019s Muslim citizens. He essentially agreed with the terms set by Hindu nationalists that to speak of equal citizenship and political rights for India\u2019s 165 million Muslims is no longer acceptable in India.Mr. Gandhi\u2019s pitch to voters amounts to the claim that he not only can carry out the same economic policies better than Mr. Modi but also is as good a Hindu as Mr. Modi.Over time, the Somnath temple had become a monument to Hindu injury and rage. Its reconstruction helped inspire Mr. Modi\u2019s mentors in the Hindu nationalist movement to demolish the medieval Babri mosque in Ayodhya and eventually replace it with a grand temple for Rama, whose birthplace they believe the mosque was built upon. The demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992 transformed Indian politics and led to the rise of the B.J.P.Hartosh Singh Bal, the author of \u201cWaters Close Over Us: A Journey Along the Narmada,\u201d is the political editor of The Caravan magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Seen on TV: A Road Trip Tracks the Shows of the South", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "Road TripUsing \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and other shows as travel agents is a decent way to see things that give an area its character.Supported by\u201cThat\u2019s where Andrea died.\u201dIt\u2019s not the sort of remark one normally hopes to hear on vacation. But on a dazzling spring morning in Senoia, Ga., it spurred a chorus of \u201coohs\u201d as the assembled aimed cellphones at the site of the demise.I came for \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d tour but stayed for the ambience. For a few hours anyway, because there were more places to see where fictional people got killed, cursed, discovered, drunk, fed and further enmeshed in a Gothic murder mystery. Along the way I ate well, drank better and zoned out on rocky-top foothills and in kudzu canyons, letting my mind wander as hundreds of miles rolled beneath the wheels of my overpriced rental car.Which is to say, I undertook a mythic getaway (an American road trip \u2026) for a slightly corny reason (\u2026based on TV locations). And it was great.Nobody needs an excuse for a road trip, though it helps to have hooks for the thread of your adventure. Friends or family, or sites you\u2019ve always wanted to visit: national parks, Civil War battlefields, Waffle Houses. (No judgment.) It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, really; all you need is a framework. I write about \u2014 and thus watch a metric ton of \u2014 television. So that was mine.I chose the South because, well, so has TV. Producers seeking ever more evocative backdrops \u2014 and fat tax credits \u2014 have turned the region into a popular shooting spot. Atlanta, in particular, has become a hub, the home base of both numerous series (\u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d) and box office blockbusters, like the \u201cHunger Games\u201d and \u201cAvengers\u201d films.So that seemed like a good place to start an As Seen on TV trek that would take me to Nashville, site of, er, \u201cNashville,\u201d and then New Orleans, whose indelible atmosphere has enlivened shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d \u201cTreme\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective.\u201dThe broader point, of course, is that the cultural and aesthetic charms that look good onscreen also make these cities excellent spots to visit, and using TV as your travel agent turns out to be a decent way to see things that give an area its character. The same things that beguile location scouts looking for a sense of place can be a great way to get a sense of a place.In Atlanta, these include nearby small towns whose picturesque squares have served as settings for shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d (Griffin) and \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d (Covington).I\u2019d wanted to see it, too, but zombie fatigue was setting in. I breathed deeply from the sweet-smelling breeze, building escape fantasies around the town\u2019s elegant houses and enjoying a walk that eventually veered off course. \u201cDon\u2019t go in her yard!\u201d Mr. Adams shouted, jerking me back to attention. Apparently not every Senoian is down with walker stalkers.Roughly 30 miles east of Atlanta, Covington is a small town with a robust filming history, hosting productions that include \u201cFriday the 13th,\u201d \u201cCannonball Run\u201d and \u201cRemember the Titans.\u201d On TV the town has served as the Hazzard County seat (\u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d), Sparta, Ga. (\u201cHeat of the Night\u201d) and Mystic Falls, Va. (\u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d).So I made a pilgrimage up Flat Rock Road to the white cinder block building that served as the exterior of the Boar\u2019s Nest, where Daisy Duke slung beers in her namesake micro-shorts.It now appears to be a church, so I guess there\u2019s hope for us all. Then it was time to head to Nashville.As I approached Chattanooga, the rolling Georgia terrain gave way to dramatic vistas of the Appalachian foothills before the highway bent west toward Nashville. In recent years, the country music capital has also become your cool friends\u2019 favorite city, thanks to New South cuisine and a fertile cultural scene. On this trip I was there for the Bluebird.\u201cNow we have hundreds of people, many who just want to have their picture taken in front of the venue,\u201d said Erika Wollam Nichols, the general manager. \u201cOr they get desperate about trying to get inside, to the point of trying to break the door down, waving $20 bills at me.\u201d\u201cIt gets kind of insane,\u201d she added.As mawkish as this sounds: The Bluebird is about songs, not stardom \u2014 their power to crystallize ephemeral emotions and reach places inside you that don\u2019t see them coming. And the warm aura of the place makes it hard to do anything other than open yourself to them.\u201cIt\u2019s the quintessential listening room,\u201d Monte King, a veteran Bluebird performer, told me before showtime. Later he reduced me to tears with \u201cI Will Always Be Your Dad,\u201d his song about a son who had left home for the Marine Corp.\u201cMost people leave changed and that\u2019s the best part,\u201d Ms. Wollam Nichols said.My only other Nashville agenda item was hot chicken, though locals tended to smirk at my request for recommendations. The fiery, cayenne-laden style of yardbird, born in the city, is a foodie obsession.Pro tip: Order online and get it to go. But however smug I felt bypassing the line, the tenders cut me down to size. I got the extra hot Shut the Cluck Up flavor \u2014 a silly name for some serious chicken that had my head leaking multiple fluids and my mouth burning in delicious agony.Nashville had made me cry twice in as many days, which felt like enough. So I pointed the car toward New Orleans.The Natchez Trace Parkway is one of the great drives in America, a 444-mile strip of two-lane blacktop, stretching from Nashville to Natchez, Miss., that follows a route established by Native Americans trailing buffalo and later used by traders, settlers and soldiers.On a weekday with few other cars in sight, it felt like the primordial artery that it is, taking on a mystical feel as I drove through an upholstered landscape of deep-shag kudzu and dense trees. It also has a 50 miles-per-hour speed limit, so at Tupelo, Miss., I opted for the more pragmatic highway to New Orleans.But music formed the soul of the show, as it does for the city itself. At least that\u2019s how it felt amid the churn of revelers in and out of the bars on Frenchman, my head humming with the crash and clang of a half-dozen bands. I caught one last set at Blue Nile by Dr. Klaw, the funk supergroup made up of members of Soulive, Dumpstaphunk and others, and made it back to my hotel after 3 a.m.Which made the next morning a bit foggy. My first destination was only blocks away, so I forced myself out of bed and walked down St. Charles.The private home was built in 1856 by a cotton kingpin named Henry S. Buckner, and also housed a business school until the 1980s. But while it wears its opulence gracefully, its recent stint as a witch school \u2014 and all the murders, resurrections and tongue removals that entailed \u2014 gave it a sinister undertow even on a spring morning full of birdsong.In \u201cTrue Detective\u201d it was called Doumain\u2019s Domain, but everything else felt the same \u2014 the wood-paneled interior, the air thick with cigarette smoke. But if the Buckner Mansion retained the gloom of its fictional counterpart, the opposite happened here. Across the road the bayou glimmered like a jewel and my cellphone had no service, so I settled down with a longneck and jotted in my notebook. Sometimes the end of the earth isn\u2019t bad.I heard there might be alligators out back, but instead I found Lula Riviere, 84, cleaning golfball-size snails out of a marshy pond. For years Miss Lu, as she\u2019s known, had an alligator that lived there and became so tame she would paint its claws with fingernail polish. (The bartender confirmed this.) During filming for \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d she helped Woody Harrelson and Mr. McConaughey\u2019s young son feed it hot dogs.At the bar I found Mr. Ruffins himself, an auspicious development \u2014 he was a good person to ask about something that had been on my mind.Travel can be fraught with questions about appreciation versus appropriation \u2014 heedless tourists can treat cultures as instruments for their own enrichment, and risk trampling them in the process. It seemed to me that if you approach places with humility, respect and an open heart, it didn\u2019t matter how you discovered them. But I saw how facile it could seem, checking off a list of things you saw on TV.I posed some version of this to Mr. Ruffins, who acknowledged that many people who come to his bar do so because they saw it or him on \u201cTreme,\u201d rather than because they are devoted jazz fans.\u201cBut we turn them into jazz fans once they hear the band play,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can convert people real fast.\u201dIf he\u2019s untroubled by it, who am I to wring my hands?Jeremy Egner writes about television for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Dealt Setback After European Court Rules It Is a Taxi Service", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe European Union\u2019s highest court on Wednesday declared that Uber was a transportation business, not just a technology platform, another blow to a company already grappling with scandals and regulatory setbacks.Uber had positioned itself as digital marketplace that connected drivers with riders, which tend to face a lighter regulatory burden. The ruling will now force Uber to comply with the bloc\u2019s rules for taxis and other transport companies, meaning the company could face stricter licensing and other requirements.Legislation in many countries has not kept up with the atypical work arrangements that companies use to cut costs. Regulations for decades have been formulated around traditional 9-to-5 jobs.The uncertainty has fueled a wave of litigation, leaving the courts to create a patchwork of regulations and rules.\u201cIt\u2019s normal that authorities don\u2019t know what to do \u2014 they can\u2019t just issue regulations anytime somebody claims to operate a new business model,\u201d said Valerio De Stefano, a law professor at the University of Leuven in Belgium. \u201cThe litigation will lead authorities to better understand what is the reality of the work in the platform economy.\u201dThe Uber case before the European Court of Justice centered on a complaint brought by a taxi group based in Barcelona, Spain. The group argued that it was unfair that Uber did not have to adhere to the same rules in the city. Uber ran a peer-to-peer service there called UberPop, which linked nonprofessional drivers with riders.The service has since been disbanded in Spain and several other countries. And Uber said it now used only professional drivers in the vast majority of the European Union.In a statement on the Wednesday ruling, Uber said that it was already operating under the transportation law of most European countries in which it did business, and that the ruling would have little impact. It added that it would continue a dialogue with cities across Europe for its services.He had no paid sick leave while recovering, and his insurance refused to cover the cost of repairs to the scooter. To earn cash, he started riding for Deliveroo again, this time on a bike, and driving part time with Uber. But he had to work long hours to make ends meet.\u201cYou end up trapped in this kind of cycle,\u201d Mr. Biswas said. The biggest shock, he added, was to \u201cfeel you\u2019re in the hands of other people who ultimately just don\u2019t care: They don\u2019t care until you come back in as a cog.\u201dBut such numbers may mask the precarious side of atypical work. In Spain, for example, the government reported that 18 million temporary contracts were handed out last year, compared with 1.7 million long-term jobs.\u201cThe financial crisis took away a lot of permanent stable employment and skewed statistics to say we have record high employment,\u201d said Jeremy Coy, a partner and labor law specialist at the law firm Russell-Cooke, which is based in London. \u201cPeople may be forced to get that work because it\u2019s the only work out there.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need to exploit our staff to be profitable,\u201d said Sven Wolf, Bzzt\u2019s chief executive.In the absence of clearer rules, those in the freewheeling world of gig work are also turning to unions to help wrest concessions from companies that have grown into juggernauts on the back of flexible labor.When the company did not grant her holiday pay, she took CitySprint to a labor tribunal and won back pay of 200 pounds, or $270. But the battle cost more than it was worth: Trying to pursue a claim while bicycling 50 miles a day to earn her basic wage was exhausting.\u201cIf governments are confused, they could literally get a job at a courier company for a week as a van driver or on a bike,\u201d Ms. Dewhurst said.Then, she added, \u201cthey\u2019ll realize exactly what they need to do.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was an embarrassing moment for India, and the National Green Tribunal, India\u2019s environmental court, chastised the local government for even holding the match.\u201cEvery newspaper has been carrying headlines that the air pollution was going to be higher this week. Still you took no action. Even the players were playing the match wearing masks,\u201d the court said. \u201cAre the people of Delhi supposed to bear this?\u201dThe bigger question might be: Why can\u2019t India, which has made enormous strides fighting poverty and aspires to be a superpower, get a handle on its pollution?This time of year, as winter sets in, is the worst. Diesel fumes, construction dust, emissions from coal plants and smoke from huge swaths of crops being burned combine to form a smog blanket, thickened by the relatively cool and still air.Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of the state of Delhi (a position like a governor), had a totally different take: He said Delhi had turned into a \u201cgas chamber.\u2019\u2019This is another issue.

In November and again this week, Indian news channels ran little red meters on screen showing air quality sinking to anxiety-producing levels. As officials across various layers of Indian government scrambled to respond, Mr. Modi did not say \u2014 or tweet, which is how he often communicates \u2014 a word about it.Instead, he sent out messages on entirely different subjects ranging from meeting Prince Charles to Chennai\u2019s \u201crich musical tradition.\u201dAn adviser gave the impression that the prime minister was not more engaged because the central government considered air pollution a problem for just a couple of weeks a year, and a Delhi-centric one at that.But the city\u2019s air quality is poor for most of the year. And it is not just New Delhi: Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Agra, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad have all suffered levels more than six times what the World Health Organization considers safe.Many outside observers compare India and China, two Asian heavyweights struggling to find a balance between expanding their economies as quickly as possible while not ruining the environment. China has been faster to distribute fines and criminal charges.But India has never been able to boss around its population like China does. India\u2019s political system is much freer, and messier: a decentralized democracy covering 1.3 billion people rife with all sorts of regional and political rivalries. Indian officials rarely line up behind one set of policies, even when it comes to an enormous public health problem.\u201cDel is choking sir,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal posted.\u201cNot a matter for interstate discussion,\u201d his cohort in Punjab, Amarinder Singh, replied.A week later, Mr. Kejriwal tweeted: \u201cWould be grateful if u cud spare sometime to meet me.\u201dThe two still have not met.Indian environmentalists have a long list of complaints: They say Mr. Modi should be stepping in more to provide leadership on air pollution. They say his administration\u2019s decision to eliminate environmental impact assessments for most construction projects has led to more dust, a significant contributor to Delhi\u2019s air pollution.They also complain that his government has failed to enforce restrictions on coal-fired power plants and granted approvals for new ones, including near Delhi. Coal is one of the dirtiest fuels.Mr. Modi\u2019s advisers argue that they are pushing solar energy, cracking down on truck traffic and setting up a task force.But they don\u2019t hide from the fact that they are continuing a decades-long process of liberalizing India\u2019s economy to help it grow. They argue that India has plenty of strong environmental rules \u2014 too many, actually. What environmentalists see as trouble, the government sees as progress.Every year in November, clouds of white smoke waft over New Delhi. This is from the billions of pounds of crop residue, like leaves and stalks, burned on farms in neighboring Punjab and Haryana to clear space for the next planting. Crop burning creates a quarter of Delhi\u2019s air pollution in winter.Several state governments have pleaded with the central government to support alternatives, such as transporting the residue to dairy farms for cows to eat. The cost would be around $200 million, less than a tenth of a percent of India\u2019s $2 trillion economy. The central government has yet to agree.Air pollution, which seems to be getting worse each year, has yet to ignite large protests. One reason is that the major political parties still see it as a fringe issue.Indians call this the elite buyout: Those with means avoid substandard government services and move on.Environmentalists have tried to appeal to Mr. Modi\u2019s interest in keeping India\u2019s growth rates high by saying that air pollution is hurting the economy. They argue that images of Delhi\u2019s smog clouds \u2014 and vomiting cricket players \u2014 will scare off investors. The World Bank estimates that air pollution is costing India at least $55 billion a year, probably more.But some professionals have given up.Vinay Kesari, a lawyer, recently left Delhi for Bangalore with his pregnant wife.\u201cThe deciding factor,\u201d Mr. Kesari said, was \u201cwe didn\u2019t want our child\u2019s first breath to be drawn in Delhi.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Maybe $150 million.\u201dMr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony came on his fifth day on the witness stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan as he was cross-examined by a lawyer for a Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is on trial for his alleged involvement in the sanctions evasion.Mr. Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian citizen who was arrested on a 2016 family trip to Disney World, testified last week that in 2012, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey\u2019s prime minister and now its president, personally ordered that two Turkish banks be allowed to participate in the scheme.Mr. Zarrab also testified that he had paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to the country\u2019s then economy minister, Zafer Caglayan.Before Mr. Zarrab secretly pleaded guilty on Oct. 26 to conspiring in the sanctions scheme, he was to have been tried along with Mr. Atilla. His plea and cooperation agreement were revealed last week when the trial began.On Tuesday, during his cross-examination, Mr. Zarrab offered new details about an unrelated charge to which he also pleaded guilty \u2014 bribing a guard at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was held, in return for contraband like alcohol and for the use of the guard\u2019s cellphone.Mr. Zarrab revealed Tuesday that the bribe was about $45,000, and said the payment had been arranged by a lawyer in Turkey who was representing him and was in New York at the time. Mr. Zarrab did not identify the lawyer; one of his New York attorneys, Robert J. Anello, declined to comment. A jail spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony, now in its second week, continued to send political tremors through Turkey.Mr. Erdogan used his weekly address to parliamentarians from his Justice and Development Party on Tuesday to make a heated attack against the United States. He pointed to not just the trial, but also American support for Kurdish insurgents in Syria and United States policy in Israel.\u201cIt is now understood that the U.S.A. has a plan against us,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told legislators. \u201cIt is obvious that this trial is brought up as a tool to blackmail us to give up our claims in the region.\u201dMr. Erdogan, who values his personal relationship with President Trump, suggested that holdovers from the Obama administration still in the United States government were trying to undermine the Trump administration.\u201cThis trial is also a piece of the big fight, the big strife in American domestic politics,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cAmerican media covers this trial alongside with the \u2018Russia, Flynn, Trump\u2019 headline.\u201dMr. Erdogan noted that the sanctions case indictment says \u201cconspiracy.\u201d\u201cYes, there is conspiracy \u2014 but against Turkey,\u201d he said. As he has repeatedly in the past, he blamed followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who he has accused of fomenting a failed coup against him in 2016.And in a warning to opponents at home, Mr. Erdogan said: \u201cWhoever takes the trial in America as a matter of domestic politics is a collaborator in the treachery.\u201dDuring Mr. Zarrab\u2019s cross-examination, he also revealed that his lawyers first met with prosecutors as early as the summer of 2016 to discuss the possibility of his cooperating with the government, but the idea went nowhere. Then, this past August, he and his lawyers met with the government, leading to about a dozen sessions with prosecutors and F.B.I. agents, after which the government agreed to the cooperation deal.Mr. Zarrab also testified about his efforts before becoming a government witness to have his lawyers in Turkey and New York try to resolve his case outside of the court system. \u201cWithin the bounds of law, they did make efforts,\u201d he said in response to a question from Cathy Fleming, a lawyer for Mr. Atilla.\u201cIn fact, you hired Rudy Giuliani and former Attorney General Michael Mukasey as your attorneys in the United States to try to work out a solution for you in Turkey, correct?\u201d Ms. Fleming asked.\u201cThat is correct, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Zarrab said.\u201cIn fact, you are furious with people in Turkey that it did not work, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d Ms. Fleming asked.\u201cI don\u2019t have any anger towards anybody, ma\u2019am,\u201d Mr. Zarrab replied.Follow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter @BenWeiserNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "If the City Never Sleeps, Should Its Subway?", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a one-paragraph recommendation nestled in a nearly 400-page report on the future of New York City. But it grabbed attention, because it takes aim at a cherished hallmark of city life: a subway that is always available, around the clock, seven days a week.The suggestion \u2014 to end overnight weekday service \u2014 quickly became the talk of the transit world, with some reaching for a clich\u00e9 to express a common view: Can the city that never sleeps tolerate a subway that does?The group argued that shutting down the subway during the wee hours would make it easier to repair what is broken and to upgrade a crumbling, century-old system. It would affect a relatively small portion of passengers: Only 1.5 percent of weekday riders, or about 85,000 people, use the subway between 12:30 a.m. and 5 a.m., according to 2016 data.Nighttime trains could be replaced with buses, which the association\u2019s report said would encounter little congestion during those hours and would run more frequently than the subway.Tom Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, said that the subway system was one of the few in the world that offered 24-hour service, and that the trains were falling far behind those in other cities.\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to fix them, let alone get ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to try something different.\u201dBut many transit experts, advocates and riders said stopping the trains would run counter to the rhythms of New York, undermining the city\u2019s economy and unfairly burdening working-class passengers.\u201cThe city is becoming more of a 24-hour city than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Mitchell Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, who called the idea elitist. \u201cClosing the subways is a way to undermine the health care industry, the restaurant industry, the office maintenance industry. This is a threat to the fundamentals of the city\u2019s economy.\u201dAndrew Sparberg, a subway historian, said New York City\u2019s subways have run 24 hours since the day they opened in 1904, following in the footsteps of elevated trains that had also run overnight since at least the 1880s.\u201cThere has never been a systemwide, overnight shutdown,\u201d said Mr. Sparberg, who opposes the idea. \u201cThat\u2019s unprecedented. Even during World War II, there were no shutdowns. It\u2019s a radical change in what has always been an accepted service pattern.\u201dNo other major subway system, except Copenhagen\u2019s, operates trains on virtually all its lines all the time, according to Mike Rohde, who operates Metrobits.org, a website focused on rapid transit. Some cities, like Chicago, Philadelphia and Minneapolis, operate certain lines throughout the night. The PATH system, which links Manhattan and New Jersey, runs 24 hours a day but is far smaller than New York\u2019s.That all-night availability is practically written into the fiber of the city\u2019s being. Trains shuttle tourists back to their hotels and carry workers to and from their jobs at all hours.Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, highlighted the city\u2019s nickname in pushing back against the idea of weeknight shutdowns.\u201cI believe a permanent closure of the entire subway system every night is a bit draconian,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cinappropriate\u201d for a city with a reputation for insomnia.Even supporters of the recommendation acknowledged that the subway\u2019s overnight availability was a core tenet of New York\u2019s identity. Thomas F. Prendergast, a former chairman of the transportation authority and a member of the Regional Plan Association\u2019s board, recalled that when he came to New York in the 1980s, a 24-hour subway system was one of the amenities of city living. \u201cIt became a staple, and people were dependent on it,\u201d he said.Still, he said the deterioration of the subway system should force a rethinking. It is no longer possible, he said, to do all the necessary work without closing down some of the lines.Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the transportation authority, noted that the agency already shuts down some lines on weekends, overnight or during off-peak daytime hours. The authority has also begun overnight closings earlier, at 10 p.m. rather than midnight.Members of the Regional Plan Association said the report was meant to spark conversation, not provide a rigid prescription for change. Indeed, even members of the group differed in their opinions about nighttime shutdowns. Scott Rechler, the group\u2019s chairman and a member of the M.T.A. board, said he opposed a permanent end to nighttime service.\u201cI think that doing so for short periods of time may be necessary to modernize the system quickly,\u201d he said, comparing the proposal to the temporary closings at Pennsylvania Station this summer that enabled emergency track repairs. \u201cHowever, New York City is, and always will be, the city that never sleeps, and that includes our subways.\u201dThe feasibility of replacing trains with buses raised questions, too. Mr. Moss noted that the transportation authority already used shuttle buses in place of train service during temporary station and line closures \u2014 with little success, he said.And although weeknight ridership makes up only a small fraction of overall ridership, the number of people who depend on overnight trains has increased. Between 2009 and 2016, weekday ridership between midnight and 6 a.m. increased 11 percent, according to Mr. Moss.Juan Colon Jr., 53, a lifelong resident of the Bronx, said he had begun waking up earlier and earlier because subway delays were causing him to be late to work. He now wakes up at 3:30 in the morning to catch a 5:30 train to his job in food service at Hudson Yards.At that time, he said, the platform is already packed.\u201cEverybody\u2019s getting up earlier,\u201d Mr. Colon said.Atlanta Amado Foresyth, 46, a singer, said she rode the subway after midnight at least four nights a week, traveling from gigs at restaurants or private events to her home in Long Island City, Queens.If the proposal becomes reality, she said, \u201cthe city will shut down.\u201d\u201cThe city will cease to be what it\u2019s known for,\u201d she said.Carolyn Gainey, 55, said just the notion offended her. Ms. Gainey, who lives in Queens, works as a manager at a professional development company and sometimes leaves work after midnight.\u201cPlanning to do that,\u201d she said, \u201cis saying that the system is just not going to work for some people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cairo, Vibrant and Budget-Friendly, Is Ready Again for the World Stage", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrugal travelerThe Egyptian capital is as engaging as ever \u2014 and is a particularly great destination for bargain seekers.Omar pulled up in his red Toyota on the edge of the traffic circle in Tahrir Square, where just six years earlier, he and tens of thousands of other Egyptians had converged to protest the presidency of Hosni Mubarak. I hopped in and we sped north up the Nile Corniche, windows down, taking in the lights of downtown Cairo and enjoying the softest of breezes coming off the Nile \u2014 after another 95-degree day, any respite was welcome. A couple of logistical notes before leaving the airport: I picked up a SIM card in the lobby \u2014 eight gigabytes of data from Vodafone set me back 130 pounds (a little over $7). Also, don\u2019t worry about getting a visa ahead of time: American citizens can purchase a visa stamp upon arrival for $25 at a kiosk before passport control.I arrived at the Berlin Hotel, on the fourth floor of a dusty old colonial style building in the heart of central Cairo \u2014 it was a bit more shabby than chic, but the owner spoke English well and the staff was responsive. My room was huge, with two big balconies overlooking the city and, thankfully, a mostly functioning heirloom of an air conditioner. Moreover, the price couldn\u2019t be beat: Less than $20 per night. It also was a great home base for exploring the city, close to the functional (but limited) subway, more upscale attractions on Gezira Island, in the middle of the Nile, and with easy access to the beautiful churches and mosques on the city\u2019s east side. After paying 80 pounds for a ticket, which included museum access (and another 2-pound ticket for the driver\u2019s car), I ventured out in the dry midday heat to explore the pyramid. You\u2019re not allowed to enter Djoser itself, but can explore the surroundings and mortuary complex. You can also do what I did, if you\u2019re so inclined, and hire one of the local men hanging around the site to take you on a quick horse or camel ride.\u201cCan I climb the pyramid?\u201d I joked to Ahmed, who was sitting on his horse, Amira. \u201cYou? You are too heavy,\u201d he replied. After a minute of bargaining, I paid Ahmed 150 pounds for a ride into the surrounding desert, where we could see the Giza pyramids from afar. It was slightly more than I wanted to pay, but he was a nice guy and it was a fun opportunity. (Take care to have small bills when traveling around Cairo \u2014 you don\u2019t want to find yourself in a bargaining situation and then need to ask for change.)My next stop, within the same complex, was the Imhotep Museum, home to decorative masks, a wooden sarcophagus of Imhotep himself, and a mummy of King Merenre I from the 23rd century B.C.; it is said to be the oldest complete royal mummy in existence and is in amazingly good condition. Heading back toward the city, I had my Uber driver drop me off on the southern tip of Rhoda Island, one of two large Nile islands in Cairo. Three hours had elapsed since he first picked me up. The total cost was 183 pounds, or about $10 \u2014 a huge savings over a tour.I made a beeline for the Nilometer, a 9th-century tool that gives insight into the crucial role the Nile played in the health and productivity of the city. The Nilometer building houses a big pit that plunges deep below sea level, connected to the river through a system of tunnels. An octagonal column rises up from the bottom of the pit \u2014 a measuring stick, so to speak, of the flood levels of the mighty river. Though it is no longer in use, the Nilometer remains an elegant reminder of the past, with an intricate domed ceiling dotted with a series of small windows. Admission was just 15 pounds.I walked up El-Malek El-Saleh Street, observing the daily life of the city: Kids splashing in the Nile, daring others to jump off a small footbridge; the harsh clang of metal plates that signaled the coming of a tamarind juice peddler (I paid a few pounds for a glass of the tasty but exceedingly sweet nectar). I bought a quick cup of tea and bottle of water (10 pounds total) at a small cafe on the corner of Al Miqyas and Al Malik Al Mozafar with \u201cBonjorno\u201d scrawled on a green awning before heading back over the river.Getting back to downtown Cairo was easy on the subway. It was a bit of a scrum buying a ticket (4 pounds) but the trip up to Jamal Abdulnasser station took about 20 minutes. Not all attractions are as easily accessible by train, though: From downtown, you\u2019ll want to go by car to the fantastic Saladin Citadel of Cairo (admission, 60 pounds), which I visited one afternoon. The massive fortification, built by Saladin in 1176 to ward off Crusaders, was the seat of Egypt\u2019s government for nearly seven centuries. It contains the Muhammad Ali mosque which, while not the oldest or most historically important mosque in the city (it\u2019s not even 200 years old), is still worth a visit. Its position in the citadel, perched high above the city below, means the views are dazzling.Three cups of strong mint tea and two water pipes stuffed with a sticky tobacco-and-molasses mixture ended up costing just 35 pounds. We discussed money, history, religion (Ibrahim and his wife are Coptic) and, of course, politics \u2014 From Nasser to Sisi (the current president) and everyone in between. Between plumes of smoke from the hookah, we watched cars race toward downtown and wondered about the future of Cairo \u2014 a city that has struggled to find its footing these past six years, but is striving once again to retake its place on the world\u2019s stage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Republicans Rallied Together to Deliver a Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The sting of failure on health care still lingered in the Senate on Aug. 3, when Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, summoned the Republican members of the Budget Committee to his office. We need to pass a tax bill this fall, Mr. McConnell told his colleagues, and we need a budget that allows us to do that.There was no dissent.Within two months, party leaders had hammered out a budget that steamrolled their previous concerns over adding to the federal budget deficit, in order to pave the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. In rapid order, the budget passed the Senate, then the House, putting Republicans on track to deliver a tax bill at breakneck speed to President Trump\u2019s desk by Christmas.The $1.5 trillion bill represents the most sweeping overhaul of the United States tax code in decades, delivering deep and permanent cuts to corporations and temporary tax cuts to individuals. Early Wednesday morning, Republicans claimed victory as the Senate voted 51-48 to pass the bill, which the House passed on Tuesday 227 to 203.But in many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show. Economic analyses predict it will add more than $1 trillion to budget deficits over the next decade, an amount that would betray the party\u2019s longstanding messaging that mounting federal debt will sap economic growth.Republicans spurned those concerns, rallying around what has been the animating ideology of their party since the Reagan era: that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity. More immediately, they followed an overwhelming desire to notch a legislative \u201cwin\u201d for the president, their donors, the restless voters of their party base and for their own political fortunes.\u201cThere was never a moment where I thought, \u2018Oh, my gosh, we\u2019re going to fail at this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Toomey said in an interview. \u201cThere were many moments I thought, \u2018This is still an open question.\u2019\u201dWhat there never was, in the minds of Republican leaders, was doubt the bill would pass \u2014 not even in the scattered moments over the past several weeks when individual senators held it up to demand changes.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a single person say, \u2018If you don\u2019t do this, I\u2019m going to vote no.\u2019\u201dThe House approved the final version of the bill on Tuesday afternoon over the opposition of 12 Republicans and every Democrat who cast a vote. Because of a procedural issue, the House will have to vote again on Wednesday, but the bill is expected to land on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk within days.On the House floor, Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s voice cracked as he signaled victory.\u201cMy colleagues, this is a day I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Tuesday, in teeing up a vote he had worked toward his entire career. \u201cToday, we are giving the people of this country their money back.\u201dTo get to that moment, Republicans walled themselves off from criticism, convincing one another that unfavorable economic analyses of their bill were wrong, and that its poor poll numbers would improve once the cuts worked their way into Americans\u2019 paychecks.The schedule minimized time back home for members, allowing them to largely avoid the contentious town hall meetings that helped sink their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They caught a break when Democrats reached a deal with Mr. Trump to keep the government open in early fall, freeing up valuable legislative time to push the tax bill forward.Mr. Trump pushed party leaders again and again to deliver a bill quickly, and for the most part, he let them write it, intervening only to push for a low corporate rate and to nix an idea to meddle with tax-advantaged 401(k) plans. At times, the president would briefly derail the process with stray and unexpected Twitter posts that sent lawmakers and his own staff scrambling to reconsider major parts of the plan.In the end, the bill met nearly every deadline in an \u201coptimistic\u201d timeline party leaders prepared in early October. That timeline called for House and Senate votes on a conference committee bill to occur Dec. 18. It was off by a day.Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders have laid the groundwork for a large tax bill for years, but their efforts stalled in the early months of the Trump administration, as the party engaged in a high-visibility effort to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law. That effort crashed to the ground in the early hours of July 28, when Mr. McCain and Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine broke from their Republican colleagues in a dramatic late-night defeat for party leaders.Republicans took fire from the party\u2019s base, which had voted for Republicans in large part over health care concerns, from conservative donors and from the president himself. Congressional aides said that criticism galvanized lawmakers, almost immediately, to rally behind what at that point was still only the broad outlines of a tax plan \u2014 but which Mr. McConnell and others saw as the key to appeasing furious Republican voters.A congressional aide said the health care failure united Republicans toward a single goal: tax cuts.At the time of the health care collapse, Republicans had made little public progress toward a tax bill, and it appeared on the back burner. The White House had released a one-page memo in April outlining its priorities. The House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, a low-key business advocate better known for his work on health care, had put forth a tax-reform framework. But conservative groups had spent months killing one of its core provisions, a so-called border adjustment that would have effectively taxed imports, raising an estimated $1 trillion over a decade to help offset the revenues lost from reducing tax rates.When Mr. Brady and Mr. Ryan officially abandoned that provision in late July, Republicans faced a difficult question: How would they raise enough revenues in a tax bill to ensure they did not add further to the federal budget deficit, after complaining throughout the Obama administration that deficits and debt were choking the economy?The answer was, they did not.This was the first critical decision Republicans made to keep on their accelerated timeline: They embraced a budget that allowed for much higher deficits, on the assumption that their tax cuts would generate enough new growth and revenues to pay for themselves.A few senators voiced concerns about the possibility of adding more to the debt. They included Mr. Corker of Tennessee, a member of the Budget Committee, who announced this year he was not going to run for re-election and got into a public Twitter fight with Mr. Trump.Mr. Corker was one of the committee members who gathered in Mr. McConnell\u2019s office in August and were charged with writing a budget document that would accelerate passage of the tax bill. Congressional leaders and administration officials had already agreed to utilize the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate and approve a bill entirely on party lines. To do that, they needed a budget, which would include a limit on how much the tax cuts in the bill could add to the budget deficit over the next decade.The Senate passed the bill 51-48, with every Republican present voting yes.Many senators, led by Mr. Toomey, wanted a $2.5 trillion limit, which was less than Mr. Trump had proposed in his campaign tax plan but would all but ensure an immediate return to $1 trillion a year deficits.At Mr. McConnell\u2019s request, Mr. Toomey negotiated for weeks with Mr. Corker, and they eventually compromised on a $1.5 trillion limit. Mr. Toomey convinced many of his colleagues, including Mr. McConnell, that the bill could easily produce enough growth to offset those lost revenues \u2014 an estimate that no detailed economic analysis of the bill has yet supported.\u201cFor some time there was a lot of talk from a lot of sources that tax reform had to score as revenue neutral,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI was 100 percent certain we would never get it done if we held ourselves to that constraint, and furthermore that there was no need to hold ourselves to that constraint.\u201dMr. Corker felt $1.5 trillion was the best deal he could get, and he worried that if he refused, party leaders would bypass his committee and allow a vote on a budget with a much larger tax-cut cap.\u201cHindsight being 2020,\u201d Mr. Corker said this week, \u201cI wish we had attempted to limit even more on that front end.\u201dA significant moment came in September, when Mr. Trump cut a deal with the Democratic leaders, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, to prevent a government shutdown and raise the federal debt limit. Republicans say the move averted a protracted fight in both chambers, and left Republican leaders optimistic that they could move quickly on a tax bill by fall.In the Senate, groups of members and their staff met on an almost daily basis to work through individual provisions in the bill to come.By the end of the month, top congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump had released a more detailed framework, identifying a 20 percent corporate tax rate, down from a high of 35 percent today.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.But Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan pushed back on administration officials, including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, when they attempted to release even more details, such as the break points for individual tax rates. That move, congressional staff said, gave House and Senate tax writers more freedom to craft their own bills and avoid getting boxed into proposals that could prove problematic.The House and Senate approved Mr. Corker and Mr. Toomey\u2019s budget compromise in October. House leaders introduced their bill at the start of November, and it sailed to passage two weeks later. Senators released their bill before Thanksgiving and quickly amended it in two controversial ways: To stay within the budget guidelines, they set individual tax cuts to expire at the end of 2025. And to free up more space for tax cuts, they eliminated the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate for health insurance coverage.To the surprise of their aides, senators embraced both changes.Mr. Trump beat a public drum for the tax bill throughout the process, but he engaged selectively on policy details, often over Twitter, sometimes backed with phone calls. He urged lawmakers to eliminate the mandate, and he scuttled a proposal in the House that would have raised revenue by shifting the tax treatment of some popular retirement contributions.On a long trip to Asia, Mr. Trump often called Mr. Brady to discuss the bills. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump stayed behind to lobby senators, and she helped push for an expansion of the child tax credit that was added in the Senate Finance Committee.In late November, Mr. Trump flew to the St. Louis suburbs to rally for the tax bill on a stage decorated for the holidays. It was there that he unveiled what would become his tagline for the closing presidential push on the bill, promising Americans a tax cut for Christmas.Back in the Senate, key votes were falling into place. Mr. McCain, satisfied that the bill was moving through proper Senate channels, turned to an old friend to assess its effect on the economy. That was Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who had overseen economic policy on Mr. McCain\u2019s failed 2008 presidential campaign, who gave Mr. McCain a frame for considering the bill.\u201c\u2018This is first and foremost about giving better opportunity to workers,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin recalled Mr. McCain saying. \u201cI said, \u2018It\u2019s going to create some debt. It\u2019s going to have some deficits, no matter what you hear. So your question is, is it worth it?\u2019\u201dMr. McCain concluded it was. He announced his support for the bill before the Senate vote.That was a crucial moment, Mr. McConnell said. \u201cJohn was not there for us on Obamacare, and he was getting urged by everybody center-left,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cto do it to us one more time.\u201d Mr. McCain will ultimately not vote on the bill, having returned to Arizona for medical treatment.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.Ms. Collins also announced her support, after conversations with business owners in her state and with Mr. Holtz-Eakin, though she came away with the impression that the bill would pay for itself. Other wavering senators signed on \u2014 all but Mr. Corker, who was alone in being rattled by a Joint Committee on Taxation analysis that showed the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits even after accounting for additional growth. His lone no was not enough to stop the bill, even when coupled with every Democrat in the chamber, though it gave Republicans a slim margin for error. Mr. Corker later reversed course and said he would support the final version.As the bill raced through Congress, it sank in the eyes of the public. Majorities of Americans told pollsters they opposed it, and that they expected it would raise, not lower, their tax bills. Republicans told each other those polls would flip \u2014 that the country would come to love the bill when it saw its benefits.Democrats fanned the dissatisfaction, with constant complaints about the bill and its process. Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi thundered on the Senate and House floor that the bill would hurt middle-class Americans, clearly setting up a campaign theme for Democrats to embrace in the midterm elections.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he started the year with a sense of cautious optimism about tax policy but found Republicans unwilling to engage in a serious way.Mr. Wyden described a visit from Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, as a \u201cshow and tell\u201d and said that Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, never followed up on a promise to look into ways to make the tax plan more populist.Mr. McConnell and Mr. Toomey lamented that the bill was not bipartisan and thus was less likely to be enduring. Mr. Toomey said that Republican leaders talked seriously about working across the aisle, but that when Democratic senators sent a letter last summer with strict conditions for working with them, it was clear that Republicans would have to proceed on their own.The final negotiations this month were entirely between Republicans. The Senate version of the bill largely won out, but House leaders pushed, successfully, for an immediate cut of the corporate rate, which was raised slightly to 21 percent from 20 percent, and for a reduction in the top individual tax rate to 37 percent.Negotiations completed, Republicans congratulated each other for what they remain convinced will be seen as a landmark legislative victory. On Tuesday, a few hours before the final Senate vote on the bill, Mr. McConnell acknowledged that Democrats believe the bill will spark a backlash that could determine control of Congress.\u201cThey must believe it must be a political winner for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a political win for the country, and thus, it\u2019s going to be good for us. So we\u2019ll take it to the country and see what happens in 2018.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kenichi Yamamoto, Father of Mazda\u2019s Rotary Engine, Is Dead at 95", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKenichi Yamamoto, who led the engineering team that produced a commercially viable rotary engine at the company now known as Mazda Motor Company and later became its president and chairman, died on Dec. 20 in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo. He was 95.His death was confirmed by Mazda, which was called Toyo Kogyo until 1984.Mr. Yamamoto, a slim and intense mechanical engineer, began his career working in a Toyo Kogyo factory after World War II, but he soon shifted to engine design, which accelerated his rise in management.Around 1961, Toyo Kogyo\u2019s president asked Mr. Yamamoto to supervise a group of engineers who were trying to perfect the rotary engine that had been invented by a German engineer, Felix Wankel. With few moving parts, the rotary was a compact alternative to conventional engines, with their reciprocating pistons, connecting rods and crankshafts.The rotary represented opportunity and risk for Toyo Kogyo. Like other small Japanese automobile manufacturers, the company was under pressure from the country\u2019s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry to merge with larger companies to increase their overseas competitiveness. If the rotary engine succeeeded, it would allow Toyo Kogyo to maintain its independence.His team produced a successful engine: The prototype of a stylish rotary-powered coupe called the Cosmo made its debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1963. Mr. Yamamoto patiently talked about the Cosmo to visitors and then drove the car across Japan with Toyo Kogyo\u2019s president over two weeks.Rotary engines were mass produced and featured in the company\u2019s sporty compacts, but they had a significant flaw: poor fuel economy, which became a liability when energy crises struck in the early 1970s. Sales dropped, and the company was close to bankruptcy.In 1974, Mr. Yamamoto became the head of Toyo Kogyo\u2019s project to find fuel-saving innovations; he was adamant that the company could not abandon a breakthrough technology that set it apart from its competitors.\u201cIt would have announced to the world that what we had started doing was not good,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cAnd then we wouldn\u2019t have been able to succeed at anything \u2014 even just selling the piston engine.\u201dThe engine overhaul worked. The engine\u2019s fuel economy rose significantly. And sales of the rotary-powered Mazda RX-7 model soared.But while the rotary engines remained the hallmark of the company\u2019s innovation, the fuel shocks of the 1970s led it to rely increasingly on piston-engine vehicles, like the GLC.Mr. Yamamoto was born in Japan on Sept. 16, 1922, in Kumamoto Prefecture, on the southwestern island of Kyushu, and later moved with his family to Hiroshima, where Mazda has long had its headquarters. He graduated with a mechanical engineering degree from what was then called Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) and served in the Japanese Navy.The detonation of the first atomic bomb by the United States over Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killed Mr. Yamamoto\u2019s sister and destroyed the family\u2019s home. But his parents were still alive. He returned to Hiroshima and was hired by Toyo Kogyo to work at a plant outside the city that made transmissions for its three-wheeled trucks.His diligence and inquisitiveness placed him on a path to management.Don Sherman, a longtime automotive journalist, remembered Mr. Yamamoto as warm and candid. \u201cHe\u2019d greet you like a long-lost friend,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd he\u2019d ask you basic questions, like: \u2018What should Mazda do? Where should Mazda go?\u2019 \u201dIn 1985, after Mr. Yamamoto became president, he recommended that the company\u2019s board approve production of the car: the MX-5 Miata, which proved to be immensely popular.\u201cWe recognized that the guiding principles to which we have long subscribed in operating our company will be put to a real test here at Flat Rock,\u201d he said.The factory became a symbol of Mazda\u2019s continuing partnership with the Ford Motor Company, which bought 50 percent of the plant in 1992, augmenting its existing 25 percent stake in Mazda.Mr. Yamamoto stepped down that year after five years as chairman. Mazda\u2019s last mass-produced rotary-engine car was the 2012 RX-8.Information on his survivors was not immediately available.In 2003, Mr. Yamamoto reminisced about pioneering the rotary engine, which went on to power 1.8 million Mazda vehicles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bomber Strikes Near Times Square, Disrupting City but Killing None", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA would-be suicide attacker detonated a pipe bomb strapped to his body in the heart of Manhattan\u2019s busiest subway corridor on Monday, sending thousands of terrified commuters fleeing the smoke-choked passageways, and bringing the heart of Midtown to a standstill as hundreds of police officers converged on Times Square and the surrounding streets.But the makeshift weapon failed to fully detonate, and the attacker himself was the only one seriously injured in the blast, which unfolded just before 7:20 a.m.Law enforcement officials said the attacker, identified by the police as Akayed Ullah, 27, chose the location because of its Christmas-themed posters, a motive that recalled strikes in Europe, and he told investigators that he set off his bomb in retaliation for United States airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria and elsewhere.The explosion on Monday morning echoed through the subway tunnels just off Times Square and filled parts of the Port Authority Bus Terminal with smoke as commuters fled. Even as smoke still filled the chamber, Mr. Ullah was subdued by Port Authority police officers.After he was subdued, Mr. Ullah was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was in serious condition with burns to his hands and abdomen, according to Daniel A. Nigro, the commissioner of the New York Fire Department. Three other people had minor injuries, he said.On Monday afternoon, in his first remarks on the attack, President Trump assailed the current immigration system that allows for extended family members, and not just spouses or minor children, to receive green cards.\u201cThe terrible harm that this flawed system inflicts on America\u2019s security and economy has long been clear,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cI am determined to improve our immigration system to put our country and our people first.\u201dThe attack occurred in a long pedestrian walkway connecting the Eighth Avenue, Seventh Avenue and Broadway subway lines. Among the commuters traveling beneath Times Square was a man in a hooded sweatshirt. Then came a deafening boom \u2014 from him \u2014 and then smoke.The explosion occurred in the underground passageway connecting the Times Square and Port Authority subway stations in Manhattan.Everyone ran.Mr. Ullah had attached the pipe bomb to himself with a \u201ccombination of Velcro and zip ties,\u201d said James P. O\u2019Neill, the commissioner of the New York Police Department. It was crudely composed of a length of pipe stuffed with match heads, its ends stopped up. A broken Christmas tree light was the detonator: When lit, the filament ignited the match heads, the device powered by a nine-volt battery.The explosion, captured on surveillance video, burned and cut Mr. Ullah, but because it did not detonate properly, it did not produce shrapnel, often the deadliest element of a pipe bomb.\u201cI think he was prepared to die, and we see him connect the wires on the video,\u201d said a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the assessment of the suspect\u2019s actions was still preliminary.As people streamed through the station, Officer Anthony Manfredini of the Port Authority Police Department rushed toward the smoke, said Robert Egbert, a spokesman for the main police union that represents Port Authority officers. A former marine, Officer Manfredini, 28, found the suspect on the ground with \u201cvisible wires coming from his jacket into his pants,\u201d Mr. Egbert said.Three other Port Authority officers followed: Jack Collins, Sean Gallagher and Drew Preston. They arrived just as Mr. Ullah was \u201creaching for a cellphone,\u201d which the responding officers thought might be used to trigger another device, Mr. Egbert said. They dived and wrestled it from him.\u201cThese officers went into this situation blind, only becoming aware of the danger involved once they confronted the suspect,\u201d Mr. Egbert said.Police released a photo of Mr. Ullah that appeared to have been taken inside the subway walkway after the blast. In it, he is curled in a fetal position; his exposed stomach is blackened.Mayor Bill de Blasio found himself for the second time in two months calming the city after a terrorist attack, in this case, on the system that moves millions of people across the city every day.\u201cOur lives revolve around the subway,\u201d he said at a news conference on Eighth Avenue a few hours after the incident. \u201cThe choice of New York is always for a reason, because we are a beacon to the world. And we actually show that a society of many faiths and many backgrounds can work.\u201d\u201cThe terrorists want to undermine that,\u201d the mayor added. \u201cThey yearn to attack New York City.\u201dInvestigators, led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, believe Mr. Ullah acted alone, but they only have just begun to review materials from the searches and other leads.Christina Bethea was in the underground walkway, headed to her job as a security guard, when the explosion nearly knocked her over, sending a haze of smoke into the corridor packed with commuters. She did not see where it came from, she said. \u201cAs soon as we heard \u2018boom!\u2019 we began to run,\u201d she said. An hour after the attack, she stood outside the bus terminal, calling her mother and father in North Carolina to tell them she was O.K. \u201cI feel good,\u201d Ms. Bethea said. \u201cI am alive!\u201dAll morning, thwarted travelers spilled into the streets of Times Square, towing suitcases in bewildered silence. They gathered at police cordons stretched across the city\u2019s most trafficked thoroughfares, boulevards vacant at the height of the holiday season, and filmed the red lights of scores of emergency vehicles.On Monday morning, police searched a six-story apartment building where Mr. Ullah may have lived with his parents on Ocean Parkway, as well as two other residences. At around 11 a.m. officers led a woman in a dark coat from the Ocean Parkway home, a gray hijab covering her hair, into a patrol car, and sped off. The area is home to a few thousand Bangladeshi-born residents, and it represents the heart of their Brooklyn community, with stores and mosques built along Church Avenue.Mr. Ullah is a permanent United States resident, according to Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, having arrived in 2011.The method of attack \u2014 self-detonation, or the attempt at least \u2014 introduces something of a new element to a long history of the city as target, a place that has yet somehow avoided the bomb-wearing attackers that are the hallmark of terrorism in places like Israel and Nigeria.Since the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, there have been about 26 terrorist plots against the city that officials have identified as being thwarted \u201cthrough intelligence, investigation and interdiction,\u201d John J. Miller, the Police Department\u2019s commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference on Monday.But more recently, the string of foiled plots gave way to closer calls.In 2009, law enforcement authorities prevented a cell of people with ties to operatives of Al Qaeda from carrying out plans to bomb subway trains. A year later, in May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani immigrant, tried to detonate a truck with explosives in Times Square \u2014 but his devices did not go off.In September 2016, a crude homemade explosive crafted from a pressure cooker packed with shrapnel was left on 23rd Street in Chelsea, exploding but killing no one. Before Monday, the last attack was on Halloween, when a man spurred by Islamic State propaganda drove a rental truck down a bicycle path on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The man, Sayfullo Saipov, was arrested and charged by federal prosecutors; he has pleaded not guilty.While no formal announcement had been made, both federal and local law enforcement officials indicated that Mr. Ullah would be prosecuted in federal court in Manhattan by the office of the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim.But by Monday afternoon, the city was busy forgetting. On 42nd Street, tourists strolled unperturbed, or hurried into the reopened bus depot to catch their rides.Just hours before, John Frank had stood on that street by the Port Authority exit when he felt tremors through the pavement. \u201cThat\u2019s how strong it was,\u201d said Mr. Frank, 54. Shaken, he fled a flew blocks away, and stood for a few long minutes, leaning against a garbage can for support.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of an explosion in Chelsea in September 2016. It was on 23rd Street, not 27th Street, where an undetonated device was found later that night.Reporting was contributed by Al Baker, Christina Caron, Jonah Engel Bromwich, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed, Winnie Hu, Joseph Goldstein, Sean Piccoli, Liz Robbins, Brian Rosenthal, Nate Schweber and John Surico.

{"Headline": "Inside Trump\u2019s Hour-by-Hour Battle for Self-Preservation", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "Trump\u2019s WayWith Twitter as his Excalibur, the president takes on his doubters, powered by long spells of cable news and a dozen Diet Cokes. But if Mr. Trump has yet to bend the presidency to his will, he is at least wrestling it to a draw.Supported byEnergized, infuriated \u2014 often a gumbo of both \u2014 Mr. Trump grabs his iPhone. Sometimes he tweets while propped on his pillow, according to aides. Other times he tweets from the den next door, watching another television. Less frequently, he makes his way up the hall to the ornate Treaty Room, sometimes dressed for the day, sometimes still in night clothes, where he begins his official and unofficial calls.\u201cHe feels like there\u2019s an effort to undermine his election and that collusion allegations are unfounded,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who has spent more time with the president than most lawmakers. \u201cHe believes passionately that the liberal left and the media are out to destroy him. The way he got here is fighting back and counterpunching.\u201cThe problem he\u2019s going to face,\u201d Mr. Graham added, \u201cis there\u2019s a difference between running for the office and being president. You\u2019ve got to find that sweet spot between being a fighter and being president.\u201dBracing and refreshing to his alienated-from-the-system political base, Mr. Trump\u2019s uninhibited approach seems erratic to many veterans of both parties in the capital and beyond. Some politicians and pundits lament the instability and, even without medical degrees, feel no compunction about publicly diagnosing various mental maladies.After months of legislative failures, Mr. Trump is on the verge of finally prevailing in his efforts to cut taxes and reverse part of his predecessor\u2019s health care program. While much of what he has promised remains undone, he has made significant progress in his goal of rolling back business and environmental regulations. The growing economy he inherited continues to improve, and stock markets have soared to record heights. His partial travel ban on mainly Muslim countries has finally taken effect after multiple court fights.Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, has told associates that Mr. Trump, deeply set in his ways at age 71, will never change. Rather, he predicted, Mr. Trump would bend, and possibly break, the office to his will.That has proved half true. Mr. Trump, so far, has arguably wrestled the presidency to a draw.Mr. Kelly is trying, quietly and respectfully, to reduce the amount of free time the president has for fiery tweets by accelerating the start of his workday. Mr. Priebus also tried, with only modest success, to encourage Mr. Trump to arrive by 9 or 9:30 a.m.The pace of meetings has increased. Beyond Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kushner, they often include Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior adviser; Hope Hicks, the communications director; Robert Porter, the staff secretary; and Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor.Mr. Trump, who enjoyed complete control over his business empire, has made significant concessions after trying to micromanage his first months in office. Despite chafing at the limits, the president actually craves the approval of Mr. Kelly, whom he sees as a peer, people close to Mr. Trump said.He calls Mr. Kelly up to a dozen times a day, even four or five times during dinner or a golf outing, to ask about his schedule or seek policy advice, according to people who have spoken with the president. The new system gives him \u201ctime to think,\u201d he said when it began. White House aides denied that Mr. Trump seeks Mr. Kelly\u2019s blessing, but confirmed that he views him as a crucial confidant and sounding board. Mr. Kelly has also adopted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite grievances, telling the president recently that he agrees that some reporters are interested only in taking down the administration.At times, Mr. Trump has been able to circumvent Mr. Kelly. Over Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago, the president mingled with guests the way he had before the election. Some passed him news clips that would never get around Mr. Kelly\u2019s filters. And he dialed old friends, receiving updates about how they see the Russia investigation. He returned to Washington fired up.Mr. Kelly has told people he will try to control only what he can. As he has learned, there is much that he cannot.For most of the year, people inside and outside Washington have been convinced that there is a strategy behind Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. But there is seldom a plan apart from pre-emption, self-defense, obsession and impulse.Occasionally, the president solicits affirmation before hitting the \u201ctweet\u201d button. In June, according to a longtime adviser, he excitedly called friends to say he had the perfect tweet to neutralize the Russia investigation. He would call it a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d They were unimpressed.He has bowed to advice from his lawyers by not attacking Mr. Mueller, but at times his instincts prevail.When three former campaign advisers were indicted or pleaded guilty this fall, Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer handling the investigation, urged the president not to respond. If he did, it would only elevate the story.Mr. Trump, however, could not help himself. He tweeted that the financial charges lodged against his former campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort, had nothing to do with the campaign and that investigators should be examining \u201cCrooked Hillary & the Dems\u201d instead. By the next morning, he was belittling George Papadopoulos, the campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying about his outreach to Russians, dismissing him as a \u201clow level volunteer\u201d who has \u201cproven to be a liar.\u201dHe was calm at first when his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty. The next morning, as he visited Manhattan for Republican fund-raisers, he was upbeat. He talked about his election and the \u201cmajor loser\u201d in the Senate who had said his tax bill would add to the deficit (presumably meaning Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee).By Sunday morning, with news shows consumed by Mr. Flynn\u2019s case, the president grew angry and fired off a series of tweets excoriating Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I., tweets that several advisers told him were problematic and needed to stop, according to a person briefed on the discussion.Once he posts controversial messages, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers sometimes decide not to raise them with him. One adviser said that aides to the president needed to stay positive and look for silver linings wherever they could find them, and that the West Wing team at times resolved not to let the tweets dominate their day.The ammunition for his Twitter war is television. No one touches the remote control except Mr. Trump and the technical support staff \u2014 at least that\u2019s the rule. During meetings, the 60-inch screen mounted in the dining room may be muted, but Mr. Trump keeps an eye on scrolling headlines. What he misses he checks out later on what he calls his \u201cSuper TiVo,\u201d a state-of-the-art system that records cable news.Watching cable, he shares thoughts with anyone in the room, even the household staff he summons via a button for lunch or for one of the dozen Diet Cokes he consumes each day.\u201cI do not watch much television,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI know they like to say \u2014 people that don\u2019t know me \u2014 they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources \u2014 you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don\u2019t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I\u2019m reading documents a lot.\u201dTo an extent that would stun outsiders, Mr. Trump, the most talked-about human on the planet, is still delighted when he sees his name in the headlines. And he is on a perpetual quest to see it there. One former top adviser said Mr. Trump grew uncomfortable after two or three days of peace and could not handle watching the news without seeing himself on it.During the morning, aides monitor \u201cFox & Friends\u201d live or through a transcription service in much the way commodities traders might keep tabs on market futures to predict the direction of their day.If someone on the show says something memorable and Mr. Trump does not immediately tweet about it, the president\u2019s staff knows he may be saving Fox News for later viewing on his recorder and instead watching MSNBC or CNN live \u2014 meaning he is likely to be in a foul mood to start the day.Yet the image of him in a constant rage belies a deeper complexity for a man who runs in bellow-and-banter cycles. Several advisers said the president may curse them for a minor transgression \u2014 like bringing an unknown aide into his presence without warning \u2014 then make amiable small talk with the same person minutes later.\u201cHe is very aware that he is only the 45th person to hold that job,\u201d Ms. Conway said. \u201cThe job has changed him a bit, and he has changed the job. His time as president has revealed other, more affable and accessible, parts and pieces of him that may have been hidden from view during a rough and tumble primary.\u201dFew get to see those other parts and pieces. In private moments with the families of appointees in the Oval Office, the president engages with children in a softer tone than he takes in public, and he specifically asked that the children of the White House press corps be invited in as they visited on Halloween. Yet he does little to promote that side, some longtime friends say, because it cracks the veneer of strength that he relishes.According to a senator and an aide, the president then looked around the room and asked puckishly, \u201cAren\u2019t you glad I don\u2019t drink?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s difficult adjustment to the presidency, people close to him say, is rooted in an unrealistic expectation of its powers, which he had assumed to be more akin to the popular image of imperial command than the sloppy reality of having to coexist with two other branches of government.But while he is unlikely to change who he is on a fundamental level, advisers said they saw a novice who was gradually learning that the presidency does not work that way. And he is coming to realize, they said, the need to woo, not whack, leaders of his own party to get things done.During his early months in office, he barked commands at senators, which did not go over well. \u201cI don\u2019t work for you, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Corker once snapped back, according to a Republican with knowledge of the exchange.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, likewise bristled when Mr. Trump cut in during methodical presentations in the Oval Office. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me,\u201d Mr. McConnell told the president during a discussion of health care.\u201cAt first, there was a thread of being an impostor that may have been in his mind,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, who has tried to forge a working relationship with the president.\u201cHe\u2019s overcome that by now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bigger problem, the thing people need to understand, is that he was utterly unprepared for this. It would be like you or me going into a room and being asked to perform brain surgery. When you have a lack of knowledge as great as his, it can be bewildering.\u201dMr. Graham, once a fierce critic and now increasingly an ally, said Mr. Trump was adjusting. \u201cYou can expect every president to change because the job requires you to change,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s learning the rhythm of the town.\u201d But Mr. Graham added that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency was still \u201ca work in progress.\u201d At this point, he said, \u201ceverything\u2019s possible, from complete disaster to a home run.\u201dIn almost all the interviews, Mr. Trump\u2019s associates raised questions about his capacity and willingness to differentiate bad information from something that is true.Monitoring his information consumption \u2014 and countering what Mr. Kelly calls \u201cgarbage\u201d peddled to him by outsiders \u2014 remains a priority for the chief of staff and the team he has made his own. Even after a year of official briefings and access to the best minds of the federal government, Mr. Trump is skeptical of anything that does not come from inside his bubble.Some advisers, like the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, consider this a fundamentally good thing. \u201cI see a lot of similarities between the way he was running the campaign and the way he is as president,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cHe really loves verbal briefings. He is not one to consume volumes of books or briefings.\u201dOther aides bemoan his tenuous grasp of facts, jack-rabbit attention span and propensity for conspiracy theories.The president became visibly agitated as she spoke. \u201cRoy Cohn was my lawyer!\u201d he exclaimed, referring to the legendary McCarthy-era fixer who mentored Mr. Trump in the 1980s, suggesting that was the type of defender he needed now.At another point, Mr. Kelly interrupted. She was not \u201chelping things,\u201d he said, according to the person briefed. Even Mr. Trump eventually tired of Ms. Pirro\u2019s screed and walked out of the room, according to the person.Mr. Trump is an avid newspaper reader who still marks up a half-dozen papers with comments in black Sharpie pen, but Mr. Bannon has told allies that Mr. Trump only \u201creads to reinforce.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on defining his own reality \u2014 his repeated claims, for example, that he actually won the popular vote \u2014 is immutable and has had a \u201cnumbing effect\u201d on people who work with him, said Tony Schwartz, his ghostwriter on \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\u201cHe wears you down,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said.In August, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Schiller for a newspaper article he had heard about. After Mr. Trump mentioned the article to Mr. Kelly, the chief of staff dispatched two aides to investigate how it had gotten to the president without being cleared. Mr. Schiller acknowledged providing the contraband newsprint. Mr. Kelly thanked him tersely for coming forward, according to two people Mr. Schiller later told.Since then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration at Mr. Schiller\u2019s absence, telling a visiting lawmaker that his Oval Office suite now seems \u201cempty.\u201d The departure of other familiar faces has been equally unsettling.Once this fall, Mr. Trump lashed out at an aide he had not seen for weeks, asking, \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d When the aide told him that Mr. Kelly had limited the meetings he could attend, the president cooled off and said, \u201cOh, O.K.,\u201d according to an aide told of the exchange.If Mr. Kelly knows he cannot always control access, he is intent on at least knowing who is peddling what to his boss. He reserves the right to listen to calls coming to the president through the White House switchboard. To some callers, Mr. Kelly politely promises to forward messages. On calls he cannot monitor personally, Mr. Kelly or a deputy will usually double-back to debrief the caller on any promises the president may have made in unguarded moments.Mr. Trump seeks release on the golf course on weekends. But on weekdays, his principal mode of blowing off steam is his nightly dinner in the White House residence, which begins at 6:30 or 7 p.m. with a guest list organized by the ever-vigilant Mr. Kelly.\u201cI can invite anyone for dinner, and they will come!\u201d Mr. Trump marveled to an old friend when he took office.Mr. Trump has always relished gossiping over plates of well-done steak, salad slathered with Roquefort dressing and bacon crumbles, tureens of gravy and massive slices of dessert with extra ice cream.He needs support, a sounding board and, as a lifelong hotelier, guests. Mr. Trump is naturally garrulous, and loves to give White House tours. He has an odd affinity for showing off bathrooms, including one he renovated near the Oval Office, and enjoys pulling dinner companions into the Lincoln Bedroom or onto the Truman Balcony for the postcard view of the city he has disrupted.Over the summer, he invited four Democratic lawmakers and immediately peppered them with questions as they strolled through the Diplomatic Reception Room.\u201cWho is going to run against me in 2020?\u201d he asked, according to a person in attendance. \u201cCrooked Hillary? Pocahontas?\u201d \u2014 his caustic nickname for Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, who once claimed Native American heritage in a law school directory.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the president opined, would definitely run \u2014 \u201ceven if he\u2019s in a wheelchair,\u201d Mr. Trump added, making a scrunched-up body of a man in a wheelchair.Mr. Trump still takes shots at Mark Cuban, a fellow rich-guy reality star, and expresses disappointment that Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback, has distanced himself. But he spends much of his time now puzzling over political options and wrestling with the terrifying responsibilities of the presidency.Even when Mr. Trump is in a lighthearted mood, hints of anxiety waft over the table like steam over a teacup. In September, he met with evangelical leaders to reassure them that he would still pursue their agenda despite a flirtation with Democrats.\u201cThe Christians know all the things I\u2019m doing for them, right?\u201d he asked, according to three attendees, who reported praising his positions on issues like abortion and Planned Parenthood.When the guests depart, the remote control comes back out. He is less likely to tweet at this hour, when the news he would react to is mostly recycled from hours earlier. But he watches Ms. Pirro and her fellow Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and sometimes \u201chate-watches\u201d CNN to get worked up, especially Don Lemon.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s friends have noticed a different pitch, acknowledging that many aides and even his own relatives could be hurt by Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. As for himself, he has adopted a surprisingly fatalistic attitude, according to several people he speaks with regularly.\u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d he said of the investigation.From there it is off to bed for what usually amounts to five or six hours of sleep. Then the television will be blaring again, he will reach for his iPhone and the battle will begin anew.Glenn Thrush contributed to this article before he was suspended pending the result of an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior.

{"Headline": "Peru\u2019s President Faces Possible Ouster in Corruption Scandal", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 Lawmakers voted on Friday to begin proceedings that could oust President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru, the latest leader accused of involvement in a corruption scandal that has shaken some of Latin America\u2019s biggest countries.The dispute involves Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction giant, which last year admitted to paying roughly $800 million in payoffs in exchange for lucrative projects. That revelation set off a flurry of investigations by prosecutors and lawmakers, principally in Latin America, seeking to learn who was on the receiving end of the payments.According to documents sent to Congress and released this week, Odebrecht paid $782,000 in advisory fees to Westfield Capital, a company Mr. Kuczynski owns. Most of the payments occurred between 2004 and 2007, while Mr. Kuczynski served as Peru\u2019s economy minister and prime minister.On Friday, lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to move ahead with proceedings next week that could remove Mr. Kuczynski from office, on the grounds that he is \u201cmorally handicapped.\u201d They scheduled a hearing for Thursday, at which Mr. Kuczynski is expected to present a defense.\u201cThis scandal has highlighted the moral misery of our political regime,\u201d Alberto Quintanilla, a lawmaker with the New Peru party, said before the vote.Mr. Kucynski\u2019s opponents would need a two-thirds majority to remove him. The vote on Friday was 97 to 17.\u201cBy Christmas we will probably have a new president,\u201d Eduardo Dargent, a political-science professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, said before the vote. He noted that Mr. Kucynski\u2019s party holds only a few seats in Congress to defend him. Unlike impeachment proceedings, the ouster proposed by lawmakers would not require a lengthy trial, he said.Mr. Kuczynski, 79, has refused to step down. On Thursday night the president gave a speech in which he said he had done nothing wrong, but he did not deny that payments were made. \u201cI\u2019m not running, I\u2019m not hiding, I have no reason to do so,\u201d he said.Mr. Kuczynski said he had invoices for the transactions, adding that while Westfield Capital did belong to him, he had not managed it personally. He said he had reported the transactions to the authorities in January and had not signed any contracts with Odebrecht.\u201cI am an honest man and have been all my life,\u201d he added.Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s center-right Peruvians for Change party holds only 18 of the legislature\u2019s 130 seats. His main rival, Keiko Fujimori, lost to him in the last presidential election, in June 2016, but maintains a large majority in the legislature through her right-wing Popular Force party.In September, the opposition party flexed its muscles by staging a no-confidence vote against the president, and calling for the entire cabinet to resign and for Mr. Kuczynski to pick new ministers.\u201cThe president increasingly appears unlikely to serve out his term in office,\u201d wrote Fernando Freijedo, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit, in a note to clients on Friday.Mr. Kuczynski is the latest in a growing list of leaders who have been accused or sentenced to crimes related to the scandal.Two former Peruvian presidents also face charges of accepting bribes, with one in jail and another at large.Prosecutors have said Odebrecht paid bribes on 100 projects in more than a dozen countries, in one case buying a local bank branch to hide the transactions, and even opening a division dedicated to payoffs.Throughout Latin America, the company built bridges, dams, power plants and roads, along with a highway linking Brazil and Peru that greatly exceeded its budget. Nearly three years of investigations have prompted at least 77 Brazilian Odebrecht executives to sign plea deals, and led to the imprisonment of the company\u2019s former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht.Andrea Zarate reported from Lima, and Nicholas Casey from Hanga Roa, Chile.Advertisement"}

The abolishing of deductions for state and local taxes, which could sharply raise Californians\u2019 tax bill, is another.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Gonzalo Freixes, a tax expert at the U.C.L.A. Anderson School of Management. \u201cIt could have spiraling consequences \u2014 the economy, the real estate market, revenues to local governments \u2014 it goes further and further into things where it could have a negative impact.\u201dBut the sweeping tax bill extends well beyond headline changes.The House bill called for the elimination of the tax credit for electric vehicles, a potentially big blow for Tesla, which has large manufacturing facilities in California.Under the Senate bill, single filers earning $160,000 to around $200,000, of whom there are many in coastal California, would see their top marginal tax rate increase to 32 percent from 28 percent.Research universities like Stanford, Berkeley, U.C.L.A. and Caltech would likely be hit by the repeal of deductions for graduate students and a new tax on endowment income. Executives wanting to pursue a midcareer M.B.A. might reconsider; the House bill removes deductions for professional education courses.\u201cThese things have big consequences,\u201d said Ken Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\u201cIt makes the decision of staying in California much more difficult,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cIt\u2019s already difficult, it\u2019s already expensive. This adds one more negative.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to use that money to invest more in the U.S. than they already have,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Some readers wrote of how they were worried about rising rents and home prices from the lack of available housing in their neighborhoods.

Until we allow for apartment buildings in single-family home-exclusive districts, gentrification will continue to ravage our neighborhoods, our friends, our support networks.\u2014 Victoria Fierce in OaklandThese higher-density homes and apartments have not decreased the value of the single-family homes.

People who have been here forever and can never afford to move are seeing an almost immediate turnover of their community. It\u2019s scary for them. When Kurt talked about his vegetables he wasn\u2019t being so literal; he was describing the loss of an old and interdependent network of supportive and caring folks: a neighborhood.\u2014 Daniel Rosenthal in BerkeleyThis agenda does not promote affordable housing, it promotes developer profits.

{"Headline": "Focus on Shareholders Holds Back U.S. Wage Growth", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe economy appears to be at full employment with a jobless rate of 4.1 percent, but that hasn\u2019t put pressure on pay yet. Average hourly wages were up 2.5 percent in November from a year earlier, the same pace that has prevailed for more than two years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. Most analysts think the numbers virtually ensure that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by another quarter point next week, but a Goldilocks economy of modest wage growth should keep further tightening gradual and reassure markets.Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, told CNBC on Friday that tax cuts would usher in a long period of wage growth. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has said the proposed corporate rate cut to 20 percent from 35 percent, combined with full expensing for capital investments, would increase average household income by at least $4,000 a year after a decade.Try telling that to the C suite. Many executives view repaying investors as a higher priority than increasing wages or hiring. Honeywell, Coca-Cola, Amgen and others have said they will use any tax windfall in part to increase dividends, buy back shares and repay debt. Hilton\u2019s chief executive echoed those comments on Thursday. A Business Roundtable survey of chief executives released Tuesday showed a slight drop in projected hiring for the next six months.Companies are also worried about angering activist investors, who push to increase shareholder value through cost cuts and deals.

Activist campaigns at companies with a market value of at least $10 billion jumped by 66 percent in the first half of 2017 from the same period last year, according to ActivistMonitor.Mr. Trump himself has made shareholder moves a barometer of his success.

{"Headline": "John Anderson, Who Ran Against Reagan and Carter in 1980, Is Dead at 95", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn B. Anderson, a former Republican congressman from Illinois who bolted his party to run as a plain-spoken independent candidate for president in 1980, drawing an enthusiastic if transient following among liberals and college students, died on Sunday night in Washington. He was 95.His death was confirmed by his daughter Diane Anderson.The United States was struggling with a recession, a severe energy crisis and the protracted Iranian hostage crisis when Mr. Anderson gave up a safe seat in the House of Representatives to seek the Republican presidential nomination. When that try fizzled, he reintroduced himself as an independent, honest-dealing alternative to the rancorous business-as-usual politics of the major parties.For a while he had the national spotlight, a 58-year-old maverick whose white hair, horn-rimmed glasses and clearheaded presentation gave him the air of a genial professor who was not so much above the fray as he was unwilling to play by its rules.Mr. Anderson refused to pander, telling voters in Iowa that he favored President Jimmy Carter\u2019s embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union after it had invaded Afghanistan. He called for a gasoline tax of 50 cents per gallon \u2014 when a gallon cost $1.15 \u2014 to save energy.Early on, when all six of his rivals for the Republican nomination assured the Gun Owners of New Hampshire that they firmly opposed gun control legislation, Mr. Anderson said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\u201cWhen in this country we license people to drive automobiles,\u201d he added, \u201cwhat is so wrong about proposing that we license guns to make sure that felons and mental incompetents don\u2019t get ahold of them?\u201dHe was roundly booed.His backers promoted his campaign style as \u201cthe Anderson difference,\u201d but despite it \u2014 or perhaps because of it \u2014 he never finished better than second in a Republican primary. That came in Illinois, his home state, which he had expected to win. When he did not, losing to Ronald Reagan by fewer than 12 points (Mr. Reagan was born in Illinois), he decided to run as an independent.Drawing support from moderate to liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats and finding a receptive audience on college campuses, Mr. Anderson did well in the polls at the start. At one point, upward of one-fifth of voters said they preferred him to the major party nominees, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Carter, the Democrat, who was seeking re-election. Mr. Anderson peaked in June, when he was the choice of 24 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll, 25 percent in a Harris/ABC poll and 18 percent in a New York Times/CBS News poll.His hopes were sustained by the volatility of the 1980 campaign, with its sudden swings of popularity. Mr. Carter\u2019s Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, led by large margins in early polls, only to see the president recover and defeat him soundly in the primaries.Mr. Reagan, the early Republican favorite, spent money lavishly, but lost to George Bush in the Iowa caucuses and trailed in national polls before a solid win in New Hampshire put him back on the road to the nomination. Mr. Anderson said he believed that the tide might turn in his favor in \u201cthe climactic phase of the campaign.\u201dSo he pushed on, calling Mr. Carter a \u201cmean and evasive\u201d campaigner who used a recession and high unemployment to fight inflation, and criticizing Mr. Reagan\u2019s campaign \u201cone-liners,\u201d calling them \u201cslick and simplistic.\u201dBut in a pattern familiar to independent candidates, Mr. Anderson\u2019s support drifted as voters turned to candidates who they believed could actually win the White House. On Election Day, when Mr. Reagan won in a landslide, Mr. Anderson ended up with 6.6 percent of the popular vote.Mr. Anderson was perceived as the most liberal of the three contenders. That label probably fit on social issues like abortion, but his economic views were traditionally conservative. He preferred to think of himself as the moderate in the race \u2014 a self-description that reflected a marked political evolution.In his first three years in the House, starting in 1961, Mr. Anderson, a former prosecutor and a decorated World War II veteran, received a zero rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action. Not long after entering the Capitol, he proposed a constitutional amendment declaring that \u201cthis nation devoutly recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ, Savior and Ruler of nations.\u201dThe measure never came to a vote, and he later apologized for it.Though his views began to moderate, he was still conservative enough in 1969 for the Republicans to elect him chairman of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking leadership position. He held the post through 1979, though not without fighting off challenges from the right. By then, the A.D.A. had put his voting record in the mid-40s, and he had harshly criticized President Richard M. Nixon, a fellow Republican, over his handling of the Watergate scandal. His own critics called Mr. Anderson self-righteous and preachy.But he grew increasingly impatient not only with the House but also with the growing strength of the right wing of his own party.\u201cExtremist fringe elements,\u201d he complained in 1977, \u201cseek to expel the rest of us from the G.O.P.\u201d He warned, \u201cIf the purists stage their ideological coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, our party will be consigned to the historical junk heap.\u201dThe right returned the compliment with a strong Republican primary campaign against him in his 1978 House race. With the help of Democratic crossover votes, Mr. Anderson won with 58 percent over the insurgent, Don Lyon, a conservative minister. But he resented the challenge, and his thoughts turned to the White House.It was always a long-shot campaign. Few elected officials endorsed him. His Republican campaign, announced in June 1979, drew little support as Mr. Bush emerged as the only viable alternative to Mr. Reagan (who wound up choosing Mr. Bush as his running mate).For his independent run, announced in April 1980, Mr. Anderson had to spend millions to get on the ballot in all 50 states as the National Unity Party candidate, leaving little cash for television advertising. (His running mate was Patrick J. Lucey, a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin.) And when Mr. Carter refused to join him in a September debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters \u2014 the president, it was said, did not want to be perceived as taking Mr. Anderson\u2019s candidacy seriously \u2014 Mr. Anderson\u2019s last and best chance of making an impact was snuffed out.The debate went ahead without the president, but Mr. Reagan gained more from it than Mr. Anderson did. When Mr. Anderson\u2019s poll standing slipped below 15 percent, the league did not invite him back for an October debate, the only one between Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan, for whom it was a turning point.But Mr. Anderson never considered dropping out.\u201cWe had operated from the very beginning with the assumption that it was a given that Jimmy Carter could not be re-elected,\u201d Mr. Anderson told a conference at the Institute of Politics at Harvard weeks after the election. His hope, he added, was that with the collapse of the Carter campaign, he could emerge \u201cas a rational and reasonable alternative to Ronald Reagan.\u201dTo the frequent accusation that he had been a spoiler in the race, he replied: \u201cWhat\u2019s to spoil? Spoil the chances of two men at least half the country doesn\u2019t want?\u201dJohn Bayard Anderson was born on Feb. 15, 1922, in Rockford, Ill., a son of Swedish immigrants, E. Albin Anderson and the former Mabel Edna Ring. As a boy he worked in the family\u2019s grocery store and was the valedictorian of his class at Rockford Central High School.He earned bachelor\u2019s and law degrees at the University of Illinois and a master of laws at Harvard. In World War II he earned four battle stars as a staff sergeant in the field artillery in Europe and later worked in the Foreign Service in Berlin and Washington, where he met Keke Machakos, a passport photographer. They married in 1953. Returning to Illinois, he was elected state\u2019s attorney for Winnebago County in 1956.In addition to his daughter Diane, he is survived by his wife; three other daughters, Eleanora van der Wal, Karen Moree and Susan Anderson; a son, John Jr.; and 11 grandchildren.Mr. Anderson had homes in Rockford as well as in Washington, where he practiced intellectual property law, and in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he taught law for many years at Nova Southeastern University. He served as president of the World Federalist Association, which promotes international cooperation, and chairman of FairVote, a nonprofit group that favors ranked-choice voting.Mr. Anderson was the author of \u201cBetween Two Worlds: A Congressman\u2019s Choice\u201d (1970); \u201cThe American Economy We Need\u201d (1984) and \u201cA Proper Institution: Guaranteeing Televised Presidential Debates\u201d (1988).The most enduring impact of his 1980 independent campaign came in the courts, where his victories enabled later third-party candidates like H. Ross Perot and Mr. Nader to get on the ballot. Most important was a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 1983 that threw out Ohio\u2019s filing deadline of March 20 for independent candidates. (Mr. Anderson had not decided to run as an independent that early in 1980, but got on the ballot when a Federal District Court ordered Ohio to let him run.)Ohio defended its deadline as a way to maintain \u201cpolitical stability.\u201d But the Supreme Court accepted Mr. Anderson\u2019s argument that states could not impose substantially more onerous burdens on independent candidates than on major party nominees.Though Mr. Anderson\u2019s candidacy had little impact on the outcome of the 1980 election, his campaign was memorable for its candor. Appearing in Des Moines with six rivals for the Republican nomination, Mr. Anderson was alone among them in saying something specific when asked if there was anything in his career he would take back if he could.\u201cIt would have been the vote that I cast in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution,\u201d he said, referring to the 1964 congressional measure that gave President Lyndon B. Johnson license to widen the war against North Vietnam.He was equally forthright in defending his call for an emergency excise tax on gasoline, unpopular though it might have been.\u201cI did it as a security measure, to be sure,\u201d he told the September 1980 debate audience, \u201cbecause I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Anderson\u2019s age when he ran for president. He was 58, not 48.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the surnames of two of Mr. Anderson\u2019s daughters. They are Eleanora van der Wal, not Van der Wahl, and Susan Anderson, not Friebert.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the degree of support Mr. Anderson received when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination. He was endorsed by Representative Jim Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, and some state and local elected officials; it was not the case that \u201cno elected officials, not even his friends in the House, endorsed him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If he were down in the mine shaft operating the loader manually, he would be inhaling dust and exhaust fumes. Instead, he reclines in an office chair while using a joystick to control the machine.He is cognizant that robots are evolving by the day. Boliden is testing self-driving vehicles to replace truck drivers. But Mr. Persson assumes people will always be needed to keep the machines running. He has faith in the Swedish economic model and its protections against the torment of joblessness.\u201cI\u2019m not really worried,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are so many jobs in this mine that even if this job disappears, they will have another one. The company will take care of us.\u201dIn much of the world, people whose livelihoods depend on paychecks are increasingly anxious about a potential wave of unemployment threatened by automation. As the frightening tale goes, globalization forced people in wealthier lands like North America and Europe to compete directly with cheaper laborers in Asia and Latin America, sowing joblessness. Now, the robots are coming to finish off the humans.\u201cIn Sweden, if you ask a union leader, \u2018Are you afraid of new technology?\u2019 they will answer, \u2018No, I\u2019m afraid of old technology,\u2019\u201d says the Swedish minister for employment and integration, Ylva Johansson. \u201cThe jobs disappear, and then we train people for new jobs. We won\u2019t protect jobs. But we will protect workers.\u201dAmericans tend to dismiss Nordic countries as a realm of nanny-state-worshiping socialists in contrast to the swashbuckling capitalists who rule in places like Silicon Valley. But Sweden presents the possibility that, in an age of automation, innovation may be best advanced by maintaining ample cushions against failure.\u201cA good safety net is good for entrepreneurship,\u201d says Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. \u201cIf a project doesn\u2019t succeed, you don\u2019t have to go broke.\u201dIn the United States, where most people depend on employers for health insurance, losing a job can trigger a descent to catastrophic depths. It makes workers reluctant to leave jobs to forge potentially more lucrative careers. It makes unions inclined to protect jobs above all else.Yet in Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, governments provide health care along with free education. They pay generous unemployment benefits, while employers finance extensive job training programs. Unions generally embrace automation as a competitive advantage that makes jobs more secure.Making the United States more like Scandinavia would entail costs that collide with the tax-cutting fervor that has dominated American politics in recent decades.For Swedish businesses, these outlays yield a key dividend: Employees have proved receptive to absorbing new technology.This is especially crucial in mining, a major industry in Sweden. Wages are high, with pay and working conditions set through national contracts negotiated by unions and employers\u2019 associations. Boliden\u2019s mines have some of the world\u2019s lowest-grade ore, meaning it contains minute quantities of valuable minerals. The prices are set by global markets.\u201cWe have every reason not to be competitive,\u201d says Boliden\u2019s chief executive, Lennart Evrell.The only way for the company to ensure profit is to continually increase efficiency. This is why Mr. Persson and his co-workers in the control room will soon be operating as many as four loaders at once via joysticks.The company is pressing ahead with plans to deploy self-driving trucks, testing a system with AB Volvo, the Swedish automotive giant, at a mine in the town of Kristineberg. There, Boliden has expanded annual production to close to 600,000 tons from about 350,000 tons three decades ago \u2014 while the work force has remained about 200.\u201cIf we don\u2019t move forward with the technology and making money, well, then we are out of business,\u201d says Magnus Westerlund, 35, vice chairman of a local union chapter representing laborers at two Boliden mines. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a degree in math to do the calculation.\u201dAt the mine below the frigid pine forests in Garpenberg, 110 miles northwest of Stockholm, Mr. Persson and his co-workers earn about 500,000 krona per year (nearly $60,000). They get five weeks of vacation. Under Swedish law, when a child arrives, the parents have 480 days of family leave to apportion between them. No robot is going to change any of that, Mr. Persson says.\u201cIt\u2019s a Swedish kind of thinking,\u201d says Erik Lundstrom, a 41-year-old father of two who works alongside Mr. Persson. \u201cIf you do something for the company, the company gives something back.\u201dThat proposition now confronts a formidable test. No one knows how many jobs are threatened by robots and other forms of automation, but projections suggest a potential shock.When automated teller machines first landed at bank branches in the late 1960s, some foresaw the extinction of humans working in banks. But employment swelled as banks invested the savings into new areas like mortgage lending and insurance. Similar trends may play out again.Three years ago, Soren Karlsson quit his job on the business side of a Swedish newspaper to start United Robots, a venture that one might initially think was aimed at ruining the lives of his former colleagues: He developed a robot, named Rosalinda, that scans data about sporting events to yield news stories.\u201cThe stories are not as colorful as a human would write,\u201d he says.But his robots never break for lunch. Today, Mr. Karlsson has six people working at his offices in the city of Malmo. He expects that Rosalinda will write 100,000 stories this year for various Swedish media outlets, bringing his company revenue of about 5 million krona (about $590,000).At the Swedish Union of Journalists, no one seems concerned. Rosalinda is mostly adding coverage that did not exist before \u2014 stories about high school floor hockey games, middling soccer matches.\u201cWe have always tried to applaud and embrace new developments,\u201d says the union president, Jonas Nordling. \u201cWe can\u2019t just moan about what is happening.\u201dYet even if robots create more jobs than they eliminate, large numbers of people are going to need to pursue new careers.Sweden and its Nordic brethren have proved successful at managing such transitions. So-called job security councils financed by employers help people who lose jobs find new ones.One such council in Stockholm, the TRR Trygghetsradet, boasts that 83 percent of participants have found new jobs this year. Two-thirds have landed in positions paying the same as or better than their previous jobs.But some worry that the system could be overwhelmed by the impact of automation. The number of students older than 35 has fallen by nearly one-fifth in recent years at Swedish universities, which have curtailed enrollment of midcareer laborers while focusing on traditional degree programs.\u201cThat\u2019s a kind of warning signal for us,\u201d says Martin Linder, president of Unionen, which represents some 640,000 white-collar workers.Maintaining Sweden\u2019s social safety net also requires that the public continue to pay tax rates approaching 60 percent. Yet as Sweden absorbs large numbers of immigrants from conflict-torn nations, that support may wane. Many lack education and may be difficult to employ. If large numbers wind up depending on government largess, a backlash could result.\u201cThere\u2019s a risk that the social contract could crack,\u201d said Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm.For now, the social compact endures, and at the Boliden mine, a sense of calm prevails.The Garpenberg mine has been in operation more or less since 1257. More than a decade ago, Boliden teamed up with Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company, to put in wireless internet. That has allowed miners to talk to one another to fix problems as they emerge. Miners now carry tablet computers that allow them to keep tabs on production all along the 60 miles of roads running through the mine.\u201cFor us, automation is something good,\u201d says Fredrik Hases, 41, who heads the local union chapter representing technicians. \u201cNo one feels like they are taking jobs away. It\u2019s about doing more with the people we\u2019ve got.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Tax Overhaul, Trump Tries to Defy the Economic Odds", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps more than any other American political leader, Mr. Trump knows that long shots, like his own presidential bid, sometimes pay off. In that vein, he and congressional Republicans are arguing that their bitterly contested and expensive rewrite of the tax code will ultimately create more jobs and raise wages.If they are proved correct, they will be repudiating not only historical experience, but most experts. From Congress\u2019s own prognosticators to Wall Street\u2019s virtuosos, scarcely any independent analyses project anything like the rosy forecasts offered by the president\u2019s top economic advisers.To Mr. Trump and his allies, the normal models just do not fully capture the high-octane \u201crocket fuel\u201d embedded in the tax plan. Mr. Trump intuitively understands just how much attitudes and expectations can shape economic decisions.With a businessman in the White House, Mr. Trump argues that companies, large and small, have a renewed faith in the economy. And the corporate tax cut, combined with the rollback in regulation, will prompt waves of new investment and hiring, as middle-class Americans liberally spend the extra money in their pockets.\u201cWe\u2019re going to easily see 4 percent growth next year,\u201d the National Economic Council director, Gary D. Cohn, said. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, declared the tax plan would generate enough growth to more than pay for its $1.5 trillion cost.But those pronouncements are at odds with estimates from the former employer of both men, Goldman Sachs. The bank projected that the tax bill will add just three-tenths of 1 percent of growth in the next two years, before its impact peters out.The firm\u2019s annual growth estimate of 2.5 percent for 2018 matched the one issued this week by the nation\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, while the latest median Wall Street forecast hovered close by. And in 2019, growth is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, Alec Phillips, chief United States political economist for Goldman, said Wednesday after the Senate vote.\u201cWe note that the effect in 2020 and beyond looks minimal and could actually be slightly negative,\u201d the company said in a recent published summary.Such projections are unlikely to deter Mr. Trump and Republican leaders from declaring success next year. Lower taxes and extra incentives to invest in 2018 are almost certain to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to expand.Reduced rates mean most Americans will start taking home more money right away. Roughly three-quarters of taxpayers are expected to get a cut next year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Employers may offer other sweeteners, even if they were not specifically spurred by the tax plan. AT&T announced Wednesday that it was giving more than 200,000 domestic employees a $1,000 bonus when the tax bill is signed. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, also promised a $1,000 bonus and said it would raise the company\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.At the same time, the anticipated cut in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and other business perks are lifting the stock market to new heights. In an earnings call this week, Alan B. Graf Jr., FedEx\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company planned to use part of its tax windfall to fatten dividends.But like a shot of adrenaline, that initial burst of economic activity is likely to fade.Some provisions of the bill were intended to be sharp and short. Next year, for example, businesses will be able to borrow money and deduct the cost of those loans at the current rate of 35 percent. But later on, when they reap the profits, they will pay a tax rate of only 21 percent. That could end up causing firms to simply shift the timing of investments they would have made regardless of a change in the tax code.\u201cThe really hard question a year from now is going to be is how much of the miniboom we see is just an acceleration of stuff that was going to happen anyway or additional investment that is really going to spur the economy,\u201d said Mihir A. Desai, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School.Tax cuts can provide an added incentive to invest. But as most chief executives acknowledge, they are generally not the crucial factor.Investment decisions are much more closely linked to demand for goods and services or technological advancement. As it is, manufacturers are not making full use of the capacity in their existing facilities.Mr. Graf of FedEx held out the possibility of more spending on capital investment and hiring next year. But he noted that the economy as a whole would first have to \u201cincrease materially.\u201dOver time, most of the broad-based tax cuts will disappear. Although the richest sliver of Americans will continue to get a break, most people who earn less than $100,000 will see their taxes rise, which could slow the economy\u2019s primary engine, consumer spending.Either way, the deficit will continue to balloon. Over the last decade alone, the deficit has more than tripled. So far, the interest needed to cover that enormous loan has remained relatively small because interest rates have been at historically low levels.But those costs are expected to soar. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to slowly but surely raise the benchmark interest rate.Some economists support such deficit spending during recessions, but they worry that offering stimulants when the economy is on fairly steady ground can backfire. Although employers have resisted raising salaries by much, they continue to complain about the tightness of the labor market. The jobless rate has dipped to 4.1 percent while job openings have remained at record high levels.The pattern of short-term promise followed by disappointment is one that other presidents have experienced. President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 both passed tax cuts that delivered temporary bumps to the economy followed by slowdowns and rising deficits.\u201cThe clear consensus among independent economists is that the impact of the tax cuts on growth is nowhere close to what the administration is talking about,\u201d said Mr. Desai of Harvard. Whatever growth does occur, he added, will be \u201ccounteracted by the fiscal irresponsibility of the bill.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It occurred last Friday, when his body was rolled out of his Toronto mansion by the police, together with that of his wife, Honey.Although the Toronto area is home to 6.2 million people, it can often feel like a small town where everyone knows one another \u2014 particularly among the small moneyed elite. And so Hanukkah and Christmas parties across the snow-swept city over the weekend were a buzzing hive of disbelief, shock and finger-pointing about the couple\u2019s death.The couple was known for two contradictory things: making a fortune in the tough, litigious business of generic drugs, and giving a lot of it away to charity.\u201cThere is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\u201d said Linda Frum, a senator in the Canadian Parliament and a close, longtime friend of the couple.She added: \u201cThis idea that Barry would ever harm Honey \u2014 he adored her. That\u2019s impossible. He was a gentle, good man.\u201dFred Waks, a real estate developer and close friend of the Shermans, said: \u201cBarry was involved in big pharmacy on a worldwide basis. His lawsuits pertained to billions of dollars, back and forth. When you are dealing with the size of that industry and the amounts we are talking about, you make enemies.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd you make enemies on a global basis.\u201dHe had a reputation as a shrewd, combative businessman, a brilliant scientist and a consummate workaholic who, at 75, still logged long hours in the office most days. He appeared to have no intention of ever stepping down as chairman of Apotex, the company he co-founded in 1974 and built up from just two employees to more than 6,000 in Canada alone.Though fabulously wealthy, the couple didn\u2019t live like billionaires. They flew economy. Mr. Sherman drove a beat-up old car.

{"Headline": "Trump Says His Regulatory Rollback Already Is the \u2018Most Far-Reaching\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that his administration was answering \u201ca call to action\u201d by rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, financial services and other industries as he made a push to showcase his accomplishments near the end of his first year in office.The remarks highlighted an area where Mr. Trump has perhaps done more to change the policies of his predecessor than any other, with regulatory shifts that have affected wide sections of the economy.\u201cWe are just getting started,\u201d Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the \u201cmost far-reaching regulatory reform\u201d in United States history, a claim he did not back up.\u201cWe have decades of excess regulation to remove,\u201d he added. \u201cTo help launch the next phase of growth, prosperity and freedom, I am challenging my cabinet to find and remove every single outdated, unlawful and excessive regulation currently on the books.\u201dEchoing his days as a real estate developer with the flair of a groundbreaking, Mr. Trump used an oversize pair of scissors to cut a ribbon his staff had set up in front of two piles of paper, representing government regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said), and today \u2014 a pile that was about six feet tall (said to be 185,000 pages).His efforts \u2014 his staff said that the rules already rolled back had saved $8.1 billion in regulatory costs over their lifetime, or a total of an estimated $570 million a year \u2014 have brought cheers from the business community, most notably from companies that will benefit from the rollbacks.But these efforts have generated fierce pushback from state attorneys general and environmental groups who say that pulling back regulations has left the environment more vulnerable to pollution and consumers with fewer of the protections that were adopted after the financial crisis.Still, several economic indicators \u2014 and comments from companies large and small \u2014 suggest that a shift in federal regulatory policy is building business confidence and accelerating economic growth, developments Mr. Trump certainly took credit for on Thursday.But even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own staff members were not able to back up his broad claims on Thursday, including Ms. Rao, who when asked if the regulatory rollback was the biggest in United States history, acknowledged that she could not prove that, and instead pointed to the Reagan administration as another time when a large number of rules were revoked.Even so, Democratic state attorneys general, environmental groups and others have already filed dozens of lawsuits to try to stop or reverse the Trump administration rollbacks, meaning that the ultimate outcome may be decided in federal courts.\u201cIt is a mirage more than a miracle,\u201d Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said in an interview on Thursday, referring to the benefits to American society that Mr. Trump said have been gained.But as the documents released Thursday show, individual federal agencies have heard the White House\u2019s call to reconsider a broad array of regulations, even though these agencies must go through a time-consuming process to repeal any rule.Coal mining has been an area of particular attention.\u201cThat is some of the biggest deregulatory action,\u201d said Stuart Shapiro, a professor at Rutgers University who served from 1998 to 2003 in the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cIt sets the expectation for businesses that the cop is not on the beat.\u201dEric Lipton reported from Washington, and Danielle Ivory from New York.

{"Headline": "Stoking Fears, Trump Defied Bureaucracy to Advance Immigration Agenda", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "Trump\u2019s WayThe changes have had far-reaching consequences, both for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country and for America\u2019s image in the world.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Late to his own meeting and waving a sheet of numbers, President Trump stormed into the Oval Office one day in June, plainly enraged.But so many foreigners had flooded into the country since January, he vented to his national security team, that it was making a mockery of his pledge. Friends were calling to say he looked like a fool, Mr. Trump said.According to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting, Mr. Trump then began reading aloud from the document, which his domestic policy adviser, Stephen Miller, had given him just before the meeting. The document listed how many immigrants had received visas to enter the United States in 2017.More than 2,500 were from Afghanistan, a terrorist haven, the president complained.Haiti had sent 15,000 people. They \u201call have AIDS,\u201d he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there.Forty thousand had come from Nigeria, Mr. Trump added. Once they had seen the United States, they would never \u201cgo back to their huts\u201d in Africa, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in the Oval Office.As the meeting continued, John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Miller turned their ire on Mr. Tillerson, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. Tillerson fired back.Tempers flared and Mr. Kelly asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to the Oval Office was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had made derogatory statements about immigrants during the meeting.\u201cGeneral Kelly, General McMaster, Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Nielsen and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims,\u201d she said, referring to the current White House chief of staff, the national security adviser and the secretaries of state and homeland security. \u201cIt\u2019s both sad and telling The New York Times would print the lies of their anonymous \u2018sources\u2019 anyway.\u201dWhile the White House did not deny the overall description of the meeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. Trump never used the words \u201cAIDS\u201d or \u201chuts\u201d to describe people from any country. Several participants in the meeting told Times reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time.The meeting in June reflects Mr. Trump\u2019s visceral approach to an issue that defined his campaign and has indelibly shaped the first year of his presidency.Seizing on immigration as the cause of countless social and economic problems, Mr. Trump entered office with an agenda of symbolic but incompletely thought-out goals, the product not of rigorous policy debate but of emotionally charged personal interactions and an instinct for tapping into the nativist views of white working-class Americans.Like many of his initiatives, his effort to change American immigration policy has been executed through a disorderly and dysfunctional process that sought from the start to defy the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it, according to interviews with three dozen current and former administration officials, lawmakers and others close to the process, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private interactions.But while Mr. Trump has been repeatedly frustrated by the limits of his power, his efforts to remake decades of immigration policy have gained increasing momentum as the White House became more disciplined and adept at either ignoring or undercutting the entrenched opposition of many parts of the government. The resulting changes have had far-reaching consequences, not only for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country, but also for the United States\u2019 image in the world.\u201cWe have taken a giant steamliner barreling full speed,\u201d Mr. Miller said in a recent interview. \u201cSlowed it, stopped it, begun to turn it around and started sailing in the other direction.\u201dIt is an assessment shared ruefully by Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critics, who see a darker view of the past year. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, a pro-immigration group, argues that the president\u2019s immigration agenda is motivated by racism.\u201cHe\u2019s basically saying, \u2018You people of color coming to America seeking the American dream are a threat to the white people,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Sharry, an outspoken critic of the president. \u201cHe\u2019s come into office with an aggressive strategy of trying to reverse the demographic changes underway in America.\u201dThose who know Mr. Trump say that his attitude toward immigrants long predates his entry into politics.\u201cHe\u2019s always been fearful where other cultures are concerned and always had anxiety about food and safety when he travels,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, who interviewed him for the biography \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d \u201cHis objectification and demonization of people who are different has festered for decades.\u201dBut he remained conflicted, viewing himself as benevolent and wanting to be liked by the many immigrants he employed.\u201cWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity,\u201d Mr. Trump ad-libbed. \u201cThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs; they\u2019re bringing crime; they\u2019re rapists.\u201dDemocrats and some Republicans recoiled, calling Mr. Trump\u2019s messaging damaging and divisive. But for the candidate, the idea of securing the country against outsiders with a wall had intoxicating appeal, though privately, he acknowledged that it was a rhetorical device to whip up crowds when they became listless.Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, whom Mr. Trump consults regularly on the matter, said it was not a stretch to attribute Mr. Trump\u2019s victory to issues where Mr. Trump broke with a Republican establishment orthodoxy that had disappointed anti-immigrant conservatives for decades.But mindful of his campaign promise to quickly impose \u201cextreme vetting,\u201d Mr. Trump decided his first symbolic action would be an executive order to place a worldwide ban on travel from nations the White House considered compromised by terrorism.With no policy experts in place, and deeply suspicious of career civil servants they regarded as spies for President Barack Obama, Mr. Miller and a small group of aides started with an Obama-era law that identified seven terror-prone \u201ccountries of concern.\u201d And then they skipped practically every step in the standard White House playbook for creating and introducing a major policy.The National Security Council never convened to consider the travel ban proposal. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary at the time, did not see it ahead of time. Lawyers and policy experts at the White House, the Justice Department and the Homeland Security Department were not asked to weigh in. There were no talking points for friendly surrogates, no detailed briefings for reporters or lawmakers, no answers to frequently asked questions, such as whether green card holders would be affected.White House aides resorted to Google searches and frenzied scans of the United States Code to figure out which countries were affected.But for the president, the chaos was the first, sharp evidence that he could exert power over the bureaucracy he criticized on the campaign trail.\u201cIt\u2019s working out very nicely,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office the next day.At a hastily called Saturday night meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Miller told senior government officials that they should tune out the whining.Sitting at the head of the table, across from Mr. Kelly, Mr. Miller repeated what he told the president: This is what we wanted \u2014 to turn immigration enforcement back on.Mr. Kelly, who shared Mr. Trump\u2019s views about threats from abroad, was nonetheless livid that his employees at homeland security had been called into action with no guidance or preparation. He told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the rollout was \u201call on me.\u201d Privately, he told the White House, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201dAmid the turbulent first weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to bend the government\u2019s immigration apparatus to his will began to take shape.The ban\u2019s message of \u201ckeep out\u201d helped drive down illegal border crossings as much as 70 percent, even without being formally put into effect.Immigration officers rounded up 41,318 undocumented immigrants during the president\u2019s first 100 days, nearly a 40 percent increase. The Justice Department began hiring more immigration judges to speed up deportations. Officials threatened to hold back funds for sanctuary cities. The flow of refugees into the United States slowed.Mr. Trump \u201chas taken the handcuffs off,\u201d said Steven A. Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration.Mr. Obama had been criticized by immigrant rights groups for excessive deportations, especially in his first term. But Mr. Camarota said that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach was \u201ca distinct change, to look at what is immigration doing to us, rather than what is the benefit for the immigrant.\u201dThe president, however, remained frustrated that the shift was not yielding results.By early March, judges across the country had blocked his travel ban. Immigrant rights activists were crowing that they had thwarted the new president. Even Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyers told him he had to give up on defending the ban.Attorney General Jeff Sessions and lawyers at the White House and Justice Department had decided that waging an uphill legal battle to defend the directive in the Supreme Court would fail. Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster.The president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in the Oval Office.It was a familiar moment for Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. The president did not mind being told \u201cno\u201d in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby.As Marine One waited on the South Lawn for Mr. Trump to begin his weekend trip to Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. McGahn insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. Trump would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said.\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d the president responded.With nothing resolved, Mr. Trump, furious, left the White House. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland: \u201cHe\u2019s coming in hot.\u201dOver dinner that night with Mr. Sessions and Mr. McGahn, Mr. Trump relented. When he was back in Washington, he signed the new order. It was an indication that he had begun to understand \u2014 or at least, begrudgingly accept \u2014 the need to follow a process.Still, one senior adviser later recalled never having seen a president so angry signing anything.As a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly contradicted himself about the deportations he would pursue, and whether he was opposed to any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But he also courted conservative voters by describing an Obama-era policy as an illegal amnesty for the immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children.During the transition, his aides drafted an executive order to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But the executive order was held back as the new president struggled with conflicted feelings about the young immigrants, known as Dreamers.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of those kids,\u201d Mr. Trump had pledged to Senator Richard J. Durbin during a private exchange at his Inauguration Day luncheon.The comment was a fleeting glimpse of the president\u2019s tendency to seek approval from whoever might be sitting across from him, and the power that personal interactions have in shaping his views.In 2013, Mr. Trump met with a small group of Dreamers at Trump Tower, hoping to improve his standing with the Hispanic community. Jos\u00e9 Machado told Mr. Trump about waking up at the age of 15 to find his mother had vanished \u2014 deported, he later learned, back to Nicaragua.\u201cHonestly,\u201d Mr. Machado said of Mr. Trump, \u201che had no idea.\u201dMr. Trump appeared to be touched by the personal stories, and insisted that the Dreamers accompany him to his gift shop for watches, books and neckties to take home as souvenirs. In the elevator on the way down, he quietly nodded and said, \u201cYou convinced me.\u201dAfter weeks of private meetings on Capitol Hill and telephone conversations with Mr. Durbin and Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican supportive of legalizing the Dreamers, Mr. Kushner invited them to dinner at the six-bedroom estate he shares with his wife, Ivanka Trump.But Mr. Durbin\u2019s hope of a deal faded when he arrived to the house and saw who one of the guests would be.\u201cStephen Miller\u2019s presence made it a much different experience than I expected,\u201d Mr. Durbin said later.Even as the administration was engaged in a court battle over the travel ban, it began to turn its attention to another way of tightening the border \u2014 by limiting the number of refugees admitted each year to the United States. And if there was one \u201cdeep state\u201d stronghold of Obama holdovers that Mr. Trump and his allies suspected of undermining them on immigration, it was the State Department, which administers the refugee program.At the department\u2019s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, there was a sense of foreboding about a president who had once warned that any refugee might be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d or part of a \u201cterrorist army.\u201dMr. Trump had already used the travel ban to cut the number of allowable refugees admitted to the United States in 2017 to 50,000, a fraction of the 110,000 set by Mr. Obama. Now, Mr. Trump would have to decide the level for 2018.At an April meeting with top officials from the bureau in the West Wing\u2019s Roosevelt Room, Mr. Miller cited statistics from the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies that indicated that resettling refugees in the United States was far costlier than helping them in their own region.Mr. Miller was visibly displeased, according to people present, when State Department officials pushed back, citing another study that found refugees to be a net benefit to the economy. He called the contention absurd and said it was exactly the wrong kind of thinking.But the travel ban had been a lesson for Mr. Trump and his aides on the dangers of dictating a major policy change without involving the people who enforce it. This time, instead of shutting out those officials, they worked to tightly control the process.In previous years, State Department officials had recommended a refugee level to the president. Now, Mr. Miller told officials the number would be determined by the Department of Homeland Security under a new policy that treated the issue as a security matter, not a diplomatic one.When he got word that the Office of Refugee Resettlement had drafted a 55-page report showing that refugees were a net positive to the economy, Mr. Miller swiftly intervened, requesting a meeting to discuss it. The study never made it to the White House; it was shelved in favor of a three-page list of all the federal assistance programs that refugees used.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Trump cited the Center for Immigration Studies report, arguing that it was more cost-effective to keep refugees out than to bring them into the United States.\u201cUncontrolled migration,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, \u201cis deeply unfair to both the sending and receiving countries.\u201dCecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser, said she was alarmed by the speed with which Mr. Trump and his team have learned to put their immigration agenda into effect.\u201cThe travel ban was a case of bureaucratic incompetence,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made rookie mistakes. But they clearly learned from that experience. For the moment, all of the momentum is in the direction of very ugly, very extreme, very harmful policies.\u201dAt times, though, Mr. Trump has shown an openness to a different approach. In private discussions, he returns periodically to the idea of a \u201ccomprehensive immigration\u201d compromise, though aides have warned him against using the phrase because it is seen by his core supporters as code for amnesty. During a fall dinner with Democratic leaders, Mr. Trump explored the possibility of a bargain to legalize Dreamers in exchange for border security.Mr. Trump even told Republicans recently that he wanted to think bigger, envisioning a deal early next year that would include a wall, protection for Dreamers, work permits for their parents, a shift to merit-based immigration with tougher work site enforcement, and ultimately, legal status for some undocumented immigrants.The idea would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring the parents who brought them illegally for citizenship, limiting what Mr. Trump refers to as \u201cchain migration.\u201d\u201cHe wants to make a deal,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who spoke with Mr. Trump about the issue last week. \u201cHe wants to fix the entire system.\u201dYet publicly, Mr. Trump has only employed the absolutist language that defined his campaign and has dominated his presidency.Privately, in the Oval Office, the president expressed disbelief about the visa program that had admitted the suspect, confiding to a group of visiting senators that it was yet another piece of evidence that the United States\u2019 immigration policies were \u201ca joke.\u201dEven after a year of progress toward a country sealed off from foreign threats, the president still viewed the immigration system as plagued by complacency.\u201cWe\u2019re so politically correct,\u201d he complained to reporters in the cabinet room, \u201cthat we\u2019re afraid to do anything.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "File Your Taxes on a Postcard? A G.O.P. Promise Marked Undeliverable", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax bill does not pass the postcard test.It leaves nearly every large tax break in place. It creates as many new preferences for special interests as it gets rid of. It will keep corporate accountants busy for years to come. And no taxpayer will ever see the postcard-size tax return that President Trump laid a kiss on in November as Republican leaders launched their tax overhaul effort.This was not the grand simplification of the code that Republicans promised when they set out to eliminate tax breaks and cut the number of tax brackets as they lowered rates.As their bill tore through Congress, their ambitions fell to the powerful forces of lobbying and the status quo. Killed tax breaks returned to life. New ones sprung up beside them. A plan for three individual tax brackets became five, and finally eight.Trade groups, such as the one for real estate agents, were able to preserve many benefits targeted for elimination. The groups whose breaks were actually killed formed an eclectic, if less powerful, bunch: bicycle commuters, gamblers, workers whose companies give them free food.What emerged on Friday, in the final product agreed to by Republican members of a House-Senate conference committee, was a bill that layers new tax complexities upon businesses large and small, and which delivers a larger share of benefits to corporations and the rich than to the middle class.It sets all tax relief for individuals to expire in eight years, while making deep and permanent cuts to the corporate tax rate. It limits one key benefit for taxpayers in high-tax states, such as New York, but otherwise does little to back up Mr. Trump\u2019s promise last month that \u201cwe\u2019re also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage by the wealthy.\u201dBudget experts had hoped for a tax overhaul that stoked additional economic growth by eliminating targeted tax breaks, which would allow for lower tax rates, a trade that economists generally believe increases efficiency in the economy.\u201cThe whole purpose of tax reform is to eliminate tax breaks to simplify the tax code and reduce rates,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington. \u201cBut from what I can see, they only repeal one significant tax break, and very few if any tiny ones.\u201dThose arguments echoed a message that conservative groups had found scored highly with voters \u2014 the idea that a tax bill could \u201cun-rig\u201d the system. In August, In Pursuit Of, a communications and marketing firm that supports the influential Koch network, conducted a focus group test of Mr. Trump delivering a short message along those lines, and it rated highly. The results were shared widely among Republicans, and echoed in party leaders\u2019 speeches when they launched the tax push in earnest.The House measure did take one significant step toward simplifying the process for some taxpayers. It nearly doubled the standard deduction, a decision that stuck through every version of the legislation, including the final one. Because of this change, congressional staff members project, only 6 percent of Americans will itemize their tax returns, down from 30 percent now.An analysis accompanying the final bill predicted that \u201cthis reduction in complexity and record keeping also may result in a decline in the number of individuals using a tax preparation service, or tax preparation software, or a decline in the cost of such service or software.\u201dBut that ratio sank in the Senate, where lawmakers added waves of new breaks to the bill, such as an excise tax cut for craft brewers and special relief for certain citrus growers. Shortly before the legislation passed the Senate, Republicans tried to insert a provision that initially appeared designed to benefit a single conservative college in Michigan, before Democrats and a handful of Republicans banded together to strike it in a floor amendment.The final Senate bill included eight tax brackets, up from five in the House plan and seven in the current system, and it created at least as many new special-interest provisions as it eliminated. In the House-Senate conference committee, the Senate \u2014 where Republicans need to preserve nearly every vote because of their narrow majority \u2014 prevailed on most questions of whether targeted breaks would stay or go.Medical expense deductions stayed, as did tax breaks for teacher supplies, student loan payments and tuition waivers for graduate students, all of which had been eliminated in the House plan. The conference bill even retained a tax break that helps professional sports teams build new stadiums with taxpayer dollars. The only major provision eliminated was a special tax treatment for manufacturers.Republican leaders insisted that they had fulfilled their promise to simplify the tax filing process.\u201cSo, with the standard deduction nearly doubled and a number of those provisions, the postcard still remains,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on Friday. \u201cAre there a few more items on it? Sure. But that was the process we wanted.\u201dMr. Brady went on to imply that the special breaks were retained at the behest of voters. \u201cWe said from the very beginning: \u2018This isn\u2019t our tax code. It belongs to the American people,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it does. So, in the House we really took it down to the foundation and began to rebuild it the way the American people want it in the 21st century, not 30 or 50 years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Weeks After Mugabe Fell, Zimbabwe Remains in the Army\u2019s Grip", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe call for the unconditional lifting of the political and economic sanctions, which have crippled our national development,\u201d said the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who led the annual congress of the governing party, ZANU-PF, this week.Mr. Mugabe long whipped up domestic support by blaming sanctions imposed by Western governments for Zimbabwe\u2019s economic collapse, though most economists point instead to mismanagement of the resource-rich economy.Mr. Mnangagwa, 75, who is serving the remainder of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s term \u2014 which was scheduled to end next August \u2014 promised \u201ccredible, free and fair\u201d elections. Western officials have indicated that Zimbabwe would be considered for loans from the International Monetary Fund and other creditors only after holding free elections as well as showing improvement in human rights and other areas.The presence of the army, which has been used in the past to tilt elections in the governing party\u2019s favor, is still felt across the country. Soldiers remain deployed at checkpoints on roads and in towns and the countryside \u2014 often performing duties that they are not legally allowed to assume in peace time, critics say.\u201cThis is a military government,\u201d said Elias Mudzuri, a vice president of the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party. \u201cAnd when you have a military government and it wants to stay in power, it could do anything.\u201dThe army placed Mr. Mugabe under house arrest on Nov. 15 and eased the way for Mr. Mnangagwa to assume power.\u201cWhy has Mnangagwa not quickly returned the soldiers back to the barracks?\u201d asked Okay Machisa, vice chairman of the Peace Project. \u201cIf people are being beaten by soldiers and the head of state does not say a word, you start to wonder why. We want a country that is not militarized.\u201dThe continued military presence is particularly worrisome because of the upcoming elections, which are likely to be held in August. In the past, Mr. Mnangagwa, who was Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man for decades, is believed to have orchestrated the rigging of elections. Soldiers played a key role in coercing voters to support the governing party, especially in rural areas.\u201cZANU-PF is stronger than before,\u201d the Rev. Morris Brown Gwedegwe, a party member who founded a church in 2014, said, adding that opposition parties were \u201ca necessary evil.\u201dWhile shouting support for the new president, a senior member said, \u201cForward with President Robert Mugabe!\u201d before correcting himself. Even Mr. Mnangagwa, in introducing his wife, began addressing her as Grace Mugabe before he, too, caught himself \u2014 to much laughter from the audience.Party leaders strongly supported Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s call for the \u201cunconditional lifting\u201d of sanctions. In the past two decades, the United States and European governments have imposed sanctions following the Zimbabwean government\u2019s violation of human rights, including the violent seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe, which became ineligible for multilateral loans after defaulting in the late 1990s, must clear $1.8 billion it owes to the I.M.F., the World Bank and the African Development Bank before it can be considered for fresh loans.\u201cI hate the idea that U.S.A. wants to be a prefect of all nations,\u201d said Victor Matemadanda, a war veterans leaders and ZANU-PF\u2019s political commissar. \u201cLet them fix all the wrong things with Trump and get to us later.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been promised that the days of name-calling and blaming are over,\u201d Mr. Thomas said in an interview. \u201cWe hope that\u2019s true because that won\u2019t help people.\u201dKembo Mohadi, the defense minister, repeated the president\u2019s statement that sanctions must be removed without conditions.\u201cWhat have we done wrong as a new government?\u201d Mr. Mohadi said.Asked why soldiers had yet to return to their barracks, he said that the army was still carrying out its mission of righting the governing party, which had been led astray by a cabal led by Ms. Mugabe. The military has called its ousting of the old government under Mr. Mugabe as \u201cOperation Restore Legacy.\u201d\u201cUntil that legacy is restored,\u201d the defense minister said, \u201cour presence will be seen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Will Lead an Electric Car Future, Ford\u2019s Chairman Says", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The world\u2019s automakers are just starting to bet on an electric car future \u2014 and already, one of the most powerful people in the industry says that future belongs to China.The Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that it planned to introduce 15 battery electric or plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid car models in China by 2025. Speaking in Shanghai, William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor\u2019s longtime executive chairman, outlined why in an unusually blunt comment.\u201cWhen I think of where E.V.s are going,\u201d he said, using an abbreviation for electric vehicles, \u201cit\u2019s clearly the case that China will lead the world in E.V. development.\u201dFord Motor is far from alone. General Motors, Volkswagen, Daimler and other automakers have put big bets on the market for electric cars in China in recent months.Still, Mr. Ford\u2019s statement was notable given his own long-held ambitions to develop vehicles that run on something other than gasoline. Two decades ago, he drove an electric Ford Ranger compact pickup truck around the Detroit area even as his wife drove a gasoline-powered Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle.China now appears to be behind that wheel. The government has taken a major role in electric car development and is pushing to dominate the market. Beijing hopes the push will add to its technological know-how, help address its pernicious pollution problems and curb its dependence on oil imports from politically volatile countries.To achieve this, China is offering global automakers enticing financial carrots and threatening them with weighty regulatory sticks. State-controlled automakers have begun putting massive investments into electric car production. Meanwhile, Beijing has mandated that automakers must start selling large numbers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid cars or risk losing their right to sell gasoline-powered cars in China, now the world\u2019s largest auto market.\u201cCertainly having the full weight and power of the Chinese government behind it gave them a pretty good head start,\u201d said James Chao, a China automotive analyst at IHS Markit.China is already the world\u2019s dominant producer not just of electric motors but of practically all their components. Chinese companies even mine most of the valuable minerals, called rare earth metals, that go into the tiny magnets often used to make many of the motors.Daimler AG, the maker of Mercedes-Benz and Smart cars, said at the Guangzhou auto show last month that it also planned a sharp increase in its electric car production investments, particularly for making the batteries.\u201cChina will, in my view, be the biggest market for passenger cars for a very long time,\u201d said Hubertus Troska, the company\u2019s management board member responsible for China. Many of them, he added, will be electric.General Motors, VW\u2019s rival as the market leader in China, has put much of its electric car development effort in China and is laying plans to expand its electric car offerings here.\u201cGlobally, but especially here in China, car companies are shifting and new companies emerging with a focus on electrified products,\u201d Jennifer Goforth, the chief engineer of electrification at General Motors China, said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon.Once that electric car parts volume materializes, Mr. Luo said, \u201cI call it an inflection point,\u201d producing a drop in prices and a takeoff in sales.Ford Motor\u2019s market research has also found that Chinese customers are less concerned than customers elsewhere with issues like an electric car\u2019s range on a single charge, said Peter Fleet, the president of Ford Motor\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations. That may partly reflect the fact that cars in China tend to be used mainly for driving within cities.Mr. Ford has a long history of interest in alternative-fuel vehicles. As a young man, he has said in interviews, he toyed with becoming an environmental activist before deciding that he could make more of a difference in the world going to work in the company his great-grandfather founded.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senegal Opens Airport in Bid to Jump-Start Economy", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 A decade after construction began, Senegal opened a new airport on Thursday, the centerpiece of an ambitious plan to try to catapult the nation to become a top economic player in West Africa.President Macky Sall and other officials gathered at the $575 million airport, about a 90-minute drive from the center of Dakar, the capital, for an inaugural flight Thursday morning. Mr. Sall told crowds holding posters of him that it was now open for business. He boarded a plane that rushed down the runway as helicopters and military jets buzzed around the terminal.The new Blaise Diagne International Airport is part of the president\u2019s \u201cEmerging Senegal\u201d plan. He hopes to energize the economy by creating both the airport and new city outside Dakar.Mr. Sall is trying to position Senegal to expand its steadily growing economy, which in past years has slowly diversified beyond the peanut farming that the country relied on when it broke free of colonial ties to France decades ago. Besides peanuts, it now grows rice and cotton, and the nation has also developed its fisheries and its mining industry.With a currency guaranteed by the French treasury and \u2014 most important \u2014 its long-stable political environment, Senegal has huge potential, according to analysts. Optimism is palpable in Dakar, where pounding from hammers rings out all day at construction sites for seaside apartment complexes and offices.The nation\u2019s stable democracy \u201ccompensates for some weaknesses Senegal might have,\u201d said Aur\u00e9lien Mali, a senior analytical adviser for Africa for Moody\u2019s.Other countries in the region, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have growing economies, and Nigeria is a top economy on the continent.Senegal\u2019s chief rival is Ivory Coast, which has a much larger economy. But Ivory Coast was shaken when civil war broke out in the early 2000s, and aid groups and corporations moved their headquarters to Dakar. More recently it has experienced a terrorist attack at a group of hotels, scaring off potential tourists and businesses.The new airport may give an edge to Senegal. It\u2019s one of the biggest and most expensive compared with several that have recently replaced older airports in Ivory Coast and Togo or are in the works elsewhere in the region. Senegal also has a geographic edge over other nations: It is the closest point on the continent to the Americas.Senegalese officials hope the airport serves three million passengers in its first year.\u201cOur goal is to make Senegal a leader in air transportation in the region and a major player in the international airline business,\u201d said Mohamed Habiboulah Fall, a spokesman for the new airport.A recent discovery of offshore oil and gas near the border of Mauritania has left officials giddy at the opportunity to transform Senegal\u2019s economy and create new jobs. But analysts point out that the region offers numerous cautionary tales of the widespread corruption that can come with oil revenues.\u201cThere are already mistakes by other countries in the region from which Senegal can either learn from, or stand the risk of becoming another country that failed to utilize its resources well,\u201d said Babacar Sene, director for the center of research for applied economics at the University of Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar.The president\u2019s plan for Senegal still faces challenges.Most projects at the new city are still under construction, including even infrastructure for small marketplaces. Housing for workers at the sites, in the middle of an empty, scrubby landscape dotted by baobabs, has yet to be completed. Just one hotel near the new airport, a Radisson Blu, is accepting customers. An expensive express rail service to the airport is nowhere near finished.Frequent fliers here have dreaded the new airport\u2019s opening because it means that in most cases their travel time to and from Dakar itself will quadruple because of clogged roadways, including a fraught stretch outside a busy soccer stadium. A taxi ride to the new airport costs around $35; the ride to the old one cost less than $5.Taxi drivers appear to be among the hardest hit by the opening of the airport. Elimone Thiaw, the secretary general for the union of taxi drivers at the old airport, said that his union had over 500 registered taxis but that so far only 100 of those had been allowed to work at the new airport.The other taxis, he said, will be forced to compete for fares on the streets of Dakar. That, he said, will thwart the president\u2019s hope of the new airport\u2019s relieving congestion in the overcrowded city.On Thursday, Paul Diatta was among passengers waiting for flights under the futuristic, wavy, white-paneled roof that reflected off the new terminal\u2019s gleaming white floor. Because he feared traffic jams, he had arrived six hours before his flight was to depart. Getting to the airport, especially on the official inaugural day, was difficult, he said.\u201cThey should have at least done the inaugural ceremony today and started operations tomorrow so that we won\u2019t struggle through the crowd and heavy traffic to get to here,\u201d Mr. Diatta said.Still, for travelers, the new airport is a welcome relief from the grimy walls, broken seats, stale croissants, struggling air-conditioning and mosquito-infested waiting areas of Dakar\u2019s creaky old one. The best attribute there might have been the graffiti in the women\u2019s bathroom politely wishing fliers safe travels. And now, passengers will no longer have to climb stairs to board planes; they can instead use air-conditioned bridges.Diplomats who toured the airport fretted over the amount of last-minute work, including electrical wiring strung to check-in counters. More important, many had concerns about the safety of the airport\u2019s jet-fuel supply area, where work was still going on in recent days.The problems will be solved, most diplomats said, but it will take time.But merely building an expensive airport is not enough, he said.\u201cFor the airport to fully function and generate income,\u201d Mr. Racine said, \u201cit should be able to take care of the welfare of travelers and help make travel easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Return of the Techno-Moral Panic", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyThe story was a sensation, inspiring a \u201cNightline\u201d feature and drawing the attention of politicians. The full text of the Time article was entered into the Congressional Record by Senator Chuck Grassley, who urged his colleagues to act \u201cto help parents who are under assault in this day and age.\u201d With strong bipartisan support, Congress soon passed the Communications Decency Act, as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which broadly criminalized the transmission of \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d materials to underage internet users. (A Supreme Court ruling in 1997 essentially defanged it.)As moral panics about danger and depravity lost traction, popular tech criticism became nebulous and fretful, concerned with vague themes and forecasts. (\u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d \u201cTinder and the Dawn of the \u2018Dating Apocalypse.\u2019\u2009\u201d) In the absence of coherent critiques, and in the context of a stunningly rapid adoption of smartphones, a righteously defensive posturing about the social consequences of tech went mainstream. Critics were easily dismissed as Luddites, unable to see the future through a misplaced nostalgia for the past. This assumption was frequently vindicated and started to feel a lot like wisdom. As the world truly moved online, abstract fears were repeatedly met with, and answered by, specific, irresistible and unthreatening products and experiences. We had learned our lesson.Our present panics tend to arrive just as new parts of our economy, culture and politics are reconstituted within platform marketplaces \u2014 shifts that have turned out to be bigger than anyone anticipated. Aggravation about \u201cfake news\u201d followed the realization that the business and consumption of online news had been substantially captured by Facebook, which had strenuously resisted categorization as a media company. Children\u2019s entertainment has migrated to new and unexpected venues faster and more completely than either parents or YouTube expected or accounted for. Twitter is now the most effective way to keep up with breaking news, a singular direct line to the president, and a conspicuously mismanaged experiment in centralized public discourse.In this way, these new moral panics do have something in common with Luddism, though not as it is now popularly and mistakenly understood. The original Luddites\u2019 complaint was with the way industrialists were using new textile manufacturing technologies to circumvent labor conventions and to thin their ranks as quickly as possible, not with the technologies themselves. They didn\u2019t so much propose solutions as much as they registered a loud and visceral complaint, smashing machines until they were put down by gunfire. Luddites have been reduced in the popular imagination to misguided fools obstructing the arrival of technologies that we now understand as both primitive and vital to the advance of civilization. Their message was inchoate but fueled by firsthand experience of material change rather than speculative, moralistic doomsaying or elite hand-wringing about what we might have lost.As the internet of 2017 has changed, so has the internet user. We are now in the majority, and our experience is defined by plenitude and freedom, still, but also by a growing sense of exploitation. We find ourselves aware of the power and unaccountability of the new marketplaces in which we socialize, communicate and do business. To cast our recurring panics as technophobic reruns is to misidentify what animates them most: Not fear, but helplessness.It would be a mistake to give credence to every noisy critique of a platform, and some of the inevitable panics about Facebook, Google and Twitter \u2014 not to mention Amazon \u2014 will be bolstered by sheer reactionary traditionalism. But in more cases, these panics will reveal themselves as concrete complaints, addressed to people and companies whose responsibility for the networks that connect us \u2014 for better and for worse \u2014 will finally start to catch up with their power.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at the magazine.Advertisement"}

By his own reckoning, Wall Street\u2019s rally since his election is proof of the economic potency of his presidency.But is Mr. Trump really delivering what investors expected? To answer that question, we assembled a set of Trump Policy Indexes.

The Bulls were, on average, not far ahead of the Bears \u2014 perhaps investors had unrealistic ideas of how easy it would be for Mr. Trump to push his agenda and how effective he would be at doing it.But in the final days of November, with Mr. Trump and Republicans on the verge of a tax cut bill, the index rallied \u2014 not to the optimistic levels seen early in Mr. Trump\u2019s term, but back above its pre-election level.In our policy graphs, which measure whether markets expect Mr. Trump to follow up on his campaign talking points, important events are noted, like the Senate's rejection of health care repeal.

{"Headline": "Once a Cash Cow, Venezuela\u2019s Oil Company Now Verges on Collapse", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen energy prices started to crater several years ago, Venezuela and other oil-dependent nations suffered in tandem. Now, prices are rising and others in the oil patch are on the mend.Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is slashing its deficits and reaping increased revenue. Even dysfunctional Libya and Iraq have been pumping and exporting like mad.Not Venezuela, the country with the largest proven reserves in the world. The state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, teeters on the brink of collapse, its failures at once a symptom and a cause of the nation\u2019s downward economic spiral.The reasons can be clearly seen at the sprawling oil refining complex here on the Caribbean coast. Once the crown jewel of Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, it not only fueled the country\u2019s booming economy but also produced an abundance of lucrative gasoline and diesel for export.Today, the complex is in severe decay. A lack of investment compounded by cash flow problems and chronic shortages of spare parts have crippled operations, critics say.It is closing out the year operating at only 20 percent capacity, with 76 of 84 plants paralyzed, said Iv\u00e1n Freites, a union leader and outspoken government critic. The complex does not have the computer software to diagnose its production problems, nor the money to fix them if they did.\u201cIt\u2019s like a slow death,\u201d Mr. Freites said.With facilities around the country in disrepair, Venezuela has been unable to take advantage of rising prices by pumping out more oil and ramping up refinery operations. Production is falling 20,000 barrels to 50,000 barrels a day month after month and is now at its lowest level in nearly three decades.\u201cWith production going down and down, there is a spiral of less cash and less investment and less production,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been such a collapse in cash flow of any national oil company.\u201dPdvsa\u2019s production problems have been exacerbated by the turbulence in its leadership. In the last few months, the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro arrested scores of managers on corruption charges. Mr. Maduro says the prosecutions are an effort to clean up the company. But critics view the sweep as a political purge by the Mr. Maduro to consolidate power ahead of presidential elections next year.And last month, the president appointed Major General Manuel Quevedo to run both Pdvsa and the oil ministry \u2014 though he had no known experience in the energy sector. Critics viewed the move as a transparent effort by Mr. Maduro to safeguard against a coup.Luis Giusti, who ran Pdvsa before President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power in 1999, said Mr. Maduro\u2019s purge was \u201cmore of a political campaign to see if they can have some breathing room because everything is going down the drain.\u201d\u201cThey have been managing the corporation for 18 years and then all of a sudden they are saying now they are going to rescue the corporation,\u201d he added. \u201cRescue from whom?\u201dFor generations, Pdvsa delivered mightily on the promises of Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, funding the nation\u2019s socialist-inspired revolution and making it one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America. But production in recent years has plummeted so far that Pdvsa is no longer able to meet domestic demand for diesel and gasoline, forcing the country to import increasing amounts of both, including from the United States.The company\u2019s crude exports have also fallen drastically. Shipments to the United States, Pdvsa\u2019s top foreign market, plunged by a third over the last year. Mr. Maduro has threatened to cut crude exports to the United States entirely and sell more to China and India. But crude exports to China have also fallen \u2014 by nearly 15 percent over the last year \u2014 as the quality of its oil has declined and China has increased its purchases from the United States.Pdvsa is also sagging under the burden of immense debt. It has been effectively in default on its $26.5 billion in unsecured bonds since early November, and it owes roughly $60 billion more to its service companies that drill and maintain its fields.The Maduro administration has insisted that it intends to continue to make payments on its debts, and investors have been largely tolerant of payment delays. But Pdvsa\u2019s financial health has become so perilous that Cuba, Venezuela\u2019s closest ally, recently took the company\u2019s 49 percent share in a Cuban refinery as payment for outstanding debts.This company\u2019s struggles are particularly evident in the two sprawling refineries that bracket this small city and form part of the Paraguan\u00e1 Refining Center, one of the largest refinery complexes in the world.As recently as 2015, the center, with a capacity of nearly a million barrels a day, was processing about 587,000 barrels a day, according to Pdvsa\u2019s website. The crude was converted into a range of products, including gasoline, jet fuel, asphalts and lubricants.But the refineries, like most of the company\u2019s facilities around the country, have fallen into grave disrepair. The situation has forced severe cutbacks in operations, leading to layoffs and an increase in accidents and injuries, workers and union leaders said.The refineries have been recently plagued by a series of mishaps.In late October, some 200,000 gallons of gasoline and other products spilled from a slop tank in one of the refineries, Amuay, into the adjacent bay. The spill killed wildlife and forced local fishermen to suspend fishing for weeks.Then an overworked pump in the same refinery failed, leaving operational only two of five distillation units, a key part of the refining process, workers and union leaders said.Days later, a fire broke out in a separate refinery, Card\u00f3n, leaving only one of five distillation units functioning. Workers reported that the emergency crew that responded could do little more than to watch the fire burn out on its own. They had run out of firefighting foam.In the midst of it all, production came to a near-standstill, dropping to just 13 percent of capacity in early-December before rebounding slightly, Mr. Freites said. Three of Amuay\u2019s distillation units and two at Card\u00f3n were functioning this week, the union leader said on Wednesday, but he added that another fire had broken out in Card\u00f3n on Tuesday causing injuries.The disintegration of the refineries has left many workers dispirited.Employees have lost all interest, said Emilio, a worker in the Card\u00f3n refinery who asked that his last name be withheld because he feared punishment by the authorities for criticizing the company. He said they were simply punching the clock.Wage increases have lagged far behind soaring inflation and workers have seen their purchasing power drop markedly and benefits reduced sharply. Some employees have been forced to sell their gloves and helmets to put food on their family\u2019s dinner table, workers said. Pride of association with Pdvsa has evaporated.Before, people would be devastated if they lost a job at Pdvsa, said Jos\u00e9, a worker in the Amuay refinery who also asked that his last name be withheld because he feared retribution from his bosses for speaking publicly about the company. Now, he said, many dread going to work and are looking for jobs elsewhere.In recent years, the company has slashed the number of contractors employed at the refineries, said Mr. Freites, general secretary of the Oil and Gas Workers Union of Falc\u00f3n State. But with production at a crawl, he said, even salaried workers are left with little to do, and many spend their days playing cards and dominoes.Pdvsa\u2019s downfall is rippling through this once-thriving company town. Roads are plunged into darkness at night because thieves have made off with the wires that carry power to the street lamps. Shops in the city\u2019s downtown, once abuzz with commerce, are now shuttered.Residents have migrated abroad in search of work and better lives. Hundreds of oil workers have signed three-year contracts in recent weeks to work for $10 an hour in construction helping the Caribbean island of St. Martin rebuild following the hurricanes.Jos\u00e9 said he went to work every day wondering which of his colleagues would be the latest to leave; he compared the experience to a reality show. Pdvsa, he said, is now an empty shell.Kirk Semple reported from Punto Fijo, and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Meridith Kohut contributed reporting from Punto Fijo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Francine Prose\u2019s Oaxaca: An Immersion Course in Mexico\u2019s Delights", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCultured TravelerI can\u2019t think of a better way to counter the \u201calternative facts\u201d we have been hearing in the political discourse about Mexico and Mexicans than to go there and see for ourselves, to experience firsthand the country\u2019s physical beauty, its rich traditions, the hospitality and kindness of its people. And I can\u2019t think of a better place to start than Oaxaca, an easy trip of less than an hour, by air, from Mexico City. At least partly because of its pleasant climate, temperate all year round, Oaxaca has become an appealing tourist destination.Oaxaca was the first place in Mexico to which I traveled with my family, 30 years ago, and the place to which I returned most recently, with husband, our grown son, our Mexican daughter-in-law and three grandchildren in tow \u2014 a city that seems remarkably unchanged, despite the fact that its area and population have grown, over the decades.Even at the busiest times, the mood \u2014 in this city of under 300,000 people \u2014 is relaxed, the traffic manageable, and one never feels mobbed by hordes of sightseers and shoppers. Though there are periodic eruptions of political tension \u2014 several buildings, including the law school, still bear the scars of a teachers\u2019 strike in 2016, and seven months of unrest accompanied an earlier strike in 2006 \u2014 Oaxaca continues to feel friendly, safe and welcoming. The recent earthquakes that so damaged Mexico City and its environs (including Oaxaca State) shook buildings in Oaxaca City, but failed to do serious damage, and the city continues to welcome tourists, on whom a significant portion of its economy depends.Though the exact date of its initial construction is uncertain, we know that Mitla thrived from the 8th century until the Spanish conquest, in the early 16th century. Yet what\u2019s most striking about Mitla is not so much its age as its beauty. Decorating its walls, its pillars, lintels and archways are fragments of brightly painted frescoes, as well as remarkably well-preserved and stunningly elaborate geometric designs made of mosaics of small stones set into the stucco around them \u2014 an architectural feature unique in all of Mesoamerica, the area encompassing much of Mexico and Central America. Even the grandchildren were excited by Mitla, by the sensation of being able to move from one enclosed space to another, almost like going from outdoor room to outdoor room in a magnificent ruined house.But arguably the most beautiful (and certainly my favorite) is the Templo de Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n, which was built by the Dominican friars in the 16th and 17th centuries. The ornately gilded interior of the church features a ceiling decorated with bright polychrome figures, including a lively representation of Santo Domingo\u2019s family tree that evokes pre-Columbian images of the Tree of Life. The bas reliefs on the western facade were done by local sculptors, descendants of the artisans responsible for the carving at Mitla, and in one chapel is the statue of a saint dressed in an indigenous costume.There\u2019s a lot to see in Oaxaca, but it\u2019s a place that can also be enjoyed by those with only a limited interest in archaeology, history, architecture and art. Above all, Oaxaca is a wonderful place to be, to stroll, to shop, to spend time in the food, flower and handicrafts markets, and \u2014 not insignificantly \u2014 to eat. And it\u2019s a great walking town. Around nearly every corner in the historical center, you may come upon a bright blue, yellow or orange wall, stenciled with the inventive advertising posters for which Oaxaca is known.I bought several woven tote bags decorated with Mexican folk motifs \u2014 perfect for carrying books, papers and (small amounts of) groceries. I also found a mask made from straw that, as the vendor helpfully showed us, could be rolled into a sort of tubelike parcel and easily stowed in a suitcase without damage. At one end of the market, farthest from the z\u00f3calo, is the section where \u2014 as in all the greatest Mexican markets \u2014 one can eat at counters and small stalls. Here, the adventurous can sample tropical fruit juices and an enormous range of delicious foods.In the market, one can browse the glittering displays of mezcal bottles, many with gorgeous labels advertising their origin in small local distilleries. Agave, from which mezcal is made, is grown throughout the Oaxaca Valley and is one of its most important crops. Driving along the well-marked roads surrounding Oaxaca, one passes agave farms, lined with attractive orderly rows of plants that resemble a cross between an aloe and a pineapple top. Travelers with an interest in sampling the local product (served straight up or in elaborate cocktails) can do so at one of the many stylish mezcal bars that have sprung up throughout the centro.Several smaller and more low-key markets selling crafts \u2014 beaded purses, embroidered shirts, woven belts, filigree earrings, as well as the painted, whimsical wooden animals made in the nearby village of Arrazola \u2014 are near the Templo de Santo Domingo, on the other side of the z\u00f3calo and a 20-minute walk from the 20th of November market. And throughout the centro are dozens of small, inviting boutiques featuring clothes, accessories and household goods that combine traditional craft with high design.If one ventures further afield, it\u2019s possible to visit nearby villages known for their particular specialties. San Bartolo de Coyotepec is celebrated for its unique black glazed pottery. In the village of Teotitl\u00e1n del Valle, nearly every household appears to be involved in weaving gorgeous woolen rugs, and it can be visited on the way to Mitla.Oaxaca is justly famous for its mole, a piquant sauce with a complex blend of spices and flavors including (in one of its more familiar iterations) chocolate. In fact there are many variations on the theme of mole that one can try around Oaxaca, where large numbers of talented chefs, inspired by the region\u2019s culinary heritage, have dedicated themselves to reinventing traditional dishes, and to preparing elegant yet unpretentious food served in surroundings ranging from funky and cool to luxurious, stylish and ultramodern.But by far my favorite souvenir, which I bought in the central market, was a generous amount of the Mexican chocolate for which Oaxaca is famous. Cups of the steaming hot chocolate are among the most reliable ways I know to keep my spirits up during a cold winter and in this unsettling political climate.Sipping the chocolate, I think about Oaxaca and feel ever so slightly warmer as I imagine walking its cobbled streets, past its painted houses, its shaded plazas and Baroque churches. And I watch the video which we took on New Year\u2019s Eve in the courtyard of the Templo de Santo Domingo. Behind those bright swirls of light inscribed on the dusky twilight are two granddaughters with twirling sparklers, celebrating the joy of being in this magical place, with their family, on a perfect holiday evening.There are several direct flights daily from Mexico City to Oaxaca, an hourlong trip.Los DanzantesCalle Macedonia Alcala 403; Phone 52 951 501 1187; losdanzantes.comCatedralCalle Manuel Garcia Vigil 105; Phone 52 951 516 3285; restaurantecatedral.com.mxItanon\u00edAv Belisario Dominguez 513; Phone 52 951 513 9223; email (via Facebook)Francine Prose\u2019s latest novel is \u201cMister Monkey.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Ed\u2019s Low Moment", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen all was said and done, the tax overhaul that President Trump signed into law a little more than a week ago didn\u2019t beat up on higher education to the extent that earlier drafts of the legislation did. Americans who were deducting interest on student loans will still be able to do so. The tuition waivers that many graduate students receive won\u2019t be treated as income.Or this unsettling, dangerous paradox: At a time when a college degree is one of the surest harbingers of higher earnings and better economic security, college itself is regarded with skepticism by many Americans and outright contempt by no small number of them.Its tumble from grace came into sharp focus in 2017, so the end of this year is a fitting moment to examine what happened and how to fix it. Repair is imperative, because the continued competitiveness of the American economy depends on the skills of our work force, the intellectual nimbleness of our citizens, the boldness of our scientific research and the genius of our inventions. Our colleges and universities are central to that. When they lose support, we all lose.That\u2019s not so surprising, given Americans\u2019 intensifying resentment of anything that smacks of elitism and given Republicans\u2019 attacks on science and intellectuals. As Ron Daniels, the president of Johns Hopkins University, recently told me, \u201cEven if we were completely unblemished in the way in which we pursued our mission, it would be hard to imagine that in Trump\u2019s America, we wouldn\u2019t be targets for scorn.\u201dMargaret Spellings, who was education secretary in the George W. Bush administration and is now president of the University of North Carolina, said that colleges are plenty blemished and that this reckoning was years in the making. Too many of them had maintained too aloof a posture.My conversations with Spellings, Daniels and Hiram Chodosh, president of Claremont McKenna College, actually filled me with hope, because not one of them was baffled by the bind that colleges are in. All of them conceded some culpability. And all of them identified, and expressed a commitment to, necessary changes.\u201cThe tax proposals, though self-defeating, emerge from an understandable and growing public frustration,\u201d Chodosh said. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. Like the general society, we have an increasing divide in higher education between the haves and the have-nots. Our sticker price is high.\u201d He added that \u201cour policies are opaque, confusing and tend to squeeze out middle-class families who are unaware, or just above the line, of eligibility for aid. Even among the privileged, few can get in.\u201dChodosh\u2019s \u201cour\u201d refers to America\u2019s most exclusive colleges, with the lowest acceptance rates, and one problem, fostered by those of us in the media as much as anyone else, is an undue obsession with those schools to the exclusion of others. Higher education encompasses community colleges, technical schools and scores of public universities without storied names. They educate exponentially more students than the Ivy League does, and our lopsided conversation about the Ivy and its ilk have deepened the divisions that Chodosh mentioned.Daniels bluntly acknowledged \u201cthe lack of political diversity on our campuses,\u201d saying, \u201cNot only is this bad for our students in terms of preparing them for leadership roles in a very politically polarized country, but it has grave consequences for broader political debate in the country.\u201d He mentioned a new facet of orientation for incoming students at Hopkins that stresses the importance of free speech, drawing on experts from across the political spectrum. Other colleges have taken similar steps.\u201cHigher education has enjoyed this sort of send-us-the-money, leave-us-alone luxury for a long time, and that\u2019s just not the case anymore,\u201d Spellings said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to prove what we do.\u201d If 2017 was the year when our most celebrated colleges belatedly woke up to that, may 2018 be the year when they successfully attend to it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Delivers a Mixed Message on His National Security Approach", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump presented a blueprint for the country\u2019s national security on Monday that warns of a treacherous world in which the United States faces rising threats from an emboldened Russia and China, as well as from what it calls rogue governments, like North Korea and Iran.To fend off these multiple challenges, the report says with Cold War urgency, the government must put \u201cAmerica First,\u201d fortifying its borders, ripping up unfair trade agreements and rebuilding its military might.But in his speech announcing the strategy, Mr. Trump struck a much different tone. Instead of explaining the nature of these threats, he delivered a campaignlike address, with familiar calls to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico and a heavy dose of self-congratulation for the bull market, the low jobless rate and tax cuts, which, he promised, were \u201cdays away.\u201d\u201cAmerica is in the game, and America is going to win,\u201d he said, to an audience that included cabinet members and military officers.The disconnect between the president\u2019s speech and the analysis in his administration\u2019s document attests to the broader challenge his national security advisers have faced, as they have struggled to develop an intellectual framework that encompasses Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable, domestically driven and Twitter-fueled approach to foreign policy. The same confusion has confronted foreign governments trying to understand Mr. Trump\u2019s conflicting signals.Indeed, Mr. Trump preferred to focus on a Sunday phone call from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who thanked him for intelligence that the C.I.A. had passed on to Russian authorities, which Mr. Trump said foiled a terrorist attack in St. Petersburg that could have killed thousands of people.\u201cThat\u2019s a great thing,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201dOutlining a national security strategy is mandated by Congress, but Mr. Trump broke with his two most recent predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, in announcing one himself. His aides said that reflected his enthusiastic approval of the exercise, and that the Trump administration published its strategy months earlier than either the Bush or Obama administrations.The strategy \u2014 which administration officials said was drawn from speeches that Mr. Trump had delivered during the 2016 campaign and as president while at the United Nations and on trips in Europe and Asia \u2014 ranges widely and includes jihadi extremism, space exploration, nuclear proliferation and pandemics. But it is animated by a single idea: that the world has been on a three-decade holiday from superpower rivalry; and it suggests that that holiday is now over.\u201cAfter being dismissed as a phenomenon of an earlier century, great power competition returned,\u201d the document says. China and Russia, it says, \u201care determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence.\u201dThe document\u2019s call to push back against China on trade is familiar from the campaign, but its description of the challenge posed by Russia seems at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s own refusal to criticize Mr. Putin for his seizure of Crimea, his efforts to destabilize Ukraine and his violations of a key nuclear treaty with the United States.While Mr. Obama\u2019s two national security strategies emphasized cooperation with allies and economic partners, Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy attempts to walk the line between his campaign slogan of \u201cAmerica First\u201d and an insistence that he is not rejecting working with American partners \u2014 as long as they do so on terms advantageous to the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy contains more than a few hints of a return to a Cold War view of the world. Mr. Obama used his strategies to de-emphasize nuclear weapons as a key to American defense, but Mr. Trump calls those weapons \u201cthe foundation of our strategy to preserve peace and stability by deterring aggression against the United States.\u201dThe national security strategies of past administrations were sometimes strong predictors of future action: It was Mr. Bush\u2019s 2002 strategy that revived a national debate about the justifications for pre-emptive military action. And it helped frame the rationale for the invasion of Iraq six months later, arguing that the risks of inaction in the face of a major threat made \u201ca compelling case for taking anticipatory actions to defend ourselves.\u201dThe new strategy never uses the word \u201cpre-emption,\u201d including in its discussion of North Korea. This omission comes despite the fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, has said that if diplomacy and sanctions fail, \u201cpreventive war,\u201d or a pre-emptive strike, might be needed to keep the North from attacking the United States.Mr. Obama viewed China as a potential partner in confronting global threats, from Iran\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs to climate change, although he was critical of it on human rights issues.Mr. Trump defines China as a \u201crevisionist\u201d power, reflecting the administration\u2019s worry that Beijing is trying to rewrite the rules of the post-World War II order to match its own economic interests and global ambitions. (Russia is also described as revisionist, though it does not have China\u2019s economic reach or influence.)The Trump administration\u2019s language suggests it will push back hard on China\u2019s state-driven economic practices and expansionist claims in the South China Sea, while not challenging it on rights issues.Mr. Trump has tried working with China to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, even setting aside his America First trade agenda in an effort to persuade President Xi Jinping to put more economic pressure on the government of Kim Jong-un. But the document suggests a return to his campaign promises, and states explicitly that \u201cthe United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression.\u201dAnother section refers to preserving the \u201cnational security innovation base,\u201d at a moment that the administration is considering steps to keep China from investing in promising American technology.In another shift from his predecessor, Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy does not recognize the changing climate as a threat to national security. The document instead places climate under a section on embracing \u201cenergy dominance,\u201d and says that while \u201cclimate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,\u201d American leadership will be \u201cindispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda.\u201dThat puts it at odds with the Pentagon, which has continued to highlight national security threats from a changing climate, including refugee flows as a result of droughts and intensifying storms and the repercussions of rising sea waters.In describing the use of cyberattacks against the United States, the document described the problems facing the nation rather than prescribing solutions. It refers to cyberweapons as a new threat because they can strike \u201cwithout ever physically crossing our borders.\u201d\u201cDeterrence today is significantly more complex to achieve than during the Cold War,\u201d the document reads, saying a mix of inexpensive weapons and \u201cthe use of cybertools have allowed state and nonstate competitors to harm the United States across various domains.\u201dBut the document deals with the subject at some remove, not dwelling on how Russia used cybertechniques in an attempt to interfere with the 2016 election. And it does nothing to describe any broad national strategy to guard against meddling in future elections.Some foreign policy experts praised the report for its vigorous tone.\u201cIt\u2019s a robust statement of U.S. leadership on the world stage,\u201d said Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s a rejection of isolationism.\u201dOthers, however, said the disjunction between Mr. Trump and his national security team raised questions about how relevant the strategy would be.\u201cWho does it represent? What does it represent? How seriously should we take it?\u201d asked Richard N. Haass, who served in the State Department during the George W. Bush administration and is now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cIn my experience, national security strategies have a fairly short shelf life,\u201d Mr. Haass added. \u201cThis administration will face that reality \u2014 and then some.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Readers in Michigan: We Need More Skills, Not More Jobs", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Times in PersonA common experience after writing an article is that once it\u2019s published, people come out of the woodwork to tell you things you wish you had known. It doesn\u2019t matter that you spent weeks reporting in the first place.Usually these readers reach a reporter by email or in the online comments. But the other day I had the rare and rewarding experience of meeting them in person, at a forum The Times organized in Jackson, Mich., to follow up on a profile I wrote of a young factory owner there. I came away wishing I\u2019d interviewed many of the Jackson residents who turned out. It\u2019s not that I would have changed the thrust of my story. But the extra voices added richness and depth.I made four or five visits to Ms. Quillen\u2019s company, Diversified Engineering & Plastics, which produces injection-molded plastic parts for the automobile industry, during May and June.\u201cI was like, O.K., is he ever going to be leaving?\u201d she quipped to the nearly 100 community members who turned out for the forum on Nov. 28.The focus was jobs and the manufacturing economy, and we were joined onstage by Mindy Bradish-Orta, president of the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce, and Bill Rayl, president of the Jackson Area Manufacturers Association.The audience included officials from the city, the school district, local companies and others passionate about seeing Jackson County (pop. 160,000) thrive. To some, the community no longer hummed as it once had when Goodyear tire employed 1,500 there, with union wages, at a now-defunct factory.\u201cThe panacea that it\u2019s going to be 1967 again is not going to happen,\u201d one audience member lamented. \u201cThose jobs are gone.\u201dBoth Ms. Bradish-Orta and Mr. Rayl said Jackson\u2019s employers had to compete with the lure of the bright lights from cities like Detroit and Ann Arbor. Ms. Bradish-Orta called it a \u201cperception problem\u201d and praised her county\u2019s abundant lakes and golf courses.I cited statistics showing there were thousands fewer manufacturing jobs these days in Jackson, long a blue-collar hub, than there were in 2000. What was the problem?Ms. Quillen and the others said that companies couldn\u2019t find workers qualified to fill advanced manufacturing jobs, and that many people lacked good work habits.\u201cWe\u2019ve got an entire generation of people that don\u2019t have the work ethic, haven\u2019t had it instilled in them by parents and society,\u201d said Mr. Rayl, whose group trains young people for manufacturing careers.A couple of audience members who advise students pointed out that 37 percent of Jackson high school graduates do not go to college, but the option of working in manufacturing hasn\u2019t always been evident to them, especially those raised in front of digital screens.\u201cKids haven\u2019t played in their backyards and made birdhouses and forts; they don\u2019t know they like to work with their hands,\u201d said Cari Bushinski, the curriculum director for a local school district. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was when we were young.\u201dUnemployment in Jackson is low. Wages, however, are not growing. Median household income is actually 11 percent lower than in 2005.Daveda Quinn, a city employee whose job in environmental quality brings her into factories, said she sees people every day walking to work along a busy road because they do not have cars and there are no city buses.Ms. Quillen joined in. \u201cWe have a significant amount of employees that walk or ride their bikes,\u201d she said.A few online comments on the original article criticized Ms. Quillen for not paying workers well enough to make a decent living or display commitment to the company. Her pay scale, starting at around $10 an hour, reflects the local economy, she said, and there are opportunities to earn considerably more.\u201cAnyone can walk in right now to D.E.P. and take a job that starts at $10.50 and work up to making $25 an hour in less than four years if they choose to,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a college education. They need to have grit.\u201dWill you invest in your plant and create more jobs if you receive a tax windfall? I asked Ms. Quillen.Her answer was revealing: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hire more people unless you\u2019re adding more sales.\u201d Instead, she said, she would \u201cinvest in the employees we have,\u201d by offering more skills training and reducing their health insurance costs. \u201cBy giving them more skills, you can justify paying them more.

Only problem is now he\u2019s so full of himself he can\u2019t stick to the script.Then again, some of his tweets are slyly funny. He has a capacity for answering questions in a reasonably coherent way. And there\u2019s no getting away from the purely instrumental benefits he derives with his seemingly insane tweets. He baits his critics. He delights his fans. And he debases the currencies of civility and normal politics to the point where we are all sinking to his level.He\u2019s also always had a problem remembering inconvenient facts. But if we\u2019re now dealing with a guy who seriously believes that the voice on that \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape is not really his, that\u2019s super scary.Whether he\u2019s crazy or not, it\u2019s important for his opponents to presume he isn\u2019t. His behavior has a certain pattern, and those patterns can be politically effective. Speaking of which, what do you make of his latest claim that the F.B.I.\u2019s reputation is \u201cin tatters\u201d?One of the ironies of the last week has been the way Trump\u2019s behavior managed to almost completely obliterate attention on the big tax bill. Which I guess is going to become law.Can we take a short break from the mental health of our chief executive to talk about it? What do you think?But go ahead, about taxes \u2014Things I don\u2019t: the possibility of a fourth tax bracket, which could push tax rates above 50 percent for people who live in places like, er, Manhattan. The elimination of the health insurance mandate, which I might have supported in a broader health care reform but seems like a way of gutting the current system without reforming it. The \u201cHarvard tax\u201d on large university endowments, which may have the satisfaction of sticking it to liberals but damages great universities that are crown jewels of our society.Look, most of our readers aren\u2019t going to agree with me on any of this. But the markets on which many of our readers depend through their IRAs and 401(k)s are cheering. And all that corporate profitability will work its way through a private economy that seems to be booming again.But I have two great fears. One is that the economy is going to become seriously overheated. We already have a very low unemployment rate, a shortage of new immigrant families to expand the younger population, and a stock market that\u2019s hitting historic peaks every day, much to our president\u2019s delight. I\u2019m afraid a new surge \u2014 fueled by the government spending money \u2014 is going to pop the bubble and push us toward a really mean recession.The other is that Republicans are already looking at said deficit, licking their chops and preparing to cut entitlements. You\u2019ve already got the president talking about how \u201cwe\u2019re looking very strongly at welfare reform.\u201d By which he presumably means those two huge programs he swore he\u2019d never touch during the election.But then we\u2019ve already pretty much agreed that nothing Donald Trump says counts for anything.I vote for a long-term fix by raising the current cap on payroll taxes. But that can be a debate for another time. Go ahead.What I do know is that if the economy does do well, Trump will claim, and the G.O.P., will get, the credit. And I don\u2019t see Democrats taking that politically into account. Too many eggs in the impeachment basket, methinks. Which makes me wonder: Where do you think Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation go from here?Certainly something to look forward to in the new year. What\u2019s your bet?Here is what we know. The former national security adviser lied to the F.B.I. He appears to have been directed to make contact with the Russians by the president\u2019s son-in-law, who may have been speaking on his father-in-law\u2019s behalf. One former campaign aide who lied to the F.B.I. appeared to have no role in the campaign other than to establish contacts with the Russians. The former campaign chairman was, at a minimum, vulnerable to Russian blackmail on account of his allegedly illicit business ties with a corrupt Ukrainian president. The president of the United States kept bending over backward to make nice to Vladimir Putin and does so to this day. This president also had longstanding ambitions to do business in Russia. The president\u2019s son held a meeting with Russian figures in hopes of finding dirt on Hillary Clinton.Fire? Maybe not. But we are dying of smoke inhalation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Forecasters Get It Wrong: Always", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts \u2014 global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers \u2014 the experts got the year wrong.They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher.Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade.The forecasting misses of 2017 reflect mistakes humans have been making since we started thinking about the future. Every forecaster knows that economies rise and fall constantly, oscillating around a long-term trend line. Yet forecasts typically extrapolate current trends on a straight line, so the vision of tomorrow closely resembles today, often implausibly so. A year ago forecasters thought 2017 would look like 2016; instead the world economy had its best year since the financial crisis of 2008.The weakness of straight-line forecasts explains why the consensus of leading economists has consistently missed big turns. They have not predicted a single United States recession since the Federal Reserve began keeping such records a half-century ago, and missed many revivals, including the unusually broad global expansion of 2017.Few dare predict big shifts, so they tinker at the margins. And once an economy gets labeled \u201cmiraculous\u201d or \u201chopeless,\u201d the stereotype sticks. Japan had gone cold for so long few experts could imagine it warming up in 2017, but it did. After long slumps, \u201cOld Man Europe,\u201d Russia and Brazil also recovered much faster than expected. In part, these economies were just rebounding toward their long-term average or, as economists say, \u201creverting to the mean.\u201dEconomic stereotypes are reinforced by political biases, like Europe\u2019s ingrained fear of extreme nationalism. In early 2017, forecasters took rising poll numbers for nationalists, extrapolated them into the future and imagined formerly fringe right-wingers gaining influence and setting off a eurozone crisis. Instead, the center held, and sheer relief helped propel the surprise economic recovery.Forecasters are prone to focus on a single story line, particularly one as compelling as angry populism. The consensus view figured Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans would increase growth in the United States, while his protectionist threats would undercut the rest of the world. Most forecasters share the establishment disdain for Mr. Trump, yet few paused to consider whether a leader they see as inept and divisive could deliver all this as fast as he promised.He didn\u2019t, and the widely hyped \u201cTrump Bump\u201d barely surfaced in 2017. Yes, the United States economy grew around 2 percent and generated jobs at a healthy pace. But both trends date to well before Mr. Trump. Liberals who thought Mr. Trump would induce a global recession proved even farther off the mark.If one were to avoid the straight-line projections, political biases and single factors that so often distort forecasts, what would a 2018 forecast look like? Not like the consensus, which is euphoric over the current combo of high growth and low inflation. Usually staid Wall Street economists are giving their 2018 forecasts headlines like \u201cBoom Shaka-laka-laka\u201d and \u201cAs Good as It Gets.\u201d Inspired by a cocksure consensus, investors are holding less money in cash than they ever have before \u2014 meaning they are all-in on risky investments.Confidence this solid is a warning sign of complacency. For one, gross domestic product growth is at the top end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade, so it is more likely to slip than accelerate. That should be sobering for every major power, including Trump\u2019s America. But please, it\u2019s not all about him. For better or worse, Mr. Trump had less impact on the global economy than most experts expected in 2017. The lesson \u2014 the inevitable rarely happens, the unexpected often does \u2014 applies as well to forecasting 2018.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Next Potential Boom Spot: The Places People Overlook", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIANGDUO, China \u2014 One crisp October morning, Han Youjun got into his silver delivery van and left this small town in eastern China. Within minutes, his van brimming with boxes of every size and shape, he was rumbling through rice paddies, down narrow village lanes and past modest farmhouses, deeper and deeper into China\u2019s vast hinterland.In the past, delivery drivers like Mr. Han would have had little reason to travel so far. China\u2019s boom over the past four decades made its crowded metropolises wealthy. Much of the rest of the country, especially farming communities like those surrounding Liangduo, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, remained relatively poor.\u201cThe workdays have been getting longer,\u201d he said.In the prefecture that contains Liangduo, Yancheng, locals\u2019 wallets are fattening more quickly than the national rate, and their household spending \u2014 which surged 8 percent per person in 2016 \u2014 outpaced the rises in Beijing and Shanghai.Signs of that new prosperity can be seen at Auto City, a jumble of ramshackle, boxy buildings in Yancheng where Toyota, Ford and just about every other major brand compete for customers. Zhou Zhengguo, owner of a dealership for the Chinese automaker Geely, expects to sell 2,000 cars this year, four times more than just two years ago.\u201cMost people who bought cars were private businessmen,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cNow working-class people buy, too.\u201dThose who live in China\u2019s less developed places could be crucial to the next stage of China\u2019s development.Robin Xing, an economist at Morgan Stanley, believes consumer spending in places like Yancheng\u2019s urban center will continue to outperform bigger cities. As a result, two-thirds of all additional private consumption growth will come from these less developed areas through 2030.\u201cWe do expect them to catch up, to narrow the income gap with the large cities,\u201d Mr. Xing said.Businesses are looking at such areas in a new light. New highways and high-speed railways make relocating factories and other operations into smaller cities easier, allowing companies to take advantage of their lower costs. Industrial output in Yancheng expanded more quickly than the national rate last year.The gains are not limited to the hinterland\u2019s main towns. Farms are becoming bigger, more efficient and more lucrative.In Xinling, a nearby village, Luo Jianhai, 37, is typical of a new breed of farmer-entrepreneur. He has steadily expanded the farm where he tills rice and wheat by renting land from his neighbors. He also invested in two new tractors, which he lends out to other farmers who need them to work their own larger plots. Over the past three years his annual income has increased seven times, to $100,000, and his spending has quadrupled, mainly on higher-quality clothing for his three children and a new, $17,000 car from a General Motors joint venture.His improved lifestyle, Mr. Luo said, \u201cis the difference between being poor and having money.\u201dNearby, Cheng Zhiguo, 47, also enlarged his farm this year, increasing his net income to about $23,000 \u2014 five times greater than just three years ago. His reward: his first car, a Hyundai, bought in August.Such change is luring urban entrepreneurs such as Zhou Jian. Mr. Zhou, a 33-year-old resident of Nanjing, a major city in eastern China, figured that large-scale farming would also need more money. In 2013, he founded Nongfenqi E-Commerce Company, which helps arrange loans for farming families from banks and other lenders.Nongfenqi has since arranged about $150 million in loans, opened more than 100 offices spread around rural China and hired 800 employees. \u201cThe upgrading of the market allows businesses like us to serve these big farmers,\u201d Mr. Zhou said.Such opportunity has attracted JD.com. Over the past three years, JD.com has more than doubled its army of deliverymen, many aimed at reaching into rural towns and villages.\u201cBuilding a rural logistics network is one of our most important strategies,\u201d said Wang Hui, JD.com\u2019s head of delivery services. \u201cWith consumption developing in rural areas, we hope we can catch this opportunity to expand our business.\u201dThat chilly morning in Liangduo, where the delivery station opened last year, a giant JD.com truck squeezed down a cluttered central street to disgorge hundreds of packages, which were sorted and carried to customers by nine full-time delivery personnel. The station is intended to help introduce residents to how e-commerce works. Next door, a merchant transformed his appliance shop into a JD.com outlet, where farmers, often unfamiliar with e-commerce, can test products available online and place orders.It\u2019s an \u201conline-to-offline\u201d experiment to educate these new consumers in online shopping. The delivery station \u201cis not just a logistics center,\u201d said the JD.com manager in Liangduo, Ye Huanglong. \u201cAnyone can come in and ask questions.\u201dNot all rural regions are advancing as quickly as Liangduo. Hu Bingchuan, deputy researcher at the Rural Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, fears companies may discover, at least for now, that their profits from countryside customers do not match their efforts to chase them.\u201cMost rural areas are not that successful yet,\u201d he said. \u201cE-commerce platforms won\u2019t be able to copy their success in cities to rural regions.\u201dThe future, though, holds promise. One of Mr. Han\u2019s first stops is at the home of Han Aifeng, a farmer. She ordered cartons of milk, which, she said, make for a convenient refreshment when tending her fish-farming ponds. The milk is among China\u2019s most expensive brands, but Ms. Han, 64, can now afford it. Her husband works at a furniture factory, while she has increased the family income by raising crayfish and selling them in the local marketplace.In all, the household\u2019s annual income doubled in the past two years, to about $30,000, and Ms. Han\u2019s spending on food and other goods has increased as well, much of it ordered online, using her smartphone. Discarded delivery boxes for pomelo, rice wine and yogurt are stacked on top of old rice hulls in a corner of her home\u2019s courtyard.\u201cI used to have to ride an electric bike to the market when I needed to go shopping,\u201d Ms. Han said. \u201cNow people bring everything to my door.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a deputy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He is Hu Bingchuan, not Binchuan.Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

Many returned to the streets after Mr. Boakai\u2019s concession speech.The election\u2019s peaceful conclusion was seen by some as a milestone for the fledgling democracy, which was founded almost two centuries ago by freed American slaves but has not seen a peaceful transition of power since 1944.Ibrahim al-Bakri Nyei, 30, a doctoral student in Liberian politics, came of age during a 14-year civil war that left 250,000 dead and the nation\u2019s infrastructure destroyed.

What we do know is that the administration has produced no empirical cost-benefit analysis to support its proposal, which is customary when the government seeks to make an important change to federal regulations.By changing the fundamental underpinnings of tipping, the government might well end up destroying this practice.

But this isn\u2019t a story about people who swiped right.Adam J. Kurtz, 29, and Mitchell Kuga, 30, first connected Dec. 1, 2012, five years to the day before their wedding.It was just before 5 p.m. and Mr. Kurtz, living in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, ordered a pizza. As one does, when one is 24 and living amid a generation of creative people whose every utterance and experience might be thought of as content, Mr. Kurtz filmed and posted to Tumblr a 10-minute video showing him awaiting the delivery.Among those who liked the video was a stranger Mr. Kurtz had already admired from afar. It was a guy named Mitchell who didn\u2019t reveal his last name on his Tumblr account, just his photographic eye for Brooklyn street scenes and, on occasion, his face. Mr. Kurtz had developed a bit of a social-media crush on him. \u201cI would think, \u2018He\u2019s not even sharing his whole life, that is so smart and impressive,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kurtz said.Mr. Kurtz found Mitchell Kuga there and messaged him. The gist was, \u201cMy pizza is here. You want some pizza?\u201d Then he added his cellphone number and immediately logged off Facebook. His hope was that Mr. Kuga would want to respond and that he would have to do so by texting.Mr. Kuga texted Mr. Kurtz five minutes later: \u201cHi Adam, this is Mitchell.\u201d\u201cIt was like old-school pre-Tinder,\u201d Mr. Kurtz said.Mr. Kuga was pushing a broom when Mr. Kurtz walked in. Before Mr. Kurtz could even introduce himself in person, Phillip Gilmour, then the owner of the restaurant, approached Mr. Kurtz.\u201cWe love Mitchell,\u201d he said to Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIf you break his heart, I will kill you.\u201dThey went for drinks at a nearby bar and then went to Mr. Kurtz\u2019s apartment, where he had set out slices of pizza. They talked till 7 a.m.They soon began dating, and in the intervening months and years, they traveled to Paris, Brazil, Tokyo, Coney Island. They wrote each other love notes in perfect penmanship. On a birthday card to Mr. Kurtz, Mr. Kuga addressed it to, \u201cmy babe my sun my emoji my rock my lol my jew boo my reason.\u201dMr. Kurtz graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2009 and moved to New York in 2012 to work as a graphic artist. He was always creative and enjoyed making crafts with bits and bobs of paper he had saved, ticket stubs and back-of-the-envelope doodles.As their careers grew, so did their affection. After dating for two years, Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Kuga moved in together.For both Mr. Kuga and Mr. Kurtz it was the first big romance.About 10 days after meeting Mr. Kurtz, Mr. Kuga texted his mother a photo of Mr. Kurtz. \u201cI met a boy,\u201d he wrote. He had come out to his mother a few years before but this was the first time he explicitly told her about a man in his life. \u201cYour new \u2018boyfriend\u2019?\u201d his mother, Amy Kuga, responded. \u201cHe\u2019s cute! What does he do?\u201dMr. Kuga also told his sister, Marisa, about Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIt was his way of coming out to me,\u201d said Ms. Kuga, now 24, while sipping from a beer bottle at her brother\u2019s wedding. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a surprise to me that he was gay. But it showed to me how special this is. He finally wanted to put it into words.\u201dIt has been a more complicated situation for Mr. Kurtz, who first came out as gay to his parents when he was 15. They handled it as lovingly as a strictly religious family might, he said. Still, it has been tough for all parties to navigate. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they expected me to become a rabbi,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they expected me to be gay and marry a Japanese Hawaiian man.\u201dWhile some gay men and women in long-term relationships felt an overwhelming urge to marry as soon as gay marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court in June 2015, some younger gay couples felt otherwise. Including Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Kuga. \u201cA lot of us feel like marriage is not that important because it wasn\u2019t an option for so long so it isn\u2019t a factor that should determine the strength of a commitment,\u201d Mr. Kurtz said. \u201cIt can be seen as a heteronormative idea.\u201dWhen the men changed their minds about marriage, it was out of pragmatism. It was the summer of 2016, and they were lying in bed talking.\u201c\u2018I think we deserve the rights and protections that married people are afforded. I want to bury you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kurtz recalled saying to Mr. Kuga. (\u201cRomance!\u201d Mr. Kuga interjected as the men told the story.) From that point on, they considered themselves engaged. A few weeks later they went to Chinatown to buy engagement rings and then posted the news on Instagram to make it real.At first they considered a courthouse wedding or something very small. But then they decided they wanted to host an event that brought together the communities that had helped foster and sustain their relationship. This included the staff of Momo Sushi, Mr. Kurtz\u2019s friends from Baltimore, a large contingent of people the couple met through social media and Mr. Kuga\u2019s family \u2014 except for his father, who could not fly from Hawaii because of recent surgery.Mr. Kurtz\u2019s parents and three siblings were not there. The grooms had decided to marry on the fifth anniversary of their meeting, which happened to fall on a Friday, the Jewish Sabbath. Mr. Kurtz invited them knowing they would not attend because of Shabbat. \u201cIt worked out so that no one had to make any uncomfortable decisions,\u201d he said.However understated the proposal was, the wedding was not.The third floor of the Strand Bookstore took on the look of a well-staged Instagram feed. Strings of bulbs hung from rare-book bookshelf to bookshelf, with the light bouncing off the long pink, white, turquoise and gold dangling tassels. One table at the center of the room had big jars of pickles. Another had tiered cake platters overflowing with doughnuts.Amid circular periodical stands displaying paperbacks like \u201cVultures of Paradise Valley\u201d and $750 copies of \u201cThe Book of Common Prayer\u201d in glass cases, guests in crochet dresses and with large shoulder tattoos of eggplants sipped wine from plastic cups and beer from bottles.After a cocktail reception, the grooms emerged, both dressed in black and wearing leis that Amy Kuga had brought from Hawaii.They were married by Hector Marcel, a Buddhist teacher and Universal Life minister. He asked all in attendance to tie red strings around one another\u2019s wrists in acknowledgment of their role in making and supporting the marriage.\u201cYou are getting married to each other,\u201d he said to the crowd, before asking the men to read aloud the vows they had written. (Mr. Kurtz wrote his in crayon.) Mr. Kurtz, who is 6-foot-2, and Mr. Kuga, who is 5-foot-7, never let their eyes unlock.But it was Mr. Kuga\u2019s mother who returned to the importance of communities, reminding the guests that bonds are created in different ways. \u201cAdam has always been a part of our family, but now he is officially our son,\u201d she said looking up at Mr. Kurtz. \u201cIt\u2019s only taken 30 years to get a child over 5 feet 8 inches.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Republicans in Congress were struggling to reach an agreement that would keep the government funded into January and avoid a shutdown.At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump presided over a grand celebration on the South Portico, flanked by Republican lawmakers and members of his cabinet in a show of unity. A Marine Band played Christmas carols while the president and his party soaked up a moment long in coming.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.\u201cThis will indeed be a very big day, when people look back at our country. It\u2019s a whole different attitude, a whole different way,\u201d Mr. Trump said, congratulating the lawmakers behind him. \u201cThey have been working on this for years, years and years. And I just want to turn around and I want to thank them all. They are very, very special people.\u201dThe lawmakers \u2014 many of whom face re-election next year \u2014 eagerly returned the favor as the president brought several of them to the lectern, where they offered a common refrain: paeans to Mr. Trump, his legislative victory and his presidency.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said Mr. Trump might end up being one of the country\u2019s greatest presidents. Members of Congress who have at times been on the receiving end of brutal Twitter posts made by the president, including Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, returned the president\u2019s praise in kind.\u201cThis has been a year of extraordinary accomplishment for the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, as the president grinned broadly behind him.But though Mr. Trump listed a series of accomplishments during his first year in office, he confronts a challenge in the new year of persuading more Americans to get behind him.The tax victory was a rare moment of legislative success for a president who has struggled to govern in a city that he derided as \u201ca swamp.\u201d He has repeatedly used Twitter, his favorite means of communication, to demean and belittle members of both parties, undermining Republican leaders and generating intense opposition from Democrats.On Wednesday, he struck a different tone, posting on Twitter to praise Mr. McConnell for shepherding the tax bill through the bitterly divided chamber.The tax bill that passed includes the elimination of the Obama-era requirement that people have health insurance, handing Mr. Trump and Republicans a talking point when they confront constituents who expected full repeal of the health care law. Speaking to reporters before a cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump bragged about getting rid of the health care mandate, saying that it amounted to a full repeal of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature law.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bring it up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI told people specifically, \u2018Be quiet with the fake news media because I don\u2019t want them talking too much about it.\u2019\u201dWhether that proves to be a political victory for Mr. Trump and Republicans is unclear. Many of his core supporters will appreciate the move. But the president\u2019s eager declaration that \u201cObamacare has been repealed\u201d also means that he will be held responsible if premiums rise or people struggle to secure health insurance.The tax overhaul also provides a break to owners of pass-through businesses, whose profits are taxed through the individual code, and lowers the top individual rate to 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. It nearly doubles the standard deduction and doubles the child tax credit and the size of inheritances shielded from estate taxation.It also opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling.Republican lawmakers said they believed the public\u2019s opinions about the tax overhaul would improve as more people began paying lower taxes next year. If they are right, the party could benefit just as lawmakers face voters in the fall.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who spent most of his almost 20 years in Congress pushing for an overhaul of the tax code, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about making good on a core part of the Republican Party\u2019s orthodoxy.\u201cWe are going to launch next year this fantastic tax reform so that the American people can see how we can truly reach our economic growth and our economic potential,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.In remarks before the cabinet meeting, Vice President Mike Pence offered the kind of effusive praise that Mr. Trump is unlikely to receive very often, even after the tax bill victory.\u201cI want to thank you, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cI want to thank you for speaking on behalf of and fighting every day for the forgotten men and women of America. Because of your determination, because of your leadership, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more, and we are making America great again.\u201dFor the president, passage of the tax bill could be even more important \u2014 depending on how people come to view the legislation. As a candidate, Mr. Trump pitched himself as a champion of working Americans whose interests had been forgotten or ignored by a political establishment that cared little about their fortunes.\u201cTrumpism, in the end, as a domestic policy, comes down to jobs,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cAs a baseline of the conversation, he has to produce a better economy for anything else he is doing to make sense.\u201dThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lure of a Better Life, Amid Cold and Darkness", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "NORILSK, Russia \u2014 Blessed with a cornucopia of precious metals buried beneath a desert of snow, but so bereft of sunlight that nights in winter never end, Norilsk, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, is a place of brutal extremes. It is Russia\u2019s coldest and most polluted industrial city, and its richest \u2014 at least when measured by the value of its vast deposits of palladium, a rare mineral used in cellphones that sells for more than $1,000 an ounce.NorilskMoscowArcticCircleRUSSIANorilskMoscowArcticCircleRUSSIAIt is also dark. Starting about now, the sun stops rising, leaving Norilsk shrouded in the perpetual night of polar winter. This year that blackout began last Wednesday.Built on the bones of slave prison laborers, Norilsk began as an outpost of Stalin\u2019s Gulag, a place so harsh that, according to one estimate, of 650,000 prisoners who were sent here between 1935 and 1956, around 250,000 died from cold, starvation or overwork. But more than 80 years after Norilsk became part of the Gulag Archipelago, nobody really knows exactly how many people labored there in penal servitude or how many died.The Norilsk camp system, known as Norillag, shut down in 1956, when Nikita Khrushchev began to dismantle the worst excesses of Stalinism. The legacy of repressive control, though, lives on in tight restrictions on access to the city. All foreigners are barred from visiting without a permit from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet successor to the K.G.B.\u201cNorilsk is a unique city, it was put here by force,\u201d said Alexander Kharitonov, owner of a printing house in the city. \u201cIt is like a survivor. If it had not been for Norilsk, there would have been another principle of life in the Arctic: You came, you worked, you froze \u2014 and you left.\u201dThe residents of Norilsk have stayed, turning what until the 1930s had been an Arctic wilderness inhabited only by a scattering of indigenous peoples into an industrial city dotted with smoke-belching chimneys amid crumbling Soviet-era apartment blocks and the ruins of former prison barracks.The population dropped sharply after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which sent the economy into a tailspin. It has risen again, along with Russia\u2019s economic fortunes. Around 175,000 people now live year-round in Norilsk.Beyond the city, which is 1,800 miles northeast of Moscow in northern Siberia, extends an endless, mostly uninhabited wilderness.\u201cEverything else is a vast wild land with a wild nature and no people,\u201d said Vladimir Larin, a scientist who lives in Norilsk. \u201cThis is where the last wild mammoths died. When they dug the foundations of the buildings, they found the bones of mammoths.\u201dSome residents are the descendants of former slave laborers who stayed on simply because it was too hard to leave a place so remote that locals refer to the rest of Russia as \u201cthe mainland.\u201d There are no roads or railway lines connecting Norilsk to parts of Russia outside the Arctic. The only way to get in or out is by plane or by boat on the Arctic Ocean.Many residents, however, came voluntarily, lured by the promise of relatively high salaries and steady work in the city\u2019s metallurgical industry, a sprawling complex of mines and smelters owned by Norilsk Nickel. The business is a privatized former state company that is the world\u2019s largest producer of palladium and also a major supplier of nickel, copper and other metals.The company gets its products to market through a port at Dudinka on the Yenisei River, the largest of three great Siberian rivers that flow north into the Arctic Ocean.Dudinka, as well as providing Norilsk\u2019s main outlet to the outside world, also offers a glimpse of the region\u2019s past. The settlement\u2019s natural history museum displays tents used by the four main indigenous peoples in the area. The biggest of these today are the Dolgans, a nomadic Turkic people that used to live off hunting and reindeer herding but were themselves herded into collective farms during the Soviet era.There are now around 7,000 Dolgans, many of whom have given up their ancestors\u2019 shamanistic beliefs in favor of Christianity. Smaller native groups include the Entsi, of which there are only around 227 left in the region, which is known as Taimyr.Traditional belief in shamanism has been steadily eroded by the Russian Orthodox Church, which has been sending priests into the area since the 19th century and in 2000 built a new church on a bluff overlooking Dudinka port.\u201cOur children study their native language as if it were a foreign tongue,\u201d said Svetlana Moibovna, who is a member of the Nganasan indigenous group. \u201cMany local people were persecuted for shamanism. One shaman in his dreams saw that the Russian god would defeat the shaman god and that only the Russian god would rule in Taimyr.\u201dDespite the horrendously harsh climate, choking pollution and absence of sunlight from late November until January, many residents are fiercely proud of Norilsk \u2014 and their own ability to survive in an environment that even the hardiest of Russians living elsewhere would find intolerable.Last winter, temperatures plunged to minus 62 Celsius (minus 80 Fahrenheit), and early winter this year has also been unforgiving, with temperatures in November already falling to around minus 20 Celsius, about 4 below Fahrenheit.The cold has spawned a booming freelance taxi business because it is too cold to walk even short distances. Taxis charge a fixed price of 100 rubles (about $1.70) to go anywhere in the city. There are also buses, but it is too cold to wait outside so passengers crowd into nearby shops to shelter until their bus arrives.But even the bitter cold is for some a source of delight, with the frigid waters of Lake Dolgoye attracting swimmers who revel in the bracing experience of bathing in ice. \u201cAfter bathing, I have the feeling that I have been on vacation for a week,\u201d said Natalia Karpushkina, a 42-year-old who runs a local walrus club. The lake freezes only partially because of hot water pipes from a nearby power plant.The city also has a large indoor swimming pool for those less keen on bathing in ice water.Most of the work and leisure takes place indoors, particularly in the winter period of perpetual darkness. Life inside became considerably less monotonous recently thanks to a long-awaited breakthrough: After decades of serving the digital economy by providing materials needed to make cellphones and computers, Norilsk got its first reliable internet service.But even without the internet, it had replicated as best it could the amenities of a normal Russia city. The Norilsk College of Arts offers ballet lessons. Norilsk Greenhouse, a local company, grows cucumbers in heated shelters, while the Zaboi Bar offers revelers home brew and live music.The bar\u2019s 30-year-old manager, Anton Palukhin, who moved to Norilsk with his parents from Kazakhstan when he was 5, said that he still struggles with the climate and that whenever he travels to warmer parts of Russia on vacation, dreads having to return to the Arctic.\u201cI really do not want to go back and am ready to give anything so that I don\u2019t have to fly,\u201d he said. All the same, he keeps coming back.Sergey Ponomarev reported from Norilsk, Russia, and Andrew Higgins from Moscow.Produced by Gray Beltran, Meghan Petersen and Megan Specia.

{"Headline": "Obsession With Iran Is Driving the Mideast and the U.S. Crazy", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf there is a common denominator explaining so many recent events in the Middle East \u2014 actions by Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Syria, Israel and Yemen \u2014 it can be expressed in one word: Iran. Everyone has Iran\u2019s growing power and influence in the region on the mind \u2014 including Iran \u2014 and that obsession is making a lot of people crazy.This is generating a lot of anxiety in the Arab world, the U.S. and Israel without enough people stepping back and thinking: So pro-Iranian militias control a bunch of bad neighborhoods in Beirut, Sana, Damascus and Baghdad. Tell me, what is second prize? What are they really \u201cwinning\u201d?Iran has a richly talented population, and rich Persian culture. But instead of unleashing both and enabling Iran\u2019s youth to realize their full potential \u2014 and making the country influential that way \u2014 the ayatollahs are suppressing those talents at home and unleashing the power of Shiite mercenaries on Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and compelling influence that way instead.It\u2019s actually rather pathetic. The greatest thing that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia could do is to stop working each other into a lather over this Iranian \u201cthreat\u201d and to focus on their domestic reform agendas. That would be the best revenge on Tehran.For starters, American, European and Arab leaders should all be encouraging M.B.S. to keep going where no Saudi leader before him has dared to go \u2014 pursuing his stated goal of reversing the religious right turn that the kingdom took in 1979, after the takeover of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Muslim extremists. That prompted the Saudi rulers at the time to ban fun, tighten the control of the religious police over society and to much more aggressively export the most misogynist, anti-pluralistic interpretation of Islam to mosques and madrasas across the Muslim world, tilting the whole faith community to the right.If M.B.S. fulfills his vow to bring Saudi Islam back to \u201cmoderation,\u201d it will surely improve the status of Muslim women, the quality of education in Muslim communities and the relationship between Muslims and other faiths across the globe. We in the West have spent tremendous sums \u201ccountering Muslim extremism.\u201d We may finally have a Saudi leader ready to do that work \u2014 from the wellspring of Islam \u2014 and it would over time hugely benefit Muslims and non-Muslims alike.But for M.B.S. to advance that agenda requires a strong, economically healthy Saudi Arabia. Alas, for now Saudi Arabia is far from that; its trajectory in recent years has been sharply downward. Most Saudis today are focused on jobs and education, not on Iran, and if M.B.S. can fix those needs with his reform plan it will only propel his push to moderate Saudi Islam.Precisely because these intertwined religious and economic reform agendas are so critical, wise friends of M.B.S. would also be offering him some tough love \u2014 by telling him that it\u2019s great to arrest thieving Saudi billionaires and throw them in the Ritz-Carlton, but it has to be done with transparency and within a rule of law \u2014 which would enhance his legitimacy \u2014 not in an arbitrary way that will hurt his legitimacy and frighten future investors. They also have to stress to him that to be an effective anti-corruption campaigner, he has to be open to criticism himself and live modestly. No more giant yachts.On foreign policy, M.B.S.\u2019s real friends would also tell him that while Iran has expanded its influence across the Arab world, the Saudis do not have the muscles to take it head-on right now. The Iranians have spent nearly 40 years developing their influence through underground networks and Shiite proxies.Meanwhile, the Saudis wrote checks to Sunni militias, who never stayed bought. Or they bought big weapons systems that are useless in this age of irregular warfare \u2014 and only lead to the kind of Saudi aerial bombardments of Yemen that have led to so many civilian deaths, disease and starvation \u2014 and a costly stalemate for Riyadh. Saudi Arabia needs to end that war \u2014 now \u2014 and get out of Yemen, even if it means leaving some Iranian influence behind.I was just speaking to a Kuwaiti banker who told me that M.B.S.\u2019s popularity among Kuwaiti women and youth on Kuwaiti social media is unlike anything he has ever seen. Kuwaiti youth are asking why isn\u2019t anyone throwing their corrupt princes into a Ritz-Carlton or just a tent in the desert? Why doesn\u2019t their aging and unimaginative ruling family have someone shaking things up like M.B.S.?But they don\u2019t like M.B.S.\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 Yemen most of all, but also the ham-fisted interventions in Lebanon and Qatar. They look bullying. M.B.S. would unlock so much more good will and influence for himself if he curtailed these ill-conceived, Iranian-obsessed foreign adventures.But just about the last thing Saudi Arabia or any of our Arab allies need right now is for President Trump to do what the White House says he will do Wednesday \u2014 announce plans to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I can\u2019t think of anything more unnecessary and destabilizing. It is such a gift, wrapped with a bow, to Iran and Hezbollah. You can bet they will use it to present the Saudis, Jordanians, U.A.E., Palestinian Authority and Egypt as enablers of an American \u201cZionist agenda.\u201dAt a time when Iran is extending its influence, and our Arab allies are preoccupied with domestic reforms \u2014 which require a lot of pain for their publics that strains the legitimacy of their leaders \u2014 this is the last thing they need from their American friend. It is such a pathetic way for Trump to deflect attention from his utter failure to make any progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front.And it is such a pathetic way to disguise the fact that America really is not present in the Middle East these days. Our ability to shape events there is less than anytime since World War II.\u201cFor the first time since 1945 America is no longer a leader,\u201d argued Ivo Daalder, the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a co-author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Empty Throne: How America Abdicated Its Global Leadership Role.\u201d Though we are less powerful \u201cwe could still be influential,\u201d he added. \u201cBut that influence has to come by building strong coalitions.\u201dAlas, Trump has neither the patience for such coalition-building nor the willingness to make the compromises with allies \u2014 let alone with distasteful rivals like Russia or Iran \u2014 that will be required to stabilize the Middle East when we have neither power nor desire to do it alone.So Trump will rail against Iran and pretend that he is Thor, throwing down thunderbolts, like recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. But he\u2019s really just a lost tourist, looking for his bus. Which is really unfortunate at a time when Saudi Arabia needs a wise U.S. ally more than ever, Iran needs to be confronted with smart diplomacy more than ever and Israel\u2019s security requires some kind of creative diplomacy in Syria more than ever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Disney Deal Expected to Value Fox at Around $40 a Share", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 Disney\u2019s pursuit of Fox is nearing its conclusion.\u2022 The Fed still projects three rate increases next year.\u2022 How will Doug Jones\u2019s election affect the Trump agenda?\u2022 But Mr. Jones\u2019s arrival probably won\u2019t affect the tax bill.Reuters reports:Walt Disney Co\u2019s deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world\u2019s most important global news and film conglomerates.Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday.That\u2019s the answer to the main question investors had ahead of the Fed\u2019s policy statement on Wednesday.Despite its improved outlook for the economy, the Fed remains cautious about raising rates too quickly. Two officials \u2014 Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2014 voted against Wednesday\u2019s rate hike. The reason? Concerns about inflation.Fed officials predicted that inflation would stay below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target next year, and then stay at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Those were unchanged from September.Here\u2019s how Wall Street economists reacted:\u2022 Republicans will have a harder time passing legislation \u2014 from infrastructure spending to potential cuts to programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 with a Senate majority of just one seat.\u2022 The Republican Party may split further between establishment figures like Mitch McConnell and dissidents in the vein of Mr. Moore whose allegiance aligns more closely alongside President Trump and shaking up the status quo.\u2022 Democrats now have a more plausible, though still difficult, path to regaining a majority in the Senate.The likely changes\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 21 percent, slightly higher than what lawmakers had originally proposed\u2022 A slight lowering of the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent\u2022 Limiting the mortgage deduction to loans of up to $750,000, a compromise on levels set in the House and in the Senate proposalsWhat still needs work\u2022 Whether to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax\u2022 A resolution on the estate tax\u2022 How to treat state and local tax deductions.The tax flyaround\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share. For Hollywood, it begs for more consolidation. There will be one or two fewer studios a year from now. What happens to CBS and Viacom?\u201dWhat was still being hammered out as of yesterday\u2022 The price that Disney would pay for the Fox businesses it would acquire\u2022 What role, if any, James Murdoch would take at Disney\u2022 What sort of protections the companies would need in case antitrust authorities raise objectionsThe F.C.C. is expected to vote tomorrow on rolling back the regulations. But Facebook, Google and their peers have been noticeably quiet. Why? They\u2019re already on the defensive on other issues.\u201cWith the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations.\u201dAndrew writes:If that\u2019s true, it means that employee cuts would be even more severe than I had anticipated. About 12,000 people would lose their jobs, more than the number of people Qualcomm employs at its headquarters.Why did the SEC call up Munchee and cause it to shut down? \u201cBecause Munchee was making reckless and unsupported claims about incredible returns that deceived investors and separated little old ladies from their hard-earned retirement ether,\u201d you might assume, but you\u2019d be wrong.Critics\u2019 corner Lumped together, the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and others in lower-, mid- and senior-level management positions in the financial sector increased from 17 percent to 21 percent in the period.Before diversity advocates cheer, they should read on.

But his critics zeroed in on Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s statements during the congressional inquiry. \u201cThe problem of lying is not only the lack of ethics of lying,\u201d Victor Andr\u00e9s Bela\u00fande said, \u201cbut the cover-up of improper acts that have enriched him.\u201dThe president eventually acknowledged that his firm, the Miami-based Westfield Capital, had received money from Odebrecht, but he said that the transaction did not violate laws and that it was not a bribe for preferential treatment. His company was being run by a business partner at the time, and Mr. Kuczynski said the firm had provided only consulting services to Odebrecht.Some in Peru\u2019s Congress had argued that Mr. Kuczynski should be held accountable for receiving the funds, and voted last week to begin impeachment proceedings. The vote was introduced by the left-wing party Frente Amplio, which described Mr. Kuczynski as having \u201cdemeaned the presidency.\u201dDuring his testimony on Thursday, Mr. Kuczynski said he would be open to an investigation into his finances, but he urged members of Congress to vote against his removal, warning that the country would not benefit from a hasty decision.\u201cThe people of a nation do not forget or forgive,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski said.His attorney, Alberto Borea, appeared alongside him and offered his own defense of the embattled leader during nearly two hours of testimony. \u201cNot to impeach does not mean not to investigate,\u201d Mr. Borea said. \u201cThe president puts himself at the disposal of the Public Ministry.\u201dA two-thirds majority \u2014 or 87 of 130 votes \u2014 was needed to remove Mr. Kuczynski. After his testimony, Mr. Kuczynski left the chambers and lawmakers debated his future over several hours. Lawmakers finally voted 78 to 19 in favor of the motion, with a number either abstaining or not present.Mr. Kuczynski, who was given just days to formulate a defense after the impeachment proceedings were announced, maintained that the consulting services that Westfield Capital provided to Odebrecht did not give Odebrecht a competitive advantage in any dealings.The president recently acknowledged being paid $380,000 in dividends by Westfield Capital between 2004 and 2007. He was prime minister of Peru from August 2005 to July 2006, and was economy and finance minister from February 2004 to August 2005.At the time, his company was being managed by a business partner, Gerardo Sep\u00falveda, a Chilean. Mr. Kuczynski maintained that he did not personally approve any contracts with Odebrecht during that time, and the contracts involved no unlawful negotiations.The opposition argued that he broke rules on conflict of interest during his time in public office, both as prime minister and as economy and finance minister.Mr. Kuczynski gave a televised statement on Wednesday evening. With his two vice presidents standing at his side, Mr. Kuczynski said that neither would accept the presidency if he was removed.\u201cI confess that I have not been sufficiently organized, but I am not corrupt,\u201d Mr. Kuczynski said in the televised address. \u201cI apologize with clarity in my mind and heartbreak if I did not explain my professional conduct.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis week President Trump sharply reduced the size of two monuments; plans for many others are unclear. What are these places like for visitors? We explored a few.His opponents say no such authority exists. \u201cWe intend to sue the president immediately in federal court over these unlawful acts\u201d Steve Bloch, legal director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said, just as the president arrived. S.U.W.A. will join several plaintiffs that include the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Wilderness Society, Earthjustice and other groups, he said.\"The Antiquities Act does not provide authority to revoke or modify national monuments once they\u2019ve been created,\u201d Mr. Bloch said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019ll be in a position to move very quickly to have those actions declared unlawful.\u201d Those dirt roads are always remote, and often forbidding. Flash floods are common. Cellphone service is restricted to about 10 percent of the monument. In high season, Bureau of Land Management ranger patrols have to pull one stranded car a day out of trouble and they have to mount one full-scale search-and-rescue effort a week, on average. The senator\u2019s analysis puzzles Suzanne Catlett. She is president of the Escalante-Boulder Chamber of Commerce, and the owner of a local restaurant, Nemo\u2019s Drive-Thru. The economies of those two hamlets \u2014 the gateways to the monument \u2014 have been prospering on the tourism they draw, she said. Before its creation, Escalante was a sleepy ranch supply center with a failing sawmill. The growing number of visitors now supports businesses that provide food and lodging, guide and expedition services, camping supplies and an annual art festival. Fifty-one of the Chamber\u2019s 52 members have declared their opposition to any changes in the monument\u2019s boundaries, she told me.\"For an administration that\u2019s supposed to care about business and economics, this does not make sense,\u201d she said. She said she worries that if the Trump plans succeed, industrialization of the landscape will undermine tourism. And, she said, \u201cIt opens up the ability to mess with the monuments every four years, or based on a political environment, and that is no way to build an economy.\u201dThe first couple of miles of the hike were remarkable, too, for the pungent, pervasive odor of cattle dung. Grazing is allowed on many national monuments and other public lands, even in officially designated wilderness areas. The number varies, but officials estimate that there are about 6,000 private cattle on leased allotments through most of Grand Staircase-Escalante. The cows have been kept away from some streams on the monument, where they naturally congregate in this arid environment. But they are still allowed at Harris Wash, despite damage to stream banks, fouled waters, depleted natural vegetation, competition with wildlife and this canyon\u2019s popularity as a hiking destination. Then, in April, President Trump ordered a review of all large monuments created since 1996. As part of the review, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke visited the Maine monument in June.Mr. Zinke's final report to the president, released this week, included vague language about prioritizing public access and increasing logging in the monument. It did not suggest reducing the size of the monument.Jamie Brundrett, the president of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, is looking forward to some resolution. \u201cEveryone here in the Katahdin region is ready to put the issue to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want everything finalized one way or the other.\u201dMr. Brundrett also owns a general store in Millinocket. \u201cFrom wearing both hats, all spring, summer, and into the fall, business has been up, and there have been more cars on Main Street, so I definitely think the park is helping to drive tourism here,\u201d he said.A National Park Service spokeswoman, Elizabeth Rogers, said that things have been busy in the nascent monument.More than 8,000 vehicles drove onto the monument between May and November, and over 5,000 people stopped at welcome centers in Millinocket and Patten. Ms. Rogers said staffers have been improving the signs on the loop road and elsewhere.In winter, the monument is open for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and fat-tire biking. The loop road is closed for the season, and the best winter approach is from the monument\u2019s north entrance, where there is a plowed parking lot. There are also more than 30 miles of snowmobile trails elsewhere in the monument.Lucas St. Clair, Roxanne Quimby\u2019s son, and the executive director of the family nonprofit Elliotsville Plantation, said he has been pleased to see the monument\u2019s popularity. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge increase in visitation,\u201d he said.Mr. St. Clair said some first-time visitors are surprised by the rugged conditions.\u201cI do emphasize the fact that this is a relatively remote and rustic experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe loop road is rough, and you have to be prepared for driving a couple of hours on a dirt road. It\u2019s not like the loop road in Acadia.\u201dMichael Downing, of Mt. Chase Lodge in Patten, said the review created one hurdle that makes it hard to find the monument. In May, Maine Governor Paul LePage, an outspoken opponent of the monument, directed the state Department of Transportation to not post any road signs for the monument, pending the outcome of the monument review.Still, Mr. Downing said, tourists are finding it. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people from all over the country,\u201d he said, \u201ccoming specifically just to see the monument.\u201dInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke identified the Cascade-Siskiyou as one of 10 monuments to shrink or modify. An Interior Department report says its boundaries should be made smaller to allow more timber harvest and cattle grazing. At the moment, its fate is uncertain.This vast stretch of mostly undeveloped land, which straddles the Oregon-California border, also straddles a cultural divide within its region. The nearest sizable town, Ashland, was once the center of a robust timber economy, and has now become a mecca for theater enthusiasts and winter sports fans.Green Springs Highway speeds visitors past pullouts for the Pacific Crest Trail and smaller hiking paths, through a remote community contained within the monument, and through forests that remain popular with local hunters even after the monument\u2019s designation. Dueling \u201cNO SISKIYOU MONUMENT\u201d and \u201cYES MONUMENT!\u201d signs posted at restaurants and rental cabins highlight the depth of the local divide.Pull over for a closer look, and the changing seasons offer a hint at the diverse plant and animal life the monument seeks to protect. Two endangered lilies \u2014 Green\u2019s mariposa and Gentner\u2019s fritillary \u2014 bloom purple and red each spring. More than a hundred butterfly and moth species flit and dance among the conifers in summer. A genetically distinct strain of redband trout overwinter in the monument\u2019s lakes and ponds when the days grow short.The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s efforts to preserve the ecological diversity of what Mr. Clinton called a \u201cbiological crossroads\u201d do not forestall all human activities here. The Bureau\u2019s last review of the monument\u2019s resources, completed in 2008, noted that more than 46,000 acres had been set aside for grazing \u2014 and that over the course of a decade, ranchers had used only 58 percent of available public lands within its borders, on average, each year. Logging has been more heavily restricted, as Bureau officials seek to bring back canopies that were thinned over many decades and to maintain old-growth trees.When the monument was expanded, the region's timber industry immediately raised alarms, with one local company, Murphy Co., filing federal suit and arguing the designation is hurting its bottom line.John Murphy, the president of Murphy Co., told local media that the monument expansion forced his company to withdraw logging plans that would have brought in millions of dollars in revenue \u2014 and generated $500,000 in taxes for Oregon\u2019s Jackson County.Meanwhile, the Oregon Cattlemen\u2019s Association maintains that grazing is more restricted than Bureau data would indicate \u2014 with preservation requirements so strict that ranchers would rather look elsewhere than use all the land available within the monument.These arguments pull at the heartstrings of many native Oregonians, even as natural resources play an ever smaller part in the region\u2019s economy. Fewer than 500 Jackson County residents still work in logging today, out of a local labor force of more than 100,000. Timber once employed 80,000 people statewide, but that\u2019s fallen to 5,300 jobs as wood harvests have moved abroad, the sector has grown more efficient and environmental restrictions have limited logging both inside and outside the monument.\u201cTourism jobs are not family wage jobs,\u201d Tom Mallams, the Klamath County Commissioner, said during a recent Oregon Public Broadcasting radio program on the monument. \u201cTimber jobs are family-wage jobs,\u201d he continued, in an argument that would appear to pit one endangered species, the logger, against countless others in the expanded Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.

Then it got out of control.World Wrestling Entertainment took it for producing wrestling videos. Regional gas stations claimed it because they mix ethanol with base fuel. Grocery stores asked for it because they spray their fruit so that it ripens. Pharmacies could take it because they have booths that print photos.The latest overhaul could play out the same way. Already, lawyers and accountants are eyeing several provisions that investors and companies could potentially exploit.The new law is also supposed to encourage companies to make investments in the United States. But the rules were written in such a way that they could give businesses an incentive to keep their money in foreign countries and build factories abroad.The wildly popular manufacturing break, passed in 2004, is a case study in the unforeseen consequences of changing the tax code \u2014 how companies take advantage of gaping holes and force the government to play catch-up.The provision, known as the domestic production activities deduction, gave companies a tax break on income they earned from making things in the United States. It was intended to help American manufacturers, which were struggling to hold their own against competition from overseas.Movie studios got the break because they produced films, and tech giants won it, too, for making computer software. Construction companies got it for making buildings, and so did engineers and architects for designing them.Starbucks hired lobbyists to make the case that it, too, was a producer, because the company roasts coffee beans. Congress added language that allowed coffee shops to deduct a percentage of every cup sold if it was made with beans they roasted off site. It became known as the Starbucks footnote.The government initially estimated that the 2004 law would cost a net $27.3 billion from 2005 through 2014. It ended up costing over $90 billion during that period, according to a congressional report.The Internal Revenue Service had to warn retailers that cutting keys doesn\u2019t make you a manufacturer. Neither does mixing paint, putting plants in the sun to grow or writing \u201cHappy birthday\u201d on a cake you didn\u2019t bake.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.But in more than a decade of battling with companies about the rule, the government gave up more ground than it won. One of its most epic losses came at the hands of a David-size challenger in Fullerton, Calif.It all started in tax class. Dan Maguire, an accountant by trade, was sitting in a seminar about the new features of the tax code in 2005 when he first heard about the manufacturing deduction. He became obsessed.\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018Gosh, as crazy as it is, this is a good deduction for Houdini,\u2019\u201d he said. Houdini Inc., better known as Wine Country Gift Baskets, is a plucky maker of assortments for special occasions that employs Mr. Maguire as its chief financial officer.Mr. Maguire filed for the deduction in amended returns for 2005 and 2006. The I.R.S. gave Houdini a refund of close to $300,000. Then, when it realized what had happened, it doubled back and audited the company, demanding that Houdini return the money.\u201cIt\u2019s the government \u2014 what do you expect?\u201d Mr. Maguire said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t exactly an efficiently run organization.\u201dWhen Houdini refused to give the refund back, the government sued the company in 2011.At issue was a straightforward question: Does putting wine and chocolate into a basket amount to manufacturing? Federal lawyers sputtered at the thought.\u201cI can make a gift basket at home,\u201d pleaded one government lawyer, according to a transcript in the case. \u201cI can go to the store, and I can purchase these items and put them into a basket which I have purchased and put cellophane wrap around it, but in the process, I have not altered anything in it.\u201dThe problem, for the government, was that its lawyers didn\u2019t have much to stand on. The deduction\u2019s regulations explicitly defined manufacturing as \u201ccombining or assembling two or more articles.\u201dJust putting two things together wouldn\u2019t count, but Houdini argued that it had all the elements of a traditional manufacturing system going in its warehouses. There are assembly lines, conveyor belts, forklifts, \u201cjust like Henry Ford,\u201d Mr. Maguire said.In the end, a federal judge ruled against the government. Mr. Maguire has been claiming the deduction ever since. It has saved the company over $5 million. \u201cThis was a fun lesson to teach the I.R.S.,\u201d he said, with conviction.The government took it on the chin once more over the deduction when a medicine packaging company sued the I.R.S. in 2012. The company, Precision Dose, said it deserved the deduction, which had been denied. It did not make the liquid medicine or the cups that the medicine went into. But it did design the cups and the lids on them. The government said the company was just repackaging drugs.That will all be moot with the latest tax bill. Congressional Republicans said the deduction was no longer necessary with the overall reduction of the corporate tax rate. So the hunt for unintended gold mines will go down new paths.\u201cIf the bar has been set low by the regulation, you can understand why taxpayers are claiming it,\u201d said Connie Cheng, a tax managing director at the accounting firm BDO USA. It took longer to write the law that included the manufacturing deduction in 2004 than it did to shape the entire tax bill this time around. The haste is sure to create countless new adventures for accountants like Ms. Cheng.\u201cThat\u2019s the nature of tax in general,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time you write a rule, there are people out there who think about \u2018How do we get creative with it, and how do we get around it?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Higher Education Bill Rolls Back Obama-Era Safeguards", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans began work Tuesday on an extensive rewrite of the law that governs the nation\u2019s system of higher education, seeking to dismantle landmark Obama administration regulations designed to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges and to repay the loans of those who earned worthless degrees from scam universities.But in its systematic effort to erase President Barack Obama\u2019s fingerprints from higher education, the measure before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce could undermine bedrock elements that have guided university education for decades. One provision could do away with the system of \u201ccredit hours\u201d that college students earn to complete their degrees, which could help for-profit colleges inflate the value of their degrees.The bill \u201caddresses many of the ill-conceived mandates handed down by the Obama administration in favor of policies that will allow higher education to meet the current needs of students,\u201d said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the committee chairwoman and the chief author of the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act.Many elements of the bill pursue bipartisan goals: simplifying the federal financial aid process, cutting down on student debt and expanding programs like federal work-study programs.But the bill\u2019s efforts to roll back the Obama legacy will divide Congress and the education community along partisan lines \u2014 and bolster efforts already underway by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to boost the fortunes of for-profit colleges and universities. Two of the Obama-era regulations of for-profit colleges and universities \u2014 called \u201cgainful employment\u201d and \u201cborrower defense\u201d \u2014 are being rewritten by Ms. DeVos\u2019s Education Department. Under the House bill, they would be repealed and blocked from readoption.A lesser-known, more complex \u201ccredit hour\u201d rule also completed by the Obama administration would suffer the same fate. Policy experts say the undermining of university credits would be among the most consequential provisions in the 542-page bill, illustrating how in their haste to erase Obama\u2019s regulatory legacy, Republicans could disrupt a higher education system that is considered the best in the world.\u201cThe credit hour is the bedrock of the entire higher education system, so it could be catastrophic,\u201d said Amy Laitinen, a former Obama administration staff member and the director of higher education at New America, a research group. \u201cThis could do things we can\u2019t even imagine yet \u2014 like open up the door to a whole new breed of for-profit institution, without any safeguards.\u201dA 2010 Education Department inspector general\u2019s investigation found that one for-profit school awarded nine credits for a 10-week course, significantly more than the traditional program\u2019s average of three credits for a 15-week course.Under the Obama-era rules, colleges can choose from a menu of options to define a credit hour, including hours of instruction, evidence of student achievement or amount of work represented in outcomes. The Obama Education Department maintained that the definition still gave institutions plenty of room to run higher education institutions.The American Council on Education wrote a letter to Arne Duncan, the former education secretary, on behalf of 70 institutions that opposed the definition. The council said that the inspector general\u2019s findings should not spur a one-size-fits-all definition, and the department had \u201cfederalized a basic academic concept and, at the same time, developed a complex, ambiguous and unworkable definition.\u201dMs. Foxx agreed.\u201cThe creation of a federal definition of a credit hour was part of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018Washington knows best\u2019 approach to higher education, and it only created barriers to innovation for students and institutions,\u201d she said.But where Republicans see deregulation, others see potential chaos.Committee Democrats called the bill a \u201cwar on students.\u201d House Democrats said Republicans refused for months to engage in talks about reauthorizing the bill, which they characterized as a giveaway to the for-profit industry.In addition to the gainful employment, borrower defense, and the credit-hour rules, the bill calls for repealing a requirement that for-profit institutions get at least 10 percent of their revenue from nonfinancial-aid sources.That rule was issued because some for-profit colleges were signing up students who did not have the means or ability to complete a degree or find gainful employment. They would then secure the students loans guaranteed by the federal government, knowing that the inevitable default would be covered by taxpayers. The legislation also weakens rules that required states to take a bigger role in authorizing institutions of higher educationDuring Tuesday\u2019s drafting session, Democrats offered amendments that would have restored some of the accountability measures, but all were defeated.Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, said the wholesale regulatory repeal \u201cmakes it more likely students would pursue worthless degrees.\u201dBut Representative Paul Mitchell, Republican of Michigan, said Democratic attempts to restore the rules unfairly targeted the for-profit sector and represented a \u201cfalse dichotomy that continues to devalue career and technical education which is wrong in this economy.\u201dAndrew Carnegie first established the modern-day credit hour in the early 1900s, allowing colleges to participate in a free pension system if they adopted the use of a \u201cstandard unit,\u201d also known as a \u201cCarnegie unit,\u201d for college admissions. Faculty members who taught 12 credit units qualified for pensions, and 120 credits came to equal a bachelor\u2019s degree.Ms. Laitinen is among those who believe that the credit hour has become a faulty proxy for what a student knows, when really it only measures how much time they spent in a seat.But throwing out the credit system without a replacement would reopen the system to hucksters preying on students and bilking the federal loan guarantee, she said.\u201cIn no way are we prepared to just throw out the credit hour,\u201d Ms. Laitinen said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see a world where we don\u2019t see massive fraud and abuse if this bill were passed.\u201dMs. Foxx said that higher education accrediting agencies would be a line of defense for regulating colleges and universities. Her aides said that the bill contains several accountability measures, including the creation of a \u201cdata dashboard\u201d that would provide students with information like average salaries and the debt levels of graduates from college programs. One provision would revoke federal funding for institutions that have high percentages of borrowers who are at least 90 days delinquent on loan payments.Paul J. LeBlanc, the president of Southern New Hampshire University, said he fears that programs like his would suffer without accountability. Mr. Obama praised his private, nonprofit college for its flexibility and affordability. The university has a program that allows students to earn a business degree in three years without attending summer classes, and another program that emphasizes career readiness through projects and real-world experiences instead of class time.Mr. LeBlanc said the Republican higher education bill may open up opportunities for more innovation, but, he said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t answer the question: How do we know?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Move to Resolve Tax Bill Differences as Cost Concerns Loom", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders moved closer on Wednesday to resolving some key differences between the House and Senate tax bills, though several big issues, including the size of the corporate tax cut, remained in flux.\u201cThat sounds like a kind of reasonable idea,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to a proposal brewing among House Republicans that would give people the option of deducting up to $10,000 in income taxes or property taxes. Right now, both bills would only allow taxpayers to deduct property taxes and cap that at $10,000.Complicating the discussions is the need to ensure that the overall bill stays in the $1.5 trillion bucket lawmakers have budgeted for the cuts. All the changes under discussion would cost money, requiring lawmakers to find ways to offset the effect on the deficit. Lawmakers continued to debate whether to increase the corporate tax rate to 22 percent from the proposed 20 percent, an idea that President Trump appeared to support over the weekend.Mr. McConnell publicly remains cool to the idea. On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, reiterated his support for a 20 percent corporate rate.\u201cWe will take all that up in conference,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cI continue to make the point the 20 percent rate is crucial to competitiveness.\u201dMr. Brady also said that some House Republicans had called for some form of medical expense deduction to be in the final tax bill.The conference committee, which will be made up of Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate, will have one public meeting that is likely to take place next week. While most of the negotiations will occur behind closed doors among Republicans, Democrats will have another opportunity to publicly criticize the bill.Republican lawmakers are looking to quickly resolve differences so they can get the bill signed and to Mr. Trump by Christmas.Mr. Trump, for his part, expressed optimism on Wednesday that the bill would get to him quickly and said that he expected the tax bill to help drive a surge in economic growth to 6 percent \u2014 a level far greater than most economists believe possible.\u201cSo we\u2019re at 3.3 percent G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to gross domestic product, a measure of the economy\u2019s strength. \u201cI see no reason why we don\u2019t go to 4, 5 and even 6 percent.\u201dMr. Trump said that there were parts of the Senate and House bills that he preferred but that he was confident the final version would be better than both proposals. He said that the last step of the process would ensure that the \u201csliver\u201d of taxpayers who do not currently receive relief from the legislation were taken care of.On Wednesday night, Senate Republicans announced that Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Cornyn of Texas, John Thune of South Dakota, Rob Portman of Ohio, Tim Scott of South Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania would sit on the conference committee.In a sign of their confidence, Republicans are already looking past taxes to their next priority: gutting safety net programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,\u201d the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said on Wednesday during an interview with the radio host Ross Kaminsky.During his campaign, Mr. Trump opposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid, but Mr. Ryan said that he was working to persuade him to change his mind.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Security Council Tightens Economic Vise on North Korea, Blocking Fuel, Ships and Workers", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations Security Council placed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday that significantly choke off fuel supplies and order North Koreans working overseas to return home, in what may prove the last test of whether any amount of economic pressure can force the isolated country to reverse course on its nuclear weapons program.The sanctions, proposed by the United States and adopted by a vote of 15 to 0, were the third imposed this year, in an escalating effort to force the North into negotiations. China and Russia joined in the vote, in a striking display of unity, but only after the Trump administration agreed to soften a couple of the provisions.Under the new sanctions, the amount of refined petroleum North Korea can import each year will be cut by 89 percent, exacerbating fuel shortages. Roughly 100,000 North Korean laborers who work in other countries, a critical source of hard currency, will be expelled within two years. Nations will be urged to inspect all North Korean shipping and halt ship-to-ship transfers of fuel, which the North has used to evade sanctions.Experts, and even the White House, agree that the United States is running out of sanctions options. The C.I.A. assessment is that no amount of economic sanctions will force the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, to give up his country\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cPresident Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behavior,\u201d the White House homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said Tuesday. \u201cAnd so we don\u2019t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behavior.\u201dThe United States, which has led the sanctions effort at the Security Council, drafted the latest round in consultation with other members, notably China, which historically has been reluctant to impose them for fear of destabilizing North Korea, its neighbor.There were some last-minute changes in the final version of the resolution, partly to satisfy Russian complaints. The changes included doubling the deadline for the return of North Korean workers to 24 months from 12 months.Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, who attended the Security Council vote, made a point of complaining about negotiations over the resolution, in which he said Russia had not been adequately consulted.Still, Russia went along with the new measures \u2014 though American officials have charged that in recent months the Russians have secretly opened new links to the North, including internet connections that give the country an alternative to communicating primarily through China.Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador, thanked the other Council members \u2014 especially China \u2014 for coming together on the resolution and said further North Korean defiance would \u201cinvite further punishment and isolation.\u201dMs. Haley called North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile test last month \u201canother attempt by the Kim regime to masquerade as a great power while their people starve and their soldiers defect.\u201dChina\u2019s deputy ambassador, Wu Haitao, said the latest measures reflected \u201cthe unanimous position of the international community\u201d and he urged North Korea to \u201crefrain from conducting any further nuclear and missile tests.\u201dBut he also emphasized China\u2019s longstanding position that all antagonists in the dispute needed to de-escalate and find ways to resume a dialogue, asserting that there was \u201cno military option for settling the nuclear issue\u201d on the Korean Peninsula.Speaking to reporters before the meeting, Matthew Rycroft, the British ambassador, said the unity of Council members on North Korea showed they were \u201cseeing the bigger interests we all have.\u201dAsked if the new measures would make life even harder for ordinary North Koreans, Mr. Rycroft blamed their government, saying it \u201cuses every cent, every penny that it can on its nuclear program and its intercontinental ballistic missile program and nothing at all on the welfare of the poor people of North Korea.\u201dUnder Mr. Kim, a grandson of the country\u2019s founder, Kim Il-sung, the impoverished country of 25 million has exalted nuclear weapons and threatened to use them against the United States, its No. 1 perceived enemy since an armistice halted the Korean War in 1953.But inside the administration, there are clear differences of opinion over how long Mr. Trump can, or will, tolerate a growing threat from North Korea without resorting to some kind of military force.While diplomacy backed by sanctions is the clear preference of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, others inside the administration say there is little time left for the sanctions to stop the North from achieving the ability to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon.Yet to prove effective, sanctions must be strictly enforced and require many months or several years to take effect. Even then, there is no guarantee: Despite all the sanctions heaped on North Korea in recent years, its economy grew 3.9 percent last year, by most estimates.Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, has said in recent weeks, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time left.\u201d That would suggest that even the new sanctions may not bite in time to change the calculus of the North Korean leadership. The fear in Washington, among those looking for a diplomatic solution, is that Mr. Trump will decide on some kind of pre-emptive strike, betting that the North will stop short of major retaliation.The North Koreans have conducted six nuclear tests and have demonstrated major progress with their missiles even though the United Nations has prohibited them.Experts on North Korea said the new measures had the potential to dissuade Mr. Kim from further escalating tensions with more tests, but they were cautious about predicting his behavior.If that happens, he said, it would force North Korea \u201cto make a choice\u201d between defiance and negotiations.Others were more skeptical.However, she said it was doubtful that the move would persuade Mr. Kim \u201cto give up his nuclear arsenal or even discuss a freeze\u201d in 2018.\u201cThe upshot,\u201d he said, \u201cwould be the Trump administration admitting that maximum pressure to gain a diplomatic solution is a lost cause.\u201dRick Gladstone reported from the United Nations, and David E. Sanger from Dallas. Sewell Chan contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

In fact, in many ways he has helped prop it up.\u201cIf you want to call yourself a populist, you better be ready to stick up for the little guy, whether she punches a time sheet or swipes a badge, makes a salary or earns tips, whether he works behind a desk, on a factory floor, or behind a restaurant counter,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. \u201cBecause populism is for the people \u2014 not these people, or those people, but all people.\u201dSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, pushed back on the criticism, pointing to economic gains in the last year as evidence that Mr. Trump had helped ordinary Americans.\u201cIt\u2019s been a great year for the American economy and the American labor that powers it, with pensions up 39 percent and nearly 160,000 manufacturing jobs added since the president took office,\u201d she said.\u201cPresident Trump has been focused on the American worker since the very first days of his administration, during which he withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, signed an executive order promoting domestic manufacturing in pipeline construction and stopped the previous administration\u2019s job-killing regulatory overreach in its tracks.\u201dAnd the views of Mr. Trump among his stalwart supporters are not likely to be altered by in-the-weeds regulatory rollbacks, or even tax breaks that benefit the wealthy. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said that while \u201celites\u201d in places like Washington might find dissonance between what Mr. Trump says and does, his supporters are most likely viewing him primarily through the lens of a steadily improving economy.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between the world that elites live in, the world in which they pay close attention to news and are highly attuned to the political discussion, and the rest of the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Trump voter is going to be saying: \u2018When I see my paycheck, am I going to see more money or less money in it? Are my neighbors employed or unemployed? Are my children getting jobs?\u2019\u201dThey will not, she said, be debating the nuances of net neutrality or the arcana of the tax code.Other elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic message may also be subject to reality checks. The president has often talked of how he loves \u201cclean, beautiful coal\u201d and the miners who unearth it, pointing to them as a ready exemplar of his working-class sympathies. \u201cI\u2019m going to put the miners back to work,\u201d he said last year in Charleston, W.Va., before donning a hard hat.Mr. Trump said this year that his effort to revive the industry by clearing away regulations had helped produce 45,000 mining jobs. But the Labor Department reported in November that the country had gained just 1,500 coal mining jobs over the previous year, after losing tens of thousands in recent years.Just a week ago, an official for the United Mine Workers union said 260 workers would lose their jobs at a mine in northern West Virginia.The same day, the president showcased what he called the \u201cmost far-reaching regulatory reform\u201d in American history. His deregulatory efforts have been cheered by businesses, and economic indicators have shown increased business confidence, but environmental groups and consumer advocates say the rollback has left Americans with fewer protections.Being the champion of the \u201clittle guy\u201d is a staple of presidential rhetoric, and wealthy occupants of the Oval Office like Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy have used it to great effect. But Mr. Trump has taken it to a new level, and Democrats have been quick to note that there is little in his background to suggest any basis for empathy for those who live paycheck to paycheck.\u201cUnfortunately, all too often the president has broken the promises he made to Ohio workers on the campaign and thrown in with Mitch McConnell to cut back-room deals for Washington special interests,\u201d Mr. Brown, the senator, said in an emailed response to questions, referring to Senator McConnell, the Republican majority leader.Ms. Jamieson said such criticism might not stick \u2014 no matter what happens to the economy.\u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t succeed, he has what I call universal rebuttal,\u201d Ms. Jamieson said. \u201cIt works everywhere: \u2018I tried. The rigged system did me in.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe core of the Trump appeal was to say to people who didn\u2019t have a voice, \u2018I am voicing your anger,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cAnd to those who didn\u2019t know who to blame, \u2018Here\u2019s who to blame, and in a rigged system I will take on your enemies.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign-style rallies, like the one in Pensacola, are packed with supporters who sign up for tickets in advance, and he rarely hears dissident voices. He knows his audience, and he almost always returns to the theme of being the guardian of the working class.But others see a yawning gap between the emerging list of winners in the Trump era and the little guy he pledged to help.Mike Walden, a retired Teamster from Ohio who drove a truck for more than 30 years, visited Washington this past week to try to lobby for pension security. He did not vote for Mr. Trump, but he has voted for Republicans like his home-state senator, Rob Portman. The president, he said, has done little to help the workers in his union.\u201cHe got elected to the office of president because he talked about the issues of the working man and labor,\u201d Mr. Walden said. \u201cWe have not heard one word from him about that.\u201cWhere is this \u2018I am for the working man\u2019? I don\u2019t see anything there,\u201d Mr. Walden said, adding: \u201cWhat has he done for the working man? I am not totally against him. He\u2019s president of the United States. But on the same hand, you don\u2019t get elected by the working class and then throw them under the bus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Without New Laws or Walls, Trump Presses the Brake on Legal Immigration", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut it has also quietly, and with much less resistance, slowed many forms of legal immigration without the need for Congress to rescind a single visa program enshrined in the law.Immigration and State Department officials are more closely scrutinizing, and have started more frequently denying, visas for people seeking to visit the United States on business, as well as for those recruited by American companies, according to lawyers representing visa seekers. Foreigners already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their stays are also facing new hurdles.The changes show how the Trump administration has managed to carry out the least attention-grabbing, but perhaps farthest-reaching, portion of the president\u2019s immigration plans: cutting the number of people entering the United States each year as temporary workers or permanent residents.The administration has put into practice the philosophy President Trump laid out in a pair of executive orders billed as protecting the nation from terrorism and its workers from foreign competition.But now even applicants lucky enough to be chosen are drawing more scrutiny.Officials are asking for extra details about applicants\u2019 education and work history, the position to be filled and the employer, requiring the company to amass many additional documents, which can postpone a decision by several months.For H-1Bs, the number of such \u201crequests for evidence\u201d from January to August this year jumped 44 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the most recent data from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.So far, the government is still greenlighting most H-1B applications that survive the lottery, but the approval rate is inching down.For the first two months of this fiscal year, October and November, 86 percent and 82 percent of H-1B applications were approved. That compares with 93 percent and 92 percent for the same months last year. The data does not reflect companies that give up after receiving requests for more evidence.Once a company has spent thousands of dollars in legal fees to petition for a worker, \u201cthere is huge discouragement after an R.F.E. is issued,\u201d said Roxanne Levine, an immigration lawyer in New York, \u201cbecause of the massive extra time, effort and money required to respond.\u201dL. Francis Cissna, the immigration agency\u2019s new director, said in an interview that if there are more requests for evidence, \u201cthat is perfectly rational and perfectly appropriate.\u201d\u201cWe are looking at the entire program to ensure the entire thing is administered well and in conformity with congressional intent,\u201d he said.Immigration lawyers and companies seeking the visas say that some of the decisions appear arbitrary.After responding to requests for evidence, a consulting firm that applied for an H-1B for an energy expert from Britain received a denial stating that the skills for the position \u201cdo not appear to be of such complexity, uniqueness or specialization as to require the attainment of a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d a prerequisite for the visa.Kristen Albertson, the operations manager at the firm, called the outcome \u201cegregious.\u201d\u201cWe apply only when it\u2019s a strong case and essential to our business,\u201d she said of the applicant, who is a graduate of the University of Chicago.An H-1B visa for an Indian scientist recruited by the Cleveland Clinic for his expertise in cellular biology is stuck in \u201cadministrative processing\u201d in New Delhi, meaning it is undergoing further review that could stretch into months. \u201cHis team\u2019s projects are now on hold due to the delay,\u201d said Janice Bianco, an official at the Cleveland Clinic who handles applications for foreigners.She said a visa for a pediatric geneticist hired in the spring took three months to be issued \u2014 in the past, it would have taken about three weeks \u2014 forcing the hospital to reroute some patients to other facilities.The State Department, which has handled the Cleveland Clinic visa requests, said in a statement that \u201cconsular officers have the discretion to request additional screening in any case.\u201dMr. Eremeev drew up plans, which his lawyer in New York detailed in a 347-page visa application. He was applying for an L-1A visa, awarded to executives transferring to the United States.\u201cSounds and looks great, but it didn\u2019t help me obtain a visa,\u201d Mr. Eremeev said in a phone interview.Among other things, the immigration agency stated that the office leased by Mr. Eremeev did not appear to be suited for a \u201cbusiness that would require the employment of a manager or executive.\u201d His lawyer provided details and pictures of the space.Ultimately, the government denied the petition, stating that the \u201corganizational structure\u201d presented did not support the \u201cmanagerial or executive position\u201d that Mr. Eremeev was to fill.\u201cYou are going in circles,\u201d said the lawyer, Oksana Bandrivska, \u201cand it\u2019s getting harder to win cases.\u201dRussell Harrison, director of government relations for IEEE-USA, a society of technology professionals, applauded the administration\u2019s efforts to tackle visa abuse. However, he said, a blanket approach could stifle American competitiveness.\u201cThey seem to be against anyone coming in, which is a simplistic view,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cThere are some incredibly talented people not born in this country, and they are being treated just like other workers who are cheap.\u201dThe government\u2019s argument, Mr. Joseph said, is that those companies are trying to import temporary workers to fill permanent jobs that should go to Americans. But he said his clients faced a shortage of local labor year after year to fill jobs in construction, lodging, landscaping and amusement parks.Other changes affect foreigners already working or living in the United States on H-1Bs or other temporary permits.Those sponsored by their employers for a green card, or legal permanent residency, must pass in-person interviews, a reversal of a 20-year-old policy that is likely to exacerbate a long backlog in green card applications. A memo from the immigration agency said the change was in line with the executive order to safeguard the nation from terrorism.The administration said this month that it planned to eliminate a program established during the Obama administration that allows international entrepreneurs to stay in the United States for up to five years. The administration also said it would eliminate a two-year-old program that granted work permits for spouses of H-1B workers. And it recently announced plans to restrict the ability of foreign students to work temporarily in the United States after they graduate.Another change affects green card holders who enlist in the military. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, military service has provided a faster path to citizenship than applying as a civilian, typically taking just 10 weeks.In October, the Pentagon enacted new procedures that substantially slow the process by adding several layers of vetting. The change affects thousands of immigrants who have already enlisted because they cannot start training before clearing the background checks.The Pentagon said the new measures were needed to ensure that terrorists do not infiltrate the military. But Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer and retired lieutenant colonel in the Army, said the military would suffer. \u201cThey are turning away green card holders with language, cybersecurity and other skills that the United States military needs,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The decision suggested that change would not be immediate, or happen across the board.Mr. Shin\u2019s father, Shin Kyuk-ho, 95, who founded Lotte, was sentenced to four years in prison in the case, according to Yonhap. But the court, taking his age into consideration, did not order his imprisonment. Other relatives of the chairman were acquitted or given lighter sentences than those sought by prosecutors.The country\u2019s authorities have long been accused of using special treatment with business titans who break laws. Critics say officials shy away from harsher punishments to avoid threatening economic growth.Mr. Lee, the Samsung heir and de facto head of its lucrative electronics unit, and top aides were convicted in August of using bribes to cement the Lee family\u2019s control over Samsung\u2019s businesses.

{"Headline": "In Cricket, Fixing Concerns Rise as Bets and Matches Multiply", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile all three captains reported the approaches to cricket authorities \u2014 the offers were said to be for sums of up to $150,000 \u2014 the incidents reinforced the troubling concern that cricket is still regarded as ripe for fixing.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that the threat of corruption in the game is not going away,\u201d said Tony Irish, the executive chairman of the international cricket players\u2019 association. \u201cCricket as a whole has been slow to adjust to the risks of corruption.\u201dIrish said that he believes there is \u201ca serious risk to the reputation of the entire game.\u201dThe International Cricket Council\u2019s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, which polices the sport, has expressed alarm at the recent spike in incidents, and it is currently conducting seven investigations into suspected fixing.In September, the unit gained the power to request that players, coaches and administrators surrender data from their mobile phones, including from the messaging service WhatsApp, during investigations of suspected corruption cases. While it cannot compel suspects to hand over their devices, any who refuse face a charge of noncooperation, which could lead to a ban of up to two years.Twenty20, the short format of the game begun in 2003, has galvanized domestic cricket \u2014 and the amount bet on matches. Around $200 billion a year is gambled on cricket worldwide, according to estimates by the Qatar-funded International Centre for Sport Security, with a sizable portion of it drifting down to lower-profile games, both in official and unofficial tournaments, that are broadcast to eager fans, sometimes over social media platforms. Women\u2019s cricket and men\u2019s junior games are also considered increasingly vulnerable; in legal markets alone, $7 million was bet on last month\u2019s under-19 Asia Cup in Malaysia.At the same time, technology has allowed corrupting matches to become more intricate, as fixers can manipulate a portion of matches \u2014 so-called spot fixes \u2014 to lock in a profit regardless of who wins. And the I.C.C.\u2019s anticorruption unit is only responsible for monitoring international matches; national boards are in charge of anticorruption activity in their domestic leagues.\u201cIf the threat remains in international cricket then there should be even greater concerns about the leagues, where there are no minimum consistent standards,\u201d Irish said. \u201cIn some leagues the anticorruption measures are good, and in others they aren\u2019t. There are no enforced minimum standards, and there are no minimum player education requirements.\u201dBut for all these new challenges, the problems remain very familiar. Most countries that play top-level cricket lack specific laws against match-fixing, which can make it harder to prosecute fixers. Most fundamentally, gambling in India remains illegal \u2014 rendering it nearly impossible to follow betting patterns, and thus trace suspicious bets in that underground economy.Worldwide, only around 15 percent of sports betting is done through legal means, according to I.C.S.S. estimates. For cricket that figure is likely to be even lower, owing to the sport\u2019s huge popularity in India and other countries where betting is effectively untraceable. So while the International Cricket Council, like other sports bodies, is optimistic about its use of algorithms to identify suspicious betting patterns, those methods can succeed only in markets where legal gambling can be tracked, and monitored.Advertisement"}

The 68-page doctrine the White House released Monday described Russia and China as \u201crevisionist\u201d powers for seeking a change in the American-led world order.Dmitri S. Peskov, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s spokesman, responded with the Kremlin argument that the world would be a safer place if there were several powerful countries that could keep one another in check. The doctrine, he said, showed America\u2019s continuing \u201caversion to the multipolar world.\u201dBut Mr. Peskov also noted some recent instances of security cooperation, as did President Trump in a speech about the new doctrine that took a softer line on Russia than the document did.Mr. Peskov also praised that tip as an \u201cideal example\u201d of security cooperation.\u201cThe very idea of a \u2018revisionist power\u2019 is a departure from the position of Congress, which included Russia in the same lineup with Iran and North Korea \u2014 that is, among the rogue nations,\u201d Mr. Rogulyov said.The new doctrine\u2019s recognition of Russia as a rising power is an improvement over the views of previous administrations, Sergei A. Karaganov, a periodic Kremlin adviser on foreign policy, said in an interview. \u201cObviously, the new order is emerging,\u201d he said.The Chinese response to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech accused the United States of succumbing to \u201coutdated zero-sum thinking.\u201d\u201cOn the one hand, the U.S. government claims that it is attempting to build a great partnership with China,\u201d the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement. \u201cOn the other hand, it labels China as a rival.\u201d\u201cWe call on the United States to abandon its outdated zero-sum thinking, and work together with China to seek common ground and engage in win-win cooperation,\u201d the embassy said in its statement. \u201cTherefore we can jointly build a global community with a shared future for mankind, featuring common prosperity and development.\u201dThose criticisms were echoed by Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Beijing. She said at a regular briefing on Tuesday that the two nations had common goals, and that they needed to be respectful of each others\u2019 interests.\u201cIt is futile for any country to distort the facts or to smear China,\u201d Ms. Hua said. \u201cWe urge the U.S. side to stop distorting China\u2019s strategic intentions and to abandon Cold War thinking and a zero-sum mind-set, otherwise it would only harm both sides.\u201dGerry Mullany contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Actually, Egypt Is a Terrible Ally", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWhen Vice President Mike Pence visits Egypt on Wednesday, he will follow in the footsteps of countless American officials who have stopped in Cairo to laud the \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d between the United States and Egypt.This has become a vacuous and badly outdated talking point \u2014 the kind we both drafted during our years in the government. Mr. Pence shouldn\u2019t pay lip service to it.American and Egyptian interests are increasingly divergent and the relationship now has far less common purpose than it once did. Mr. Pence should make clear to Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt\u2019s president, that the two countries need a reset, beginning with a major reduction in American military assistance.In addition to saving American taxpayers\u2019 money, this would send an important message to other recipients of American aid that our support is not unconditional. It would also help to rein in an arrangement that has distorted Egyptian-American relations.Even where American and Egyptian goals remain aligned, Egypt struggles to promote our mutual objectives effectively. Washington has not grasped a new reality: Because of its internal decay, Egypt is no longer a regional heavyweight that can anchor America\u2019s Middle East policy.This is a start. More needs to be done.In light of Egypt\u2019s declining strategic importance and its problematic behavior, Washington should sharply reduce its annual military assistance by $500 million to $800 million to align our resources with our priorities. A cut in Egypt\u2019s aid would free up badly needed funds. And a move to start reducing security aid to Egypt to a level that is more in line with the actual value the United States derives from the relationship would be broadly popular in Congress, which has grown frustrated with Cairo.The risks are limited. Egypt is unlikely to change its behavior in response to less aid. It won\u2019t, for example, end its peace treaty with Israel or cease its counterterrorism cooperation with the United States. It will, of course, continue to fight local jihadists.Advocates of a closer relationship with Egypt argue that cutting aid would make Cairo less willing to accept American military training, but there is scant evidence that years of generous support have fostered a desire in Egypt for additional training opportunities in critical areas like counter-insurgency. Rather, disabusing Cairo of the notion that assistance is an entitlement might help to restore some leverage to extract concessions from Cairo. And, while instability in Egypt is a legitimate concern, we are deluding ourselves to think that American assistance is the difference between order and chaos.America is getting a bad deal in Egypt. That\u2019s ironic for a president who prides himself as a negotiator. Mr. Pence\u2019s visit is an opportunity to turn a new page with Egypt, and make the United States\u2019 commitment to the country commensurate with what Washington receives in return. If the Trump administration does this, it will take a small but important step toward restoring America\u2019s tarnished credibility and reputation in the region.Andrew Miller, the deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy, was the National Security Council\u2019s director for Egypt and an Egypt analyst in the State Department. Richard Sokolsky, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was a member of the Secretary of State\u2019s Office of Policy Planning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Cuts Would Lift Some Industries More Than Others", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disparities illustrate the difficulty in tailoring tax cuts for two of the blue-collar industries that Mr. Trump frequently promises to invigorate through economic policy changes. That\u2019s in part because both mining and manufacturing companies already benefit from relatively low effective tax rates among Americans companies.The findings come from economists at the Penn Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania, who projected how the final tax bill would change the average effective tax rates of a variety of industries over time.The legislation is expected to be put to a vote in the House as early as Tuesday and in the Senate on Wednesday. It would reduce the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from the current top rate of 35 percent, and make a host of other changes to the way businesses are taxed.Other analysts, particularly Wall Street firms, have begun estimating how specific industries would fare under the tax plan in the years ahead. On Monday, Goldman Sachs researchers said they expect the corporate cut in the tax bill to increase earnings-per-share by 13 percent on average for America\u2019s largest banks, with Wells Fargo standing to gain the most from the change.The Penn Wharton economists found that it would reduce the average effective tax rate across industries to 9 percent next year, down from 21 percent under current law.The cuts would boost some industries far more than others, in part because some sectors, like financial firms, pay higher effective tax rates than others, like manufacturing. Average effective rates are the tax rates that industries actually pay on profits after accounting for deductions and other tax breaks, as opposed to the statutory rate, which is set under law.The study found that real estate firms would see a 16-point reduction in their effective rates next year, and financial firms would see a 12-point reduction. Mining companies would see a cut of just under 9 points. Manufacturers\u2019 rate would fall by less than 7 points.\u201cSome industries see smaller gains because they already benefit from so much preferential tax treatment,\u201d said Alexander Arnon, a researcher with the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \u201cManufacturing and natural resource extraction already have low effective tax rates under current law, and so there isn\u2019t much room for them to fall further.\u201dThe analysis projects that the bill will save financial firms $250 billion on corporate taxes over the next decade, a 35 percent cut from what otherwise would have been a $715 billion tax liability.It projects manufacturers will save nearly the same amount, $261 billion. But that amounts to only a 22 percent cut, because that industry is larger than finance, and would have otherwise faced a $1.2 trillion liability over that time.Financial firms start with a higher effective rate, and in the first few years would see a larger rate cut. In later years, though, manufacturers in particular fall prey to a pair of provisions phased in by Republicans.One is the ability to immediately deduct the full cost of some capital investments, like heavy equipment and factories, which expires after five years. The other is a provision that effectively reduces the annual value of a tax credit for investments in research and development, which manufacturers utilize heavily.Manufacturing lobbyists say they are bullish on the tax bill and plan to fight Congress in later years to ensure neither of those provisions take effect down the road.\u201cOur members are very happy about the tax bill as it\u2019s written,\u201d said Chad Moutray, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see that level of optimism if they didn\u2019t think this was something that\u2019s going to benefit them.\u201dManufacturers currently enjoy one of the lowest effective tax rates of any industry, and they would continue to if the bill becomes law. Penn Wharton projects that manufacturers\u2019 effective rate would drop from 17.5 percent to 10.9 percent in 2018. But that number would rebound to 15.8 percent in 2027 if the law remains as written.No other major industry would see its rate savings shrink so drastically. But, under the legislation, every industry would see its gains erode over time. The average effective tax rate across industries, the Penn Wharton researchers calculated, would fall by 12 percent in 2018 compared to current law.By 2027, that cut would shrink to less than 5 percent.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How New Yorkers Would Lose Under the Republican Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tax bill approved by the Senate is many things, offering a huge tax cut for corporations, lower rates for the wealthy, and a big victory for Republicans and the White House.It is also an economic dagger aimed at high-tax, high-cost and generally Democratic-leaning areas \u2014 most notably New York City and its neighbors.The bill, if enacted into law, could send home prices tumbling 10 percent or more in parts of the New York area, according to one economic analysis. It could increase the regional tax burden, complicating companies\u2019 efforts to attract skilled workers. It could make it harder for state and local governments to pay for upgrades to the transit system and other infrastructure. And it could force cuts in federal programs that help immigrants, the elderly and other low-income residents afford the region\u2019s high cost of living.Most significantly, the bill would eliminate the deduction for state and local income taxes, and would cap the deduction for property taxes at $10,000.That wouldn\u2019t matter to the more than two-thirds of households nationwide that take the standard deduction, which would be nearly doubled under the bill. But in the New York area, high state and local taxes change the equation. In Manhattan and wealthy suburban counties, close to half of households itemize their deductions, and many could see an immediate tax increase.\u201cWe\u2019re worried and we\u2019re wondering what are we going to tell our kids,\u201d said Cynthia Metcalf, who lives with her husband and the youngest of their four children in Mount Kisco, an affluent commuter town. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s an attack deliberately set against people from the Northeast or from other blue states.\u201dMs. Metcalf, who teaches history at Westchester Community College, said she had tried to use TurboTax software to estimate how their tax returns would be affected. Currently, they can deduct the more than $20,000 a year they pay in school and town taxes, and the 7 percent of their income that goes to state taxes. Losing those deductions means the family could wind up paying considerably more, Ms. Metcalf said.That prospect has the Metcalfs rethinking their financial future. Ms. Metcalf said she dreaded the prospect of telling her youngest child, Genevieve, a high school senior, that the college of her choice was beyond their means. And she said she and her husband might have to accelerate plans to relocate once all their children have left home. Then again, she added, selling their home could become more difficult.\u201cNow I\u2019m starting to think, who\u2019s going to want to buy our house here in New York?\u201d Ms. Metcalf said. \u201cThe whole game has shifted.\u201dIndeed it has, and not just for homeowners. The tax plan would probably cut taxes for most New Yorkers, at least in the short term. But it has several provisions that local leaders said could pose long-term problems for New York and other urban areas. Mayor Bill de Blasio, in an interview on Monday, estimated that 700,000 New Yorkers would pay more in taxes in the near term.\u201cThe human impact is huge,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, referring both to the higher taxes some residents would pay and to the services that could be cut as a result of the tax plan. He said his administration had tried for four years to make one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities more affordable by providing public prekindergarten and paid sick leave. \u201cAnd then along comes the federal government and makes the situation worse,\u201d he said.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who joined Gov. Jerry Brown of California and New Jersey\u2019s governor-elect, Philip D. Murphy, on a call with reporters on Monday, called the bill \u201ca targeted assault\u201d on their states.Parts of the bills could be good for New York. Most significantly, the corporate tax cuts contained in both the House and Senate versions would most likely be a boon to New York\u2019s financial sector. That could mean higher returns for investors and bigger bonuses for Wall Street traders \u2014 which, in turn, could mean more spending at shops and restaurants and more sales-tax revenue for the city and state.Still, most experts said there was little doubt the bills would be bad for certain state and local budgets, and for the regional economy.High earners in Democratic counties are the most likely to receive a tax increase as a result of the repeal of the state and local tax deduction.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be good, I think that\u2019s clear,\u201d said Michael P. Jacobson, who leads the Institute for State and Local Governance at the City University of New York. \u201cAnd it might well be devastating.\u201dAn analysis of the Senate bill by Moody\u2019s Analytics concluded that home prices in Manhattan could fall nearly 10 percent in the coming years because of the bill. Some New York and New Jersey suburbs could be even more vulnerable because property-tax rates are higher there and prices are still recovering from the bursting of the housing bubble.There could also be broader effects. Driving up New York\u2019s already high tax burden could undermine the region\u2019s competitiveness by making it harder for businesses to recruit and retain skilled workers, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a leading business group.\u201cIt\u2019s our scientists, our entertainers, our teachers, top professors, employees of cultural institutions \u2014 it\u2019s a talent issue,\u201d Ms. Wylde said. \u201cIt\u2019s the entrepreneurs who decide not to locate their company here.\u201dFor the wealthiest New Yorkers, meanwhile, the loss of the deduction for state and local taxes means they could face a combined tax rate above 50 percent on their income.Already, many wealthy New Yorkers try to spend enough time outside the city to avoid paying income taxes as state residents, and economists warn that the tax bill could accelerate that trend. Goldman Sachs recently estimated that the loss of the state and local tax deduction could eventually lower the number of high-earning New York City residents by 2 to 4 percent.It wouldn\u2019t take a mass exodus to have a significant impact on state and local budgets. According to the city\u2019s Independent Budget Office, fewer than 40,000 New Yorkers accounted for 45 percent of taxable income in New York City in 2014.Three decades ago, New Yorkers defeated a similar effort to repeal the state and local tax deduction by rallying opposition from local officials across the country, said Jay Kriegel, who helped lead that lobbying effort on behalf of local business leaders. The breakneck pace of the latest tax bill left little time for a similar approach.\u201cPerhaps the biggest difference between \u201985 and 2017 is the speed at which these people have worked,\u201d Mr. Kriegel said. \u201cThere has not been time to have a serious discussion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens if the Tax Bill Is a Revenue Disaster?", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySuppose this is indeed what happens. I\u2019ve been trying to think through the next step: What effect will a ballooning deficit have on markets and the political climate?When it comes to markets, my conclusion is, not much. The tax bill might lead to somewhat higher interest rates, but probably not to an interest rate spike. Why not?You might think that I\u2019m making the same argument I was making during the aftermath of the financial crisis, when I argued repeatedly \u2013 and correctly \u2013 against predictions that budget deficits would lead to soaring rates. But my reasoning now is different, because both the underlying economic situation and the source of the deficits is different.Back in 2009-10, we had a deeply depressed economy with monetary policy at the zero lower bound, which meant basically that desired saving exceeded desired investment. So government borrowing wasn\u2019t competing with the private sector for a limited supply of funds, it was giving idle potential saving a place to go.These days we\u2019re much closer to full employment, and the Fed is gradually raising rates, so it\u2019s an entirely different situation. But if you want to claim that deficits will drastically raise rates, you need to spell out the channel; and I think that channel would be largely blocked.First of all, the U.S. isn\u2019t going to go bankrupt; it can\u2019t run out of money to pay its bills (except for political holdups), because it can print money. And we\u2019re a long way from the kind of situation in which America would become so dependent on the printing press that we\u2019re looking at potential hyperinflation.What this means is that monetary policy \u2013 basically, short-term interest rates \u2014 will be set by the Fed based on economic conditions. And long-term interest rates will, to a first approximation, be the average of expected future short rates, so they too will reflect expected economic conditions.So the only way big deficits could drive up rates would be if they gave a big boost to demand, threatening to overheat the economy, and causing the Fed to raise rates to avert that overheating.Which means that the market impact of deficits depends on how much we think these deficits will raise demand. And the answer is, probably not all that much \u2013 if you think of the tax bill as a form of demand stimulus, it\u2019s a very ineffective one, and the piece of the deficit that comes from gaming incompetent legislation will be especially ineffective.For one thing, the bulk of the gains will go to the rich, who probably spend less of a marginal dollar. And this will be especially true for rich people receiving what they suspect will be transient income gains.So, imagine yourself as a wealthy, liquid taxpayer experiencing a surge in after-tax income because your accountant has found clever ways to exploit the idiocy of new legislation. It will be fun and lucrative, but you\u2019d have to suspect that the fun will end eventually \u2013 that even this GOP, with this leadership, will eventually close the most outrageous loopholes. So we might see big deficits that have relatively little real effect, because the winners from system-gaming save most of their gains.Notice, by the way, that this isn\u2019t the conclusion I\u2019d like to reach on political grounds. Given how terrible this bill is, I\u2019d like to claim that it will lead to immediate market disaster. But I try not to engage in motivated reasoning (although sometimes I give in to temptation, then apologize); and I just don\u2019t see a market disaster even if we see the expected epidemic of tax avoidance.What about the politics? OK, here I don\u2019t have a clear model, so this is much more speculative. Still, what happens if the deficit balloons, and it\u2019s clear that gaming of the tax bill is a major factor?We know what Ryan and McConnell will try to do: they\u2019ll try to use deficits as an excuse to cut safety-net programs. But will they be able to get away with this with the memory of the tax scam still fresh in everyone\u2019s memory? I\u2019m pretty cynical about centrists and the propensity of the media to be taken in by charlatans, but I think this would probably be a bait and switch too far.Put it this way: Republicans would surely use big deficits as an excuse to propose big cuts in social programs, but they\u2019d face a barrage of hostile media coverage, plus lots of public demonstrations as in the case of health care, all reminding everyone that these deficits were created by their own dishonest promises just a few months earlier.And imagine, as we should, that all of this would go along with many front-page stories about dubious business types abusing the new loopholes. Doesn\u2019t this sound like a political disaster for the GOP?They could, of course, simply ignore the deficit and leave Medicare alone. But my guess is that they won\u2019t be able to help themselves, that they\u2019ll be prisoners of their own rhetoric even as the most unpopular legislation in history becomes pure political poison.So that\u2019s my prediction: minor market impact, but quite probably a political disaster for the GOP as it becomes even clearer that their tax policies reward scammers.Of course, all this may be overshadowed by constitutional crisis. But that\u2019s for another essay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Panel Rejects Trump's Nominee to Lead Export-Import Bank", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two Republican senators broke with their party on Tuesday to block President Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Export-Import Bank, a setback for the White House that reflects deep divisions in the Republican Party over the role that the government should play in steering the United States economy toward prosperity.The nominee, Scott Garrett, a former representative and a Republican from New Jersey who had wanted to see the government\u2019s export credit agency shuttered, was rejected by the Senate Banking Committee in a 13-to-10 vote, the first by the committee against a Trump administration nominee.The clash over the bank, which provides loan guarantees to foreign buyers of American-made products, reflects a split in the Republican Party between purist conservatives who view any government involvement in the economy as a violation of the free market and more business-oriented Republicans who see a role for the federal government as an advocacy arm in the global economy.The Trump administration has tried, sometimes unsuccessfully, to straddle this divide. Mr. Trump has vacillated between opposing the Export-Import Bank as an example of crony capitalism and supporting it as a tool to reduce the nation\u2019s trade deficit.Mr. Garrett reflected that uncertainty. Like some of the Trump administration\u2019s more controversial cabinet appointments, he had previously called for abolishing the institution that he would have led. Once nominated, he tried to assure senators that he had had a change of heart. But business and manufacturing groups that benefit from the Export-Import Bank feared that, as the agency\u2019s leader, Mr. Garrett might act to undermine it from within.The Export-Import Bank has offered government-backed loan guarantees to overseas customers wishing to buy products manufactured in the United States since the Depression. Some of its biggest customers are General Electric, Boeing and Caterpillar, whose equipment can be out of reach to some foreign customers without loan guarantees that help them secure credit with private banks.But the agency \u2014 once backed by large majorities in both parties \u2014 has become something of a litmus test for hard-line conservatives versus establishment Republicans. Hard-line conservative outside groups like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth have demanded the agency\u2019s closing. Business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have tried to revive it.As a candidate, Mr. Trump described the bank as a kind of corporate welfare. But in his first few months in office, the president appeared to have been persuaded that the bank\u2019s mission dovetailed with his own goal of using the might of the government to help lift manufacturing and exports. He also appeared to have been persuaded by the bank\u2019s supporters, who point out that the agency makes enough money to more than pay for itself and that other countries have far larger export credit agencies.\u201cSo instinctively, you would say it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but actually, it\u2019s a very good thing and it actually makes money,\u201d the president said.The vote on Tuesday was the first time that the Senate Banking Committee had scuttled a Trump administration nominee. The Republican senators Tim Scott of South Carolina and Michael Rounds of South Dakota joined 11 Democrats to reject the nomination.\u201cI believe he\u2019s a principled man who simply believes in the abolishment of the bank,\u201d Mr. Rounds said of Mr. Garrett. \u201cI think that strong desire on his part to see it abolished as an example of crony capitalism would not have worked in the operation of the bank.\u201dMr. Scott, whose state hosts a huge manufacturing plant for Boeing, the bank\u2019s biggest customer, said: \u201cMy belief is that we need to both reform the Export-Import Bank and ensure it continues to function as an important tool for American businesses large and small. Given Mr. Garrett\u2019s long history opposing the Ex-Im Bank, I believe it would be hard for him to accomplish both of those goals.\u201dMr. Garrett had been an outspoken critic of the bank, making him a curious choice to lead it.In 2015, Mr. Garrett called the bank \u201ca fund for corporate welfare\u201d and accused it of embodying \u201cthe corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201dSince his nomination, Mr. Garrett had expressed a newfound respect for the agency, but his conversion was not convincing to a majority of the Banking Committee.\u201cMr. Garrett was a leader of the effort to slam shut the doors of America\u2019s export financing bank, and he can\u2019t hide his contempt for Ex-Im,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the committee. \u201cHis testimony expressed no regret for his work to close the bank.\u201dThe demise of Mr. Garrett\u2019s nomination presents the White House with a choice on where to go.The White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration was \u201ccertainly disappointed,\u201d but added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with the committee on a path forward that hasn\u2019t been determined.\u201dThe Senate Banking Committee voted on Tuesday to advance four other Trump administration nominees who would serve on Ex-Im\u2019s board. If at least two of those nominees are approved in the Senate, the agency will have enough personnel to function normally.But some senators could move to block those nominations in the coming months. In November, Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, a critic of the bank, said that he would do \u201ceverything I can to prevent Ex-Im from getting a quorum\u201d if Mr. Garrett was not approved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Clinton: Americans Must Decide Who We Really Are", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsAmerica has a lot going for it.We are in the second year of rising incomes across all income groups. Our work force is relatively young, hardworking and productive. America\u2019s universities and other research institutions are strong in areas like materials science, software development, nanotechnology, biotechnology, genomics and many other fields that are important to our future economic growth and employment. We continue to move toward more energy independence and cleaner energy, with advances in battery storage for solar and wind power and a vast untapped capacity to generate electricity from both.Finally, we have a serious set of security challenges, from nuclear proliferation, to terrorism, to climate change, to cybersecurity, the last of which may prove the most daunting because it puts all the systems we need to deal with the other problems, and our very democracy, at risk.In spite of our overall economic progress since the 2008 crash, all these challenges have contributed to declining economic mobility, increasing political and social alienation and more personal insecurity for millions of our fellow citizens. These forces have increased our divisions, and make it even harder to recover our sense of common purpose.The good news is that an aggressive effort to address our problems with known and affordable responses would bolster the strength of our economy and our communities through higher incomes, more upward mobility and greater security. Many cities and several states are proving it every day.But as a nation, we\u2019re on a very different path. All too often, tribalism based on race, religion, sexual identity and place of birth has replaced inclusive nationalism, in which you can be proud of your tribe and still embrace the larger American community. And too often resentment conquers reason, anger blinds us to answers and sanctimony passes for authenticity. These trends are fueled by our Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook worlds, in which the attention span for issues on television news is only a few seconds, and the very survival of newspapers depends upon retweets of headlines from their online editions. Too many social media sites are fever swamps of extremist foreign and domestic invaders. Such resolute efforts to abolish the line between fact and fiction, truth and lies, can offset all the benefits of our interconnectedness. When trust vanishes and knowledge is devalued as an establishment defense of the status quo, anything can happen. We already see citizens being disenfranchised by the millions, targeted by race, ethnicity and age not because they are ineligible to vote, but because they favor inclusive, not tribal, nationalism.Who wins in this kind of environment? Those who already have it made; they\u2019ll make more. The least responsible members of the political media, who will prosper covering each new controversy and outrage. And the enemies of democracy, who feed the discord and hope that Americans will finally concede that informed self-government no longer works \u2014 and perhaps is no longer even possible \u2014 in the modern world.Twenty-five years ago, when I was elected president, I said that every American should follow our Constitutional framers\u2019 command to form a more perfect union, to constantly expand the definition of \u201cus\u201d and shrink the definition of \u201cthem.\u201d I still believe that. Because I do, I favor policies that promote cooperation over conflict and build an economy, a society and a politics of addition not subtraction, multiplication not division. Unfortunately, too many people in power across the world seem determined to do the reverse. If we do that here, we will miss this moment to build our brightest days. Therefore our most important challenge is deciding who we Americans really are \u2014 as citizens, communities and a nation. On that, all else depends.Bill Clinton was the 42nd president of the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proposed U.N. Resolution Would Toughen Sanctions on North Korea", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United States circulated a proposed resolution to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that would further choke North Korea\u2019s economy, with a near total ban on fuel imports, a tightening of restrictions on shipping and a one-year deadline for most North Korean laborers working under contracts abroad to go home.North Korea, the world\u2019s most isolated nation, has repeatedly defied Security Council resolutions to halt its nuclear weapons and missile testing. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula over concerns about a possible war have escalated in the year since the Trump administration took office.President Trump has threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, has threatened to strike the United States with a \u201cnuclear sword of justice.\u201dA copy of the proposed resolution, seen by The New York Times on Thursday evening, would limit North Korea\u2019s import of refined petroleum to 500,000 barrels a year as of Jan. 1, representing a roughly 90 percent reduction. The restriction would include diesel and kerosene, which are used by North Korea\u2019s military.The proposed resolution also calls for the return of North Korean citizens \u201cearning income abroad\u201d within 12 months, with some exceptions based on humanitarian and other laws. Many North Koreans work in Russia and China under conditions that human rights advocates have described as harsh.North Korea has become one of the most worrisome problems for the Security Council.

{"Headline": "My Year of No Shopping", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionNashville \u2014 The idea began in February 2009 over lunch with my friend Elissa, someone I like but rarely see. She walked into the restaurant wearing a fitted black coat with a high collar.\u201cWow,\u201d I said admiringly. \u201cSome coat.\u201dShe stroked the sleeve. \u201cYeah. I bought it at the end of my no-shopping year. I still feel a little bad about it.\u201dElissa told me the story: After traveling for much of the previous year, she had decided she had enough stuff, or too much stuff. She made a pledge that for 12 months she wouldn\u2019t buy shoes, clothes, purses or jewelry.I was impressed by her discipline, but she shrugged it off. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard.\u201dI did some small-scale experiments of my own, giving up shopping for Lent for a few years. I was always surprised by how much better it made me feel. But it wasn\u2019t until last New Year\u2019s Day that I decided to follow my friend\u2019s example.At the end of 2016, our country had swung in the direction of gold leaf, an ecstatic celebration of unfeeling billionaire-dom that kept me up at night. I couldn\u2019t settle down to read or write, and in my anxiety I found myself mindlessly scrolling through two particular shopping websites, numbing my fears with pictures of shoes, clothes, purses and jewelry. I was trying to distract myself, but the distraction left me feeling worse, the way a late night in a bar smoking Winstons and drinking gin leaves you feeling worse. The unspoken question of shopping is \u201cWhat do I need?\u201d What I needed was less.My plan had been to give up what Elissa gave up \u2014 things to wear \u2014 but a week into my no-shopping year, I bought a portable speaker. When I got it home I felt ridiculous. Shouldn\u2019t \u201cno shopping\u201d include electronics?I came up with my own arbitrary set of rules for the year. I wanted a plan that was serious but not so draconian that I would bail out in February, so while I couldn\u2019t buy clothing or speakers, I could buy anything in the grocery store, including flowers. I could buy shampoo and printer cartridges and batteries but only after I\u2019d run out of what I had. I could buy plane tickets and eat out in restaurants. I could buy books because I write books and I co-own a bookstore and books are my business. Could I have made it a full year without buying books? Absolutely. I could have used the library or read the books that were already in my house, but I didn\u2019t; I bought books.Gifts were the tough one for me. I\u2019m a gift-giver, and I could see how gift shopping could become an easy loophole. I decided to give books as gifts, but I didn\u2019t always keep to it. My editor married in 2017, and I wasn\u2019t about to give him a book as a wedding present. Still, the frantic shopping for others needed to come to a halt. The idea that our affection and esteem must manifest itself in yet another sweater is reductive. Elissa said she gave people time, a certificate to watch their kids or clean their house. \u201cThat,\u201d she told me, \u201cturned out to be the hardest thing. Time is so valuable.\u201dI was raised Catholic and spent 12 years in a Catholic girls school. In the same way a child who grows up going to the symphony is more likely to enjoy classical music, and a child raised in a bilingual household is probably going to speak two languages, many children raised Catholic have a talent for self-denial. Even now my sister and I plan for Lent the way other people plan family vacations: What will we let go of? What good can we add?My first few months of no shopping were full of gleeful discoveries. I ran out of lip balm early on and before making a decision about whether lip balm constituted a need, I looked in my desk drawers and coat pockets. I found five lip balms. Once I started digging around under the bathroom sink I realized I could probably run this experiment for three more years before using up all the lotion, soap and dental floss. It turns out I hadn\u2019t thrown away the hair products and face creams I\u2019d bought over the years and didn\u2019t like; I\u2019d just tossed them all under the sink.I\u2019m using them now, and they\u2019re fine.Not shopping saves an astonishing amount of time. In October, I interviewed Tom Hanks about his collection of short stories in front of 1,700 people in a Washington theater. Previously, I would have believed that such an occasion demanded a new dress and lost two days of my life looking for one. In fact, Tom Hanks had never seen any of my dresses, nor had the people in the audience. I went to my closet, picked out something weather appropriate and stuck it in my suitcase. Done.I did a favor for a friend over the summer and she bought me a pair of tennis shoes. Her simple act of kindness thrilled me. Once I stopped looking for things to buy, I became tremendously grateful for the things I received. Had I been shopping this summer I would have told my friend, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d and I would have meant it.It doesn\u2019t take so long for a craving to subside, be it for Winstons or gin or cupcakes. Once I got the hang of giving shopping up, it wasn\u2019t much of a trick. The trickier part was living with the startling abundance that had become glaringly obvious when I stopped trying to get more. Once I could see what I already had, and what actually mattered, I was left with a feeling that was somewhere between sickened and humbled. When did I amass so many things, and did someone else need them?If you stop thinking about what you might want, it\u2019s a whole lot easier to see what other people don\u2019t have. There\u2019s a reason that just about every religion regards material belongings as an impediment to peace. This is why Siddhartha had to leave his palace to become the Buddha. This is why Jesus said, \u201cBlessed are the poor.\u201d It\u2019s why my friend Sister Nena, an 85-year-old Catholic nun, took a vow of poverty when she entered the convent at 18.The things we buy and buy and buy are like a thick coat of Vaseline smeared on glass: We can see some shapes out there, light and dark, but in our constant craving for what we may still want, we miss life\u2019s details. It\u2019s not as if I kept a ledger and took the money I didn\u2019t spend on perfume and gave that money to the poor, but I came to a better understanding of money as something we earn and spend and save for the things we want and need. Once I was able to get past the want and be honest about the need, it was easier to give more of my money to people who could really use it.For the record, I still have more than plenty. I know there is a vast difference between not buying things and not being able to buy things. Not shopping for a year hardly makes me one with the poor, but it has put me on the path of figuring out what I can do to help. I understand that buying things is the backbone of the economy and job growth. I appreciate all the people who shop in the bookstore. But taking some time off from consumerism isn\u2019t going to make the financial markets collapse. If you\u2019re looking for a New Year\u2019s resolution, I have to tell you: This one\u2019s great.What I still haven\u2019t figured out is how the experiment ends. Do I just start shopping again? Shop less? I called Elissa. I hadn\u2019t seen her in years. She told me that after she bought the black coat, she decided to re-up for another year.\u201cI realized I had too many decisions to make that were actually important,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were people to help, things to do. Not shopping frees up a lot of space in your brain.\u201dSo for now I\u2019ll leave my pledge in place. Who knows how far I can go? In a country hellbent on selling us dresses and shirts with the shoulders cut out (though I like to think I wouldn\u2019t have fallen for that one even if I had been shopping), it\u2019s good to sit on the bench for a while. Or as the great social activist Dorothy Day liked to say, \u201cThe best thing to do with the best things in life is give them up.\u201dAnn Patchett is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cCommonwealth\u201d and the co-owner of Parnassus Books.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Last-Minute Rush to Prepay Taxes Gives Way to Confusion and Anger", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Hempstead, a Long Island town where the typical property tax bill tops $10,000, residents have lined up all week to prepay those taxes for next year. They have been trying to save thousands of dollars before the new federal tax bill, which goes into effect on New Year\u2019s Day, sharply limits deductions for state and local taxes.\u201cEverybody on line, they\u2019re going, \u2018Don, are we going to be able to do this?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Clavin said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t give them a yes or a no.\u201dThe new tax bill, and its $10,000 cap on all local and state tax deductions, has generated a variety of strong emotions \u2014 including anxiety and frustration \u2014 in places like Hempstead.By Thursday, however, that stew of emotions had been replaced by utter confusion, as well as rage, including among people who had shelled out money only to discover that they might not get any benefit.This week\u2019s tax-prepayment roller coaster could be just the beginning. Republicans pushed through their tax overhaul at blistering speed, giving lawyers and accountants only about a week to study the bill before it goes into effect.But already, those people studying the law have uncovered internal conflicts and unintended consequences, as well as broad areas of uncertainty the I.R.S., the Treasury Department and, ultimately, the court system will be left to resolve.\u201cIt\u2019s fun if you\u2019re a tax lawyer,\u201d said David Herzig, a professor of tax law at Valparaiso University. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fun if you\u2019re a person going through it.\u201dThe confusion this week stems from the provision in the new tax bill that caps the previously unlimited deduction for state and local taxes, and the I.R.S. guidance about the ability of people to prepay property taxes this year.In Hempstead, and in other high-tax, high cost-of-living communities across the country, tax bills routinely run far above the new $10,000 threshold once state income and local property taxes are taken into account. In Nassau County, which includes Hempstead, the average state and local tax deduction in the county, including property taxes, topped $20,000 in 2015, among the highest in the country, according to data from the I.R.S.The new cap does not take effect until January, however. The tax bill explicitly prevented people from prepaying state income taxes, but it did not address prepayment of property taxes. That gave homeowners a brief window to pay their 2018 property taxes in 2017, and to take the full deduction when they file their federal returns this spring.Officials in Chicago, Washington, Fairfax, Va., and other communities reported huge surges of residents prepaying taxes, often showing up in person, checks in hand. Democratic politicians, who have opposed the bill, egged them on, arguing that the bill targeted states that tend to vote for Democrats.Final answers might not be available anytime soon. The I.R.S. guidance left plenty of room for interpretation and was, in any case, nonbinding.But the memo had an immediate impact. In Prince George\u2019s County, Md., the County Council had been planning to hold an emergency session on Thursday to discuss letting residents prepay their taxes, a step already taken by neighboring Montgomery County. But within hours of the memo\u2019s release, the council canceled the meeting.Dannielle M. Glaros, chairwoman of the Prince George\u2019s County Council, said the I.R.S. guidance left her little choice. T he decision to cancel the meeting resolved the immediate uncertainty, but it did little to ease residents\u2019 larger confusion about the effects of the bill.\u201cIt\u2019s this sense of the unknown,\u201d Ms. Glaros said. \u201cThat is what\u2019s creating a lot of this anxiety that we\u2019re seeing.\u201dAnxiety \u2014 and also anger. Steve Halliwell, who lives with his wife, Anne, in Irvington, a village in Westchester County, N.Y., began asking town officials several weeks ago about paying next year\u2019s property taxes this year. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive order last week was meant to make that possible.But the order came too late for the county\u2019s residents: Officials there said this week that they would not be able to issue tax assessments by the end of the year.\u201cThere are a lot of angry people here because they feel powerless and they are not used to feeling powerless,\u201d Mr. Halliwell said. \u201cThis shows the venal side of politics.\u201dOther communities happily accepted the money \u2014 but offered no guarantees that prepaying would work out for taxpayers.In Clarkstown, in Rockland County, N.Y., residents began lining up at the tax office before 9 a.m. on Thursday. The line snaked down the hall as hundreds of residents waited to get their property tax bill and then pay it. Outside, the parking lot was so crowded that police officers directed traffic.\u201cWe brought in extra staff and extended the hours,\u201d said George Hoehmann, the town\u2019s supervisor. \u201cWe have gotten thousands of calls. Normally, it would be quiet this time of year, but there is a lot of anxiety because people don\u2019t know what the impact of the tax bill will be.\u201dIn the last two days, more than 3,500 people came in to prepay their 2018 property taxes, 2,000 of them on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve seen nothing like this ever,\u201d said Mr. Hoehmann, who has been town supervisor for three years and was a councilman for seven years before.Mr. Hoehmann said he believed the town\u2019s residents would get the tax break under the I.R.S. ruling. The town had already assessed the 2018 property tax bill, allowing residents to prepay their town, county and special district taxes in 2017, he said.But he also made no promises.\u201cUltimately that\u2019s between the individual taxpayer and the I.R.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe advised people to speak to their accountant. What we wanted to do was give them the opportunity.\u201dSome taxpayers took the uncertainty in stride. Chacko Kurian, who lives in Rockland County, was in line Thursday morning to pay some of the $30,000 in property taxes he owed on his house, which he described as a \u201cmansion\u201d with a fish pond and a waterfall.Mr. Kurian, a 70-year-old retired engineer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he did not know whether prepaying his taxes would work out. But he figured it was worth the risk.\u201cMy accountant said prepay and see what happens,\u201d Mr. Kurian said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight the system. It is what it is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Venezuela Ravaged by Inflation, \u2018a Race for Survival\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Of all the compromises he has had to make during Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis, none may be as great for Carlos Sandoval as the books.A self-described bibliophile \u2014 \u201cmy life is literature,\u201d he said \u2014 Mr. Sandoval is one of Venezuela\u2019s foremost literary critics and a professor at two of the country\u2019s finest universities.Yet, Mr. Sandoval can no longer afford to buy books.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst sacrifice,\u201d he lamented.Venezuela\u2019s deepening economic crisis has spared few across the population of more than 30 million.The nation is on the verge of, and by some measures already in, an extraordinary period of hyperinflation, with the inflation rate above 800 percent through October. Next year, consumer prices are forecast by the International Monetary Fund to soar more than 2,300 percent.This is an economy in which even the hourly rate in a parking lot recently ticked upward in the two hours it took a shopper to run some errands.But affording purchases is only one major challenge. Another is figuring out how to actually pay for them.The Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar, is in short supply, and finding a fistful of them has become one of the nightmares of daily life. People are compelled to endure long lines at cash machines to withdraw maximum amounts equivalent to about 10 cents \u2014 just enough to pay for several round trips on a public bus.The economic turmoil has put families \u2014 poor and affluent alike \u2014 at the intersection of some very tough choices, bred a stressful uncertainty about the course of any given day and turned the most basic tasks into feats of endurance.\u201cSomething so simple as taking money out of a bank machine or buying a coffee or taking a taxi has become a race for survival,\u201d Mr. Sandoval said.Some in Venezuela have started equating the nation\u2019s travails to a country during wartime. But the deterioration has in some ways been less dramatic and more insidious.At first glance the severity of the situation might not be immediately obvious to a newcomer. Viewed from a certain remove, Caracas may seem like any other capital in the developing world: streets crowded with traffic, people hustling to work, shops open and doing business.But on closer inspection, those impressions quickly fall away to reveal a society falling apart, and people struggling to hold their lives together and make it through the day.The administration of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stopped publishing inflation data long ago. But the opposition-controlled National Assembly, whose economic data is generally in line with those of private economists, said that the inflation rate hit 45.5 percent in October, up from 36.3 percent the month before, putting Venezuela on the statistical doorstep of hyperinflation, commonly regarded as 50 percent per month or higher.But hyperinflationary conditions have already existed, economists say, particularly as prices on some key goods and services have risen by more than 50 percent month over month, putting them out of reach of an increasing number of people.The stress and the costs are rendered most starkly among the poor, where margins of survival are measured in pennies.For nearly two decades, Beatr\u00edz, 53, worked as a nurse in Caracas, a career she loved. Even though she earned only slightly more than minimum wage, she made enough to make ends meet for her and her five children.\u201cFood was never an issue,\u201d said Beatr\u00edz, who, like some others interviewed for this article, asked that her full name be withheld for fear that she would be persecuted by the Maduro administration for criticizing the economic situation.Several years ago, Beatr\u00edz was laid off from her job as the economy worsened, and she found work as the staff cleaner in the Caracas office of an international advertising firm.She now makes about what she did as a nurse, yet it is no longer enough to cover her family\u2019s basic needs, even though her household has shrunk to only three people: herself, a son and her ailing 76-year-old mother.\u201cWe have to choose between medicine and food,\u201d Beatr\u00edz said.Like many poor Venezuelans, she has been gradually eliminating meals from her daily routine. She is now down to one, dinner, which usually consists of little more than rice and beans or pasta.\u201cIt seems like a lie, but it\u2019s not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of living. It\u2019s a matter of survival.\u201dA survey conducted by a group of national universities found that in 2016, about 80 percent of Venezuelans were living in poverty.In October, the cost of the basic monthly food basket that a family of four would need rose 48 percent during the month, according to the Analysis and Documentation Center for Workers, a nonprofit organization associated with the teachers union. Wage increases have lagged far behind the rise in costs of goods and services, putting them further out of the reach of consumers.David, a 42-year-old hairdresser with three children, started paring back his expenses several years ago. First went the annual vacation to visit family in M\u00e9rida, his hometown, in western Venezuela. Then went the biweekly clothes purchases for his children. The family has not gone to the cinema, once a regular family treat, since last year.Like other families hovering around the poverty line, they subscribe to a government program that is supposed to provide a box of subsidized food once a month, though deliveries are often less frequent. A recent box contained about four and a half pounds of black beans, the same amount of sugar, slightly more than two pounds of corn meal mix, five cans of tuna and four and a half pounds of pasta.\u201cFor a family of five, that goes quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t eat much.\u201dDavid, like many Venezuelans, spends a lot of time waiting in line to buy basic goods \u2014 when they are available. The other day he awoke before 5 a.m. and stood in line for nearly two and a half hours to buy a canister of cooking gas. By the time he got to the front of the line, the supply had run out.As he told the story, he seemed neither annoyed nor angry. Just resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s like something from a movie where you become accustomed to something that you shouldn\u2019t be accustomed to,\u201d he said. \u201cStanding in line erodes the mind, erodes your thinking, the capacity to create.\u201dExacerbating the country\u2019s crisis, the bol\u00edvar has been in free-fall against the dollar in recent months. On Friday, the dollar was trading at about 103,024 bol\u00edvars on the black market, more than double what it was a month ago and about 33 times its value at the beginning of the year, according to DolarToday.com, a widely consulted website that tracks the black market rates.The two-year graph of the rate change looks like the path of a plane that, after a sprint along a runway, executes a near-vertical take off.The soaring cost of dollars has in turn made imports even more expensive. Public buses, garbage trucks and ambulances in disrepair remain out of service longer, or forever, for lack of imported spare parts.But the plummeting bol\u00edvar also means those who earn in dollars can live like royalty.On a recent evening at La Esquina, one of the capital\u2019s most fashionable and expensive restaurants, many of the dishes were in the range of 100,000-200,000 bol\u00edvars \u2014 a fortune in a country where the monthly minimum wage is 177,507 bol\u00edvars, yet less than $2.50 in black market dollars at that day\u2019s exchange rate.The shortage of cash, and the enormous number of rapidly devaluing bills required to buy even the cheapest items, has accelerated digital banking in Venezuela. Transactions using credit cards and debit cards, or internet bank transfers, are the norm, even in some street markets.Barter is also becoming more common. Mr. Sandoval said that a secretary in his university office recently offered a swap of some corn meal for bathroom soap.While most taxis still demand payment in cash, Mr. Sandoval said that over the years he had assembled a network of taxi drivers who trust him enough to allow him to pay in bank transfers, which helps ensure that his transportation is covered as he zips from job to job, appointment to appointment.He has built a busy life for himself to make ends meet: On top of his two university jobs and a position at a publishing house, he has taken on an array of freelance gigs, including editing a novel and teaching writing workshops.Venezuelans call this kind of side work \u201cmatar un tigre,\u201d or killing a tiger. And Mr. Sandoval is killing tigers right and left. Yet, there is no relief.\u201cWith this situation,\u201d he said, \u201ceverything has gotten much more difficult.\u201dDespite all the additional work he has taken on, he has watched his purchasing power spiral downward. A decade ago, his university paycheck would have covered his household expenses, food and mortgage, leaving enough extra to buy some trousers or a pair of shoes.\u201cNow, to buy a pair of shoes, I have to put together two biweekly paychecks and hope that a light bulb doesn\u2019t break,\u201d he said.His wife, who has both Spanish and Venezuelan citizenship, wants to move to Spain, but he is resisting. He fears that despite everything, he would miss Caracas.\u201cI\u2019d die spiritually,\u201d he said.\u201cThis has to change at some moment,\u201d he added, referring to the crisis. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how, but it has to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Corporate Tax Cuts: It\u2019s Only About the Wedge (Wonkish)", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor those who weren\u2019t reading my blog before it was folded into the column page, \u201cwonkish\u201d posts were written with economists or highly economics-fluent readers in mind, not the broader public. I put up the \u201cwonkish\u201d as a warning to normal human beings. So here\u2019s one of those on the topic of the day; if funny diagrams and economese aren\u2019t your thing, feel free to skip.Tax experts are going to be up all night trying to figure out what\u2019s really in the bill Republicans dump today, just a couple of days before the vote. I have no skill in reading legislation, so I\u2019ll wait for them to do the job. In the meantime, I had a new thought on claims that corporate tax cuts will produce lots of economic growth \u2013 a different way to make the \u201cleprechaun economics\u201d point I\u2019ve been making repeatedly, to little avail.But there\u2019s a way to estimate the true gains implied even by their wildly optimistic approach, by focusing on the fundamental economics of claims that cutting corporate taxes are beneficial to the U.S.. Where do the supposed gains come from?The answer is that as long as we have a corporate tax, the marginal product of capital \u2013 which, assuming competition, is also the pre-tax rate of return \u2013 is higher than the after-tax rate of return, which is what foreigners get from investing here. So there\u2019s a tax wedge: what the U.S. economy gets in additional production exceeds what we pay out to foreigners. And the gains from capital inflow are due to that wedge.We have the demand for capital, also equal to its marginal product. We also have a supply of capital, which is elastic because we\u2019re open to capital flows. I\u2019ve drawn an upward-sloping supply curve, for reasons I\u2019ll explain in a minute; Tax Foundation effectively assumes this curve is horizontal.In either case, corporate taxes put a wedge between the cost of capital and its marginal product, as shown in the figure. Tax cuts narrow that wedge, bringing in foreign capital, and for a small tax cut those gains equal the yellow rectangle at the right. It\u2019s not hard to do this for a large tax cut, but it won\u2019t change anything.So how big are the gains \u2013 the true gains, measured as gains to domestic residents? They\u2019re equal to the area of that rectangle \u2013 the increase in capital multiplied by the size of the wedge.And we know what Tax Foundation is claiming: they predict a big rise in the capital stock. They also predict a 3% gain in GDP.So using the very logic that seems to underlie optimism about corporate tax cuts, we actually end up with much smaller numbers for national income.And wait, there\u2019s more. Even in the long run, the U.S. doesn\u2019t face a horizontal supply of capital, because we\u2019re a big player and capital mobility is far from perfect. We definitely don\u2019t face a horizontal supply curve in the short and medium run. As a result, a lot of corporate tax cuts will raise after-tax profits rather than wages. And roughly a third of this profit rise will accrue to foreign investors who are already here. That\u2019s a loss for America\u2019s GNP \u2013 the red rectangle at the bottom \u2014 that partially or maybe even completely offsets the gain from the wedge.My main point, however, is that we should think about corporate tax cuts the way we think about other economic policies: the gains come from reducing existing distortions. In this case, the distortion is a tax that puts a wedge between domestic returns and the cost of imported capital. If you take the logic of the case for gains from corporate tax cuts seriously, it still implies that only the narrowing of the wedge produces gains \u2013 and that means that only a smallish fraction of the gains in GDP, however large they may (or may not) be, actually stays here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Re-election Is Assured. Let the Succession Fight Begin.", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Ask Russian analysts to describe the coming campaign for the March 2018 presidential election and their answers contain a uniform theme: a circus, a carnival, a sideshow.With the victory of President Vladimir V. Putin assured, the real contest, they say, is the bare-knuckled, no-holds-barred fight to determine who or what comes after him by the end of his next six years in office, in 2024. What might be called the Court of Putin \u2014 the top 40 to 50 people in the Kremlin and their oligarch allies \u2014 will spend the next presidential term brawling over that future.\u201cThe election itself does not matter at all,\u201d said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former Kremlin consultant. The people around the president, he added, \u201care deciding the question of who they themselves will be after Putin. That is the main motive behind this fight: It is a struggle for a place in the system after Putin is gone.\u201dWhile no one can be certain what Mr. Putin, 65, will do when his next term ends, those in his inner circle are already preparing for the day he leaves the presidency, eager to preserve their power and to avoid any fallout that could follow a change in leadership. With an expiration date on the horizon, his court is beginning to focus more on self-preservation than on serving Mr. Putin.This jockeying for power is expected to offer all the drama that next year\u2019s presidential race sorely lacks. Cloistered, for now, mostly behind the Kremlin walls, the intrigues are expected to burst into public view with increasing frequency in coming years.Several internal battles have already erupted publicly, including the dismantling of a respected research university and a startling corruption trial in which a former minister accused of soliciting bribes said he was set up by a former spy who has been a close Putin ally. It is the kind of fight the president would have managed privately in previous years.\u201cYou cannot hide the enormous tension, the enormous degree of uncertainty within the Russian elite,\u201d said Konstantin Gaaze, who contributes political analysis to the website of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a policy research organization. \u201cThey will do stupid things; they will blackmail each other; they will write reports about each other and bring them to Putin.\u201dFor the coming three months, the election will be the main distraction. Then Mr. Putin, who will turn 72 in 2024, is expected to start building something of a retirement plan.\u201cPutin thinks of himself as an historical figure, and he knows that if he wants to put himself into the history books, he should not repeat Mugabe\u2019s mistake \u2014 he should find the right time to leave,\u201d said Konstantin Kalachyov, the head of the Political Expert Group and an occasional consultant for the Kremlin.At the same time, Mr. Putin is likely to want to preserve some political role after 2024 and not simply retire to his dacha, or worse, end up in jail.\u201cHe cannot just go,\u201d Mr. Gaaze said. \u201cHe knows perfectly well that if his successor fails, they will both be prosecuted.\u201dSome expect Mr. Putin to reshape the Constitution to create some kind of higher military or security council, appointing himself to lead it and securing his influence. \u201cI cannot imagine a situation where he gives all power to the successor; he does not trust anybody,\u201d Mr. Gaaze said.Mr. Putin has done something similar before. When his second consecutive term as president ended in 2008, he served as prime minister during the one-term presidency of Dmitri A. Medvedev, although it was understood he remained the country\u2019s ultimate leader. Starting with the election of 2012, the president\u2019s term in office was extended from four years to six.Mr. Pavlovsky, who worked in the Kremlin under President Boris N. Yeltsin, recalled that the process to replace Mr. Yeltsin, who was ailing, began right after he won the 1996 election and would clearly not run again.It meant rebuilding the state, not just replacing the man.\u201cWe knew that Yeltsin would be gone in 2000, and we did not want the state to go with him,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said. \u201cIt was Yeltsin\u2019s Russia. Yeltsin was going, so Yeltsin\u2019s Russia was going too, and we had to found a new Russia.\u201dMr. Yeltsin appointed Mr. Putin his successor in 2000, and he has been the most powerful man in Russia ever since. Because Mr. Putin has centralized so much power, the question of who will succeed him is especially urgent.\u201cToday we have Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said. \u201cIf Putin is gone, Putin\u2019s Russia also has to go. That is also a dangerous situation. His entourage understands this and wants to preserve Putin\u2019s Russia after he is gone.\u201dSo the various factions within the Putin Court will seek to convince the president to name an heir apparent who best preserves their collective interests.For those angling to succeed the president, it is a high-wire act. Candidates need to be careful not to be seen as an immediate threat to the president, notoriously protective of his position. Push too hard, too fast, and a person could be purged.And as 2024 nears, Mr. Putin\u2019s ability to protect likely successors could lessen, putting them at risk of being brought down by rivals. As a result, no one is expected to seek the heir apparent title openly.\u201cPeople considered possible successors are ready to pay not to be called that,\u201d Mr. Kalachyov said.The Kremlin dismissed talk of internal intrigues, with Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, calling such speculation the favorite pastime of political analysts. \u201cThat is what they do,\u201d he said.There have already been signs of Mr. Putin\u2019s influence starting to ebb, however, and a few brutish spats among the elite have spilled into the open.Russia\u2019s former economy minister, Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, delivered a long, emotional soliloquy at the closing of his corruption trial on Thursday about what he views as political treachery.He faces up to 10 years in a penal colony on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe to approve a major oil deal sought by the state oil giant Rosneft, run by Igor I. Sechin, a Putin ally and former military intelligence agent.In his speech, the former minister warned the Kremlin elite that anyone could be next in the docket. \u201cNever send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee,\u201d he said, quoting the classic lines of John Donne. \u201cIt can toll for any one of you. It\u2019s become very easy: a bag, a basket, a grainy video, three clicks, and it\u2019s ready.\u201dIn a show of force, Mr. Sechin refused a court summons to appear as a witness at the trial four times, saying he was too busy.Aside from Mr. Ulyukayev, Mr. Sechin appears intent on crushing Sistema, a wealthy investment firm, by filing repeated lawsuits \u2014 despite public admonitions from Mr. Putin that he would like such disputes settled amicably.Mr. Sechin also publicly, and unexpectedly, pledged to work with Ramzan Kadyrov, the autocratic leader of Chechnya. Both men have shown an increasing tendency to act independently of Mr. Putin, distancing themselves even though it was the president\u2019s protection that allowed both to become outsize figures with vast fortunes and personal fiefs.If Mr. Sechin and Mr. Kadyrov share a common cause, it is trying to help choose the next president, the best insurance for those in the inner circle. \u201cBecause the others, except those who decide the successor to Putin, will all be in great danger,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said.The more Mr. Putin becomes a lame duck, analysts said, the less influence he may have in choosing a successor and the more Kremlin insiders will assert themselves. Many point to the case of the European University at St. Petersburg as an example that Mr. Putin\u2019s protection is no longer as robust.By numerous accounts, Mr. Putin tried to preserve the university, a respected private, liberal, postgraduate institution. Conservative nationalists hated it, and real estate developers coveted the historic Small Marble Palace where it was housed.First the university lost its building, and last week it was denied an operating license for the third time. The demise came despite what one senior university official and various Russian news reports described as three attempts by Mr. Putin to get the Education Ministry to protect the place.\u201cWhat matters now is your own potential independent of Putin,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said, \u201cbecause the moment is rapidly approaching when Putin will not be able to help you.\u201dFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar.Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

This column is taking a short recess from the 24-hour, seven-day-week, free-floating, I-can\u2019t-bear-to-look-anymore apocalypse of the subway, the city, the country, the world and intergalactic space.So. In August 1952, The New York Times published the following dire statement in an editorial: The public now had evidence in statistics \u201csolemnly guaranteed as accurate and complete by the Police Department, that there is definite reason for concern about the trend violence is taking in New York.\u201dOver the years, things got bloodier, more or less steadily, until 1990. The city had 2,245 murders that year.A mere number, the homicide statistic is of the utmost importance for what it counts, death by violence. But it is also a historic milestone for what it does not count: lives not lost. It marks a long change, one whose importance would be unmistakable for anyone familiar with the city.Well, not everyone. You can, of course, always manage to find one New Yorker who sees things upside down. In this case, the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump managed that trick during a campaign debate last year.\u201cMurders are up, all right,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou check it.\u201dWrong then, wrong now. That may not qualify as startling news, but it is welcome. As the city has grown, it has become safer and safer.The cause of the (nonexistent) crime increase, Mr. Trump had said, was that \u201ca judge, who was a very-against-police judge,\u201d acting in concert with Mayor Bill de Blasio, had ended the use of stop-and-frisk.Candidate Trump got the murder trend completely wrong, but sometimes people stumble on facts when rushing to get to a larger truth.In this case, Mr. Trump was trying to get at an even bigger untruth.Today, the police still stop and search people, but the number of such encounters has dropped by more than 98 percent since its peak in 2011 \u2014 down to 12,404 in 2016, and about the same pace this year. Six years ago, 685,724 were stopped and searched \u2014 605,328 of whom had done nothing wrong, and many thousands who had done nothing worse than carry marijuana.Along the way, a federal judge did say that the city\u2019s wholesale stop-and-frisk practices violated the Constitution. But contrary to the cries of Mr. Bloomberg, the police commissioner and some editorial writers, further curtailing this approach did not make the city more dangerous. In fact, the opposite happened. That is unambiguously great news.In the six years since the police department began cutting back on searches, murder in the city has dropped by almost half. The department now puts its resources on groups \u2014 gangs \u2014 that it sees as likely to be victims or perpetrators of crime, or both.Other realities: The city\u2019s economy is booming. Jobs have grown for 90 straight months. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to say that the police are completely responsible for the murder decrease,\u201d said Stephen P. Davis, the Police Department\u2019s deputy commissioner for public information. \u201cIt\u2019s also wrong to say these other factors, like the economy, are the only reason.\u201dSome people still miss the drug.Regular coverage of the apocalypse resumes shortly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Resolute in Sanctuary Status as a Heated Case Ends", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the next 16 months, he seized on the killing as an example of the problems with illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. The man who fired the gun, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, was an undocumented immigrant who had been deported several times and had recently been freed by the San Francisco County sheriff.Instead, they have effectively doubled down on policies protecting them.San Francisco has successfully sued the Trump administration to stop it from financially punishing sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. Both California and San Francisco, along with other cities, have set aside money to help pay for lawyers for undocumented immigrants facing deportation.And in October, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed a law strictly limiting communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, effectively turning all of California into a sanctuary state.\u201cCalifornia\u2019s local law enforcement cannot be commandeered and used by the Trump Administration to tear families apart, undermine our safety, and wreak havoc on our economy,\u201d Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, said in a statement when Mr. Brown signed the law, calling it \u201ca wall of justice against President Trump\u2019s xenophobic, racist and ignorant immigration policies.\u201dBut while the fight over immigration has become symbolic of California\u2019s role as a leader of the Democratic opposition to the president, the only fiery remarks over the last two days have come from Mr. Trump and other Republicans, a sign of the delicate position for leaders here in the face of the death of an American citizen.After the acquittal, Mr. Trump called again for the construction of a border wall and threatened to use Ms. Steinle\u2019s death against Democrats, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions again criticized sanctuary cities for \u201chaving put the public\u2019s safety at risk.\u201dThe reaction in California was far more muted. \u201cSan Francisco is and will always be a sanctuary city,\u201d a spokesman for Edwin M. Lee, the city\u2019s mayor, said in a statement, declining further comment.Supporters of sanctuary policies say they build trust with immigrant communities and ultimately stop crime, and have argued that Ms. Steinle\u2019s death was an aberration that was unfairly turned into political fodder. They say the policies also protect undocumented immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding, but opponents counter that such immigrants should not be immune from deportation.\u201cThere is nothing more repugnant than the racist exploitation of tragedy and I think that people of California have a heightened sensitivity when that happens,\u201d said Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which pushed for the statewide legislation.\u201cThis has become more than an immigration and economic issue, it\u2019s become a cultural issue,\u201d Mr. Madrid said. \u201cThis happened in California, the place that has become the beating heart and center of the resistance. Everyone is going to get out their shovel and dig deeper.\u201dAt the time of the shooting, Mr. Garcia Zarate had a criminal record that included seven felony convictions, and he had been deported from the United States five times. He spent almost four years in a federal prison for illegally re-entering the country, then was sent to jail in San Francisco because of a warrant for a 20-year-old felony marijuana charge, which a local court dismissed almost immediately.Federal officials said they issued a request to be notified when he would be released from jail, noting that they had an order for deportation. But the sheriff who runs the jail said that the city\u2019s sanctuary ordinance meant that he could only respond to immigration authorities if they had a formal court order, which are rare with immigration charges. Mr. Garcia Zarate was released, and later that year, fired the gun that killed Ms. Steinle.During the trial, lawyers for both sides reminded jurors that they were there to decide a criminal case, not debate immigration issues. Defense attorneys argued that Mr. Garcia Zarate had found the gun on the pier and fired it accidentally, which created enough reasonable doubt in juror\u2019s minds against prosecutors\u2019 claims that he had intentionally killed Ms. Steinle. Mr. Garcia was acquitted of murder, manslaughter, and assault with a firearm, and was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.On Friday, federal officials moved to avoid a repeat of Mr. Garcia Zarate\u2019s release. They secured an arrest warrant accusing him of violating his supervised release from prison, which will allow them to take custody of him for possible prosecution and deportation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Susan Rice: When America No Longer Is a Global Force for Good", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy marks a dramatic departure from the plans of his Republican and Democratic predecessors, painting a dark, almost dystopian portrait of an \u201cextraordinarily dangerous\u201d world characterized by hostile states and lurking threats. There is scant mention of America\u2019s unrivaled political, military, technological and economic strength, or the opportunities to expand prosperity, freedom and security through principled leadership \u2014 the foundation of American foreign policy since World War II.In Mr. Trump\u2019s estimation, we live in a world where America wins only at others\u2019 expense. There is no common good, no international community, no universal values, only American values. America is no longer \u201ca global force for good,\u201d as in President Obama\u2019s last strategy, or a \u201cshining city on a hill,\u201d as in President Reagan\u2019s vision. The new strategy enshrines a zero-sum mentality: \u201cProtecting American interests requires that we compete continuously within and across these contests, which are being played out in regions around the world.\u201d This is the hallmark of Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalistic, black-and-white \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy.But the world is actually gray, and Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy struggles to draw nuanced distinctions. Throughout, China and Russia are conflated and equated as parallel adversaries. In fact, China is a competitor, not an avowed opponent, and has not illegally occupied its neighbors. Russia, as the strategy allows, aggressively opposes NATO, the European Union, Western values and American global leadership. It brazenly seized Georgian and Ukrainian territory and killed thousands of innocents to save a dictator in Syria. Russia is our adversary, yet Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its most hostile act: directly interfering in the 2016 presidential election to advantage Mr. Trump himself.On China and Russia, I suspect the White House realists, to escape the embarrassment of a strategy that ignored Russia\u2019s hostile behavior, agreed to lump China with Russia and almost always mention China first, to placate their nationalist colleagues who hate China but admire Russia. The result is a flawed analysis that may actually drive Russia and China closer together.In several respects, including nuclear weapons and arms control, weapons of mass destruction, counterterrorism, intelligence, cyberthreats, space policy, unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property, the strategy falls within the bipartisan mainstream of United States national security policy, differing little from that of a more traditional Republican president. In other areas, it helpfully corrects this administration\u2019s wavering course, as in its unequivocal embrace of United States allies and partners and reaffirmation of our Article V commitment to defend NATO. The strategy recognizes the threat from pandemics and biohazards and the importance of strengthening global health security. And it maintains at least a nominal commitment to women\u2019s empowerment and providing generous humanitarian assistance.But the nationalists around him succeeded in enshrining Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh anti-immigration policies, from the border wall to ending family preferences and limiting refugee admissions. They reprised their paean to bilateral over multi-nation trade agreements and trumpeted the abrogation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would help check China\u2019s economic and strategic expansionism in Asia. The result is an insular, ideological treatment of our complex world, substantially unimpaired by facts and dismissive of United States interests.The plan also glaringly omits many traditional American priorities. It fails to mention the words \u201chuman rights\u201d or \u201cextreme poverty\u201d; there is no talk of higher education, combating H.I.V.-AIDS or seeking a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Absent, too, is any discussion of people under 30 (who make up over 50 percent of the world\u2019s population), of civil society or of the value of promoting democracy and universal rights. Gone is \u201cclimate change\u201d and its threat to American national security. Neither is there any expression of concern for the rights of the oppressed, especially L.G.B.T. people. These omissions undercut global perceptions of American leadership; worse, they hinder our ability to rally the world to our cause when we blithely dismiss the aspirations of others.The plan also contains some true howlers. It heralds diplomacy, yet Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, have starved the State Department of resources, talent and relevance. The strategy lauds the \u201cfree press,\u201d yet Mr. Trump routinely trashes our most respected news outlets as \u201cfake news,\u201d threatening their personnel and operations. And it claims the United States \u201crejects bigotry and oppression and seeks a future built on our values as one American people\u201d; yet the president has denigrated women, used race-baiting language and been hesitant to criticize anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi extremists. One wonders how seriously to take a document that so starkly diverges from the president\u2019s own words and deeds.These contradictions matter, as does the administration\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of a self-serving, confrontational vision of the world. National security strategies do not always leave an enduring legacy, but they are important articulations of an administration\u2019s priorities \u2014 signposts to a world that cares deeply about America\u2019s ambitions and interests.The United States\u2019s strength has long rested not only on our unmatched military and economy, but also on the power of our ideals. Relinquishing the nation\u2019s moral authority in these difficult times will only embolden rivals and weaken ourselves. It will make a mockery of the very idea of America first.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Myanmar, Echoes of Past Horrors Are Amplified", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverPANTIN, France \u2014 The horrors of Myanmar\u2019s recent ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority Rohingya summon to memory the harrowing tales I grew up with of the persecution my Indian family faced there decades ago, when it was called Burma, and of their exodus from a land they called home. What they experienced, terrible enough, was less horrific than the campaign of mass rape, murder and arson inflicted on the Rohingya by Myanmar\u2019s military in recent months.But the goal was the same, to purge the country of people of an ethnicity considered foreign: drive them out, confiscate their assets and take their land.My father was born into a family of Indian merchants \u2014 Gujarati Jains, to be precise \u2014 in Rangoon, Burma, in 1930, when the British ran the show. He remembers the terrible rioting between Burmese and ethnic Indians in the 1930s and the nights when my grandfather didn\u2019t come home from his office and no one knew if it was because he had decided it was too dangerous to take the train to the suburbs, where he\u2019d moved the family for safety, or if he\u2019d been killed, as hundreds of Indians were.My young father and his family fled Burma after the Japanese bombed Rangoon in December 1941. The Japanese invasion prompted some 450,000 ethnic Indians to undertake a harrowing trek overland to India and safety. Between 50,000 and 100,000 perished on the way. After World War II, my grandfather and other Indians returned to try to recover their properties and businesses and start life anew. Burma became an independent country in 1948, and the hope was that the resentment many Burmese felt at the outsize role Indians had played in the country\u2019s economy under the British rule would fade.When my great-uncle, Mangalji Khara, returned to Burma in 1947, U Nu, who became Burma\u2019s first prime minister, told him: \u201cYou are a Burmese, born and raised here. Now do something for Burma.\u201dIt was not to be. In the heady period of nationalist fervor, the situation for Indians in Burma deteriorated sharply. \u201cWe never knew in the morning when we woke up what would happen that day,\u201d one relative told me. \u201cPeople were being denounced right and left. They could just come and take you away and take everything away from you. There was, what do you call it, \u2018summary justice.\u2019 \u201dYet, my grandfather persevered, still sending letters to my parents in the United States after my birth in 1957 on letterhead printed \u201cP. B. Kamdar & Co., 71 Mogul Street, Rangoon.\u201dAfter Gen. Ne Win seized power in a military coup in 1962, he moved to nationalize assets under what was called the \u201cBurmese Way to Socialism.\u201d A new exodus of Indians began, with all valuables confiscated at dockside as they boarded ships for India. By 1964, the government of India had identified some 300,000 Indian refugees from Burma. Many, including my grandfather, had lost everything.Yet, bad as it was, my family and other ethnic Indians never faced a military scorched-earth campaign to destroy their homes and obliterate every trace of their presence on Burmese soil, as the Rohingya have. When I visited Myanmar in 1997, I found the homes where they\u2019d lived and the offices where they\u2019d run their businesses quite intact. The women in my family never faced mass rape by Burmese soldiers, as Rohingya women have.And whatever they\u2019d suffered in Burma, my family had the education, the means and the connections to rebound in India.The Rohingya have no comparable prospects. To many in areas of Rakhine State from which they have been driven, the Rohingya never existed at all, and every trace of their past is being eliminated. Meanwhile, Bangladesh \u2014 a poor, populous country, where some 640,000 Rohingya have taken refuge since August \u2014 says their welcome is a temporary one.Myanmar is threatening to house returned Rohingya in \u201ctemporary shelters,\u201d an ominous threat given the squalid concentration camps where more than 100,000 Rohingya are already confined.This puts an added burden on the rest of the international community not to abandon the Rohingya to the unkind mercies of Myanmar\u2019s leadership, which in turn will condemn an entire people to unimaginable suffering.For the sake of the Rohingya and in the name of basic humanity, the United States and the European Union must keep the pressure on Myanmar and insist that any repatriation of Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh has the full backing of the United Nations to ensure their safe return to rebuilt homes and the restoration of their businesses and lands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Months After Storm, Puerto Rico Stares Down Another Blow: The Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is really a devastating blow for Puerto Rico, in our greatest time of need,\u201d Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 said on Friday.The tax bill\u2019s effect on Puerto Rico could have been worse: Had Republicans opted for the House version of the bill, American companies that import goods from their affiliates abroad would have been charged a 20 percent excise tax. That tax, intended to keep American profits from being shifted overseas, would have threatened much of Puerto Rico\u2019s pharmaceutical and medical industry. It ultimately did not make the compromise plan.Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million United States citizens, the tax code treats the island as both a foreign and domestic entity. American affiliates in Puerto Rico get tax breaks like the ones granted to foreign companies, while the goods they produce are sold as made in America.The tax on intellectual property, which includes patents and design rights, would make Puerto Rico less attractive for business, compared with foreign countries that offer lower tax rates for manufacturers, said Ram\u00f3n Ponte, president of the Puerto Rico C.P.A. society.\u201cA lot of companies are going to look at the numbers and decide that, under the circumstances, it\u2019s better to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is not Puerto Rico versus the mainland: It\u2019s really Puerto Rico versus its competitiveness with other foreign jurisdictions.\u201dIf Republicans want to protect American jobs, as President Trump has pledged, then Congress should consider Puerto Rico a domestic entity, said Mr. Rossell\u00f3, who spent last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, making one last push for support. The governor predicted the tax plan would renew debate on the island about its commonwealth status. A vote on the tax bill could come as early as Monday or Tuesday.Mr. Rossell\u00f3 accused Republican leaders \u2014 several of whom made highly publicized trips to Puerto Rico after Maria \u2014 of reneging on Congress\u2019s commitment to help the island regain its financial footing.\u201cCongress essentially turned its back on Puerto Rico, and essentially failed in its mission,\u201d said Mr. Rossell\u00f3, a member of the island\u2019s pro-statehood New Progressive Party who also identifies as a Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s just penalizing Puerto Rico. It\u2019s putting Puerto Rico in a worse-off position than it was yesterday.\u201d\u201cThe Task Force believes that Puerto Rico is too often relegated to an afterthought in congressional deliberations over federal business tax reform legislation,\u201d lawmakers wrote.Among the task force\u2019s recommendations that the final tax bill ignored: allowing lower-income Puerto Rican families with one or two children to qualify for an additional child-tax credit that currently kicks in only after a third child.Last month, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said lawmakers would address Puerto Rico\u2019s tax concerns in negotiations with the Senate.\u201cIt is our intention to make improvements to our tax reform legislation as it relates to Puerto Rico when we go to conference,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a Nov. 16 statement issued jointly with Representative Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico\u2019s nonvoting member of Congress.Now, however, it appears Puerto Rico\u2019s requests will have to wait until next year, when Congress could draft bills to extend tax credits or make technical corrections to the law. One of Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s suggestions, to create \u201copportunity zones\u201d offering tax incentives for manufacturing, remains a possibility, said Representative Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201cI think more can be done as well, but I think this is important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just absolutely committed to helping that island rebuild.\u201dPuerto Rico is sensitive to tax decisions made in Washington. In 1996, President Bill Clinton authorized the repeal of a 1976 provision that gave American companies significant tax incentives to establish their subsidiaries on the island. Those perks helped turn the island into a biotech manufacturing hub, but critics countered that most of the benefit went to wealthy investors, not local workers.Once the incentives were fully phased out in 2006, at a time when manufacturing was declining across the nation, Puerto Rico plunged into a recession that has lasted for more than a decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Regulators Agree on Rules to Prevent Financial Crises", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe world took a significant step toward averting future financial meltdowns Thursday, just as the United States under President Trump begins relaxing constraints on risky behavior by banks.The rules are the capstone of years of grindingly detailed work by the so-called Basel Committee. Known as Basel III, the rules require banks to reduce their dependence on borrowed money so they are less susceptible to losses from bad loans, market turmoil or other problems.\u201cIt\u2019s a great day,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference.But he acknowledged that the agreement was not perfect.\u201cThis is a compromise,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. The rules will make the banking system more resilient, he added, but \u201cnothing is crisis proof.\u201dThe negotiators were unable, for example, to reach agreement on a way to address one of the root causes of the government debt crisis that nearly destroyed the eurozone a few years ago.And agreement on the new rules is just an interim step. The countries that took part in the negotiations pledged to incorporate the rules into national legislation. Some, including the European Union, have a spotty record of doing so. In any case, the latest rules would not take effect until 2022.\u201cWe will be in better shape when this is implemented,\u201d said Stefan Ingves, who is chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and governor of Sveriges Riksbank, the Swedish central bank. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s in store for the future.\u201dAfter the 2008 crisis, the United States was ahead of Europe in forcing banks to improve their ability to absorb losses. United States banks may benefit because their European competitors will now be compelled to adhere to higher standards.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a big difference for U.S. banks,\u201d said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cIt makes a big difference for some European banks.\u201d He said, for example, that the rules would require European banks that specialized in mortgage lending to hold more capital.Mr. V\u00e9ron said the agreement \u201cshows that there is a piece of international regulatory cooperation that makes progress under Trump.\u201d\u201cThe global infrastructure for addressing common problems is not completely broken,\u201d he added.Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, said in a statement Thursday that the rules \u201cwill help level the playing field for U.S. firms and businesses operating internationally.\u201dOne of the main lessons of the last financial crisis was that many banks that appeared healthy on paper were acutely vulnerable to disruptions in the flow of money among financial institutions. That was what happened in the atmosphere of fear and mistrust that prevailed after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank in September 2008.Banks stopped lending to one another, the international financial system seized up, and many lenders quickly ran dangerously low on cash, requiring taxpayer bailouts to survive.The Basel III rules require banks to hold more capital \u2014 another way of saying that they must rely less on borrowed money, so that they can absorb losses without collapsing. The regulations also require banks to show they have enough liquid assets to survive a cash crunch.Most of those rules were negotiated years ago, and many have already gone into force.The last chapter in the negotiations, which concluded Thursday, revolved around the way that banks calculate the risks of different kinds of business. The riskier an asset, the more capital a bank is required to hold.The previous rules gave banks substantial discretion to determine, for example, how risky a commercial real estate loan, home mortgage or business loan might be and how much capital would be required. The compromise approved Thursday sets limits on banks\u2019 leeway without entirely eliminating it.But the negotiators were unable to agree on rules that would have reduced banks\u2019 vulnerability to their holdings of government bonds, a cause of the eurozone debt crisis.Many banks in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy hold large portfolios of their own government\u2019s debt. In 2010, severe declines in the value of Greek, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds threatened those countries\u2019 banks, creating a so-called doom loop.Wounded by the bond losses, the banks stopped lending to consumers and businesses. The economy tanked, government tax receipts plunged, and the government got into even more trouble.But most of the countries represented in the negotiations opposed rules that would have discouraged banks from investing in government debt and would have made it harder to finance public borrowing.\u201cAt this juncture, it was not possible to get to a consensus on this particular issue,\u201d Mr. Ingves said. \u201cThings stay the way they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Signing Sweeping Tax Bill, Trump Questions Whether He Is Getting Enough Credit", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump signed the most consequential tax legislation in three decades on Friday, even as he complained that he has not been given credit for his administration\u2019s accomplishments during a turbulent first year.Mr. Trump decided against doing a formal signing ceremony early next year because television news networks questioned whether he would keep his promise to sign the legislation before Christmas.Mr. Trump said he saw the coverage Friday morning and hastily called his staff to say that the legislation needed to be signed \u201cnow,\u201d prompting a last-minute Oval Office ceremony for the president\u2019s greatest achievement in his first year in office.\u201cWe did a rush job today,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the bill signing. \u201cIt\u2019s not fancy, but it\u2019s the Oval Office. It\u2019s the great Oval Office.\u201dIt marked another improvisational moment in a presidency already known for abandoning the norms of the office.The bill was the most significant legislative victory for Mr. Trump, who has struggled during his first year in office to pass major bills that would deliver on campaign promises, even with Republicans having the majority in both chambers of Congress. Republicans promise the new tax law will benefit the middle class, but Democrats have warned that the law could be harmful to many lower-income taxpayers and to the nation\u2019s fiscal health.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tremendous thing for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Before signing the legislation on Friday, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post that companies were celebrating the bill\u2019s passage with bonuses for workers.During the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump said, \u201cCorporations are literally going wild over this.\u201d A handful of companies, including AT&T, which is seeking government approval of a major acquisition of Time Warner, have announced that they would give bonuses to workers.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.There was some discussion in Congress and at the White House that Mr. Trump should consider delaying the signing until early 2018 as a way to delay automatic spending cuts that could have been triggered by the tax cuts. In addition, some companies said that delay would give them more time to adjust to the major changes that the new tax code will mean for their businesses.However, once Congress reached a deal this week to avoid the possibility of the spending cuts, White House officials signaled that Mr. Trump wanted to sign the bill into law as soon as possible.Mr. Trump often reacts to television news, and Friday was no different. The president delayed his travel to Florida for the holidays by an hour to stave off potential criticism.\u201cEvery one of the networks was saying, \u2018Will he keep his promise?\u2019 \u201d the president said.Earlier in the morning, the president suggested that he would not get credit for what he said were extraordinary accomplishments for a first year.Under the new tax law, individual rates will be lowered, but those cuts are set to expire in 2025. The standard deduction, which will almost double, is likely to become more popular. The tax credit for children will also double, which Republicans have said will benefit lower-income families. The largest cut by far in the new tax law \u2014 which will not expire \u2014 benefits corporations.The new law has been criticized by lawmakers representing states with high taxes, because the bill caps state and local tax deductions at $10,000.The law also eliminates the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that most people have health insurance or pay a penalty. Mr. Trump has said that amounted to repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, but 8.8 million Americans signed up for coverage, according to figures his administration announced on Thursday. The law is not repealed, but the mandate had been considered an important feature of it.Mr. Trump also signed a stopgap spending bill in order to avoid a government shutdown. In addition to extending government funding, the bill includes $4 billion for missile defense, among other provisions.Alan Rappeport, Michael D. Shear and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Jane Goodall, Mohsin Hamid, Oscar Murillo, James Dyson, Richard Dawkins, Kyung-sook Shin and Daniel Humm tell us.Jane GoodallThe world, as I know it, is ending. I close my eyes and again experience the wonder of the rain forest, the murmuring streams, the rustling leaves and the myriad sounds of animal life, chirping and singing and buzzing. Flashes of color; birds, butterflies, fish shining in the water. Monkeys feeding overhead. The smell of damp earth and flowers. Each species, no matter how small, playing its part in the rich tapestry of life. I move my mind\u2019s eyes to the wetlands, the mountains, the coral reefs, the golden prairies. The sun glittering on the Arctic ice. The pine trees of the cliffs I climbed as a child. In these few minutes the beauty of the world I once knew is real again.I open my eyes reluctantly. I am surrounded by land and water that is dead, polluted, plundered. The natural world destroyed. Our cities collapsed. Nature has hit back at we humans, who so greedily stole her riches, with hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires and earthquakes.But suddenly I realize that though the Earth may seem destroyed, it is alive in my mind. And I am aware of another kind of beauty: that of the indomitable human spirit. The lust for greed and power has destroyed the beauty we inherited, but altruism, compassion and love have not been destroyed. All that is beautiful in humanity has not been destroyed. The beauty of our planet is not dead but lying dormant, like the seeds of a dead tree. We shall have another chance.Jane Goodall is an ethologist, a conservationist and a United Nations Messenger of Peace. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977.Mohsin HamidEntities of the cosmos, greetings from the humans of Earth.Our world as we know it is coming to an end.Humans are a biological life-form. Our individual existence is characterized by impermanence. We live, and then we die. Our greatest achievement is that we are not entirely overwhelmed by our awareness of this predicament.We know we will die, yet we experience love and tenderness and wonder and joy. Our mortality forms the basis of our compassion. We know that every human, no matter how different we are from each other, will experience death, and this creates a sense of closeness.We were not less because we died. We were more. But the desire to live forever was strong in us. We gave birth to machines that we hoped would help us achieve this wish. We hoped to merge with these machines. Now, in our attempt to extinguish our mortality, we are on the verge of extinguishing ourselves.Farewell. May our example be of benefit to you.Mohsin Hamid is a Pakistani novelist. His latest book is \u201cExit West.\u201dOscar MurilloThe pursuit of new frontiers in the name of science and empire has almost always come at the expense of others. Early explorers, from the conquistador Cort\u00e9s to Captain Cook, voyaged across the globe for the sake of expansion and knowledge. However their aim was not to discover more about the world; it was to spread an already-formed worldview. Thus their path was littered with casualties \u2014 communities, countries, corpses.History is told by those with the loudest voices. And the voices of imperialism remain the loudest, even today. The astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission trained in the desert of the Western United States \u2014 formerly Native American land \u2014 in order to prepare themselves for the final frontier. According to an old joke, a native chief asked the astronauts if they could pass on a message to the holy spirits who live on the moon. The man spoke some words in his own language, and when the astronauts asked what the message meant, the chief told them it was a secret between his tribe and the moon spirits. But the astronauts managed to find someone who could translate the words.The message was: \u201cDon\u2019t believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your land.\u201dOscar Murillo is an artist based in London.James DysonThe way engineers tackle seemingly insoluble problems with ingenuity and grit is something to behold.Tomorrow is more exciting than today because of engineers. They drive all progress using their brains and hands. With intelligence and persistence, they show human resourcefulness at its best. They are the most genuine form of wealth creator an economy can hope for, and they are incredibly resourceful.Engineers don\u2019t always follow the rules; they approach challenges from new angles and with a na\u00efve intelligence in order to find the right solution. No challenge is too big.I therefore find it implausible that the world is coming to an end. Engineers will find a way to avoid this catastrophe!James Dyson is an inventor, designer and founder of the Dyson company.Richard DawkinsDear fellow cosmic citizens,If you have the technology to intercept this last testament from our doomed planet, chances are that you are far more advanced than us; you have probably been evolving for much longer and your codebreakers are capable enough to decipher my language.You will be aware that, like any other life-form, we evolved by gradual degrees from simple beginnings, through the nonrandom survival of digitally coded instructions. We called those instructions genes (doubtless yours differ in detail from ours). They survived mostly by building what we called bodies. Our life-form was driven by energy from our star (the \u201csun\u201d) and intercepted by static bodies called plants, using specialized photon collectors called leaves. The energy of plants was then stolen by mobile bodies called animals. Some animals, in turn, consumed other animals, and the energy was passed along in a \u201cfood chain.\u201d All used the same genetic code, a linear string of digital characters drawn from an alphabet of four. As you will easily calculate, this was sufficient to encode a huge diversity of forms, which was one of the stupendous glories of our tragic planet.Among the many millions of kinds of animals, our own, called humans, were distinguished by our large on-board computer (the \u201cbrain\u201d) which enabled us to make some progress toward understanding the universe and our origins. We were quite proud of understanding such things as evolution and the fact that matter comes in a finite set of \u201celements.\u201d While we made a start on what we called quantum theory, we found it bewildering, probably because our brains never evolved to understand the ultrasmall.We dreamed of a final Theory of Everything and a complete understanding of the origin of all things, including time. Perhaps you already have that. It is among our griefs that we perished before we could reach it.Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist and author. His most recent book is \u201cScience in the Soul: Selected Writings of a Passionate Rationalist.\u201dKyoung-Sook ShinI was happy to be able to live on this Earth as my mother\u2019s daughter. She taught me how to walk, how to put on clothes, how to speak my name. After I grew a bit older, she taught me that reading books is an important part of living in this world. Through her life itself, my mother taught me how to plant seeds, and that you reap what you sow, as well as how to console people when they are sad.When I was 22, I started writing novels in my mother tongue, a language filled with the essence of my mother. I wrote about everything that is born in our hearts and in this world, from sorrow and beauty to passion and love. With words, I strived to restore things that had disappeared. I also wrote about my mother, who gave me everything but whom I took for granted at times.Writing was my way of paying tribute to everything that was once alive on Earth and has since left. If I had raised a daughter, I would have taught her everything that I learned from my mother. I wish I could have.Kyung-sook Shin is a Korean novelist whose book \u201cPlease Look After Mom\u201d won the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2012, making her the first South Korean woman to do so.Daniel HummThe ultimate beauty of life on Earth can only be described in the context of personal relationships. Natural, true beauty is enhanced exponentially as a shared experience.As a chef, I am lucky enough to see this every single night in my restaurant: people from all walks of life, all ethnicities, all ages, all connecting deeply around a table. The human connection is significantly beautiful, and nothing showcases that more than our experiences in 2017.Through all of the disasters, both natural and man-made, there is one thing that proved to be more powerful than the devastation: that absolute, and most human, intention to look into each other\u2019s eyes \u2014 not at each other\u2019s skin color, political views, or religious or sexual preferences \u2014 and connect on a completely soulful level. To will someone else to triumph over adversity; to lift someone else up when they are at their lowest point; to connect with each other below the surface ... this is us at our most beautiful.Daniel Humm is a Swiss chef and co-owner of Eleven Madison Park in New York.Advertisement"}

Despite rapid strides among developing economies like China and India, which have been closing the income gap with the world\u2019s richer nations, growing inequality within almost every country will drive a further concentration of income around the globe.Nowhere has the distribution of the pie become more equitable. In China, 15 percent of the income growth since 1980 flowed to the richest 1 percent of Chinese while 13 percent flowed to the bottom half. Even in egalitarian, social-democratic Europe, 1-percenters got 18 percent of the growth in the period. The bottom half got 14 percent. And among the more unequal regions of the world \u2014 the United States, say, or Russia \u2014 income disparities are reaching levels not before seen in modern history: The bottom half of Americans captured only 3 percent of total growth since 1980. The income of the bottom half of Russians actually shrank.And yet, a careful examination of the data suggests there is nothing inevitable about untrammelled inequality. Take China and India, developing countries of billion-plus populations playing catch-up to pull themselves out of poverty. Incomes have become much more concentrated in both. But China\u2019s economic strategy has delivered much more growth at a lower cost in terms of economic disparity.

On the other end of the spectrum of development, China\u2019s strategy based on low-skill manufacturing for export, and underpinned by aggressive investment in infrastructure, has proven more effective at raising living standards for the bottom half of the population than India\u2019s more inward-looking strategy, which has limited the benefits of globalization to the well-educated elite.Share of national income35%BrazilMiddle East27.8%3026.4%25TOP 1PERCENT20151012.3%9.6%BOTTOM 50PERCENT5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u20191635%IndiaRussia3020.2%2521.7%201514.9%17.0%105\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Share of national income35%BrazilRussiaMiddle EastAfrica27.8%3020.2%26.4%25TOP 1PERCENT19.9%201517.0%12.1%1012.3%9.6%BOTTOM 50PERCENT5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Share of national income35%BrazilRussiaMiddle EastAfrica27.8%3026.4%25TOP 1PERCENT20.2%19.9%201517.0%12.3%12.1%10BOTTOM 50PERCENT9.6%5\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201916Where is global inequality going? Policy choices \u2014 about taxes and education, employment rules and finance regulations \u2014 will play a big role in shaping how countries around the world distribute the spoils of growth in the future. But the most powerful force driving the distribution of income on a worldwide scale will be raw economic growth: if economic catch-up by developing nations shrinks the income gap between rich and poor countries faster than inequality increases inside each country, the global disparity of income will narrow.The question is, how fast can developing countries grow in the future? The answer, unfortunately, is not fast enough. If China\u2019s furious economic growth over the last couple of decades was not enough to bring about a more equitable distribution of income on a global scale, it seems hard to imagine the kind of economic miracle that could shrink the worldwide income gap.Share of population within income groups in:1990100%90United Statesand CanadaAfrica8070Share of population60ChinaRussiaEurope5040MiddleEast30Other Asia20LatinAmericaIndia10011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Global income groupsHigher income(percentiles)Top 1 percent2016100%United Statesand Canada90Africa80LatinAmerica70Share of populationEurope60Russia50MiddleEast40China3020Other AsiaIndia10011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Global income groupsHigher income(percentiles)Top 1 percentShare of population within income groups in:1990100%100%9090AfricaUnited Statesand Canada80807070Share ofpopulation6060ChinaRussiaEurope50504040MiddleEast(Withineachglobalincomegroup)3030Other Asia2020LatinAmericaIndia10100011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentTop 1 percentGlobal income percentiles2016100%100%9090United Statesand CanadaAfrica8080LatinAmerica7070Share ofpopulation6060EuropeRussia5050MiddleEast4040China(Withineachglobalincomegroup)30302020IndiaOther Asia10100011020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentTop 1 percentGlobal income percentilesChina\u2019s economic miracle was an unprecedented feat: in one generation, an unproductive communist nation of farmers transformed itself into a manufacturing export colossus, a giant of capitalism. Since 1980, its share of the world\u2019s income has grown to 19 percent from 3 percent. Its income per person has grown almost 15 times as fast as that of the United States and Canada, and almost 19 times as fast as that of the European Union \u2014 to 90 percent of the world average, from 15 percent. Once at the bottom of the world\u2019s income distribution, Chinese are now much more broadly represented across the spectrum of the world\u2019s income.China\u2019s rising income was pretty much the only force pushing for a more equitable share of the spoils of growth, holding world inequality down even as the incomes of the world\u2019s biggest earners surged ahead and workers in the industrialized world mostly got stuck. And yet it wasn\u2019t enough.As China has become richer and its growth has slowed, its impact on how the world\u2019s income pie is sliced is likely to be mixed: Once the income of the average Chinese exceeds the world average, China's fast growth will start adding to inequality, rather than mitigating it. And it seems implausible that India and sub-Saharan Africa, today at the bottom of the world\u2019s income distribution, will experience anything in the coming three decades like what China experienced in the last three.+240%+220Income growth1980 to 2016+200+180Real income growthper adultby percentileworldwide+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.99Higher incomeBottom 50percent99.999Global incomepercentilesTop 1percent+240%Income growth1980 to 2016+220+200Real income growth per adultby percentile worldwide+180Top 1 percentcaptured 27 percentof total growthBottom 50 percentcaptured 12 percentof total growth+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentGlobal income percentilesTop 1 percent+240%+220Income growth1980 to 2016+200Real income growth per adultby percentile worldwide+180Top 1 percent captured27 percent of total growthBottom 50 percent captured12 percent of total growth+160+140+120+100+80+60+40+2001020304050607080909999.999.9999.999Higher incomeBottom 50 percentGlobal income percentilesTop 1 percentWill poor countries make sufficient progress relative to their rich peers to bring more balance to the distribution of global income? Or will rising inequality within countries dominate? It depends on three forces: countries\u2019 economic and population growth, as well as the evolution of inequality within them. The World Inequality Report takes a shot at projecting these forces, drawing from economic forecasts by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, population projections from the United Nations and the evolution of inequality in each country over 36 years.

One-percenters at the top, by contrast, will reap 24 percent of the global income pie, up from 21 percent in 2016.But again, policy matters. Say countries decide to push vigorously back against inequality \u2014 as vigorously as the European Union pushed in the 36 years after 1980. In that case, the world\u2019s income gap would even shrink a little: by 2050, the bottom half would get 13 percent of the pie; the share of the top 1 percent would shrink to 19 percent of the world\u2019s income.What we probably don\u2019t want the world to do is follow the trajectory of inequality in the United States. If it were to do that, by 2050 the few at the top of the pyramid would be drawing 28 percent of global income. The bottom half would get only about 6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Says It\u2019s Open for Business. Foreign Firms Find It\u2019s Not That Simple.", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.The reality on the ground was more complex.That message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\u201cChina\u2019s door will not close to the world but open wider,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.But the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.Others were more blunt in their assessments.\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201dNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup\u2019s $20 Billion Write-Down Would Be Just the Ticket", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsA $20 billion accounting loss can be a good thing, when the company in question is Citigroup. The lender\u2019s woes during the financial crisis a decade ago helped make \u201cwrite-down\u201d a household word. Now the $200 billion colossus may take another whopping great hit. But this time the potential loss, sparked by planned tax cuts, is actually pretty helpful.In theory, investors ought to be up in arms about Uncle Sam forcing such a big write-down on a private company. The potential loss that the chief financial officer John Gerspach laid out at a conference on Wednesday is a third more than Citigroup is expected to earn next year.As much as $17 billion of the write-down would stem from recalculating the value of so-called deferred tax assets, while the rest would come from repatriating overseas earnings. At the current 35 percent rate, Citigroup\u2019s stash of credits it can use against future tax bills is worth $43 billion, but at the 20 percent that lawmakers are now proposing, it would fall to just $26 billion.The pain would actually do the bank and its shareholders a favor. That\u2019s because Citigroup has used just $9 billion of its deferred tax assets since the end of 2010. The greater its earnings, the more tax it can claim back \u2014 but the problem is that Citigroup\u2019s North American operations account for less than half of its global total. This year the bank may only be able to use $1.5 billion of its balance-sheet goodies.Having Congress dissolve a large chunk of deferred tax assets would have two distinct advantages. It would lop $17 billion or so off Citigroup\u2019s common and tangible common equity \u2014 the denominators in the all-important return on equity numbers it reports to investors. That would have increased the annualized return in the first nine months of this year by around three-quarters of a percentage point in each of those reports, to 8 percent and 9 percent respectively.Citigroup would also still be able to keep its pledge to return up to $60 billion to shareholders by the end of 2020. That\u2019s because the amount banks are allowed to hand back is pegged to a third measure of capital: Tier 1 common equity. Some $27 billion of Citi\u2019s tax assets don\u2019t count toward that. So Gerspach reckons all but $4 billion of the write-down can be allocated to this disallowed portion, leaving the pot for shareholders virtually untouched.It\u2019s one time that Citigroup can cheer losing billions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Robots Take Our Children\u2019s Jobs?", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike a lot of children, my sons, Toby, 7, and Anton, 4, are obsessed with robots. In the children\u2019s books they devour at bedtime, happy, helpful robots pop up more often than even dragons or dinosaurs. The other day I asked Toby why children like robots so much.\u201cBecause they work for you,\u201d he said.What I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him is, someday he might work for them \u2014 or, I fear, might not work at all, because of them.You do not exactly need to be Marty McFly to see the obvious threats to our children\u2019s future careers.I know I am not the only parent wondering if I can robot-proof my children\u2019s careers. I figured I would start by asking my own what they want to do when they grow up.Toby, a people pleaser and born entertainer, is obsessed with cars and movies. He told me he wanted to be either an Uber driver or an actor. (He is too young to understand that those jobs are usually one and the same).My younger son Anton, a sweetheart, but tough as Kevlar, said he wanted to be a football player. Robot football may sound crazy, but come to think of it, a Monday night battle between the Dallas Cowdroids and Seattle Seabots may be the only solution to the sport\u2019s endless concussion problems.And again, all of this stuff is happening now, not 25 years from now. Who knows what the jobs marketplace might look like by then. We might not even be the smartest beings on the planet.Since Mr. Ford\u2019s book sent me down this rabbit hole in the first place, I reached out to him to see if he was concerned about all this for his own children: Tristan, 22, Colin, 17, and Elaine, 10.He said the most vulnerable jobs in the robot economy are those involving predictable, repetitive tasks, however much training they require. \u201cA lot of knowledge-based jobs are really routine \u2014 sitting in front of a computer and cranking out the same application over and over, whether it is a report or some kind of quantitative analysis,\u201d he said.Professions that rely on creative thinking enjoy some protection (Mr. Ford\u2019s older son is a graduate student studying biomedical engineering). So do jobs emphasizing empathy and interpersonal communication (his younger son wants to be a psychologist).\u201cIf you talk to the best Go players, even they can\u2019t explain what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cThey\u2019ll describe it as a \u2018feeling.\u2019 It\u2019s moving into the realm of intuition. And yet a computer was able to prove that it can beat anyone in the world.\u201dThe idea is all the rage among Silicon Valley elites, who not only understand technology\u2019s power, but who also love to believe that it will be used for good. In their vision of a post-A.I. world without traditional jobs, everyone will receive a minimum weekly or monthly stipend (welfare for all, basically).Computers, after all, are really good at some things and, for the moment, terrible at others. Even Anton intuits this. The other day I asked him if he thought robots were smarter or dumber than humans. \u201cSdumber,\u201d he said after a long pause. Confused, I pushed him. \u201cSmarter and dumber,\u201d he explained with a cheeky smile.He was joking. But he also happened to be right, according to Andrew McAfee, a management theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom I interviewed a short while later.Discussing another of Anton\u2019s career aspirations \u2014 songwriter \u2014 Dr. McAfee said that computers were already smart enough to come up with a better melody than a lot of humans. \u201cThe things our ears find pleasant, we know the rules for that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m going to be really surprised when there is a digital lyricist out there, somebody who can put words to that music that will actually resonate with people and make them think something about the human condition.\u201dNot everyone, of course, is cut out to be a cyborg-Springsteen. I asked Dr. McAfee what other jobs may exist a decade from now.\u201cI think health coaches are going to be a big industry of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cRestaurants that have a very good hospitality staff are not about to go away, even though we have more options to order via tablet.\u201cPeople who are interested in working with their hands, they\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe robot plumber is a long, long way away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In It\u2019s No Secret, a new feature, The Times highlights couples who share thoughts about commitment and what they have learned about themselves and each other along the way.The couple married Sept. 10, 1966 in the garden of Mrs. Roberts\u2019 family home in Bethesda, Md., where the couple still live today. \u201cWe had a Jewish Catholic marriage and had to overcome some hurdles,\u201d Mrs. Roberts said. \u201cSo we married in my backyard instead in a house of worship.\u201d She said that 1,500 people attended (and her mother cooked the entire meal for all the guests). They have two married children in their mid- to late 40s and six grandchildren.In the summer of 1962, Ohio State University hosted the National Student Association, where 500-plus students were part of a weeklong political conference. Cokie Boggs and Steven Roberts were among them; she was at Wellesley, he at Harvard. \u201cI saw him from across the campus and thought, \u2018That looks like Mark Roberts,\u2019 who I knew had a twin brother,\u201d said Mrs. Roberts, a New Orleans-born writer, who is a political commentator for ABC News and National Public Radio. \u201cI went over to say hi. It turned out he knew my sister, Barbara. We started talking and we clicked.\u201d Mrs. Roberts spoke at the conference, on what she couldn\u2019t recall, \u2018But that impressed him because it was highly unusual for women to speak,\u201d she said. After the summit, they went back to their respective schools. They had a few dates, then Mr. Roberts stopped calling, \u201cIn the manner of obnoxious boys,\u201d she said. That spring, both went to Washington to attend another conference, this one organized by her sister. Mr. Roberts ended up staying at her family\u2019s home. Then they began dating. Four years went by, no ring was offered. Mrs. Roberts, then 22 and tired of waiting, gave him an ultimatum. \u201cI said if we didn\u2019t get married I was moving to California. So he proposed. He didn\u2019t want to lose me,\u201d she said. Fifty-one years later, they\u2019ve never lost sight of each other.The key in marriage is to try to change together. Couples don\u2019t have to change at the same time, it\u2019s more a question of getting there if you want to have that connection and commitment. There are different paces, and you have to realize that, and accommodate each other.Then there\u2019s resiliency. I always had two jobs and was raising a family. You\u2019re so frantic and stressed, all you can do is get through the day. Once Steve said to me, \u201cI feel as though I\u2019m on your list of something to check off.\u201d Ouch.I wasn\u2019t always able to appreciate him; and he, me. We\u2019ve learned to do that more now that we\u2019re old. We also had the advantage of having the same job. We would both be at the Capitol covering stories, then drive home together and get rid of that whole conversation in the car that married people have, so when we got home we were available to our children. We understand what we have is really important. We were crazy nuts about each other. We still are.In a healthy relationship, at the core of longevity is a mutual respect and a sense of equality. Biting your tongue is often the right reaction to a moment of passing anger. Candor is overrated. I don\u2019t mean deception or secrets. I mean real mutual respect, which leads to being gentle, loving, cautious and careful at times. It leads to being silent and having self-restraint, which really helps get you through difficult moments. There\u2019s understanding that if you say everything that comes to your mind, at every moment, in the name of being honest, is often self-indulgent and hurtful. Mutual respect is a combination of many ingredients. It starts with basic romantic attraction.It\u2019s admiration that grows over time. In a really good marriage you learn from each other. You see each other\u2019s strengths and virtues and when it really works, you adopt them as your own. I\u2019ve learned to embrace the traditionalist that I am. I learned I had a greater capacity for defining myself in terms of serving others as opposed to my own ego and accomplishments. That was from marriage because everyday it involves defining yourselves as part of a partnership.One of the great joys of a long marriage is what you\u2019ve meant to each other, and held each other up, and been at each other\u2019s side.Advertisement"}

He ferried someone home, then delivered an order of KFC. Around 4 a.m., he picked up a clubgoer so wobbly with drink that Mr. Irawan had to use one hand to steer and the other to keep the woman from falling off the back of his motorbike.The two men work for Go-Jek, a $3 billion Indonesian start-up whose maximalist approach to the ride-hailing business has put rivals like Uber on notice, and gotten the attention of American investors and Chinese internet titans alike.The company\u2019s main app lets you summon a car or motorbike driver who could just give you a lift, sure \u2014 but who could also bring you takeout, shop for groceries or deliver a present to someone across town.With another Go-Jek app, Go-Life, you can hail someone to come cut your hair, give you a massage, clean your bathroom or change your car\u2019s oil. And with the money you keep in Go-Jek\u2019s digital wallet, you can pay your electricity bill, buy mobile data and book movie tickets \u2014 all within the app.Go-Jek, which started its main app in 2015 and is in only Indonesia at the moment, is counting on people coming back to its services again and again as it competes against both Uber and Grab, a Singapore-based ride-hailing company operating in seven Southeast Asian countries.\u201cWe have huge respect for Uber as a technology company,\u201d said Nadiem Makarim, Go-Jek\u2019s 33-year-old founder and chief executive. \u201cBut we just out-innovate them. We just move that much faster.\u201dChina\u2019s biggest tech companies, spying opportunity in the region, have contributed to those challenges.\u201cWe all looked to China\u201d to learn to develop e-commerce, said Nick Nash, Sea\u2019s president. \u201cThe playbook was clear.\u201dIt is no accident that Jakarta has attracted so many companies that help people get around \u2014 or that help them avoid having to get around in the first place.\u201cIn Southeast Asia, there\u2019s little public transport, many dense cities and low car ownership,\u201d said Ming Maa, Grab\u2019s president. \u201cIt makes ride-sharing a much more compelling product than in India or even, frankly, China.\u201dBefore ride-hailing apps came along, motorcycle taxis, or \u201cojek\u201d in Indonesian, plied Jakarta\u2019s clogged streets. But getting a good price required haggling. And safety was a concern, particularly for women.Go-Jek is a \u201clifesaver,\u201d said Hera Diani, a magazine editor in Jakarta. She orders food on the app, and booked a pedicure through Go-Life when she was pregnant and couldn\u2019t walk easily. \u201cThe traffic jams are getting worse and worse,\u201d she said.It is unproven, though, that people will stick with a payment app just because they use it for rides. China\u2019s dominant mobile payment services, AliPay and WeChat Pay, grew big because they could easily be used to buy stuff online and transfer money to friends, respectively.\u201cTransport is a very, very large marketplace \u2014 I would argue, larger than e-commerce,\u201d said Mr. Maa of Grab. \u201cWe think that creates the right ground for an amazing payments company.\u201dGrab and Go-Jek\u2019s breakneck growth has set off many of the frictions with regulators and drivers that Uber has encountered in wealthier countries. But one reason ride-hailing has expanded so rapidly in Southeast Asia is that the region has had a gig economy long before anyone called it that. In countries like Indonesia, work for many people has never been anything but grueling and unregulated.Several Go-Jek and Grab drivers in Jakarta described driving both before and after a full day\u2019s work in a factory or warehouse. Others said they saw their children only between the end of a night shift and the start of the school day. Some said they drove seven days a week.Their earnings can be inconsistent, too. The ride-hailing companies have repeatedly slashed fares in Indonesia to defend market share. At a recent protest in Jakarta, hundreds of drivers demanded a government-mandated price floor for motorbike rides.Mr. Makarim said that he supported a minimum fare, but that Go-Jek wouldn\u2019t be able to employ as many people as it does \u2014 900,000 registered car and motorbike drivers \u2014 without \u201cflexibility\u201d around labor standards. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the formal economy simply cannot contain that number of people,\u201d he said.Still, many drivers in Jakarta described their work as a step up from what they were doing before. Mr. Nasrun \u2014 who, like many Indonesians, uses a single name \u2014 used to clean rooms at a hotel. Mr. Irawan parked cars at a nightclub.Maharani, 29, was a stay-at-home mother. She now makes around $200 a month driving for Go-Jek.That is less than the average income nationwide. But \u201cit\u2019s the freedom of the job that I really like,\u201d she said on a recent evening, sipping iced coffee and waiting near a mall for orders. \u201cI don\u2019t have a boss behind me always watching what I do.\u201dBeing a female driver in Jakarta isn\u2019t easy. Sometimes, customers see her name, then cancel their orders. Others ask whether they can drive her motorbike while she sits in the back.Suddenly, Ms. Maharani\u2019s smartphone sounded. Someone at the mall wanted a ride. She slipped her helmet over her black head scarf, fired up her motorbike and joined the dense swarm of vehicles advancing into the fading daylight.Muktita Suhartono contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Help Assad or Leave Cities in Ruins? The Politics of Rebuilding Syria", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOMS, Syria \u2014 This city\u2019s last rebel stronghold, once a well-to-do neighborhood in Homs of wide streets and high-rise apartments, is today a ghost of its former self.After a siege by Syrian government forces that lasted three and a half years, only a fraction of the population remains in the area, known as Al Waer. Its high rises, bombed and shelled, look as though they had been punched by giants. Its streets are piled with burned-out cars and television sets, and its biggest hospital is so wrecked that barely two of the 10 floors are usable. Its oxygen tank is punctured.If Al Waer, reclaimed by the government this past spring, symbolizes President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s ruthless triumph, it also embodies a looming challenge as the war approaches an end: the politics of reconstruction.That challenge is as acute for Mr. Assad as it is for his Western critics. Can they afford to pour money into a regime that has starved, bombed and occasionally gassed its own people? Or, having failed to topple Mr. Assad, who \u2014 with help from Russia and Iran \u2014 has reclaimed much of the territory he lost over nearly seven years of war, can the West abandon the people of Syria to live in the ruins?\u201cHow to better help the Syrian populations in need without consolidating Assad\u2019s power is a difficult equation, but it is the narrow path we must find,\u201d said the French ambassador to the United Nations, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre.Western governments have a big stake in the outcome. Any hope of reversing the flow of refugees \u2014 a source of anxiety for many European politicians \u2014 rests partly on their ability to put Syria back together. Reconstruction contracts also could be lucrative for Western companies.The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has said rebuilding Syria will cost at least $250 billion.In Al Waer, one of the latest places to be reclaimed by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces, insurgent fighters were offered a deal to either surrender or leave, with their families, to rebel-held enclaves much farther north. Tens of thousands of people streamed out from March through May. As few as 30,000 remain, according to government authorities, holding onto apartments where windows have been blown out and roofs are crumbling.I visited Al Waer in early November, accompanied by a government escort and a local military official.In parts of Aleppo, the country\u2019s second largest city, retaken by government forces a year ago, the municipal water supply is still broken, requiring the International Committee of the Red Cross to truck in water, an expensive process. The historic city center of Homs, which rebels gave up in 2014 after a crippling siege, is still an impassable maze of rubble.For Mr. Assad, the siege strategy has proved the most effective way to wrest cities and neighborhoods from enemies by basically starving civilians living under their control, and even as the war winds down, he still uses it, often with dire humanitarian consequences.The European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, has called reconstruction aid the last bit of leverage the West has over the political future of Syria, though what influence the West now has over Mr. Assad\u2019s fate is uncertain at best. The political talks in Geneva this past week did not even include the subject of Mr. Assad\u2019s fate.\u201cWe are now ready to move to a next step,\u201d Ms. Mogherini said in an email, expressing support for the idea of rebuilding Syria in the future. But she also said Western nations must make clear that their participation \u201cwill start only when the political transition will be agreed on in Geneva.\u201dMr. Assad\u2019s government, for its part, is eager to note that the goal posts of those political talks have moved away from what had been a central objective of the opposition: his exit from power.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved from the idea of replacing one team with another to a partnership concept to produce a new political structure,\u201d Ali Haider, the minister for reconciliation, said in an interview in Damascus.Nonetheless, he suggested, the government has enjoyed only a partial victory.\u201cOn the battlefield we are in a better situation,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitically we are in a real fight.\u201dIn Homs, Syria\u2019s third-largest city, reminders of Mr. Assad\u2019s military triumph are everywhere, including at the entrance of a hotel that serves as the United Nations base. A giant billboard in its parking lot features a photo of Mr. Assad, smiling. \u201cHand in hand, we will rebuild,\u201d the caption reads.The siege of Al Waer was one of the longest in the country. During its toughest months, families burned their sofas to keep warm in winter.Electricity stopped for hours, or days. The bread lines were so long, Al Waer residents recalled, that people fought one another to get enough for their families. In the twisted siege economy, the price of milk became so exorbitant that malnourished children began trickling in to the charity-run hospital, Al Birr, which still barely functioned. Medical supplies were so scarce that an enterprising nurse at Al Birr stashed away the basics, like bandages and scissors to cut gauze.In the worst weeks, the staff helped women deliver their babies in the basement, the place safest from airstrikes. They used cellphones as flashlights, to save the generator for more complicated procedures.On a recent afternoon, Abdulilah Barze, 11, sat on his bicycle, crunching loudly on sunflower seeds and recalling a deafening bomb that killed a friend and left him unable to hear for a few days. His friend, Sara, recalled hiding in a bathroom every time she heard mortar fire. His sister, Iman, 14, recalled another bombing that killed her uncle as he waited on a street corner for his daughter to come home from school.Riyadh Hassan Kenan, owner of a ground-floor apartment, walked through the debris of what remained of his home, with wires and pieces of exploded artillery crunching under his shoes. All around was rubble. Part of his house seemed to have been used as a weapons depot.The foreman of the construction team clearing the rubble, Hassane Hilal, picked up pieces of a homemade bomb. He led me through tunnels that had been dug underneath the high rises.Battered water containers were strewn everywhere, used by armed factions to construct defensive positions. One nondescript apartment building distinguished itself from the others with a pile of sandbags on the ground floor. It had been used as a detention center by the Nusra Front, the Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria, when it held a patch of Al Waer.The siege ended with a stark deal offered to survivors, including anti-government fighters: Surrender to government rule, or board government buses to a rebel-held enclave farther north. Tens of thousands of people took the buses, streaming to areas near the Turkish border, where, as it turned out, conditions were sometimes even worse.I met a widowed mother of three who had stayed throughout the siege. As soon as it lifted, though, her 21-year-old son left for an opposition-held town near the Turkish border. He feared arrest if he stayed, she said.The woman, who did not want her name to be published for the sake of her family\u2019s security, looked down and ran her fingers through her prayer beads. \u201cHe is about to lose his future,\u201d she said. Eventually, she said, she would have to leave her home and join him.She was reluctant to speak further. A government escort was with us during the interview.A corner of her apartment building\u2019s roof was still broken, from the time a shell hit the building, killing an upstairs neighbor standing on the balcony, trying to get a cellphone signal.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Homs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Vietnamese Designer Tweaks Traditional Fabric Production", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 In 2010, the fashion designer Vu Thao asked her suppliers in a remote corner of northern Vietnam to alter their traditional indigo-dying technique. They were skeptical.She wanted them to stir the vats during the process, a break with village practice. And, sure enough, it appeared to bring the normal chemical reaction to a halt.\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d one supplier said.But the finished cotton fabric had a cloudy, teal-colored look, recalled Ms. Thao, who is Vietnamese, and her suppliers from the Nung An ethnic group eventually saw her request as a design innovation. They now call that fabric \u201cdead indigo,\u201d and the story of the first batch still makes them chuckle.\u201cTo me, that\u2019s how you evolve the techniques and keep them going,\u201d Ms. Thao said during an interview at her home studio in Hanoi, the country\u2019s capital, nearly 200 miles south of the village. \u201cIt excites the artisans as well: They\u2019re seeing their tradition in a totally different way.\u201d\u201cSometimes I think it shouldn\u2019t even be sold, you know?\u201d Ms. Deertz added with a laugh. \u201cYou should apply for it.\u201dMany of Vietnam\u2019s ethnic minority groups live in the country\u2019s mountainous hinterlands, and some are known for producing colorful fabrics using small-batch, nonindustrial techniques.All of Kilomet109\u2019s dyeing, weaving, batik drawing and calendering (a finishing process) is done by nearly three dozen women artisans in four separate ethnic-minority communities across northern Vietnam, and much of the work is surprisingly labor-intensive. Nung An artisans, for example, typically dip a single batch of cotton fabric in indigo dye twice a day over a period of about two months.The changes improve overall quality and give her more control of the design process, Ms. Thao said, even as they increase operating costs and require her to spend several weeks a year in her suppliers\u2019 villages.\u201cYou just have to be patient and build trust,\u201d she said.The finished fabric was later cut into cropped bomber jackets whose shimmering surfaces vaguely resembled patent leather, but with an indigo undertone.Nguyen Phuong Thao, who runs the council\u2019s arts and creative industries program in Vietnam, said Kilomet109 designs would not appeal to most mainstream Vietnamese celebrities or style setters, but its business model is a pioneering one in a craft sector that generally is associated with disadvantaged communities and often viewed merely as a source of low-end products. \u201cThe way she blends it with the contemporary style is beautiful,\u201d she said.Compared with many other Vietnam-based fashion brands, Ms. Thao has a more reciprocal relationship with her suppliers and spends more time researching her materials and the traditions behind them, said Marta Gasparin, a design and management lecturer at the University of Leicester in Britain who studies the intersection of creativity and innovation in Vietnam.\u201cShe has all the capacities to grow, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s driven by growth or competitive advantage or making a profit,\u201d Ms. Gasparin said. \u201cShe\u2019s really driven by passions.\u201dKilomet109 is named for the distance in kilometers between Hanoi and the village in Thai Binh province where Ms. Thao grew up during Vietnam\u2019s rocky postwar transition to a market economy. Her parents gave her a sewing machine for her 17th birthday, she said, but she did not initially consider fashion design as a career. \u201cIt was either become a teacher or an army officer,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what society respected.\u201dBut as a college student in Hanoi, she made clothes for Vietnamese expatriates in the Czech Republic, where her older sister had moved. She later went to design school in the capital, covered culture as a freelance writer for Vietnamese lifestyle magazines, and worked for two European designers, Ms. Deertz of Germany and Victoria Roe of Britain, both of whom were living in Hanoi at the time.In 2009, Ms. Thao met artisans from the Nung An ethnic group and placed her first order for indigo-dyed cotton, which mothers in that community typically give to their daughters as wedding gifts.The fabric was not as flashy or colorful as that made by other ethnic-minority groups in Vietnam, she said, but she loved its understated complexity.When Ms. Thao founded Kilomet109 in 2012, she said, the idea was to merge what she had learned about so-called ethical fashion in design school with an appreciation for the ethnic-minority traditions she had explored as a journalist.\u201cIt motivated me to see the whole circle of the fiber,\u201d she said.Right now Ms. Thao produces 750 to 1,000 men\u2019s and women\u2019s pieces per year, for retail prices that typically range from $100 to $500. The label has primarily grown through word of mouth, social media and what she calls \u201csoirees\u201d and trunk shows for friends and prospective clients in Hanoi, Washington and New York. (Full disclosure: I previously bought an indigo blazer and a yam root-dyed dress shirt.)Yet Ms. Thao has no immediate plans to produce more than about 2,000 pieces per year, she added, and still prefers to meet prospective clients in person and describe her process. \u201cTo make people willing to pay this much,\u201d she said, \u201dyou have to make people understand the value of the making.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Town Fights to Turn Retail Tide at a Little Mall That Might", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMASSENA, N.Y. \u2014 When the Payless ShoeSource at the St. Lawrence Center closed this spring, it could have been just another statistic in a grim year for retailers, one more struggling shop gone in a dilapidated mall.For Erica Leonard, the mall\u2019s manager, it was a call to action. Frustrated by a wave of store closings and suggestions from discouraged shoppers that they \u201cjust burn the place down,\u201d Ms. Leonard went on the local radio station to urge listeners to stop the \u201cnegativity\u201d and to start shopping there again.She turned over vacant storefronts to local merchants who sell bourbon maple syrup and wood sculptures carved with chain saws. Near the mostly empty food court, a local Mohawk tribe member opened a specialty popcorn stand. And in the space that used to house a Sears store, residents of the area created a \u201cwinter wonderland\u201d \u2014 an elfin village fashioned from discarded cardboard boxes that once held refrigerators.\u201cWe are not going to sit and wallow,\u201d said Karen St. Hilaire, who helped open the store selling locally made goods. \u201cWe need to figure out a better future. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t happen.\u201dThe decline of shopping malls and brick-and-mortar stores is well documented, reflecting the ascension of e-commerce and changes in how Americans shop. Nearly 7,000 stores closed in 2017, the most ever in a calendar year, according to the research firm Fung Global Retail & Technology.Malls seeking a second act by shaking up their mix of stores or adding entertainment options face an uphill battle because their appeal for many shoppers may have worn off for good.But the campaign to revive St. Lawrence Center highlights a more emotional, even psychological challenge confronting American towns upended by a shifting economy. In many places, the desolate halls and tired window displays at the local mall are a wrenching reminder of what once was, and may never be again.For generations, Massena was a manufacturing stronghold in an improbable place, far from interstate highways, on the north side of the Adirondack Mountains. Hydroelectric power from the St. Lawrence River attracted the aluminum giant Alcoa to operate several plants here.It was in those better times, in the 1990s, that St. Lawrence Center opened. The only mall in St. Lawrence County \u2014 an area larger than Delaware \u2014 it was the place to be on frigid nights, and there are plenty of those in Massena. The food court was packed with teenagers, people watchers and families having Friday night dinners. Children rode on a carousel near the entrance.And Canadians came across the border for bargains. Ron Cook, 60, remembers the parking lot being littered with old shoes that Canadians had left behind so they could wear their new sneakers back across the border and avoid customs.Mr. Cook, who lives on the nearby Mohawk tribal reservation, spent many hours watching his daughters play hockey at the mall\u2019s ice rink, which is now closed.Today, fewer than half of the 84 storefronts are occupied. The sole remaining restaurant in the dimly lit food court is a Wendy\u2019s.Massena has struggled alongside its mall. Alcoa operates only one smelting plant now.\u201cYou try to be as positive as you can,\u201d said Liza Akey, 42, who works in a hair salon at the mall. \u201cBut you start to lose hope.\u201dWhere many residents see sadness, Ms. Leonard, the mall manager, sees great potential.\u201cPeople would come up to me and say this place will never be anything, just like Massena,\u201d she said. \u201cI just stopped listening to them.\u201dThis year, a group of Canadian real estate developers bought the mall and made some basic improvements: new lighting in the hallways, patches to the leaky roof, cleaning supplies for the janitors.After being hired in April, Ms. Leonard set out to get control of the place. She said she had confronted a pimp who appeared to have brought \u201chis girls\u201d to the nail salon, and told a pack of teenagers who she believed were dealing drugs that she would have them arrested.The harder task was filling up the empty storefronts and giving residents a reason to return.An Amish farmer delivers handmade fly swatters and other goods to the store by bus since he does not drive a car. The store writes him a letter if they sell out and need him to make more because he does not use a phone.\u201cQuite frankly, I am tired of our future being controlled by corporations that live in other places, whether it is Alcoa or these corporate stores,\u201d said Ms. St. Hilaire, president of North Country Showcase.Holiday sales at the store have been twice what Ms. St. Hilaire expected. One customer bought a life-size wooden statue of a firefighter, paying for it with $700 in dollar bills she had saved in a plastic shopping bag.At the stand selling homemade popcorn, Melissa Conners said she gets calls from parents asking about their children\u2019s favorite flavor because they want a surprise to slip into Christmas stockings.\u201cYou can\u2019t get that from shopping online,\u201d said Ms. Conners, whose business card identifies her as a \u201cpopcornologist.\u201dLenny Nesbit and his partner, Jason Foster, run an event-planning business, Elite Events by Lenny, at St. Lawrence Center. They got a break on their rent for arranging the mall\u2019s Christmas decorations. They are also raising a 7-year old son, who likes to spend time in the mall\u2019s hair salon watching women get their hair washed while his fathers work nearby.\u201cThis is our home,\u201d said Mr. Nesbit, who came up with the idea for the winter wonderland at the former Sears site.Ms. Leonard tries to focus on the victories, however small. This month, hundreds of people came to see Santa Claus pulled through the mall on a gigantic sleigh, while a Girl Scout troop walked in front of him.Ms. Leonard remembers seeing a line of people buying lunch that day at Wendy\u2019s, and the tables in the food court were filled.\u201cIt was how it used to look,\u201d she said.Michael Corkery reported from Massena, and David Gelles from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K.\u2019s Next Brexit Agony: What Sort of Trade Deal?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are those in Britain who want their country to break free, cutting taxes and regulation and transforming itself into a European version of Singapore. And there are some who cannot make up their minds, musing on a \u201cCanapore\u201d option, a hybrid of the Canada and Singapore models.The stakes are high because almost all experts predict that Britain\u2019s departure, known as Brexit, will hurt the British economy more than staying would.Britain\u2019s trade future could be dominated by \u201ccustoms checks, different regulations, different standards and trade falling off a cliff,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London, adding that economic arrangements would most likely descend into a \u201cnightmare.\u201dEven some who think a reasonable outcome is possible say a moment of truth is approaching. Britain will have to decide whether to sever many or most ties with the European Union \u2014 and face a brutal economic adjustment \u2014 or settle for a less advantageous version of what it currently has.\u201cMore and more, you find that the question is what kind of country you want to be,\u201d said Mats Persson, head of international trade at the advisory firm EY.\u201cDo you want to go down the route of Norway, with high tax and high social protection, and close alignment to European Union rules, or Hong Kong, with free trade and lower regulation?\u201d Mr. Persson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the essential choice, and there isn\u2019t a democratic mandate for either.\u201dThe issue is so divisive within the Conservative government, however, that there are signs they will fudge the issue for a few more weeks by uniting around a request for an outcome that is almost certainly unachievable \u2014 a \u201cCanada plus plus plus\u201d deal.Under the \u201cCanada plus plus plus\u201d deal proffered by Britain\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Davis, the country would negotiate a free-trade agreement with the European Union, but with a much deeper set of agreements than Canada has.That implies keeping close ties with the bloc but rejecting two of its pillars \u2014 the free movement of workers and the role of the European Court of Justice in adjudicating disputes. In this, experts say, Britain is once again barking up the wrong tree, in that European negotiators would never agree to such a deal because it would, in effect, reward Britain for leaving the bloc.\u201cThe European Union is going to make it ever clearer there is a binary choice between Norway and Canada,\u201d Mr. Menon said, \u201cand that, in the case of Canada, you can forget the \u2018plus plus plus.\u2019\u201dEven agreements on nontrade issues, like data protection rules and security cooperation, might run into trouble because of Britain\u2019s rejection of the European Court of Justice as an adjudicator, Mr. Menon said.Striking a tariff-free deal for trade in goods should be possible, but as Britain intends to quit the customs union, it would inevitably lead to more paperwork and checks.Free-trade agreements rarely cover services, and Canada\u2019s deal with the European Union, for example, which supplements Canadian membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement, gives very little in this sector.To achieve anything like the kind of access to European Union markets it currently enjoys, Britain might have to make a yearly financial contribution to the bloc and, as the smaller partner, would have to sign up to its rules. And if it leaves in March 2019 as scheduled, Britain would no longer play a part in setting those decisions.Mr. Persson, of EY, said Britain could achieve something \u201cshort of single market membership but more than South Korea and Canada,\u201d with some services access included. This could be done if both sides recognized the other\u2019s regulatory systems.Other agreements could cover airlines\u2019 rights to operate, the regulation of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, cross-border broadcasting rules and guidelines for the energy sector and nuclear safety.It all depends what Britain will give up. \u201cThe more Britain is willing to become a rule taker,\u201d Mr. Persson said, \u201cthe greater the prospects of grandfathering the measures provided by being part of the single market.\u201dBut tying itself to European rules means that Britain\u2019s freedom to strike deals around the globe would be seriously limited, destroying the hopes of Canapore enthusiasts.Mr. Menon says the need to keep them on board may lead Britain to a deal that is \u201cnot very good.\u201dMr. Persson is more optimistic, though he acknowledges that curbs on European workers, and an inevitable reintroduction of some customs controls, would cause the British economy to take a hit.And difficult choices lie ahead as Britain stares at the global economic map and tries to decide where to place itself.\u201cIn some sectors, you have to choose between the European Union and the rest of the world, for example in chemicals,\u201d Mr. Persson said. \u201cIn other sectors it is more nuanced, it\u2019s a sliding scale.\u201d\u201cBritain has to decide where, on that sliding scale, it wants to land,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

But a few simple rules of thumb can help.Partly it\u2019s the nature of the work. These statistics are generated according to strict rules that leave no room for political judgment. Because the numbers reflect the work of dozens of people, it would take a breathtakingly complex conspiracy to change them.Even then, fudging the numbers would be difficult, because the best statistical agencies show their work. If the fix were in, it would be easy to find.Because the state of the economy usually evolves slowly, and its effect is seen across a range of indicators, a good rule is to discount any narrative built on the latest monthly number. Far better to look for persistent trends across many data sources.Many economic debates center on the consequences of new policies, like repealing Obamacare, rewriting the tax code or changing priorities for spending.A typical C.B.O. \u201cscore\u201d is based on a combination of judgment and mathematical models that embody the consensus views among the broader community of economists. The Congressional Budget Office may not get the right answer, but its analysis is honest and required by law to be transparent.The chief critic of the Congressional Budget Office is Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director. This tension is understandable because the office was established in 1974 to serve as an independent counter to the politically inflected analyses coming from the White House and, in particular, the Office of Management and Budget, which Mr. Mulvaney now heads.The idea that political actors color their economic analyses to favor preferred policies is hardly new. But the tendency may be getting much worse. Larry Summers, a Harvard professor who served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, recently said of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s claims: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of so irresponsible an estimate coming from a Treasury secretary in the last 50 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Casualties of the Cashless Society: Those Who Get Seasonal Tips", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotedAs 2018 looms, the dawn of a cashless society feels at hand. Don\u2019t believe it? Try throwing a couple $20 bills on the table next time you\u2019re splitting the check. Or better yet, ask anyone not standing behind a cash register to break a $10 bill.\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t tip like they used to, because they don\u2019t have the cash in their pockets like they used to,\u201d said Mark, an elevator operator at an upscale Manhattan co-op, talking about his building\u2019s tenants. He asked to use only his first name because his union and employer forbid him from talking to the press.It\u2019s a peculiar quirk of modern city life. The stock market is on fire, unemployment is down, and the average price of a Manhattan apartment is now more than $2 million. Yet good luck finding anyone with paper money in her purse.For many people, particularly in dense urban environments, there is simply no incentive to visit the A.T.M. when cab rides, coffee, pizza delivery and even snacks from food trucks can be paid for online or with plastic. And that\u2019s bad news for any worker not participating in the digital economy.The problem is particularly acute for apartment building staff like doormen and elevator operators, who are not part of any transaction involving their \u201ccustomer\u201d and typically rely on change from cab rides or food delivery for their tips.\u201cLong ago, the tenants would take a cab home, and they paid with cash,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSo if they get change out of that $20, they give you that change.\u201cNow they swipe a card in the cab, or when they come with the Uber, they don\u2019t pay, so they just walk out of the car and they go straight up.\u201dMark says that his tips have gone from $400 a week three years ago to, at most, $100 a week in 2017.Roger Johnston, who became a Manhattan doorman in 2004 after working on Wall Street for 31 years, blamed not just the cashless society but also the general economy and cost of living. \u201cThese guys, they\u2019re paying good money \u2014 almost five grand for a one bedroom,\u201d he said \u201cA cup of coffee is two and change, so a lot of these people, they rent here and walk to work. It\u2019s just the economy.\u201dMr. Johnston said his tips have dropped 60 percent since 2008, when he took his current job in a Park Avenue building.But another doorman at a different Park Avenue building, who also requested anonymity, said it was specifically his tenants\u2019 preference for virtual services that has all but eliminated his tip income. They order everything online, he said, including Uber, food and water. Even the tips for the delivery guys, he said, are online.He doesn\u2019t blame the tenants, but he is frustrated with the situation. The doorman said he could work a full shift and still not make any tips.As everyday gratuities have dwindled, holiday tips stuffed into greeting cards \u2014 always a critical factor in a doorman\u2019s income \u2014 have become more important than ever. Unfortunately, those envelopes are not quite as full as they used to be, Mr. Johnston said.People who don\u2019t carry cash aren\u2019t oblivious to the plight of these workers. Maya Chung, 27, has rarely carried paper money since she was a teenager, instead relying on a combination of digital apps, PayPal and plastic to get through her day. Her building in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn doesn\u2019t have a doorman, but when she visits the nail salon she sometimes finds herself embarrassed not to have cash for gratuities.\u201cEvery time I go there without cash they miss out on their tips cause they don\u2019t have the mechanism to put it on the credit card, and I always feel bad,\u201d said Ms. Chung, a digital reporter at InsideEdition.com. Still, she doesn\u2019t always remember to visit the A.T.M. before she goes. \u201cI\u2019m just not thinking about it because I\u2019m so programmed to never have cash on me.\u201dNot all workers who depend on tips are hurt by the shift away from cash. To the contrary, touch-screen tablets in cabs and coffeehouses that prompt customers to give minimum 20 percent tips \u2014 under the watchful gaze of the beneficiary \u2014 have practically eliminated barriers to tipping those workers. And \u201cthere is research showing that people who pay with a credit card seem to pay a bit more than people who pay with cash,\u201d said W. Michael Lynn, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University.But credit card companies charge merchants a fee for processing tips, so there are still businesses \u2014 most notably nail and beauty salons \u2014 that largely don\u2019t let customers leave electronic tips. This was a problem for Mr. Diaz (he asked not to use his first name because he was not authorized by his employer to speak to the press), a hairdresser of 22 years who works in Chelsea. His tip income dipped considerably until he signed up for Venmo, an app that facilitates person-to-person cash transfers.Mr. Diaz said that his younger clients rarely have paper money, and often say they\u2019ll tip him the next time they see him. His customers encouraged him to sign up for Venmo, and his tip income is now back to where it used to be, he said.Though Venmo is popular for peer-to-peer transfers, many other apps, such as Bravo, Tipsta and TipGenie, have sprung up in recent years specifically aimed at providing digital tips for workers who rely on cash. But so far, none have reached the level of widespread adoption necessary to make a real dent.\u201cThe problem is both parties, receiver and giver, have to have the app for this to work, and it\u2019s difficult to create an incentive that causes both groups to sign on,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cNobody has figured out how to fix that problem.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the spending habits of Maya Chung. She sometimes carries paper money; it is not true that she never visits the A.T.M. before the nail salon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Pittsburgh, the Airport Is a Destination", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s open to non-passengers for shopping, dining and meeting people at the gate. Here\u2019s how \u2014 and why \u2014 it works.\u201cWe\u2019ve got space and we\u2019ve got a beautiful facility and people are proud of it here,\u201d said Ms. Cassotis, a self-professed \u201ctravel junkie\u201d whose father was a pilot for Pan Am and United Airlines. \u201cI\u2019m from Boston and I moved here to take this job, and I am fascinated by this community because I\u2019m learning about it constantly,\u201d she said.Below are edited excerpts from an interview with Ms. Cassotis.Why is being allowed into the airport on a regular basis so important to the people of Pittsburgh?When Pittsburgh International was built 25 years ago, it was built with the idea that retail would have a very prominent role. It really was credited as being the first air mall in the U.S. and it was something that the community here was incredibly proud of and really liked. I hear stories all the time when I\u2019m out in the community; people fondly recall Friday night dinner at the airport, watching planes take off, meeting people from around the world. It was just an exciting place to be.There\u2019s been a lot of change in the last two and a half years to the physical facility that people read about, and unless you fly, you wouldn\u2019t have access to that. We\u2019ve added flights and brought European service back more robustly, so you\u2019ve got a lot more activity going on out there. It feels like something\u2019s happening and people want to be part of that again.Despite allowing more people into the facility, no new T.S.A. security lines are being added to the airport. Has crowding been a problem so far?We are averaging about a 150 people a day, which is just the equivalent of a new flight, so we can handle it. We purposely chose to allow this from Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., because that\u2019s a time when our T.S.A. average wait times are often below five minutes. It\u2019s not crowded, we have room, and we monitor to make sure that the flying public always has priority. We did this mindful of the fact that we could maintain our high level of safety and security. The T.S.A. folks in our airport live in this community, so they know how important this is too.Beyond shopping and dining at the airport, how are people taking advantage of My Pit Pass?There was a really nice story about grandparents who were meeting their grandchild for the first time; their daughter was flying alone with a baby, and they were able to meet her right at the gate. Also, there are parents with little kids who want to see big planes, and it\u2019s nice that we can allow that.The city of Pittsburgh itself is experiencing a revival, economically and creatively. How does the airport figure into that?Pittsburgh has this incredibly rich history in building this country and went through two big gut punches: steel tanked and then the [US Airways] hub left. What\u2019s fascinating is to watch this whole community, with a lot of deliberate effort on the parts of a very bipartisan and cross-functional group of government, civic, university and nonprofit and business leaders, come together and say, \u201cO.K., we have got to figure this out.\u201d And now we\u2019re seeing it happen. They\u2019ve got this amazing diversified economy and their swagger is back.For years this airport was looked at as a drag on the community. Now there\u2019s all this new activity, all these new flights, all this excitement, all this investment. Now, people are thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out there and see what\u2019s happening.\u201d So, it\u2019s sort of the continuation of the story of the region.Advertisement"}

Much of the island\u2019s 2,400 miles of transmission lines, 30,000 miles of distribution lines and 342 substations were damaged in the storm, they said. Carlos D. Torres, the system\u2019s restoration coordinator, said workers were finding \u201cunexpected damage\u201d in some areas even as they make repairs in others.Jos\u00e9 E. S\u00e1nchez, who heads the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers task force to restore power in Puerto Rico, said some homes were so damaged they are unable to receive electricity, though he did not know how many homes were in that situation.The island\u2019s governor and power utility said that of the homes that could receive electricity, roughly 55 percent have had their service restored. He noted that the government\u2019s new estimate includes five towns that recently received temporary fixes from Corps generators.Mr. S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the 55 percent restoration was hardly a success.\u201c55 percent? No, oh my gosh, I want it quicker, faster, better,\u201d he said.He said the Corps has increased its number of crews working on the island, and many of the materials ordered in October are beginning to arrive. Some private companies that had committed to help Puerto Rico will begin to arrive in January.Several investor-owned electric companies that are members of the Edison Electric Institute will deploy nearly 1,500 additional restoration workers and support personnel to Puerto Rico in early January to accelerate ongoing power restoration efforts across the island, the agency announced Thursday.Mr. S\u00e1nchez said the companies faced the same kind of logistical challenges that kept them from arriving sooner.\u201cA lot of people are angry,\u201d said Cannabis Nebot, 43, who lives in Arecibo, where power was largely restored. \u201cThey don\u2019t believe what the government says about the power outage. You can see on Facebook a lot of people saying that they got no light. A lot of people in the countryside have no light. Or some towns have it, but it comes and goes.\u201dThe government had previously not been able to say how many people had power because of damage to the outage management system. The government has repaired the fiber optic cables that allow the system to read meters.\u201cWe won\u2019t be satisfied until it\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d said Gerardo Qui\u00f1ones, a spokesman for Prepa. \u201cThe media can criticize all it wants, but this is a result of a lot of hard work.

{"Headline": "Brexit Talks Headed for a Second, More Difficult Phase", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Now comes the hard part.Mrs. May clinched the deal with a unilateral promise \u2014 details to be negotiated later \u2014 that Britain would not reimpose physical border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union, even if Britain ultimately fails to strike a trade deal with the bloc.Difficult as that was, most analysts agree that the second stage of negotiations will be far harder. Britain and the European Union will begin to tangle with the finer details of the divorce settlement and the structure, at least, of the future relationship that Britain, as a nonmember, will have with the European Union.\u201cThis deal has only been done through a mixture of fudge and playing for time,\u201d said Peter Ricketts, a former senior British diplomat with long European experience and a member of the House of Lords.On the border, he said, \u201cno one has solved the underlying problem of how to have a border if there is no deal with the European Union,\u201d which will be the subject of further talks.Even then, he added: \u201cThis was the easy part, but now the British cabinet has to confront some real choices. Now, we get to the really divisive part about what kind of future trading relationship we want with Brussels.\u201dThat debate boils down to two opposing sides: those who want the closest possible future relationship with the European Union for the sake of trade and business ties, and those who want a sharper split, so that Britain can freely negotiate trade deals with countries like the United States and Australia without being hampered by allegiance to all of the European Union\u2019s regulations and standards.The problem for the British government is that it is no closer to deciding the matter than it was when Mrs. May invoked Article 50 in March, initiating the process of withdrawal, or Brexit.Mrs. May has declared only that Britain would not seek to remain a member of the single market or the customs union, while also saying that she wants the best possible trading relationship with Europe, which is, after all, where most of Britain\u2019s trade goes.Simon Fraser, a former senior British diplomat who runs a consulting company that focuses on Brexit, said that \u201cBritain wants to move quickly to phase two, but in fact it does not have a policy for phase two.\u201dBrexiters argue that Britain is so important to Europe that London should be given a special or \u201cbespoke\u201d deal, given the 44 years of bloc membership. But the European Union is legalistic, bureaucratic and runs by precedent. And there are only a limited number of templates for a future relationship, Brussels officials consistently say.Britain could work out a deal, much like Norway has, where it remains a member in everything but voting power and name \u2014 trading freely but subject to freedom of movement and labor for European Union citizens and continuing to pay into the union\u2019s budget. That seems unacceptable to Britain, which voted to leave in large part to stop freedom of movement.Or Britain, as a third country, could negotiate a free trade deal with the European Union, as Canada and Japan have done. But those deals have taken many years to finish and leave out services \u2014 in banking, investment, advertising \u2014 that make up 80 percent of Britain\u2019s economy.That is one reason Mrs. May, and British businesses, want a transition period of at least two years after Britain formally leaves at the end of March 2019. During that time its relations with Brussels would remain roughly the same, allowing breathing room to negotiate a trade deal and avoid a chaotic \u201ccliff-edge\u201d exit.Businesses have been warning that they need some clarity soon; otherwise executives would be forced to make decisions on future investments that assumed the worst. There was a touch of optimism and relief on Friday that talks would move ahead and that a transition period would provide the needed breathing space.\u201cSignificant progress has clearly been made, particularly on citizens\u2019 rights, but let\u2019s not kid ourselves. Problems remain,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of The U.K. in a Changing Europe.However the specific issues play out, Mr. Fraser sees 2018 as extremely complicated, a rush to finish a withdrawal deal that fills in all the blanks in the current agreement and settles a host of other questions, like air travel and other logistics. It will have to be finished by October or November, he said, to allow time for ratification.But that deal will also be dependent on negotiating a transition after March 2019, to which all member states must agree, and is likely to be one of the first orders of business early next year. Such a transition would take some of the heat off the negotiators trying to avoid a chaotic exit and would reassure businesses, airlines and tourists, too. But it would also mean Britain continuing to pay into the E.U. budget, which could anger Brexiters.Then there is the task of defining the \u201coutlines\u201d of a future relationship, which the British call a trade deal. But for Brussels, there can be no trade deal until Britain leaves the bloc. And few believe it can be negotiated in two years.At best, Mr. Fraser and Mr. Ricketts believe, there will be an agreement in two more years on the \u201cheadline\u201d understandings of a trade deal, which will have to be filled out painstakingly. And that can be done only after Britain decides how close it wants to remain to the European Union and its laws and standards.Then there will be negotiations on Britain\u2019s future security relationship with the bloc, which is one of Britain\u2019s strengths. Britain, as a critical member of NATO, a nuclear power and a member of the Security Council, has vowed to preserve and even enhance its defense ties and commitments to Europe. Some Brexiters want to use that as a bargaining chip for a trade deal, but that idea is controversial and is resented in Brussels.And then Britain has to figure out how to handle or renegotiate all the trade deals that the European Union currently has with third countries, of which Britain is now a part but will not be in the future. Countries that gave trading concessions to the huge European Union market of more than 500 million people may not be so generous in their dealings with Britain alone, a country of some 65 million people that is highly dependent on its service industries.\u201cThe real negotiations on the economics will be in the period of the transitional deal,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cBut this British government may never get there,\u201d citing the political weakness of Mrs. May and the fights to come among \u201cthe remainers, the Brexiters and the hard Brexiters in the cabinet,\u201d he said.He added, \u201c2018 is going to be a very difficult year.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shivering Children, Pricier Spandex: The Impact of China\u2019s Energy Stumble", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Homes, businesses and even hospitals across northern China are running short of natural gas. Some schoolchildren are shivering. And in the chemical industry \u2014 well, the spandex supply is getting tight.More than a decade ago, China began moving gradually to rely more on natural gas and less on coal, a dirtier form of energy. This autumn, faced with public pressure to clean smoggy skies, the government decided to pick up the pace.In some places, that shift has gone awry.The Chinese government on Tuesday shut down big chemical factories in western China for as long as four months to free up natural gas to heat homes and schools. And in Beijing, the city authorities have very publicly reversed a heavily promoted policy of ending municipal coal use. The city has turned a big coal-fired power plant in its southeastern suburbs back on \u2014 in the chilly air, it releases a towering, gray cloud of steam and pollution visible from tall buildings across much of the city.\u201cIt is the most severe shortfall of natural gas since the commitment to build up gas demand,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy consultant and author, who is visiting Beijing this week.The disruptions so far appear temporary. But they show how painful and expensive it will be for China to clean up its air and wean itself from dirty-burning coal. The fossil fuel helped propel the country\u2019s economy to become the world\u2019s second-largest, and efforts to break its coal addiction could have global, as well as national, consequences.Through the autumn, government inspectors did not just order schools, businesses and homes to shut down coal-fired stoves and boilers and switch to natural gas. They made sure that their orders would not be defied, dismantling and removing large numbers of coal-fired devices, according to state-controlled media.Winter has arrived early, however, and it has been especially cold this year, triggering unexpectedly high demand for heating. At the same time, natural gas has been in short supply, and in some cases construction has not been completed on the pipelines needed to deliver it.The result has been a national outcry, particularly after the official newspaper People\u2019s Daily published photos last week of elementary school students having classes outdoors in subfreezing weather because it was even colder indoors.\u201cIn the past, the heating problems had occurred, but this year the issue is particularly severe because the supply side has not caught up,\u201d said Lin Boqiang, an energy analyst at Xiamen University. \u201cIn planning the emissions goals, the government has not really coordinated well with gas producers.\u201dChina already consumes considerably more natural gas than it produces, importing the difference. The country also regulates the price at which state-controlled energy giants are allowed to sell natural gas, to encourage its domestic use as a cleaner-burning substitute for coal.Keeping prices low, though, has meant that energy companies have had little incentive to produce or import more natural gas. PetroChina, the main oil and gas company in northern China, reported that its losses from natural gas climbed steeply in the first three quarters of this year compared with the same period in 2016.Yet there is one big exception in consumer prices for natural gas in China: the compressed natural gas burned by many taxis in big Chinese cities, and by a growing number of trucks as well. Compressed natural gas prices have surged 65 percent since early November, prompting government officials to warn last week against price gouging.The natural gas shortage has particularly hit the chemicals industry in China, with consequences for the wider world.While MDI factories outside China mainly produce the chemical for insulation, China dominates global production of garments made from spandex, the stretchy material best known in the United States under the Lycra brand name. The BASF shutdown may drive MDI prices even higher. That will make spandex garments more expensive, but should not result in their disappearance from store shelves, chemicals analysts said.And while Chinese environmentalists have led the push for using more natural gas and less coal, even they now say the government may have moved too fast.\u201cThe problem is not about what they are doing, but whether you can achieve the goal in a short period of time,\u201d said Ma Jun, the director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a nonprofit group in Beijing that monitors pollution. \u201cThe officials are ill prepared, and there has been a lack of discussion on execution.\u201dAilin Tang and Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a fitting image for a world that feels under pressure and on the verge of, well, everything \u2014 ready to break off and set itself free. The global political temperature is on the rise, the future of truth is under debate and the specter of nuclear conflict hovers. We asked His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his thoughts on how to cope.We are facing a time of great uncertainty and upheaval in many corners of our planet. When it comes to making the world a better place, concern for others is tantamount.Our future is very much in our hands. Within each of us exists the potential to contribute positively to society. Although one individual among so many on this planet may seem too insignificant to have much of an effect on the course of humanity, it is our personal efforts that will determine the direction our society is heading.Wherever I go, I consider myself just one of 7 billion human beings alive today. We share a fundamental wish: We all want to live a happy life, and that is our birthright. There is no formality when we\u2019re born, and none when we die. In between, we should treat each other as brother and sister because we share this commonality \u2014 a desire for peace and contentment.Sadly, we face all sorts of problems, many of them of our own making. Why? Because we are swayed by emotions like selfishness, anger and fear.One of the most effective remedies for dealing with such destructive patterns of thought is to cultivate \u201cloving-kindness\u201d by thinking about the oneness of all the world\u2019s 7 billion humans. If we consider the ways in which we are all the same, the barriers between us will diminish.Humanity is rich in the diversity that naturally arose from the wide expanse of our world, from the variety of languages and ways of writing to our different societal norms and customs. However, when we overemphasize race, nationality, faith, or income or education level, we forget our many similarities. We want a roof over our heads and food in our bellies, to feel safe and secure, and for our children to grow and be strong. As we seek to preserve our own culture and identity, we must also remember that we are one in being human, and work to maintain our warmheartedness toward all.In the last century, the inclination to solve problems through the use of force was invariably destructive and perpetuated conflict. If we are to make this century a period of peace, we must resolve problems through dialogue and diplomacy. Since our lives are so intertwined, the interests of others are also our own. I believe that adopting divisive attitudes runs counter to those interests.Our interdependence comes with advantages and pitfalls. Although we benefit from a global economy and an ability to communicate and know what is happening worldwide instantaneously, we also face problems that threaten us all. Climate change in particular is a challenge that calls us more than ever to make a common effort to defend the common good.Tackling destructive emotions and practicing loving-kindness isn\u2019t something we should be doing with the next life, heaven or nirvana in mind, but how we should live in the here and now. I am convinced we can become happier individuals, happier communities and a happier humanity by cultivating a warm heart, allowing our better selves to prevail.The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the spiritual leader of Tibet and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1959 he has lived in exile in Dharamsala, in northern India.Advertisement"}

He also offered to meet Mr. Rajoy in Brussels or another location outside of Spain.Yet even now Mr. Rajoy seems reluctant to take an approach to the Catalan crisis any different from the one that has pushed Spain nearly to the point of fracturing.On Friday, the prime minister repeated his insistence that he was open to dialogue, but not with Catalan politicians who do not respect Spain\u2019s Constitution.Instead, Mr. Rajoy chose to emphasize the success of the anti-secessionist party, Ciudadanos, led in Catalonia by In\u00e9s Arrimadas. It received the largest percentage of the vote \u2014 25 percent \u2014 but is still likely to be in the opposition.Mr. Rajoy, speaking in Madrid on Friday, said he should talk with the winner of the elections, \u201cand that is Ms. Arrimadas.\u201d Mr. Rajoy\u2019s own Popular Party came in last.So the standoff continues.Thursday\u2019s outcome \u201ccompletely defeats his idea that direct control over Catalonia and elections would really weaken the secessionist bloc,\u201d said Sandra Le\u00f3n, a Spanish senior lecturer on politics at the University of York in Britain.\u201cWe knew that these elections only had a slim chance of really solving the conflict,\u201d Ms. Le\u00f3n added. \u201cBut we now have instead got confirmation that the secessionist bloc is resilient and that Catalan society is completely polarized.\u201dThat polarization extends beyond Catalonia to the seemingly unbridgeable chasm with Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, and it is fueling a crisis that threatens to sow instability not only in Catalonia but also throughout Spain\u2019s entire politics and economy.For Catalonia, a new round of turmoil, which now seems almost certain, could generate still more economic tremors, further undermining the secessionist claim that independence would increase the wealth of a region.Since the conflict reached a boiling point in October, more than 3,000 companies have relocated their legal headquarters outside Catalonia, which accounts for nearly one-fifth of Spain\u2019s economy.On Friday, the Spanish stock market index fell 1.2 percent, while analysts warned of dwindling foreign investment in a region whose cosmopolitan capital, Barcelona, has become Spain\u2019s tourism hub.Politically, Thursday\u2019s election could also shift the balance of power in Madrid, where Mr. Rajoy has been at the helm of a minority government since 2016, reliant on the support of the Ciudadanos party.\u201cThere has been nobody in Europe who has supported the position of the separatists,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said.Albert Rivera, the national leader of Ciudadanos, told La Sexta, a television news channel, that the social divide in Catalonia and prolonged political crisis meant that \u201cwe have to ask what have we done badly as a country to get to this.\u201dBut he also argued that \u201cwhat has happened in Catalonia has a lot to do with the malaise of Europe, which is that nationalism and populism have gained strength.\u201dWith the strong showing of Ciudadanos in the election, Mr. Rajoy\u2019s party will no doubt face a stronger challenge from its rival to be seen as the main flag bearer for Spanish unity.\u201cThe competition in Spain is going to be structured more along national identity lines, which probably means a hardening of the position toward Catalonia,\u201d said Lluis Orriols, a professor of politics at the Carlos III University in Madrid.For the separatists, on the other hand, \u201cit seems very hard to return in such conditions to a unilateral path, so their challenge is to agree on new ways to pursue their goals,\u201d Mr. Orriols said.Even if the separatist parties bury their recent disagreements to form a new coalition government in January, Mr. Rajoy could reapply his emergency powers and extend direct rule over Catalonia, if he judges that the new Catalan administration is set to violate the Constitution.The separatist parties also face an uphill challenge to take office because most of their leaders are facing prosecution for already flouting Spain\u2019s Constitution, including in October when they held an independence referendum that had been declared illegal by Spain\u2019s government and courts.Mr. Rajoy defended his handling of the conflict, saying that his emergency powers were \u201capplied in an intelligent manner,\u201d without unsettling the administration of Catalonia.Mr. Rajoy has been a government minister since the 1990s and has survived election defeats as well as a financial crisis, often by being cautious and waiting for others to fail.Still, Mr. Rajoy \u201cmust come to view an adversary who wins half of the votes in Catalonia at least as a legitimate interlocutor,\u201d argued Sonia Andolz, a professor of politics at the University of Barcelona, who specializes in conflict resolution.\u201cNegotiating isn\u2019t a sign of weakness,\u201d Ms. Andolz said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Sought to Undercut an Unfavorable Analysis of the Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican requirement that Congress consider the full cost of major legislation threatened to derail the party\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax rewrite last week. So lawmakers went on the offensive to discredit the agency performing the analysis.In 2015, Republicans changed the budget rules in Congress so that official scorekeepers would be required to analyze the potential economic impact of major legislation when determining how it would affect federal revenues.Public statements and messaging documents obtained by The New York Times show a concerted push by Republican lawmakers to discredit a nonpartisan agency they had long praised. Party leaders circulated two pages of \u201cresponse points\u201d that declared \u201cthe substance, timing and growth assumptions of J.C.T.\u2019s \u2018dynamic\u2019 score are suspect.\u201d Among their arguments was that the joint committee was using \u201cconsistently wrong\u201d growth models to assess the effect the tax cuts would have on hiring, wages and investment.The Republican response points go after revenue analyses by the committee and by the Congressional Budget Office, which scores other legislation, saying their findings \u201ccan be off to the tune of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years.\u201dThe swift backlash helped defuse concerns about the deficit impact long enough for the bill to pass by a vote of 51 to 49. Some deficit hawks in the Senate caucus were sufficiently concerned about the report on Thursday night to delay the tax vote by a day, but the only Republican lawmaker to vote no was Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, whose last-minute efforts to cut the size of the package or otherwise offset the deficit impact were unsuccessful.Instead, Senate Republicans questioned the timing of the analysis\u2019 release on Thursday, and a spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee released a statement saying the findings are \u201ccurious and deserve further scrutiny.\u201dRepublicans say the committee\u2019s model underestimates how workers will respond to lower taxes and how private investment affects growth. They also say the model assumes that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates faster than Republican lawmakers expect, which would make borrowing more expensive and could slow economic growth.That sentiment was repeated over and over, before and after the vote. \u201cWe think they lowballed it,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, told reporters on Thursday. On Sunday, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said on CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that the J.C.T. has been consistently underestimating the activity in our economy.\u201dIn the final hours before and after the bill passed, party leaders insisted that the tax plan would produce enough economic growth to pay for themselves with additional tax revenue from growing businesses and higher-paid workers. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told reporters early Saturday morning after the vote, adding that he believed the bill would actually be a \u201crevenue producer.\u201dThe attack on the joint committee and its analysis is a change from the praise Republicans have long heaped on the body, which is staffed with economists and other career bureaucrats who analyze legislation in depth.At stake in the debate is more than the reputation of the economic analysts whose lifeblood is understanding the vagaries and intersections of the federal budget and tax code.If Republicans are wrong and the joint committee is correct, the tax bill will add to an already worsening fiscal forecast in the United States. The federal government is already running an annual deficit of nearly $700 billion. The amount of federal debt has surpassed $20 trillion, and it is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade as government safety net spending rises because of retiring baby boomers and increasing health care costs.The joint committee did find that the tax bill would rev up economic growth but, like other studies, it would not be enough to offset the loss of tax revenue. The analysis found growth from the tax cuts would offset $458 billion in lost revenue, but $51 billion of that would be eaten up by additional interest costs on money the United States would need to borrow to pay for the plan. That would leave just $407 billion to offset a nearly $1.5 trillion tax cut, the committee found.Both the Penn model and the Tax Policy Center\u2019s model found the Senate version would increase deficits by more than $1 trillion after accounting for growth; the Penn model in particular produced a near-identical score to the joint committee\u2019s. The Tax Foundation did not complete an analysis of the Senate bill as amended in committee, when senators made several large changes to the bill including sunsetting its tax cuts for individuals in 2025.Until Thursday, though, Republicans could dismiss those findings by pointing to the lack of analysis from the joint committee. The House bill was passed two weeks after it was introduced, before the committee could issue a so-called dynamic score of the bill, one that estimates the legislation\u2019s cost in light of its effect on the economy. When the Senate analysis was finally released, Republicans, who pushed the bill through Congress at such lightning-fast speed that the final bill had handwritten changes in the margins, questioned the timing.\u201cHow is it,\u201d they wrote in their response points, \u201cthat J.C.T. found the time to produce and make public its macroeconomic analysis of the Senate bill, when it has yet to produce the same analysis of the House bill that passed weeks ago.\u201dIn a November 28 email shared with The New York Times, the committee\u2019s chief of staff, Thomas A. Barthold, said the committee had suspended its work on the House bill dynamic score in hopes of producing an analysis of the Senate bill before a final vote.Looking at the calendar, Mr. Barthold wrote, \u201cI made the decision to have my macro colleagues devote their time to producing a macroeconomic estimate of the Finance bill in time for the Finance Committee\u2019s report (in this we failed) or in time for the Senate\u2019s debate on the legislation. My colleagues and I reasoned that we could then return to complete work on H.R. 1\u201d \u2014 the House bill \u2014 \u201cand with good fortune have the two analyses available for a potential conference.\u201dThe blowback came, in part, from lingering anger over unfavorable analyses of Republican health care plans by the budget office earlier this year, according to a Republican Senate aide. A finding that contradicted their philosophical belief that tax cuts will generate significant growth and revenues inflamed their suspicions.Instead, they found comfort in ballpark estimates offered by some conservative economists, that the tax bill could increase the size of the economy by as much as 4 percent over a decade, or 0.4 percent a year. Mr. Smetters, of Penn, said that number is actually much higher \u2014 that the economy would need to grow by at least an additional 0.57 percent a year for tax cuts to pay for themselves.Not even the most optimistic analysis of the Senate bill projected it would unleash anywhere close to that rate of additional growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heading Toward Tax Victory, Republicans Eye Next Step: Cut Spending", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the tax cut legislation passed by the Senate early Saturday hurtles toward final approval, Republicans are preparing to use the swelling deficits made worse by the package as a rationale to pursue their long-held vision: undoing the entitlements of the New Deal and Great Society, leaving government leaner and the safety net skimpier for millions of Americans.Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other Republicans are beginning to express their big dreams publicly, vowing that next year they will move on to changes in Medicare and Social Security. President Trump told a Missouri rally last week, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go into welfare reform.\u201d\u201cThe way to get at fixing the debt is to feel like everybody is willing to put something on the table,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group. \u201cOnce you have one side grab all it could, you\u2019re never going to have the other side show up.\u201dAnd it was passed along sharply partisan lines, offering nothing to Democrats, and leaving them with no obligation or incentive to negotiate cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, the entitlement programs that are driving up spending, but are also the pride of the Democratic Party.For his part, Mr. Trump spent his campaign promising not to cut Medicare and Social Security. And Republicans will probably find, as they did when they failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that the public rises up to defend the programs they are trying to cut. Whatever political boost the Republicans could get for passing a tax cut could evaporate fast.\u201cRepublicans are going to find that Democrats treat this tax bill the way Republicans treated Obamacare \u2014 it\u2019s not trusted by people on the other side of the aisle,\u201d said former Senator Judd Gregg, who was chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission, a bipartisan group of lawmakers and budget experts that produced a deficit reduction plan in 2010. \u201cIt will become a target, a rallying cry, which is unfortunate, because good tax reform, when done right, is not only good for the economy, it\u2019s good for the parties.\u201d\u201cRepublicans have been telling themselves for years that they wanted to get into power so they could balance the budget, reduce the debt, cut spending and fix entitlements,\u201d Ms. MacGuineas said. \u201cThey\u2019ve just made it harder, not easier.\u201dFor weeks, Democrats and their allies have been accusing Republicans of a \u201ctwo-step\u201d deceit, warning that they would cut taxes now and then use the increase in the deficit they caused to demand entitlement cuts later.\u201cWhen you run up the deficit, your next argument will be, \u2018Gee, you\u2019ve got a large deficit,\u2019\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said in an interview.Now Republicans are beginning to acknowledge as much. Mr. Ryan said at a town hall-style meeting last month that Congress had to spur growth and cut entitlements to reduce the national debt.The Republican tax plan, he said \u201cgrows the economy.\u201d But, he added, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in cutting spending.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio of Florida was more specific on Wednesday, telling business leaders that the tax cuts were just the first step; the next is to reshape Social Security and Medicare for future retirees.\u201cThe argument would be we can\u2019t cut taxes because it will drive up the deficit,\u201d he said, saying that he disagreed. \u201cYou have to do two things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to generate economic growth because growth generates revenue. But you also have to bring spending under control. And not discretionary spending. That isn\u2019t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.\u201dThe Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will cost the federal government $28.6 trillion through 2027. The tax cut, estimated at nearly $1.5 trillion, makes the problem only mildly worse.But if that trillion-dollar boost to the government\u2019s yawning fiscal hole is comparatively small mathematically, it could add up to much more politically if it keeps Democrats away from the negotiating table.And even if Republicans do not pursue changes to entitlements, the tax bill will trigger pay-as-you-go requirements that Congress cut spending. That would be a particularly big hit to Medicare, which would face a $25 billion cut for the current fiscal year. Groups like AARP, the lobby for older Americans, warn that it would force doctors and hospitals to turn away patients because reimbursements would be cut so drastically.Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, released a statement Friday saying that the so-called pay-go cuts \u201cwill not happen\u201d because Congress would waive the law, as it has in the past. But they will need Democratic votes to do that, in a climate that is unusually partisan.Regardless of whether Republicans can waive these cuts, David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, said, \u201cYou know they\u2019re going to come back and say, \u2018We need to make more cuts to deal with the growing debts and deficit.\u2019\u201dSome deficit hawks complain that Republicans have cast away any mantle of fiscal responsibility.Robert L. Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that encourages fiscal responsibility, complained of hypocrisy from Republicans who have been clamoring to lift the spending caps that were created by the 2011 Budget Control Act.If the tax cuts do not generate the revenue Republicans are expecting, he predicted, \u201cpeople will say, \u2018No, we\u2019re not getting the growth because we should have cut taxes even more.\u2019\u201dThe United States is already facing a gloomy fiscal landscape. The federal deficit this year topped $660 billion, despite healthy economic growth, and the national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, appointed by President Barack Obama, warned last week that the national debt \u201cis the type of thing that should keep people awake at night.\u201dBut Democrats and their allies \u2014 and even some usual Republican allies \u2014 complain that Republicans are dishonest not to debate changes in spending and tax cuts at the same time, as the Simpson-Bowles commission did.Sharon Parrott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Republicans understood how bad it would look to cut food benefits for poor families and health care for the elderly at the same time they were cutting taxes for corporations and the highest earners.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason they separate them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think they can get away with it.\u201dBut in an election year with high political engagement, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to count out the idea that the public will figure it out.\u201dAn earlier version of this article quoted incorrectly from comments made by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida about entitlements and the deficit. He said the driver of the federal debt is Social Security and Medicare but did not specify \u201cinstituting structural changes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking at Blue-Collar Factory Jobs in the Rearview Mirror", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe DailyINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 During the first week in December, I took my ninth trip of the year to Indianapolis, where I\u2019d been following a group of steelworkers at the Rexnord bearing plant whose jobs were moving to Monterrey, Mexico. This was a chance to check in on how they\u2019ve been doing since the factory closed.Many of them had worked at the plant since the day they stepped out of high school. I wanted to know how they were faring in the new economy that has sprung up outside the factory walls.The trip also presented an opportunity to take stock of the bigger economic picture and foster a conversation about the future of blue-collar jobs in America within the context of globalization.To be honest, I felt a bit nervous about it. I\u2019m used to agonizing over every word I write, not talking off the cuff in public.But in the end, this trip back to Indianapolis felt almost like a homecoming. I\u2019d been there enough times to have acquired a favorite coffee shop, a favorite bar and a favorite gym. I looked forward to going back.I checked in with some of the people I\u2019d interviewed. Some had gotten new jobs at other factories or construction sites, making $10 an hour less than they had been making before. One had gotten a job delivering packages. He marveled at how grueling and thankless the work is. Others were still looking. Shannon Mulcahy has yet to find a new job, although a wealthy well-wisher who read my article has offered her a position at a hotel in Las Vegas. She is considering it, but feeling a bit scared about making such a big move.At the Dec. 7 event, Shannon told an audience of around 60 attendees about the cards, photographs and messages she\u2019d received from people all over the world after the article was published. Some had even sent money.\u201cIt was overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think very many people would even care about another factory closing.\u201dThanking people kept her busy for a time. Then she focused on caring for her disabled granddaughter, Carmella, who had just celebrated her fifth birthday with chocolate cake that Shannon had time to bake now that she\u2019s no longer employed.Yet after working seven days a week for months on end, it feels strange to her to have so much time on her hands.\u201cI miss my job,\u201d she admitted.One of the biggest takeaways for me from the event was the grim news delivered by Emily Wornell, an assistant professor at Ball State University, who has looked at the potential for job loss through automation and outsourcing in every county in the country.Ms. Wornell\u2019s research suggests that no matter how painful those disruptions have been to American workers over the last few decades, they are likely to look small compared to what\u2019s to come.In the next generation or so, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got counties where upwards of two-thirds of the jobs have the potential of being automated\u201d or outsourced.My exchange with Stu Kaplan \u2014 founder and chief executive of Makuta, a company that makes tiny plastic parts for medical devices and printers \u2014 underscored that point:\u201cStu, how many parts do you make in a year?\u201d I asked.\u201cBetween 150 to 200 million,\u201d he replied.\u201cHow many people do you employ?\u201d\u201cTen.\u201dSome of the most telling revelations came from the audience.One woman, who identified herself as a shop steward with S.E.I.U., a labor union, told the crowd she had to work two jobs just to make ends meet.Another decried a culture that no longer provides job security, health insurance or a pension.\u201cI am a highly educated single white woman and I can\u2019t get paid more than $10 or $15 in this city,\u201d she complained. \u201cWhen you do get a job, it\u2019ll be in a room of a thousand people just like me. (We are scoring the country\u2019s English exams.) . . . And yet we are all going to be fired en masse every three months.\u201dTheir comments pointed to an agonizing trade-off that Indiana seems to have made: To attract employers, the state adopted business-friendly policies, including lower tax rates and a \u201cright to work\u201d law that undercuts unions.Signs of a vibrant economy abound. Technology-oriented firms, including Angie\u2019s List and Sales Force, dot the Indianapolis skyline. Unemployment in the state has dropped below 4 percent, the lowest it has been since 2001, according to the United States Department of Labor. Yet Indiana is one of only a handful of states where real median wages have declined over the past 10 years.Despite all the efforts to woo employers, many workers feel their jobs are perpetually on the verge of disappearing.The road ahead for blue-collar workers in Indianapolis certainly won\u2019t be easy. But I now have reasons to hope that community-based solutions might be found.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Espionage Bills in Australia Stir Fears of Anti-Chinese Backlash", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 When Craig Chung, an up-and-coming Sydney city councilor, meets with former officials from the United States, neither the media nor his constituents seem to care.But for events with fellow ethnic Chinese, he errs on the side of caution. He researches the people involved. He sidesteps certain photographs and publicly declares whom he talks to and why \u2014 all to ensure he doesn\u2019t end up accused of associating with someone tied to the Chinese Communist Party.\u201cThere is this fear that we may work closely with somebody who is accused of being an agent of another government,\u201d said Mr. Chung, 49, a fourth-generation Chinese-Australian. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now where people are running scared.\u201dAustralia has been thrown into turmoil over allegations that China is trying to buy its politicians and sway its elections, charges that have led to increased scrutiny of the rising superpower\u2019s efforts to influence Australia \u2014 and fears that a campaign to stamp out Chinese influence risks becoming a McCarthy-esque witch hunt.The Chinese government has been using proxies in Australia for years to polish its image and press for its priorities, including reunification with Taiwan and sovereignty over the South China Sea. These efforts have intensified under President Xi Jinping, who seems to view Australia \u2014 which has benefited greatly from trade with China \u2014 as a laboratory for efforts to sway opinion abroad and increase China\u2019s global influence.But a thunderous backlash has now erupted \u2014 with a public outcry condemning anyone accused of links to Chinese influence, and a series of new bills that would strengthen espionage laws, outlaw foreign political donations and criminalize efforts to interfere in Australian democracy.Critics of the legislation, including human rights groups, worry that it, and the intensity of anti-China sentiment, will squash legitimate debate and unfairly target Australia\u2019s large and diverse ethnic Chinese community.The resulting influence, both economic and cultural, is a delicate subject. China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, whose voracious consumption of Australian iron ore, coal and other exports has lifted Australia\u2019s economy.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how to think about China because it\u2019s not an ally but it\u2019s not an enemy,\u201d said Mr. White, who is now a professor at Australian National University. \u201cWe are really facing something that is new in our national experience.\u201dMany of Australia\u2019s institutions have yet to catch up.Given the furor over Chinese political influence, many Chinese-Australians fear that the new espionage and foreign influence laws could further isolate them.As an ethnic minority, some Chinese-Australians see an identity associated with a stronger China as a path to more respect. Others have family and business ties in China that make them afraid to express dissent with Beijing.But Australia\u2019s Chinese community has roots reaching back more than a century, and its growing numbers include people from Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere, not just mainland China.Many are quick to gush about Australian life. But they also demand to know why Chinese-Australians are so absent from board rooms and the media, and why simply buying an apartment is somehow viewed as suspicious.The new legislation was drawn from the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of global threats, said George Brandis, the attorney general until being named high commissioner to the United Kingdom in a cabinet reshuffle this week. Mr. Brandis also said it was American-inspired, reflecting the lessons from the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the evidence of Russian attempts to meddle in the outcome.This includes criminalizing actions that fall short of outright espionage but that are deemed to interfere with an \u201cAustralian democratic or political right or duty.\u201d\u201cOne of the striking features of the American system is its vagueness or the highly generic way in which political interference is defined,\u201d Mr. Brandis said. \u201cUnder the Australian scheme there is a very specific description of what constitutes foreign interference.\u201dMany Chinese-Australians with firsthand knowledge of Beijing\u2019s heavy hand have welcomed the bill.Chinese influence also became a focal point of the recent race for an open seat in Parliament from a heavily Chinese area of Sydney, with the Liberal candidate, John Alexander, a former professional tennis player, surviving accusations that the government was whipping up anti-China sentiment to win the seat, preserving Prime Minister Turnbull\u2019s majority.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing play out there are the somewhat toxic politics of national security, which have swamped countries around the West since 9/11,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cThere is a grave danger of us overreacting.\u201dJacqueline Williams contributed reporting from Canberra, Australia, and Christopher Buckley from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Rallies a Florida Crowd in Support of an Alabama Senate Candidate", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPENSACOLA, Fla. \u2014 President Trump\u2019s crowd was here in Florida on Friday night, but his audience was in Alabama.Mr. Trump was about 45 minutes into his speech, though, before he even mentioned Mr. Moore. But when prompted to do so by a man in the crowd, the president quickly obliged.\u201cThis guy\u2019s screaming, \u2018We want Roy Moore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s right. How many people here are from the great state of Alabama?\u201dMany cheered.\u201cThe future of this country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very, very close United States Senate,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have a liberal Democrat who is completely controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. His name is Jones and he\u2019s their total puppet,\u201d a reference to Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.\u201cWe need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America Great Again agenda,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cSo get out and vote for Roy Moore.\u201dMr. Trump was less than 30 miles from the border with Alabama, which shares media markets and many conservative cultural affinities with its neighbor.His address was a rhetorical journey from elation about the economy to condemnation of a familiar group of targets.But he also emphasized strong economic news, including a roaring stock market, rising values of retirement accounts and increasing consumer confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s all about psychology to an extent,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand that\u2019s what creates greatness.\u201dHe waded further into cultural matters by cheering the signs in the arena that said Merry Christmas.\u201cLet me begin by wishing each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cI can think of no better Christmas present for the American people than giving you a massive tax cut.\u201dWhile the event was part of the president\u2019s political operation, it was the campaign in Alabama that was the focus of attention. And Mr. Moore found plenty of support among the president\u2019s backers.\u201cI\u2019m not from Alabama, but if I were, I would be voting for Roy Moore,\u201d said David Vail of Baker, Fla. \u201cHe\u2019s a God-fearing man, a good Christian man.\u201dMr. Trump has already made a campaign appearance in the Alabama Senate race, but it was not for Mr. Moore.If Mr. Strange loses, Mr. Trump mused aloud, adopting the dramatic tone of a television newscaster, it will be portrayed as \u201ca total embarrassment\u201d for him. The state\u2019s voters rejected Mr. Strange.Here in Pensacola, even with steady rain and temperatures in the 30s, the president had an approving crowd in an arena where he made two campaign appearances in 2016.His rally was the lead story in The Pensacola News Journal for two days straight, and the local congressman, Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican, gave the president a boisterous welcome.Mr. Trump ran up strong numbers in Florida\u2019s Panhandle \u2014 he won Escambia County here by 20 points \u2014 and that helped propel his victory in the state in 2016, and his popularity in Alabama is as robust as any state in the country.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to not travel to Alabama was not a calculated one, said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman.\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s not going to Alabama,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that he is going to Pensacola. Pensacola is Trump country. This is a part of the state that voted overwhelmingly for the president in 2016. He\u2019ll be traveling back to Florida from time to time, and it\u2019s a key state.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement, the Republican National Committee reversed itself and decided to contribute to Mr. Moore\u2019s campaign. But the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee has withheld any assistance. Most Republicans in the Senate have condemned Mr. Moore\u2019s candidacy, and several have said he would face an Ethics Committee investigation should he win.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has drifted. He originally said that Mr. Moore should leave the race, but on Sunday, he said that he was \u201cgoing to let the people of Alabama make the call.\u201d Then on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell pointedly said that if Mr. Moore were elected, \u201che would immediately have an issue with the Ethics Committee.\u201dMr. Trump is scheduled to travel to Jackson, Miss., on Saturday for the opening of the state\u2019s civil rights museum, which has drawn protests. But he will again be a toe-touch and a TV screen away from Alabama voters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Are Walking Into a Trumpian Trap", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a walk with me, dear reader, into the yard, down the street \u2014 anywhere, really, just so that we can step outside of our house of outrage. It\u2019s a roomy house, with space for everyone from woke progressives to disillusioned conservatives. It\u2019s a good house, filled with people united in a just and defiant cause. It\u2019s a harmonious house, thrumming with the sound of people agreeing vigorously.And lately, we\u2019ve started to believe we\u2019re \u2026 winning.Don\u2019t bet on it. Democrats are making the same mistakes Republicans made when they inhabited their own house of outrage, back in 1998.You remember. The year of the wagged finger and the stained blue dress. Of a president who abused women, lied about it, and used his power to bomb other countries so he could distract from his personal messes. Of a special prosecutor whose investigation overstepped its original bounds. Of half the country in a moral fever to impeach. Of the other half determined to dismiss sexual improprieties, defend a democratically elected leader and move on with the business of the country.Oh, also the year in which the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 16 percent, the unemployment rate fell to a 28-year low, and Democrats gained seats in Congress. Bill Clinton, as we all know, survived impeachment and left office with a strong economic record and a 66-percent approval rating.If nothing else, 1998 demonstrated the truth of the unofficial slogan on which Clinton had first run for president: It\u2019s the economy, stupid. Prosperity trumps morality. The wealth effect beats the yuck factor. That may not have held true in Moore\u2019s defeat, but it\u2019s not every day that an alleged pedophile runs for office. Even so, he damn well nearly won.1998 also showed that, when it comes to sex, we Americans forgive easily; that, when it comes to women, we don\u2019t always believe readily; and that, when it comes to presidents, we want them to succeed. However else one might feel about Mueller \u2014 or, for that matter, Ken Starr \u2014 nobody elected them to anything.Which brings us back to Trump. Democrats may like their polling numbers, but here are a few others for them to consider.What about the outrage over the president\u2019s behavior? Kirsten Gillibrand and other Senate Democrats have called on Trump to resign following new accusations of sexual harassment and assault. Good luck getting him to agree. Tom Steyer and other liberal plutocrats want the president impeached and thrown out of office. Good luck electing 67 Democrats to the Senate.Every minute wasted on that whale hunt is a minute the Democrats neglect to make an affirmative case for themselves.Which leaves us with Mueller. All of us in the house of outrage are eager for the special counsel to find the goods on the president and Russia, obstruction, financial shenanigans, anything. The clues seem so obvious, the evidence so tantalizingly close.Dear reader, I too live in the house of outrage, for all the usual reasons. Just beware, beware of growing comfortable in it. As in 1998, it just might turn out to be a house of losers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Catalan Separatists Want Independence. Who Else?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Separatist politicians in Catalonia have been pushing for independence from Spain. After three months of political turmoil, new Catalan elections are scheduled for Dec. 21.Of the 276 regions, some are pressing for independence or much greater autonomy.CATALONIA, SpainCatalonia\u2019s push for autonomy in the 1930s was one of the reasons behind the Spanish Civil War, and the resulting Franco dictatorship crushed many civil liberties, suppressing the Catalan language. After Franco\u2019s death in 1975, Spain\u2019s return to democracy was enshrined in a new Constitution, which created a decentralized but not formally federal state.In 2006, a new statute of Catalan autonomy, which had been drafted by a Socialist-led regional government, was approved in a regional referendum, as well by Catalan and Spanish lawmakers. The statute might have forestalled the current crisis over yet more extreme independence demands, but it was rejected in part by Spain\u2019s constitutional court in 2010, after Spain\u2019s conservative Popular Party had campaigned fiercely against it.During the financial crisis, the regional government in wealthy Catalonia pushed unsuccessfully for a better tax deal with the national authorities. In September 2015, a coalition of separatist parties won a majority of the seats in the Catalan Parliament, but they did so with only 48 percent of the votes in regional elections.BASQUE COUNTRY, Spain and FranceThe Basques have their own history, culture and language. Although the region straddles France and Spain, aspirations for greater autonomy have been almost exclusively limited to the population on Spanish soil.In recent years, mainstream Basque politicians have made some efforts to gain more autonomy. In 2004, the Basque regional Parliament approved a plan for a new statute of autonomy, which Spanish lawmakers rejected.SCOTLAND, United KingdomFLANDERS, BelgiumFlanders, known for its medieval cities and its World War I battlefields, is one of three regions in the federation of Belgium, but is home to the majority of the country\u2019s 11 million inhabitants, and produces about half its GDP. Flemish people speak Dutch, whereas Walloons \u2014 residents of the second largest region, Wallonia \u2014 speak French and some German.Flanders has existed as a political entity since the Middle Ages, encompassing the territory around the cities of Ghent, Bruges and Ypres, but never achieved full sovereignty. Belgium itself, founded in 1830, is a relatively young country in Europe. The Flemish independence movement emerged in the late 19th century and gained momentum after World War II. From 1970 onward, the region progressively obtained autonomy, following six constitutional revisions that transformed Belgium from a unitary country into a federation.CORSICA, FranceThe mountainous Mediterranean island of Corsica is one of France\u2019s 18 regions. Its inhabitants make up 0.5 percent of France\u2019s population of 67 million. The island\u2019s main economic activities are tourism and subsistence-oriented local commerce.Because Corsica is close to Italy, Italian culture has historically had a strong influence on the island, reflected in the local tongue, Corsican.Corsican nationalism emerged after World War I and grew into a movement demanding more autonomy and even independence. Since the 1970s, there have been flare-ups of political violence in Corsica, including bombings and assassinations carried out by groups supporting the independence movement. The French state has always opposed full independence, but over the past decades, it has granted greater autonomy to Corsica than to any other region and invested strongly in its infrastructure.LOMBARDY, ItalyWith more than 10 million inhabitants, Lombardy is the most populous of Italy\u2019s 20 regions, and its capital, Milan, is the country\u2019s financial and fashion center.Italy\u2019s 1948 Constitution gave five regions \u2014 Valle d\u2019Aosta, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Sardinia, Sicily and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol \u2014 broader powers in areas including finance and administration. But regions in the north still have active separatist movements. Since 2013, Lombardy has been governed by members of the Lega Nord, a party founded in 1991 through the federation of several hybrid separatist movements, including the local Lega Lombarda.An early incarnation of the party envisioned the creation \u2014 and secession \u2014 of a state known as Padania, which included northern regions as well as Umbria, Tuscany and the Marches. The party has since abandoned its separatist longings to pursue a broader support base, and in October it dropped the \u201cNord\u201d from its name.VENETO, ItalyVeneto separatists still mourn the decline of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, a sovereign state in northeastern Italy that held sway for around 1,100 years before it fell to foreign forces in 1797. The Veneto has its own widely spoken language, Venetian.The regional council last year also sought to have the \u201cVenetian people\u201d recognized as a minority, but the national government challenged that measure earlier this year. Numerous movements in the region \u2014 broadly known as Venetists \u2014 still aspire to significantly greater autonomy, if not independence. Some are longstanding parties like the Liga Veneta, which helped found the Lega Nord. Since 2010, the region has been governed by the Northern League.In some cases, Veneto separatists have clashed with the law. A group of separatists who occupied the Campanile in St. Mark\u2019s Square in 1997 was sentenced to prison. Members of the National Liberation Movement of the Venetian People who attended a 2009 protest march in camouflage were accused by the police of being a paramilitary group. In 2014, a group of separatists was briefly arrested on terrorism charges.Here are two recent examples, one violent and one peaceful.Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Madrid, and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Shampoo Economy", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorI recently gave an update on America\u2019s economic policy, such as it is, to a group of bankers. I expected a great deal of interest in the Republican tax plan, but instead, they wanted to talk about how costly it was for them to comply with the rules introduced by the Dodd-Frank reform bill.While sympathizing with their plight \u2014 the cost of regulatory compliance has clearly risen over the last decade \u2014 I asked them to recall the last financial crisis, a set of catastrophic, deep-recession-inducing events that motivated the creation of Dodd-Frank in the first place.A few heads nodded. There was some mumbling about irresponsible home buyers.Add to this anecdote the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to undermine the consumer protection agency created by Dodd-Frank, along with similar congressional actions I suspect you haven\u2019t heard about (I\u2019ll fix that in a moment), and the person this brings to mind is the economist Hyman Minsky.Perhaps because Minsky, who died in 1996, was both an economics professor and a banker, he understood something other economists assumed away: recurring cycles of financial instability. After a crisis, like the bursting of the housing bubble and its ensuing damage to all the banks involved in mortgage lending (or derivatives of such loans, or insurers of such derivatives \u2014 Minsky thought about all this), the financial sector and policymakers are duly chastened. They recognize that risk was systemically underpriced, and they\u2019re even willing to countenance some guardrails against reckless banking and damaging speculation.Then, a few years into the next expansion, as the memory of the crisis fades, lenders start getting their risk back on. As Minsky observed, this phase is characterized by increasingly exotic and complicated financial tools that disguise the extent of leverage being doled out to borrowers who are far from creditworthy. The next thing you know, you\u2019re inflating the next bubble, which feeds itself until it suddenly pops \u2014 a point known as the Minsky moment, when risk-seeking flips to risk-aversion.At the same time, fiscal space to support the economy during the next downturn has been diminished by the deficit-financed tax cut. Moreover, President Trump has announced that one of his administration\u2019s next priorities is \u201cwelfare reform,\u201d code for hacking away at the safety net, Social Security and Medicare.Simply put, the Republicans\u2019 agenda is to deregulate, transfer tax revenues from the Treasury to their donors and shrink government. In year nine of our aging economic expansion, the timing of this agenda is coinciding with the point in the Minsky cycle where risk aversion has flipped to underpriced risk taking amid an aggressive attack on the measures put in place after the last crisis to meet just this moment.Unless we quickly regain our memories of what happened at the last Minsky moment, this can only end badly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Fed Rate Increase Affects Your Mortgage, Car Loan and Credit Card Bill", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, the fifth increase since the financial crisis, will probably reach beyond Wall Street and into most American homes.Anyone with a credit card will see a small but instant shock to their interest rate, followed by borrowers with student and auto loans and, eventually, mortgage holders.The psychological effect of the increase, the third of 2017, may be dulled as consumers grow conditioned to the such moves.Ethan S. Harris, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, cautioned in a note to investors that \u201cthere is no such thing as a painless Fed hiking cycle.\u201dUnlike homeowners and other borrowers, cardholders are immediately affected by an increase. Card rates are based on a bank\u2019s prime rate, which is usually set at 300 basis points, or three percentage points, above the high end of the Fed\u2019s benchmark. Cardholders pay a premium above the prime rate that is determined largely by their creditworthiness.That final rate tends to be variable, allowing banks to make adjustments when their own borrowing costs increase. This could cause payments to balloon, because credit cards tend to compound interest, requiring consumers to pay interest on their base balance and on the accrued interest.Consumer groups suggest that debtors who cannot pay off their monthly credit card balances transfer the debt onto a card that does not charge interest for several months, and then clear the amount owed before the card switches to a variable rate.Home loans usually come with 15- to 30-year terms, a far longer timeline than the short-term borrowing affected by the federal funds rate.So mortgage rates, which have hovered below 4 percent for much of 2017, are less sensitive to incremental rate increases than to changes in the yield of the 10 year U.S. Treasury note, which stayed low this year even as the Fed rate ticked up.Fixed rates on 30-year mortgages largely track the Treasury movements. From June 2004 to June 2006, when the Fed raised the federal funds rate 17 times, mortgage rates followed a similar pattern.Homeowners are not entirely shielded from the impact of a Fed rate increase. Whenever the central bank makes borrowing costlier for commercial banks, those institutions have an incentive to pass those costs on to customers.The most vulnerable borrowers are those either seeking a new mortgage or already holding one with an adjustable rate. Lenders have begun gradually pushing up rates, partly in anticipation of future Fed increases.If mortgage rates increase, Americans may be less inclined to buy homes. Lighter demand could mean lower home prices. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages may hold off on refinancing, leading to less loan activity and trouble for workers in the industry.Students who already have a fixed-rate government loan will not see a change, but the interest rates on private variable-rate loans will probably rise because of the Fed\u2019s action. Those who anticipate borrowing for college in the near future may see an uptick in rates.Federal loans are tied to the rate on the 10-year Treasury note, which accounts for future shifts in the Fed benchmark rate. The government adjusts its loan rates each July.Private lenders can be expected to raise variable rates on personal loans, but the shift for most existing borrowers will not happen until the date specified in their master promissory note.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a hike in the rate, you\u2019ll typically see a hike throughout the whole private lending world as well,\u201d said Ashley Norwood, a consumer and regulatory adviser with American Student Assistance, a nonprofit group assisting student borrowers. \u201cIn normal years, the increases aren\u2019t significant enough to be alarming \u2014 an extra $2,000 over the course of a 20-year, $30,000 loan isn\u2019t making or breaking you usually.\u201dBut repeated rate increases, she said, could cause \u201cheartburn,\u201d especially for vulnerable borrowers with lower credit scores.Similar forces are at work for car owners, although the impact is far more muted than it is for credit card and student loan holders. Monthly payments on new auto loans might be just a few dollars more than for existing debtors.Eight in 10 new car sales are financed through a dealer, bank affiliated with an automaker or lease, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds. Automakers and dealers are accustomed to dangling hefty incentives that they sweeten during downturns and the holidays.Although 17.2 million new cars are projected to be sold in 2017, dealers have experienced a drop-off since last year, Ms. Caldwell said. Dealers have sizable inventory of current-year models to offload before 2018 and might temporarily ignore the effect of the Fed increase.\u201cWhen sales are going down, there\u2019s more pressure for automakers and dealers to keep market share,\u201d Ms. Caldwell said. \u201cWhen things are very competitive, they\u2019re more willing to eat the cost by offering low-interest-rate financing even if they have to pay more for their loans.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Iran Sanctions Trial: A Star Witness Revealed, and a Sleepy Juror", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA trial over a conspiracy to violate United States sanctions with a billion-dollar scheme to smuggle Turkish gold for Iranian oil began in New York this week.Before the trial opened, there was broad speculation that the lead defendant, Reza Zarrab, had entered a plea bargain with the prosecution and would reveal damaging information about corruption and illegal dealings in high places.The other defendant, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker, pleaded not guilty before the trial began. Seven others have been charged in the conspiracy but remain at large.Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned in the trial\u2019s first week.Had he switched sides to cooperate with the United States government?Through three days of often-compelling testimony, Mr. Zarrab has appeared composed, has maintained a respectful tone and has rarely looked uncomfortable answering questions. His testimony about how he had carried out the scheme, working with bankers and a government minister, sent political tremors through Turkey.Ever since Mr. Zarrab\u2019s arrest in March 2016, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has repeatedly condemned the prosecution and seemingly tried everything to have the case dismissed.Mr. Erdogan claimed there were \u201cmalicious\u201d intentions behind the prosecution, and he raised the case with American officials, including Mr. Trump, in a phone call in September.\u201cWe have to seek justice, for he is our citizen,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Zarrab more than a year ago.Mr. Zarrab also said he had paid Mr. Caglayan tens of millions of dollars in bribes. Mr. Caglayan is one of the seven defendants who remain at large.Turkey has been gripped by the trial, with its cast of rich and powerful characters and its enormous sums: billions of dollars in Iranian oil money and bribes in the tens of millions of dollars, allegedly paid to the former economy minister.The Turkish government tried to head off negative news coverage, denouncing the trial in the days before it began as a plot against the government and against Turkey itself.Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said the evidence had been fabricated by followers of the cleric Fethullah Gulen \u2014 who was accused of fomenting last year\u2019s failed coup against Mr. Erdogan \u2014 and that a 2013 Turkish police investigation into the matter had been dismissed for that reason. Mr. Gulen lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.In Turkey\u2019s increasingly authoritarian climate \u2014 a state of emergency has been imposed for more than a year \u2014 newspapers and television channels have largely followed the government line, describing Mr. Zarrab as a hostage and his decision to cooperate with the United States prosecutors as forced.Television chat shows discussed at length his appearance in tan jail attire on the first day of the trial. Only one newspaper, the independent daily Cumhuriyet, dared lead with the most momentous detail: Mr. Zarrab\u2019s statement that Mr. Erdogan had ordered two banks to be included in the scheme.But social media was abuzz with the case all week, and Turks followed live feeds from reporters and online news outlets covering the trial in English and Turkish.The scale of the bribes that Mr. Zarrab said he paid the former minister drew bitter jokes.\u201cThe bribe was 45 or 50 million euros,\u201d one user wrote on Twitter. \u201cI would have to work 11,750 months. That makes nearly a thousand years. 1,000. 1,000!\u201dBurak Acerakis, who campaigns for education for children with Down syndrome, wrote, \u201cWith only 2.6 percent of the bribe taken by Caglayan, 36,000 children with Down syndrome would be able to have pre-education therapy for five years.\u201dNot all the testimony has been riveting, or so it seemed for at least one of the 12 jurors hearing the case. Late on Friday, after Judge Richard M. Berman had excused the jury for the weekend, he announced that he was going to dismiss one juror from the case.His offense? Sleeping.\u201cIt was my observation,\u201d the judge said, \u201cthat one of the jurors in my direct line of sight has been sleeping almost the whole trial.\u201dJudge Berman said that the man \u201cseemed like a very nice fellow,\u201d and he noted that during the jury selection, when he had asked the man what he liked to do in his spare time, the answer was, \u201cSleep.\u201d\u201cThat, maybe, should have told us,\u201d Judge Berman noted.He said he would notify the juror that he had been excused.

The late-1890s house is among a dwindling number of grand mansions that lined one of this port city\u2019s most prestigious thoroughfares. It is near several universities and a quick stroll from the 185-acre Point Pleasant Park.The home, on about a third of an acre, has 7,659 square feet of space and a 3,000-square-foot finished basement, for a total of nine bedrooms and five full and one half bathrooms. Just behind the structure, and included in the sale, is a 1,100-square-foot carriage house, with two more bedrooms, a full bath and a deck that holds a small aboveground pool.The house also has a rich history, said Ethan Michaels of Bryant Realty Atlantic, which has the listing. It was designed by J.C. Dumaresq, a noted Canadian architect at the turn of the last century, and built for the owner of an insurance company and his wife. It had several other owners before becoming vacant in the late 1930s and, at one time, was a boardinghouse.The current owner, whose family had purchased the home in 1974, undertook a major restoration and renovation several years ago, adding, among other things, modern conveniences and outdoor decks, Mr. Michaels said.

{"Headline": "Fed Predicts Modest Economic Growth From Tax Cut", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve, buoyed by a steadily strengthening economy, raised interest rates on Wednesday for a fifth time since the financial crisis and predicted that a proposed tax cut moving through Congress would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation.As a result, the Fed said it did not expect the legislation, which President Trump has called \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the economy, to accelerate the Fed\u2019s plans to raise interest rates in 2018 and indicated it remains on track for three rate increases next year.\u201cMy colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists,\u201d said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman. She said they expected the bill to provide \u201ca modest lift.\u201dThe Fed and Congress are moving in opposite directions. The Fed, in raising rates, is reducing the support it has provided to the economy since the financial crisis. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are preparing a $1.5 trillion tax cut for businesses and individuals with the aim of stimulating economic growth.Some Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, cautioned earlier this year that tax cuts could push the pace of growth to an unsustainable level, resulting in higher inflation, and that the Fed might respond by raising interest rates more quickly, to restrain growth and keep a lid on inflation.\u201cWe continue to think that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants factoring in their assessment of the tax policy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday.In part, the Fed has concluded the tax plan doesn\u2019t pack a large punch. Fed officials predicted that the economy would grow at a 2.5 percent pace next year; the previous forecast was 2.1 percent.President Trump has predicted that the tax plan could deliver 4 percent growth or more.Apprised of those comments by a reporter, Ms. Yellen responded: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned.\u201dThe Fed also has learned that it\u2019s not so easy to increase inflation, which has remained persistently low despite a tightening labor market and strengthening economy. The Fed aims to keep prices rising by 2 percent a year; it is on pace to undershoot that goal for the sixth straight year, and Fed officials on Wednesday predicted a seventh consecutive failure in 2018.But the Fed\u2019s outlook is also politically convenient, even if some analysts described it as overly optimistic. Republicans argue that the tax cuts will deliver a lasting boost to economic growth by encouraging investment. They do not want the Fed to get in the way by raising rates.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, described the Fed\u2019s forecast as \u201chopelessly unrealistic.\u201d He noted that the Fed was predicting that growth would be stronger than it expected, and unemployment would decline further, but without any increase in inflation.\u201cIn short, the Fed forecasts an endless expansion, with minimal inflation pressure,\u201d he said.It would be relatively easy for the Fed to respond if inflation does begin to climb. A thornier problem is the concern voiced by a minority of Fed officials that the central bank is already raising rates too quickly.The Fed\u2019s rate increases have had little impact on financial markets, which have also shrugged off the Fed\u2019s efforts to tighten borrowing conditions. Rates on many loans have declined since the Fed\u2019s most recent rate increase, in June, and credit terms have loosened. Lee Ferridge, head of North American macro strategy for State Street Global Markets, said Wednesday\u2019s decision was \u201ca bit of a nonevent, quite honestly.\u201dAsset prices, which have climbed strongly this year even as the Fed has raised rates, were largely unchanged on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 0.1 percent, closing at 2,662.85. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.34 percent from 2.4 percent on Tuesday.Mr. Ferridge said the ongoing stimulus campaigns by other central banks, notably the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, were offsetting the effect of the Fed\u2019s retreat.\u201cYou\u2019ve still got huge amounts of liquidity coming into the system, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving markets,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Fed tightening, but you\u2019ve got global policy loosening.\u201dSome economists see the lack of tightening in financial markets as a reason for the Fed to raise rates more quickly, to prevent the formation of bubbles that could cause economic disruptions.Ms. Yellen played down such concerns on Wednesday. She said the Fed saw little evidence that a fall in asset prices would cause broader pain.

{"Headline": "The Global Economy Is Partying Like It\u2019s 2008", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAre we about to make the same mistake? All too likely, yes. Certainly, the American economy is doing well, and emerging economies are picking up steam. But global asset prices are once again rising rapidly above their underlying value \u2014 in other words, they are in a bubble. Considering the virtual silence among economists about the danger they pose, one has to wonder whether in a year or two, when those bubbles eventually burst, the queen will not be asking the same sort of question.This silence is all the more surprising considering how much more pervasive bubbles are today than they were 10 years ago. While in 2008 bubbles were largely confined to the American housing and credit markets, they are now to be found in almost every corner of the world economy.He might have added that this bubble has hardly been confined to the sovereign bond market. Indeed, stock values are at lofty heights that have been reached only three times in the last century. At the same time, housing bubbles are all too evident in countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and China, while interest rates have been driven down to unusually low levels for high-yield debt and emerging-market corporate debt.One reason for fearing that these bubbles might soon start bursting is that the years of low interest rates and avid central bank government bond buying that spawned the bubbles now appear to be drawing to an end.Other reasons for fearing that the bubbles might soon start bursting are the fault lines in a number of major economies. Italy has both a serious public debt problem and a shaky banking system. Brazil is experiencing political turmoil while its public finances are on a clearly unsustainable path. China has a housing and credit-market bubble that dwarfs the one in the United States at the start of this century. And both Brazil and Italy will be holding contested parliamentary elections next year.This is not to mention the economic dislocation that could result from a termination of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or from the accentuation of other protectionist tendencies, whether by the United States or by another big country. Nor is it to mention the risk that events in the Korean Peninsula could spin out of control.It is too late for policymakers to do much to prevent bubbles from forming. However, it\u2019s not too early for them to start thinking about how to respond in a manner that might free us from the boom-bust cycles that we seem to be experiencing every 10 years. They could, for example, create a program that in a severe downturn would give every citizen a cash grant to be spent at their discretion, what Milton Friedman called \u201chelicopter money.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether the world\u2019s largest economy can take the lead this time. The Trump administration\u2019s budget-busting tax cuts risk overheating markets even further and limiting the government\u2019s ability to respond when the bubbles pop. This heightens the risk that when the bubbles burst, we\u2019ll be forced to rely yet again on artificially low interest rates, which will set us up yet again for another boom-bust cycle.Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a former deputy director in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s policy development department and a former economic strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Gambler\u2019s Ruin of Small Cities (Wonkish)", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat determined which industries a small city developed? In some cases particular features of the location and nearby resources were important, but often it was more or less random chance at first, then a sequence in which one industry created conditions that favored another.Take the (fairly celebrated) example of Rochester, New York. It started as a flour milling center, benefitting from the Erie Canal, then as a center for nurseries and seeds. So it was a resource-based center. Then, in 1853, John Jacob Bausch, a German immigrant, started a company making monocles, which became a major producer of glasses, microscopes, and all things lens related.So Rochester became a place where people knew about optics, presumably creating the preconditions for the rise of Eastman Kodak, and much later Xerox. This was typical of small industrial cities: even if what a city was doing in, say, 1970 seemed very different from what it was doing in 1880, there was usually a sort of chain of external economies creating the conditions that allowed the city to take advantage of particular new technological and market opportunities when they arose.Obviously, this was a chancy process. Some localized industries created fertile ground for new industries to replace them; others presumably became dead ends. And while a big, diversified city can afford a lot of dead ends, a smaller city can\u2019t. Some small cities got lucky repeatedly, and grew big. Others didn\u2019t; and when a city starts out fairly small and specialized, over a long period there will be a substantial chance that it will lose enough coin flips that it effectively loses any reason to exist.Again, it was not always thus: once upon a time dispersed agriculture ensured that small cities serving rural hinterlands would survive. But for generations we have lived in an economy in which smaller cities have nothing going for them except historical luck, which eventually tends to run out.Notice, by the way, that globalization and all that isn\u2019t central to this story. If I\u2019m right, the conditions for small-city decline and fall have been building for a very long time, and we\u2019d be seeing much the same story \u2013 maybe more slowly \u2013 even without the growth of world trade.Are there policy implications from this diagnosis? Maybe. There are arguably social costs involved in letting small cities implode, so that there\u2019s a case for regional development policies that try to preserve their viability. But it\u2019s going to be an uphill struggle. In the modern economy, which has cut loose from the land, any particular small city exists only because of historical contingency that sooner or later loses its relevance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Saad Hariri Had That Strange Sojourn in Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, was summoned at 8:30 a.m. to the Saudi royal offices \u2014 unseemly early, by the kingdom\u2019s standards \u2014 on the second day of a visit that was already far from what he had expected.Mr. Hariri, long an ally of the Saudis, dressed that morning in jeans and a T-shirt, thinking he was going camping in the desert with the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.But instead he was stripped of his cellphones, separated from all but one of his usual cluster of bodyguards, and shoved and insulted by Saudi security officers. Then came the ultimate indignity: He was handed a prewritten resignation speech and forced to read it on Saudi television.This, it seemed, was the real reason he had been beckoned to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, a day earlier: to resign under pressure and publicly blame Iran, as if he were an employee and not a sovereign leader. Before going on TV, he was not even allowed to go to the house he owns there; he had to ask guards to bring him a suit.As bizarre as the episode was, it was just one chapter in the story of Prince Mohammed, the ambitious young heir apparent determined to shake up the power structure not just of his own country but of the entire region. At home, he has jailed hundreds of fellow princes and businessmen in what he casts as an anticorruption drive. Abroad, he has waged war in Yemen and confronted Qatar.The day Mr. Hariri was ordered to report to Riyadh, he was just a pawn in the crown prince\u2019s overall battle: to rein in the regional ambitions of Saudi Arabia\u2019s longtime rival, Iran.This is the back story of Mr. Hariri\u2019s long, strange sojourn in Saudi Arabia last month, as revealed in behind-the-scenes accounts from a dozen Western, Lebanese and regional officials and associates of Mr. Hariri.After delivering his speech, as his bewildered aides tried in vain to reach him from Beirut, Mr. Hariri did, indeed, eventually spend the evening in the desert with the crown prince, one senior Lebanese official said.Now, he was looking to take out the prime minister of another country, one who was deemed not sufficiently obedient to his Saudi patrons. The prince intended to send a message: It was time to stop Iran\u2019s Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, the powerful Shiite organization that is Lebanon\u2019s most influential political actor, from growing still stronger.The prime minister\u2019s monthlong saga was another example of a brash new leader trying to change the way Saudi Arabia has worked for years, but finding that action often results in unintended consequences, especially in such a complicated region. Now, Mr. Hariri remains in office with new popularity, and Hezbollah is stronger than before.Saudi Arabia\u2019s heavy-handed \u2014 arguably clumsy \u2014 tactics alienated even staunch allies like the United States, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt and much of Mr. Hariri\u2019s Lebanese Sunni party. Saudi Arabia may yet clinch some modest concessions from Lebanon, officials and analysts say, but ones perhaps not worth the diplomatic storm.Mr. Hariri did not respond to multiple requests for comment; he has said publicly that he acted freely and wants to put the Riyadh episode behind him. A senior Saudi official said in a statement only that Mr. Hariri was \u201ctreated with the utmost respect,\u201d resigned of his own accord, and remains an \u201chonored friend\u201d with the kingdom\u2019s support.The Saudi moves that started on Nov. 4 came in rapid-fire succession. In the space of little more than a day, the Saudis extracted Mr. Hariri\u2019s resignation; accused Iran and Lebanon of an act of war after Yemeni rebels fired a missile at Riyadh; and rounded up the princes and businessmen on opaque corruption charges. A week later, they ordered Saudi citizens to evacuate Lebanon.The burst of contentious actions sent war tremors across the region.With anxieties running high, Lebanese officials worked to head off what they feared was a long-range plan by Saudi Arabia to destabilize Lebanon\u2019s volatile Palestinian refugee camps. There were even concerns in Beirut that Saudi Arabia or its Lebanese allies were seeking to form an anti-Hezbollah militia in the camps or elsewhere, two senior Lebanese officials and several Western diplomats said. No such plots came to fruition, and the Saudi official said none were even considered.Western and Arab officials say they are still puzzling over what the Saudis hoped to accomplish with all this intrigue. Several do not rule out the possibility that they aimed to foment internal unrest in Lebanon, or even war.What is clear, they say, is that Saudi Arabia sought to instigate a broad realignment of Lebanese politics to reduce Hezbollah\u2019s power by forcing the collapse of Mr. Hariri\u2019s coalition government, which includes Hezbollah and its allies.But crafting the nimble and activist foreign policy that Prince Mohammed wants requires \u201ca depth of understanding of political dynamics in other countries and an investment in diplomatic ties that can\u2019t be created overnight,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington.\u201cThe competition for power and influence in today\u2019s Middle East has changed significantly,\u201c he said, \u201cand the Saudis are playing catch-up, with very mixed results.\u201dThis risks miscalculations and escalations in a region rived by wars and tensions, he said.Trouble had been brewing for years between Mr. Hariri and the Saudis.Like his father, Rafik, before him, Mr. Hariri owed his political career and considerable family fortune to Saudi backing. But the Saudis grumbled that Mr. Hariri\u2019s government was giving too much sway to Hezbollah, which is both a political party and a militant group not answerable to the state.Mr. Hariri visited Riyadh in late October, and believed he had made the Saudis understand his need to compromise with Hezbollah to avoid political deadlock, officials said. Back in Beirut, to placate the Saudis, he asked Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, through intermediaries, to tone down his blistering speeches against Saudi Arabia\u2019s devastating war in Yemen and Prince Mohammed personally.That same week, a Saudi minister known as a firebrand on Iran, Thamer al-Sabhan, warned Lebanon of \u201castonishing\u201d developments on the horizon and accused Hezbollah of making war on Saudi Arabia.On Nov. 3, Mr. Hariri met with a senior Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, who then praised Iran\u2019s cooperation with Lebanon. That may have been the last straw for the Saudis.Within hours, Mr. Hariri received a message from the Saudi king \u2014 Come now \u2014 ahead of a meeting that had been scheduled days later, a senior Lebanese official said. A well-connected Lebanese analyst, Johnny Munayyer, said the prime minister was invited to spend a day in the desert with the prince.But when he landed in Riyadh, Saudi officials took Mr. Hariri to his house and told him to wait \u2014 not for the king, but for the prince. He waited, from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. No one came.The next morning, he was summoned to meet the prince. There was no customary royal convoy, so Mr. Hariri took his own car. And instead of meeting the prince, officials said, he was manhandled by Saudi officials.Lebanese officials described the long hours between the arrival and the resignation as a \u201cblack box.\u201d They said they were reluctant to press Mr. Hariri for details. When asked, one of them said, Mr. Hariri just looked down at the table and said it was worse than they knew.Saudi Arabia had many pressure points to use against Mr. Hariri. It could threaten to expel the 250,000 or so Lebanese workers in Saudi Arabia, damaging Lebanon\u2019s economy. And since Mr. Hariri is a dual Saudi citizen, with extensive business dealings in a country where kickbacks are endemic, they could threaten him personally. An Arab diplomat said Mr. Hariri was threatened with corruption charges.The prime minister was handed a resignation speech to read, which he did at 2:30 p.m. from a room an official said was down the hall from the prince\u2019s office. The text blamed Hezbollah and claimed his life was in danger; it used words that associates said did not sound like him.Hours later, the Saudi authorities began their corruption roundups, detaining two of Mr. Hariri\u2019s former business partners, a reminder of his own vulnerability.In Lebanon, Western diplomats and Lebanese officials said, the Saudis expected the resignation would be taken at face value and bring about a mass outpouring of popular support from Hezbollah\u2019s opponents. Instead, Lebanon reacted with mass suspicion. No one took to the streets. And Lebanon\u2019s president, Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, refused to accept the resignation unless Mr. Hariri delivered it in person.After disappearing for hours, Mr. Hariri made his first known call to Mr. Aoun, who realized that the prime minister was not speaking freely. Lebanese officials began making the rounds to puzzled Western diplomats with an unusual message: We have reason to believe our prime minister has been detained.Mr. Hariri, the officials said, was eventually placed with Saudi guards in a guesthouse on his own property, forbidden to see his wife and children. Within days, several Western ambassadors visited him there. They came away with conflicting impressions of how free he was. There were two Saudi guards in the room, officials said, and when the diplomats asked if the guards could leave, Mr. Hariri said no, they could stay.Lebanon\u2019s internal intelligence chief, Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, put it this way to envoys who could not quite believe a leader could be forced by foreign officials to resign, a senior official said: \u201cIt\u2019s simple: I could bring two soldiers and put you on TV saying you hate your country.\u201dMeanwhile, the Saudi prince, apparently undaunted by international concerns, summoned yet another leader, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and issued instructions on Palestinian politics. Officials differ on what Mr. Abbas was told in Riyadh. But Lebanese officials were alarmed. They dispatched General Ibrahim and a Palestinian envoy to Amman, Jordan, to debrief Mr. Abbas, three senior Lebanese officials said.Concerns were high for several reasons. The Saudi recommendations to Mr. Abbas could destabilize the fractious Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, a senior Lebanese official said. Separately, a Lebanese ally of the Saudis had urged jihadist factions in one Palestinian camp to form a \u201cSunni resistance\u201d militia to counter Hezbollah \u2014 an idea so dangerous that the jihadists themselves refused, Lebanese and Palestinian officials and a Western diplomat said.The Saudis and Mr. Abbas\u2019s spokesman denied the accounts.On a visit to Washington soon after Mr. Hariri\u2019s televised resignation, Mr. Sabhan, the Saudi minister of gulf affairs, got a withering reception, Western and Arab officials said, from David M. Satterfield, the State Department\u2019s acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs. He demanded that Mr. Sabhan explain why Riyadh was destabilizing Lebanon.Intense diplomacy followed by France, the United States, Egypt and other countries, producing a deal that allowed Mr. Hariri to leave Saudi Arabia.But Prince Mohammed sent him home with a task: to get Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from Yemen, Lebanese officials and Western and Arab diplomats involved in the deal said. That demand proved, the Western and Arab diplomats said, that the prince was not well-informed on Yemen, sometimes called \u201cRiyadh\u2019s Vietnam.\u201d Hezbollah, a Western diplomat said, had only about 50 fighters in Yemen, with Iran playing a much larger role in training and aiding the Houthi insurgents there.To end the war in Yemen, a Lebanese official said, Beirut is \u201cthe wrong P.O. box.\u201dRiyadh did get something out of the turmoil. Lebanese officials are seeking a deal with Hezbollah that could include toning down Hezbollah\u2019s anti-Saudi rhetoric \u2014 as Mr. Hariri requested even before the Riyadh episode \u2014 and shuttering a pro-Houthi television station in Beirut.It remains unclear if Mr. Hariri can deliver enough to placate Riyadh. Mr. Nasrallah\u2019s speeches have omitted critiques of Prince Mohammed lately, and on Wednesday, he called for peace talks in Yemen, a major step.Then again, on Tuesday, Yemen\u2019s Houthis fired another missile at Riyadh.Reporting was contributed by Alissa J.

Development agencies, from the World Bank to the Appalachian Regional Commission, fare little better in Stoll\u2019s estimation, because they cling to the idea that the poor will be saved by \u201cthe same thinking that made them poor in the first place.\u201dStoll\u2019s thesis is built around the concept of dispossession, a theme he returns to repeatedly throughout the book. English peasants dispossessed by the practice of enclosure, an early ancestor of private property rights; Native Americans dispossessed of land by American settlers; Appalachians dispossessed of their subsistence farms by coal mining operations. He rolls his eyes at the idea of an economy constantly progressing in stages \u2014 from the hunter-gatherers to the agrarians to the industrialists. It\u2019s a story we tell ourselves even though, Stoll argues, there\u2019s little evidence to support it. It does, however, serve to justify the dispossession at the heart of much of the American economy.The narrative Stoll substitutes is less linear. Subsistence farming isn\u2019t a relic of the past but a way of life made nearly impossible in Appalachia, not because of historical progress but because of dispossession. Farmers grew what they could, hunted what they could, consumed what they needed and exchanged the rest to satisfy various wants and needs. But population growth and the demands of industrialization overwhelmed the ecological base that subsistence farmers depended on. This drove people to wage-earning work, which in turn accelerated the disappearance of the subsistence farm. The old homestead might have been tough, but it provided the necessities of life along with independence. The wage-based economy, on the other hand, fostered dependence, powerlessness and the privation that comes with depending on the boom-and-bust cycle.If you couldn\u2019t tell already, Stoll has a viewpoint. He explains that he favors \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d and a \u201creinvention of the nation-state.\u201d As a conservative, I often have a different viewpoint. Stoll\u2019s criticisms of the market economy are sometimes needlessly polemic. Capitalism has its problems, of course. But \u201cRamp Hollow\u201d is sometimes so earnest that it ignores obvious complications for its core thesis. Undoubtedly, a lot of West Virginia families suffered in the boom-and-bust coal economy of the early 20th century. But the wealth created in the capitalist economy didn\u2019t just enrich the coal barons, it also enabled the development of new technologies, medicines and professions that made many lives materially better. Over the 20-year period from 1920 to 1940, for instance, child and maternal mortality dropped precipitously in West Virginia.The book\u2019s great strength is that it acknowledges something our politics often fails to: that not everyone wants the same things or possesses the same preferences. Stoll discusses the difference between \u201clowlanders\u201d and \u201chighlanders\u201d of Appalachia, implicitly revealing the importance of culture. \u201cMountaineers needed to think differently about how they did things\u201d about the rapidly changing nature of commercial agriculture, he writes. \u201cBut they approached the landscape with longstanding assumptions that they could not (or would not) adjust or abandon.\u201dFor many, a better future \u2014 the American dream, you might call it \u2014 isn\u2019t about yachts and private jets, but about simpler pursuits: family comfort instead of wealth, stability instead of dynamism and a life rooted in a thriving community rather than individual achievement. Our public policy sometimes ignores this, pretending, for instance, that struggling people just need a good educational or work opportunity to achieve some measure of success in the modern economy. But maybe they need something different \u2014 emotional skills that their traumatic family life deprived them of; a social community or civic organization that behavior or circumstance destroyed. Or, as Stoll encourages us to consider, maybe they don\u2019t want \u201csuccess\u201d in the modern economy at all. Maybe they just want a warm fire and a nice garden. \u201cRamp Hollow\u201d reminds us that integrating some people into the modern economy will always be a difficult challenge, even as Stoll questions the wisdom of such an integration in the first place.I disagreed with much of this challenging, interesting and engrossing book. But it made me think. And that, it seems to me, is the whole point.J.D. Vance is the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d and a contributing opinion writer for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Tries to Play Nice, After a Year of Bashing Europe", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThroughout 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey seemed to go out of his way to thumb his nose at onetime friends and allies.Relations with the United States were not much better, as both countries tightened visa requirements in a crisis ignited by Turkey\u2019s arrest of two of its citizens who worked for the State Department in Turkey.With just days left before the end of the year, however, Mr. Erdogan appears to have had a change of heart.On Wednesday night, Mr. Erdogan signaled a rapprochement with European leaders in an interview with Turkish reporters aboard a plane to Tunisia.\u201cWe have no problems with Germany, the Netherlands or Belgium,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cTo the contrary, those who are in the governments of these countries are my old friends.\u201dHe also said he hoped to visit Paris to meet with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and to travel to the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis.By now, the crosswinds of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s public statements have sealed his reputation as a leader of changeable temperament who seems to shift Turkey\u2019s policies along with his moods.Analysts of Turkish politics were divided on the reasons behind the Turkish president\u2019s about-face, but some took it as a sign of his desperation at ending the year ostracized internationally.Traditionally, Turkey, a fulcrum between Europe and the Middle East, has tried to maintain good relations with its many neighbors.Bashing Europe serves a domestic purpose: By demonizing the West, he hopes to win over voters disappointed with Turkey\u2019s struggling economy or ambivalent about the extent of the crackdown.In September, Mr. Erdogan returned to a theme by accusing German politicians of Nazism for questioning whether Turkey should join the European Union.Mr. Erdogan has been shunned by several European leaders since February and March, when he lashed out at their refusal to allow his ministers to campaign on European soil during the lead-up to his referendum.For his part, Mr. Erdogan is furious that other European countries offer sanctuary to Turkish Kurds campaigning for greater autonomy in southeastern Turkey, as well as to those he accuses of complicity in the failed putsch.But there is also little doubt that Mr. Erdogan is in need of allies, even if they are issue-specific.Speaking to reporters, Mr. Erdogan attributed his peace offering to the fact that Germany and Holland had supported his opposition to President Trump\u2019s decision to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, in contravention of international law.\u201cI asked for their support on Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe are all on the same page.\u201d\u201cThe centrality of Jerusalem for Erdogan and his administration \u2014 you can\u2019t underestimate that,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said.But relations soured this year even with formerly staunch partners, like the United States, even before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to move the United States Embassy in Israel.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s bodyguards attacked protesters in Washington in April; American forces continued to work with Syrian Kurdish troops, whom Mr. Erdogan views as terrorists; and United States prosecutors charged a Turkish gold trader who later alleged Mr. Erdogan\u2019s involvement in a criminal scheme.Though Turkey has improved its ties with Russia, particularly since the failed coup, the two governments disagree on the role of Kurdish militias in northern Syria and even, it seems, on the future role of President Bashar al-Assad.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s attempts at a rapprochement are unlikely to substantially improve European ties, since he has passed the point of no return with many European leaders, said Mr. Pierini, the former European Union ambassador.Mr. Erdogan has made \u201ca complete misreading of the mood in Europe,\u201d Mr. Pierini said. \u201cAfter the incidents last March and September, there is a broken bridge.\u201dTurkey\u2019s assistance in the battle against the Islamic State, particularly as large numbers of European fighters try to return to Europe via Turkey, may persuade some European leaders to re-establish good relations with Ankara, Mr. Cagaptay said.But Mr. Erdogan, who has so often reaped domestic rewards from stoking arguments with Europe, may himself be unwilling to commit to a long-term thaw in the European-Turkish relationship.\u201cIf Erdogan sees his poll numbers are still not great,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said, \u201che won\u2019t think for a minute before creating another crisis with European countries.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When fully opened, Resorts World will employ about 2,000 people, the casino says.It is by far the largest and most luxurious of the four new casinos licensed under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s gambling expansion.\u201cThis is a potential major economic boom for upstate New York,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in 2013. \u201cWe think it\u2019s one of the best possibilities we have.\u201dUnlike the other casinos, Resorts World is only 90 miles northwest of New York City and the densely populated suburbs of Westchester County and northern New Jersey. The operators aim to dominate that market, while tapping into Asian gamblers and high rollers from the United States, England and Asia by emphasizing the kind of plush amenities found in Las Vegas.This is destination gambling, different than most of the other New York casinos, which are designed to be convenient to gamblers within a 50-mile radius.\u201cIt\u2019s intended to be an integrated resort,\u201d said Ryan Eller, chief executive of Empire Resorts, which owns the casino, as he conducted a tour of the property. \u201cNot only one of the most luxurious options on the East Coast, but one that addresses a wider range of customers with golf, dining, entertainment and a family option.\u201dGenting operates massive casino resorts in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Birmingham, England. More recently, it has pushed into the United States, with a casino in Las Vegas and Resorts World New York, an electronic slot machine parlor at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.In November, workers began installing 2,157 electronic slot machines on the 100,000-square-foot casino floor. The machines, with all the latest bells and whistles, cost up to $25,000 apiece. There are also 134 table games and 19 poker tables.Gamblers will have a view of the forest and hills surrounding the property through large windowed walls.Almost a quarter of the casino floor is devoted to Asian-oriented table games, such as baccarat and Pai gow. There will be Chinese-speaking dealers and Asian restaurants.An escalator rises to the poker room, and high rollers can take a private elevator up to a \u201cgarden suite\u201d on the third floor, where there will be two-story villas with interior pools, all with their own butlers. The top floor of the hotel has presidential suites that are larger than the average American home.\u201cIt\u2019s about status,\u201d Mr. Eller said, \u201csomething you can\u2019t get anywhere else.\u201dResorts World New York City claimed the title for highest grossing slots in the country almost the day after it opened.The $440 million Del Lago opened in February and is now expected to fall $100 million short of its $263 million first-year projection. It is competing with both a racetrack casino and two tribal casinos nearby.\u201cThese are projections and numbers put together years ago,\u201d said Jeff Babinski, general manager of the Del Lago. \u201cThe economy has changed. We\u2019re not hitting those forecast numbers.\u201dBut, he said, the casino has contributed tax revenue to the state, employed about 1,200 people and boosted tourism in the Finger Lakes.At some point, however, the casino will close if it cannot make enough money to pay its loans.\u201cThe results have been less than overwhelming,\u201d said Colin Mansfield, a gambling analyst at Fitch Ratings, a financial information company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scratching our heads.

Steve Wynn, the gambling impresario, is opening the $2.4 billion Wynn Boston Harbor casino resort in Everett, Mass., in 2019. Mr. Wynn\u2019s business model is also for an integrated resort.And MGM plans to open the $950 million MGM Springfield in central Massachusetts later this year.

And Pennsylvania recently approved adding up to 10 \u201csatellite casinos\u201d to the 12 casinos already operating in the state.But many residents of the Catskills, hardened by the decades-long talk of revival, are now optimistic.Alicia Bakken, 25, who labored over a green felt blackjack table at a \u201cdealer\u2019s school\u201d in a storefront in Monticello earlier this month, said the county was finally on the way up.\u201cSullivan County has come a long way,\u201d said Ms. Bakken, a lifelong resident. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a better environment for everybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2009, almost every Republican in Congress opposed a $787 billion stimulus plan in the midst of an economic crisis because they said it would cause a dangerous increase in the federal debt.Nine years later, during one of the longest economic expansions in American history, almost every Republican in Congress \u2014 including Mr. McConnell, now the majority leader \u2014 supports a tax plan that is projected to cause an even larger increase in the federal debt.Republicans got to that extraordinary point by a tangled path. First they argued that the tax cuts would stimulate the economy enough to pay for themselves, only to be confronted on Thursday with a report that said the cuts would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade. That bad news led to last-minute convulsions and a frantic search for more revenue.But in the end, the political imperative to pass what would be the only major piece of legislation of President Trump\u2019s first year, along with a near-religious Republican belief in tax cuts, overrode their previous concerns about fiscal prudence.All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted for the bill early Saturday.The House and the Senate still have to reach a final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump has to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy.Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding \u201cnearly all the hard choices.\u201dMr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt.Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. \u201cI think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cMy preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.\u201dHe continued in words that now seem particularly striking. \u201cWhat I hope we will clearly avoid, and I\u2019m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cTake you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.\u201dHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House\u2019s version of the tax bill \u2014 which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade \u2014 has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt.Senate Republicans\u2019 tax cut would not pay for itself, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.In 2011 he released \u201cThe Path to Prosperity,\u201d a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary.\u201cWhat I do know is I can\u2019t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn\u2019t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC.In 2013, he said the debt \u201cwill weigh down our country like an anchor.\u201dAt the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II.\u201cPassing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,\u201d Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month.A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as \u201ccurious.\u201dRepublicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending.\u201cYou also have to bring spending under control,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. \u201cAnd not discretionary spending. That isn\u2019t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.\u201dThe tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge.\u201cReagan proved that deficits don\u2019t matter,\u201d Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration\u2019s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point.But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,\u201d Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week.But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Top Ideologue Calls for Tight Control of Internet", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWUZHEN, China \u2014 Little heard from but hugely influential, the professor-turned-Communist theoretician who has been a major adviser to three Chinese leaders finally stepped out of the shadows on Sunday.Known as the brain behind President Xi Jinping, Wang Huning made his first major speech since joining the Politburo Standing Committee, the seven-member group that rules China, at a conference created to show off the country\u2019s technological strengths to the world.Well known for his icy remove and support of authoritarianism, Mr. Wang called for security and order on the internet as part of five proposals he made to guide the future of cyberspace. He also emphasized China\u2019s technological prowess, and said more should be done by the government to guide the development of new industries like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.Mr. Wang stepped onto the world stage before an audience that included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, along with an all-star cast of Chinese tech entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma of Alibaba.Mr. Wang, 62, had emerged as the ideological counselor to Chinese leaders and the wordsmith of Mr. Xi\u2019s more authoritarian style before being tapped to join the Standing Committee at a Communist Party congress in Beijing two months ago. A close confidant of Mr. Xi and the two previous Chinese presidents, Mr. Wang was promoted despite never having governed a province or run a state ministry.On Sunday, Mr. Wang praised China\u2019s president for his \u201cdeep understanding\u201d of internet governance. He said the international community had \u201cwarmly received\u201d Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas about the internet, including the concept of cybersovereignty \u2014 a Chinese policy term used to argue that countries should be free to control the internet within their borders, even if it means censoring.\u201cGlobal cyberspace governance has no onlookers \u2014 we are all participants,\u201d he said, adding that \u201call parties\u201d should have a say over how the internet is managed across the world.The speech echoed arguments that Mr. Wang has made before. In the 1990s, as a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, he wrote that because China was so large and poor, it needed a stronger hand from the government to push through economic development. He said that such authoritarian rule was necessary for China to restore its national greatness after what the Communist Party has often described as a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.This has made Mr. Wang a longtime skeptic of calls for China to allow greater democracy despite his extensive experience abroad, including in the United States. And while he has said he admires the strength of the United States, Mr. Wang has also been deeply wary of American power.His speech on Sunday showed how China\u2019s vision of the internet attempts to wrestle with such tension. Chinese leaders have long lauded the economic power of the internet, while being deeply cautious about its democratizing and internationalizing influence.In his speech, Mr. Wang highlighted China\u2019s openness and the need for equal access to the internet. Yet China has led the way in cutting its internet off from the world with filters and blocks known as the Great Firewall of China. It has also blocked internet access in areas where members of minority groups live, to limit the potential for unrest.While many major foreign websites are blocked in China, the wireless connections at the conference allowed open access to the global internet. A promotional video that was shown before Mr. Wang\u2019s speech showed the web connecting China to the world, ignoring the existence of the Great Firewall.For the format of his talk, Mr. Wang followed the lead of Mr. Xi. His offering of five proposals appeared to have been inspired by a speech by Mr. Xi at the second World Internet Conference, when the president offered five ideas for developing the internet.Mr. Lu\u2019s successor, Xu Lin, was present at the conference, which also included more prominent foreign chief executives than in the past, including Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr. Cook of Apple. Analysts say Mr. Xu has been ordered to consolidate the administration\u2019s power, and also turn the conference into a higher-profile event.In his speech, Mr. Cook highlighted Apple\u2019s contribution to China\u2019s economy, saying that Chinese developers have earned more than 112 billion renminbi, or $16.9 billion, by selling apps to Apple users, more than developers from any other country.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Wang Huning, the Standing Committee member. He is 62, not 63.Carolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is a recognition of the swarms of consumers who are flooding back into shops and websites on a rising tide of returns, exchanges and gift cards.Five years ago, only 5 percent of consumers planned to shop after Christmas, according to a Deloitte survey. This year, nearly 40 percent will.Retailers, as they do every year, are discounting leftover stacks of reindeer-emblazoned sweaters. But some are also displaying new merchandise at full price to attract impulse buyers emboldened by store credit and confidence in the economy. Seasonal workers are being assigned longer shifts. Stores are extending their hours.But the vibrant holiday season has kindled hopes among some that the \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d has perhaps hit bottom. Since sales forecasts were released in November, Macy\u2019s stock has climbed 45 percent, and Abercrombie & Fitch is up 40 percent.Recently, the last week of the year has started to feel \u201ca little like a stretched-out Black Friday,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a consulting firm.\u201cThis week has, over the years, been gradually assuming more and more importance in the overall mix,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailers want to get a second bite at the apple.\u201dAnd Ms. Mezzacappa, a homemaker, has still more spending planned.\u201cI wanted a shirt, I had it in my hand, but there was only one register open and a line out the door,\u201d she said of her trip to the New York mall. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just order it online.\u201dE-commerce continues to gobble up most of the growth in retail sales.More e-commerce means more returns, as more online retailers try to entice customers by allowing them to change their minds frequently and easily. Online return rates are frequently double that of brick-and-mortar businesses and are extremely costly to companies.But even returns can have a silver lining when the economy is strong and consumers are in a spending mood, as they are this year.And customers who receive store credit are often inclined to think of the value as free money, according to behavioral economists.A similar psychology applies with gift cards: Shoppers with a gift card in 2017 overspent its value by an average of $38, up $10 from last year, according to First Data, a payment technology company. Americans bought more physical and digital gift cards this year than in each of the previous three years, according to the company.Several brands are taking advantage, making a wider selection of fresh spring merchandise available at full price and mixing it in with clearance items in hopes of luring customers who are wielding new gift cards or who have just unloaded returns.J. C. Penney cut the number of discounts and deals in its print circular ad for this week by 72 percent compared with the same week last year, according to an analysis by Market Track, a retail and advertising data company. Kohl\u2019s cut its deals by 67 percent, and Target by 33 percent.\u201cThe race to the bottom is basically over,\u201d said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at RSR, a retail technology research firm.\u201cSome years, it\u2019s a panic game,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s like retailers have woken out of a dream, a weird dream filled with doorbusters, and are now starting to play the game right.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans\u2019 Tax Bill Nears the Finish Line", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Lawmakers are expected to be briefed on the consensus deal later on Wednesday, ahead of a final vote next week.\u2022 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she does not see any reason to delay the votes in light of the Alabama election\u2022 Lower the corporate tax rate to 21 percent;\u2022 Go into effect in 2018;\u2022 Lower the top individual tax rate to 37 percent;\u2022 Eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax;\u2022 Allow individuals to choose whether to deduct up to $10,000 in income, sales or property taxes.See how the changes compare with the versions passed by the House and Senate \u00bbHouse and Senate Republicans tasked with merging the two tax bills have reached agreement on a consensus bill and are expected to put it to a final vote next week. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said on Wednesday that members will be briefed on the details later in the day and said he\u2019s confident it will pass next week.The conference committee that was created to merge the House and Senate tax bills began its one public meeting on Wednesday afternoon and Democrats immediately denounced the gathering as an exercise in trying to make the tax overhaul look transparent.\u201cLet\u2019s understand what\u2019s happening today is a sham,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cNobody ought to mistake this conference for real debate.\u201dSenator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, said the \u201cso-called conference committee,\u201d as he put it, \u201cis a farce.\u201dMembers of the committee assembled for their public session in a basement meeting room in the Capitol, and the partisan skirmishing began right at the outset.Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, asked that the conference committee postpone its work until Doug Jones, the winner of Tuesday\u2019s special election for Senate in Alabama, is sworn into office.The lawmaker presiding over the meeting, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the motion was not allowed.Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, quickly clashed with Mr. Brady over his handling of the meeting, reminding him that the session was not being conducted under \u201cPutin rules.\u201dDemocrats also denounced the substance of the tax overhaul.\u201cThe American people are witnessing a master class in how one political party, relying on secrecy, distortion and brute force, can muscle an unpopular, deficit exploding corporate giveaway to passage,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThis is the ultimate betrayal of the middle class.\u201dThe gathering will be one of the final times that Democrats will be able to publicly criticize the tax legislation while being face-to-face with the Republicans who are crafting it. Thus far, they have largely assailed the partisan process and argued that the bill benefits the rich and corporations and doesn\u2019t do enough to help the middle class.For Republicans, the public meeting is largely for show, as the final negotiations happened behind closed doors and the major details have already been agreed upon. Republicans are planning to pass the bill along party lines and have so far rebuffed Democrats\u2019 requests to change the bill.The odds remain strong that congressional Republicans will send a consensus tax bill to Mr. Trump, despite Democrats\u2019 upset Senate victory in Alabama on Tuesday.The news that Doug Jones, a Democrat, had defeated Roy Moore, a Republican, in the election immediately sent many liberal activists dreaming of another improbable win: blocking the tax bill.Math and momentum fueled that activist optimism. Once Mr. Jones is seated in the Senate, Republicans\u2019 majority in the chamber will narrow to a single seat. The tax bill passed the Senate on a 51-49 vote, with one Republican, Bob Corker of Tennessee, defecting. The hope among liberals was that Mr. Jones\u2019 victory would give other Republicans pause and delay the process of reconciling the bills.That seems unlikely to happen, however. Lawmakers have agreed on the contours of a final deal and an influential Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, said she saw no reason to wait for Mr. Jones to be seated before voting on the tax bill.Republicans have resolved the differences between the two versions of their tax bill.Those scenarios still appear highly unlikely. Republican leaders are prepared to hold votes early next week on the measure, well before the Alabama results are expected to be certified, making Mr. Jones eligible to be seated. Party leaders remain confident Mr. Trump will sign the bill before Christmas \u2014 most likely before Mr. Jones enters the Senate.The one wrinkle from Tuesday night, for Republicans and the bill, is that the results empower individual senators to demand even more from the leadership for their votes. Ms. Collins and Marco Rubio of Florida have both raised concerns this week about the compromise bill as it is shaping up. Party leaders may be forced to address their concerns or apply more pressure to keep them, and possibly others, in line.But even if Republicans were to defect en masse in the Senate, the tax bill could still sail to Mr. Trump \u2014 if House Republicans were to approve the version that passed the Senate. That version included some apparent drafting errors that have upset business interests, most notably the rate of the corporate alternative minimum tax. But in a worst-case scenario, party leaders could decide that bill is better than no bill at all, and promise to return to fix the provisions later \u2014 an echo of how Democrats proceeded to pass the Affordable Care Act after they lost a similarly stunning Senate special election, in Massachusetts, in 2010.Democrats are mounting a concerted, though likely fruitless, effort to get Republican leadership in the Senate to delay the tax bill vote until Mr. Jones is seated as a senator from Alabama.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to \u201chit pause on his tax bill\u201d after the Democratic candidate won the special election for Senate in Alabama on Tuesday.\u201cIt would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the newly elected senator from Alabama the opportunity to cast his vote,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday morning.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon similarly said the bill should be delayed until Mr. Jones arrives, saying in a tweet \u201cThe people of Alabama have spoken.\u201dMr. Trump hosted Republican lawmakers working on tax legislation for lunch at the White House. Flanked by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, Mr. Trump gave brief remarks on the tax plan.\u201cWe\u2019re very close to getting it done, we\u2019re very close to voting,\u201d he said.The White House on Wednesday released a name of those dining with Mr. Trump, including Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, eight Republican senators and Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.Ahead of the Conference Committee meeting, Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee will be joined by House Democratic leaders for a noon \u201cforum\u201d on the Republican tax legislation.House Democrats have invited economists including Mark Zandi, of Moody\u2019s Analytics, and Jason Furman, former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to participate.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has come under attack from Democrats for using \u201cfake math\u201d to defend the Republican tax plan, was also invited. He is not expected to attend.Liberal activists are planning to fan across the Capitol on Wednesday to try to flip Republican members of Congress who they think could be persuaded to change their minds on the tax bill.Members of Housing Works, the Center for Popular Democracy, Women\u2019s March, Hedge Clippers, People for Bernie, Strong Economy for All Coalition are planning to stage sit-ins at the offices of Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona.Ady Barkan, a progressive activist with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who confronted Mr. Flake on an airplane last week, is headlining the rally. According to one of its organizers, he is also hoping to have a meeting with Ms. Collins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Street Clashes, Argentina\u2019s Congress Passes Pension Overhaul", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 After days of intense clashes outside Argentina\u2019s Congress that left scores injured and led to at least 70 arrests, lawmakers on Tuesday approved a contentious bill tightening pension and social welfare benefits. The bill\u2019s passage was a victory for President Mauricio Macri, but resistance to the changes has put him on the defensive.\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for him so he could take money from my pocket,\u201d said Cecilia Fern\u00e1ndez, 68, one of thousands who took to the streets late Monday to bang pots and pans to protest against the bill.On Monday, when Congress reconvened, tens of thousands took to the streets to protest the bill, and the country\u2019s largest union federation called a general strike that paralyzed the country\u2019s airports.A few hundred protesters attacked police officers with rocks, setting off clashes that dragged on for hours. Officers clad in riot gear responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets.As night fell and the violence eased, thousands took to the streets with pots and pans. Some were protesting the pension overhaul, while others said they were denouncing the rare outbreak of political violence.The clashes left 141 people injured, including 88 police officers, and led to the detention of 70 people in Buenos Aires, according to the state-run news agency T\u00e9lam. At least 28 journalists were injured covering the protest, according to Sipreba, a journalist union.Mr. Macri\u2019s allies in the lower house of Congress rejected pleas from the opposition to suspend the session on Monday and worked well into Tuesday morning.The changes in the bill link increases in social welfare benefits to inflation and salaries, rather than tax revenue and salaries. The bill was approved 127 to 117 after 17 hours of debate. The Senate had passed the measure last month.\u201cDespite everything they did, we demonstrated that democracy works in Argentina,\u201d Mr. Macri said Tuesday morning as he condemned the violence of the previous day as \u201cclearly orchestrated and premeditated.\u201dThe changes will save the government about $3.2 billion next year, amounting to 0.4 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, according to Gabriel Zelpo, the chief economist at Elypsis, a research and consulting company based in Buenos Aires.While the changes will help Mr. Macri reduce the deficit, the savings will be marginal because pension and welfare rolls have nearly doubled over the past decade and will remain \u201cin serious need of reform,\u201d according to Ariel Barraud, president of the Argentine Fiscal Analysis Institute.\u201cThe level of conflict that even this simple proposal generates shows how controversial any change to the system will be,\u201d Mr. Barraud said.A survey by the polling company Ricardo Rouvier and Associates showed that two out of three Argentines rejected the overhaul, which the opposition has characterized as an austerity move.\u201cThis is clearly an unpopular measure no matter how you look at it,\u201d Mr. Rouvier said. \u201cFor the first time it hit at the heart of one of Macri\u2019s key bases of support.\u201dPension changes are politically fraught across much of Latin America, as politicians have sought to rein in spending during a period of recession or economic slowdown.\u201cMost pension systems in Latin America were designed with the demographics of the 20th century\u201d in mind, said Carlos V\u00e9gh, the chief economist for Latin America at the World Bank. \u201cLife expectancy was far lower.\u201dThe protests that took place on Monday in Buenos Aires illustrate how Mr. Macri\u2019s victory in the midterm elections was a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Esperanza Casullo, a political-science professor at the R\u00edo Negro National University in southern Argentina. \u201cThere is a bewilderment in certain segments of society by what was an abrupt change of message: from assuring people they would not lose any benefits to saying that we all have to sacrifice a little bit.\u201dMr. Macri conveyed that message again on Tuesday morning, making it clear that change was necessary.\u201cThere are nights that I have trouble sleeping due to the quantity and magnitude of the changes we have to make,\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do more than what we did in the past, we won\u2019t have a future.\u201dErnesto Londo\u00f1o contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

But maintaining it requires some hard work \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.Even in the bleak period after the fall had left the trees bare but before the snow would cover the decaying leaves, Vermont is a lovely place to visit \u2014 it makes you seriously consider living a slower-paced life.For skiers in the Northeast who are tired of the cost and the crowds at ski resorts, there have been few alternatives. That is starting to change with grass roots organizations that bring together enthusiastic skiers, snowboarders and the local community to work with the Forest Service and private landowners to cultivate areas with good downhill ski terrain away from resorts. This is human-powered skiing \u2014 there are no lifts, and you must hike, snowshoe or, ideally, skin. (To skin, you attach strips of fabric to the bottom of your skis to make them grip the snow. It is an efficient way to get to the top of a mountain, similar to Nordic skiing but with less glide and more traction.)The advantage to skiing these newly created areas over other backcountry terrain is that the glades and trails are well-planned and maintained with skiing in mind. They also are easier to follow because the routes are defined, and maps of the terrain are readily available.\u201cThere was a lot of concern at first \u2014 reactions from people as if it was going to blow out people\u2019s backcountry stashes. That isn\u2019t our intent,\u201d Mr. McCusker said, referring to some local skepticism about the project. Jeff Flavell, from nearby Salisbury, Vt., and my group\u2019s leader for the day, spoke vaguely about skiing the area before it was legitimized, but his pride in the work RASTA has done displaced any ideas that there isn\u2019t enough terrain for everyone to enjoy. Mr. Flavell even showed us some of the more hard to find trails, which he could easily have kept to himself.Holly Knox, the district recreation program manager for the Rochester and Middlebury Ranger Districts, described the Forest Service\u2019s relationship with RASTA as one of the first projects where federal land is actively managed for the purpose of uphill travel for downhill skiing and snowboarding. \u201cA lot of places have backcountry skiing on federal land where they don\u2019t need to manage for it. Out West you can naturally ski through the trees because you don\u2019t have the same amount of undergrowth that you see here,\u201d Ms. Knox said.She added that around 2009 she had received a few requests from individuals asking for new places to ski in the area\u2019s backcountry, but there was no unified voice for the skiers and the Forest Service didn\u2019t have experience working with downhill skiers.That changed when RASTA formed in the winter of 2013, organizing the backcountry ski community in central Vermont. The first several years were mostly devoted to planning: RASTA was looking for good terrain and the Forest Service was looking at ecological, infrastructure and safety concerns.Despite New Hampshire\u2019s proximity to Vermont the natural ski terrain has stark differences. \u201cWe have the benefits of the high alpine of the Presidential Mountains here in New Hampshire, but we don\u2019t have that below treeline ski network of trails,\u201d Mr. Ray said about the backcountry ski landscape in New Hampshire.Mr. Ray said that the goal of the alliance is to develop a portfolio of terrain options so that skiers and snowboarders can choose areas to visit depending on weather, time of day or any of the other complex factors involved in planning backcountry travel.As the day progressed we moved across the mountain like a herd of goats. Climbing up, over and down the steep hillside, we tore through all the downed trees and branches that stood in our path. With 10 of us working at a moderate pace we found ourselves in a meadow with tall grass and hardwood trees at the top of the mountain in about an hour.I enjoy the meditative state I often fall into while doing physical labor, so a day in the mountains of Vermont seems like a guilt-free and productive vacation. I rarely find myself on beaches because I feel like I should be busy, and end up leaving more anxious than when I arrived. My sweat and dirty hands on my day in the mountains were an investment in future vacations that others will enjoy as well.My mind wandered and my body continued with the task at hand. Visions of what the landscape will look like covered in snow started to emerge. I remembered what it feels like to glide in the snow and I kept thinking of how I would ride over the rocky lumps and rolls all the way down to the valley below. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pop Music in 2017: Glum and Glummer", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cXO TOUR Llif3\u201d isn\u2019t some avant-garde obscurity or oddball cult discovery; it\u2019s a major hit. Since its release in February, it has been streamed half a billion times on Spotify alone, with more than 130 million views of its YouTube video.The tone of that song \u2014 mournful, dazed, sullen, traumatized, self-absorbed, defensive, remote, morbid \u2014 was pervasive in the pop of 2017. Hit radio and popularity-driven algorithmic playlists lingered on bleak, bummed-out sounds and scenarios, stringing together music that shares the feeling of being alienated, unprotected and besieged.One pop response is a 2017 hit like Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d which itemizes her revenue streams over a somber minor-mode loop and ratchety drum-machine sounds, offering only the prospect of endless hustling against merciless competition. She\u2019s got hers, while you\u2019re on your own and already being left behind.The attitude was similar on the year\u2019s blockbuster album release, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cReputation,\u201d which sold more than a million copies in four days. The \u201cold Taylor\u201d \u2014 a sharp-witted yet approachable young woman dealing with inexplicably callous boyfriends \u2014 was replaced by a grown-up, unabashed celebrity, lashing out at detractors and flaunting how manipulative she could be, often backed by harsh, unyielding electronics.Now, that hope has moved out of reach. Although DJ-producers are still busy, a big, happy thump is no longer inevitable. Rhythm tracks are just as often hollowed-out and sporadic, with a beat that\u2019s inferred rather than spelled out; kick drums arrive as eruptions rather than foundations. Often, percussion sounds are spattered intermittently around a bass line, or they tick steadily like a suspense-film soundtrack \u2014 more haunted house than dance floor.The voices are isolated in a cold electronic space, and with Auto-Tune and other effects, they become half-robotic, severed from physical breath and moisture, moaning from inside the machine. The music favors doleful minor keys and skeletal harmonies. Plush, comforting sounds are in retreat; instead, instruments are often sparse and brittle, electronically desiccated or sampled through static.The dominant sound of 2017, austere and ominous, continues the long, steady ascent of trap music, which emerged out of Southern rap in the early 2000s. (It was already coalescing when T.I. named his 2003 album \u201cTrap Muzik.\u201d) It used the flatly artificial sounds of an early drum machine, the Roland TR-808, for its distinctive high-hats and cymbals; below them were shadowy spaces and an unhurried, viscous pulse. Trap\u2019s sinister mood was originally associated with lyrics about trap houses, where drugs are sold, and other chronicles of crime and deprivation, and it has never lost its ominous aura. But by 2017, even Taylor Swift was using elements of trap in songs like \u201c\u2026 Ready for It?\u201dTrap has also turned out to be symbiotic with streaming, as more listeners get their music online. Previews of the 2017 annual report by Nielsen Music, which tabulates music consumption, announced that on-demand streaming rose by 59 percent over 2016, raising the importance of the playlists offered by streaming services like Spotify. Along with the rise in streaming, what Nielson classifies as \u201cR&B/Hip-Hop\u201d became the most popular genre. Trap, already widespread, could only benefit.Although recording technology now allows infinite multitracking, the earbud playback and low-fi formats of most music online reward using just a handful of discrete sounds. Computer speakers and MP3 compression, like the transistor radios of yore, can\u2019t do full justice to music that relies on deep bass and rich combinations of instruments. The EDM-driven pop hits of recent years sound anemic without club subwoofers, and even hitmaking DJ-producers like Kygo and Zedd have now somewhat stripped down their approaches.The two streaming titans of 2017 \u2014 \u201cDespacito\u201d by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee and (in a bilingual remix) Justin Bieber, and \u201cShape of You\u201d by Ed Sheeran \u2014 offered the traditional pop blandishments of seduction and courtship. But both the reggaeton beat of \u201cDespacito\u201d and the plinky, vaguely Caribbean beat of \u201cShape of You\u201d are lean and crisp, ideal for earbuds.Meanwhile, the clickety constructions of trap come through even a tiny tweeter. And trap, with roots in the most unsparing hip-hop and a deep sense of dread built into its sound, expanded its hold on pop because it resonated more and more with a national mood of uncertainty and fear.The election of 2016 and the first year of the Trump administration have heightened the divisions in America: of race, gender, class, faith, geography. Popular music, at its best, has always promised to unify its audience for a shared good time, to overcome differences with a beat and a tune. But in this anxious, tribalized year, that was well beyond the reach of pop. It could only gird listeners for worse to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Middle-Class Tax Cut? Americans Aren\u2019t Buying It", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublican congressional leaders say their tax overhaul would raise wages, accelerate economic growth and give middle-class families a badly needed tax cut.They are having a hard time convincing Americans of those claims.The confusion probably stems in part from the complexity of the bill, which would increase the size of some tax breaks while reducing or eliminating others. And it could also reflect the unpopularity of President Trump.Cindy Kelly, an art director for a television station in Orlando, Fla., is the kind of person who might ordinarily support the tax bill. A political moderate, she said she was optimistic that a corporate tax cut could lead companies to create jobs and increase wages. And as a middle-class resident of a low-tax state, she would most likely come out ahead.But Ms. Kelly, 54, said she doubted that the bill would cut taxes for her or other middle-class Americans. She said her skepticism stemmed from one factor: Mr. Trump.\u201cI just can\u2019t be too happy about it over all,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cI have such a strong distrust of the president.\u201dThe SurveyMonkey poll, taken before the final tax bill was out, found that 58 percent of Americans disapproved of the bill, while only 37 percent supported it. An earlier version of the poll, conducted in November, found 52 percent disapproval.In the latest poll, only 29 percent of respondents said they felt that the plan would lead to substantially higher economic output a decade from now, and only 18 percent believed Republican assertions that the bill would not add to the federal deficit. (Even two-thirds of Republicans said either that the bill would increase the deficit over the next decade or that they weren\u2019t sure.)The skepticism is shared by economists, who overwhelmingly say the bill would increase the deficit while giving only a modest boost to the economy.Perhaps most striking, however, is the skepticism about how the bill would affect taxpayers personally. Using demographic and other data provided by survey respondents, The Times estimated how likely they were to receive a tax cut. Even among people with more than a 90 percent chance of getting a cut, about half said they did not expect to get one.Jessica Brescher, who works for a pharmaceutical company, has been trying to figure out how the bill would affect her. A resident of high-tax New Jersey, Ms. Brescher said she worried that Republicans\u2019 plan to repeal or reduce the deduction for state and local taxes could make her home unaffordable and force her to move. On the other hand, as the mother of twin boys, she would benefit from a planned increase in the child tax credit.In the SurveyMonkey poll, Ms. Brescher, 34, said she did not expect a tax cut under the bill. She later plugged her information into an online calculator, which told her that she could expect a modest tax cut next year. But with the bill\u2019s details changing seemingly every day, Ms. Brescher now doesn\u2019t know what to think.\u201cI\u2019m a scientist, I know numbers, but I don\u2019t know money numbers,\u201d Ms. Brescher, who holds a master\u2019s degree in epidemiology, said in a follow-up interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have the patience or really the skill set to read the tax bill for myself.\u201d\u201cIt comes down to a bunch of idiosyncratic factors,\u201d said Mark Mazur, a Treasury Department official in the Obama administration who now directs the Tax Policy Center. \u201cYou really have to parse through the details.\u201dSentiment about the bill seems strongly colored by feelings about the president. Backing remains strong among supporters of Mr. Trump: 80 percent of them say they approve of the bill. Among those who don\u2019t approve of Mr. Trump, the figure is only 10 percent.Geoffrey Cantley, an Army recruiter in rural Virginia, said he didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d get a tax cut or a tax increase under the bill. But he said Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to simplify the tax code would enable him to file without a tax preparer, saving money. And he said Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the doubt.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s getting a fair shake in the coverage he\u2019s getting,\u201d Mr. Cantley said. \u201cI think the economy\u2019s doing a lot better.\u201dRepublicans said this week that public doubts would fall away once the bill becomes law and tax cuts begin appearing in paychecks. They cited polls from 1986, showing that most Americans did not feel that year\u2019s tax bill would help them, either.\u201cWhatever the polling data is that\u2019s out there today doesn\u2019t recognize just how powerful this bill is going to be to put more money in the pockets of hard-working families,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip.\u201cNothing in my experience suggests that the views people have about the tax cuts \u2014 whether justified or not \u2014 will change after they start actually being affected by them,\u201d said Jason Furman, a Harvard Kennedy School economist who advised President Obama during and after the 2009 stimulus bill.Samuel Bruce, a financial analyst in Keller, Tex., has followed the tax bill closely but still isn\u2019t sure whether he would benefit. A father of two, he would be able to claim the higher child tax credit, but as the owner of his own home and a rental property, he said the limit on property-tax deductions could hurt him.Still, Mr. Bruce said he was more concerned with the broader economic impact. He said he doubted that most businesses would pass tax cuts on to workers, and he worried about how the deficit would affect his daughters, now 7 and 8, when they grow up.\u201cPoliticians are all about \u2018take care of today,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about the future, really.\u201dAbout the Survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 5,100 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Dec. 11 to Dec. 14. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus two percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Leap to Single-Payer: What Taiwan Can Teach ", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareHow one nation transformed a health care system. Can America do big things anymore? Taiwan is proof that a country can make a swift and huge change to its health care system, even in the modern day.Assessing the systems in eight countries can inform the debate in the U.S. over universal coverage.Today, most hospitals in Taiwan remain privately owned, mostly nonprofit. Most physicians are still either salaried or self-employed in practices. Access is also quite impressive. Patients can choose from pretty much any provider or therapy. Wait times are short, and patients can go straight to specialty care without a referral.Taiwan\u2019s cost of health care rose faster than inflation, as it has in other countries. In 2001, co-payments for care were increased, and in 2002, they went up again, along with premiums. In those years, the government also began to reduce reimbursement to providers after a \u201creasonable\u201d number of patients was seen. It also began to pay less for drugs. Finally, it began to institute global budgets \u2014 caps on the total amount paid for all care \u2014 in the hope of squeezing providers into becoming more efficient.This is not to say the system is perfect. Taiwan has a growing physician shortage, and physicians complain about being paid too little to work too hard (although doctors in nearly every system complain about that). Taiwan has an aging population and a low birthrate, which will push the total costs of care upward with a smaller base from which to collect tax revenue. Taiwan has done a great job at treating many communicable diseases, but more chronic conditions are on the rise. These include cancer and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, all of which are expensive to treat.Comparing Taiwan and the United States may appear to be like comparing apples and aardvarks. One is geographically small, with only 23 million citizens, while the other is vast and home to well above 300 million. But Taiwan is larger than most states, and a number of states \u2014 including Vermont, Colorado and California \u2014 have made pushes for single-payer systems in the last few years. These have not succeeded, however, perhaps because there is less tolerance for disruption in the United States than the Taiwanese were willing to accept. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "No Wonder Millennials Hate Capitalism", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a Friday night last month, I moderated a debate in Manhattan about whether we should scrap capitalism. It was organized by the socialist magazine Jacobin; defending capitalism were editors from the libertarian publication Reason. Tickets for all available 450 seats sold out in a day. So Jacobin moved it to a venue that holds around twice as many. The extra tickets sold out in eight hours.When I arrived, people were lined up for blocks; walking to the door, I felt like I was on the guest list at an underground nightclub. Most attendees appeared to be in their 20s and 30s, part of a generation that is uniquely suspicious of capitalism, a system most of their elders take for granted.The anti-Communist Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation was alarmed to find in a recent survey that 44 percent of millennials would prefer to live in a socialist country, compared with 42 percent who want to live under capitalism. For older Americans, the collapse of Communism made it seem as though there was no possible alternative to capitalism. But given the increasingly oligarchic nature of our economy, it\u2019s not surprising that for many young people, capitalism looks like the god that failed.Nowhere is that clearer than in the wretched tax bill passed by the Senate in the early hours of Saturday morning, which would make the rich richer and the poor poorer. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the bill directs the largest tax cuts as a share of income to the top 5 percent of taxpayers. By 2027, taxes on the lowest earners would go up.Not to be outdone, the next day, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, argued that Congress still hasn\u2019t reauthorized the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which he helped create and still claims to support, because \u201cwe don\u2019t have money anymore.\u201d He went on to rant against the poor: \u201cI have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won\u2019t help themselves \u2014 won\u2019t lift a finger \u2014 and expect the federal government to do everything.\u201d It was unclear whether he was talking about the nearly nine million children covered through CHIP or their parents.After the fall of Communism, capitalism came to seem like the modern world\u2019s natural state, like the absence of ideology rather than an ideology itself. The Trump era is radicalizing because it makes the rotten morality behind our inequalities so manifest. It\u2019s not just the occult magic of the market that\u2019s enriching Ivanka Trump\u2019s children while health insurance premiums soar and public school budgets wither. It\u2019s the raw exercise of power by a tiny unaccountable minority that believes in its own superiority. You don\u2019t have to want to abolish capitalism to understand why the prospect is tempting to a generation that\u2019s being robbed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2017: The Year in Charts", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "Advertisement\nThe overbearing persona of President Trump dominated 2017. From his angry early morning tweets to the stain of corruption bleeding into his administration to the sharp rightward tilt in his governing philosophy, Mr. Trump in his first year in office could not stand in starker contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama. Meanwhile, strong economic performance in 2017 \u2014 a legacy for which Mr. Trump should thank Mr. Obama \u2014 masked the reality that the new president failed to propose or carry out any significant policies that would help the white working-class Americans who helped elect him.The divisive campaign waged by Mr. Trump and his harsh inaugural address put him in office with the poorest approval ratings of any recent president. From that inauspicious beginning, his ratings continued to tumble, as a result of his numerous false and sometimes racially charged statements, his often unpopular policy initiatives and allegations regarding Russian meddling in the election. Of course, many new presidents see their approval ratings fall in their first year as the postelection glow begins to fade. But because of his poor start, Mr. Trump is distinguished as being the only president to finish his first year with more Americans disapproving of his performance than approving of it.Here are net ratings \u2014 the gap, in percentage points, between those who approve and disapprove \u2014 for six presidents in the months after their first inauguration.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.Dec.Jan.Dec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Surprisingly, Mr. Trump chose to pitch his young presidency toward his base, in contrast to most new presidents who try to reach out to those who did not vote for them, particularly moderates. As a result, Mr. Trump has remained as popular within his own party as his predecessors but more unpopular among the opposition party than previous presidents. The fear of a Trump counterpunch or worse, a primary challenge, as well as a strong desire to pass at least some Republican legislative priorities such as tax cuts, has helped keep Republican senators and representatives from criticizing him. And for all his unpopularity, most observers (including me) believe that the president will complete his first term, as the prediction markets indicate.Party affiliation governs presidential approval ratings.

The number of bills signed by Mr. Trump in his first 337 days was lower than any president since at least Dwight Eisenhower.  And most of those bills were minor, except, of course, for the tax bill, passed just before the Christmas holiday. Apart from the legislative front, Mr. Trump was also slow to staff his administration, while many of his campaign promises \u2014 from a $1 trillion infrastructure program to the famed border wall \u2014 remain unfulfilled.Bills signed into law during the first 337 days of each presidency.Nixon213Carter241Reagan109Bush I242Clinton209Bush II102Obama12196TrumpBillsrelated to to space,science4Reversing Obama regs.16Ceremonial, bureaucraticand routine laws621Bills related to veterans13Richard M.

It was rushed to a vote after extraordinarily little debate. It will vastly reward corporate America, largely by adding at least $1.4 trillion \u2014 and likely, much more \u2014 to the national debt. It will confer embarrassingly modest benefits on middle- and working-class Americans relative to what will be received by the wealthy. While America\u2019s corporate tax code was in desperate need of revamping, the lack of any meaningful effort to eliminate corporate loopholes suggested that far from draining the swamp, Mr. Trump embraced it. So far, the American people aren\u2019t fooled; this appalling piece of legislation has the lowest approval rating of any major bill passed since 1990.In both dollar and percentage terms, the 2018 tax cuts skew to the richest American households (and will continue to do so for many years).

The improvement in sentiment in the private sector shouldn\u2019t be shocking: If you had been told that you would receive a huge tax cut and be freed from thousands of government regulations, wouldn\u2019t you feel better about your business? As for consumers, their improved mood since the election represents a continuation of a trend that began in 2009 as the floodwaters of the financial crisis were starting to recede. But interestingly, immediately after  the election Democrats became more pessimistic about the economy while Republicans became more optimistic.Consumer and business sentiment rose after the election.

For one thing, at long last, the world economy is firing on all cylinders \u2014 perhaps not as strongly as we would like in the United States and Europe, but moving upward nonetheless. In fact, only six countries are expected to be in recession in 2018, the smallest number on record. Growing economies have helped propel corporate profits and thus  stock markets upward worldwide. So while Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on business-friendly policies has helped turbocharge the American stock market, we are hardly alone in enjoying rising share prices. And let\u2019s not forget that markets rose more during President Obama\u2019s first 11 months in office (37 percent for the S.&.P. 500 versus 18 percent for Mr. Trump).942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators Global stock markets+21%U.S. stock market+20%Global corporate profits+8%942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators +21%Global stock markets+20%U.S. stock market+8%Global corporate profitsWhat\u2019s clear is that Mr. Trump deserves little or no credit for the continuing economic and job growth in the United States, despite his frequent claims to the contrary. On Sept. 19, he declared that \u201ccompanies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d Not true. The rate of job increases has actually slowed since Mr. Trump was inaugurated, by about 44,000 jobs a month. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the current 3.3 percent rate of growth in the gross domestic product \u201cis the largest increase in many years,\u201d that is false as well; President Obama achieved similar or higher increases in six quarters of his administration.Job creation is down.

(The brief period of seemingly rising wages in 2009 was a function of declining prices, not higher incomes.) In late 2014, as labor markets began to tighten, employers trying to hire were compelled to increase pay by more than inflation.

That requirement was a key component of Obamacare because it ensured that insurance companies had a supply of healthy customers along with those in greater need of medical care. As a consequence, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, 13 million fewer Americans than previously projected will likely have coverage in 2025. To put that in perspective, before its disfiguration, the A.C.A. was projected to add 34 million to the insurance rolls by 2025. And the news gets worse: The new provision is expected to increase premiums quickly by 10 percent, a jump that will come on top of the premium increases resulting from the Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of payments to reduce insurance costs.In less than a decade, the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate is estimated to add 13 million more nonelderly Americans to the ranks of the uninsured \u2014 equivalent to the population of Pennsylvania.Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate471212121213Totaluninsured,2025:2830313144million\u201917\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate:Totaluninsured,2025:4712121212134428303131million2017\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925While the new administration has struggled to advance its legislative priorities, it has (unfortunately) excelled at another of its responsibilities: appointing judges. While it has a poor record in filling executive branch positions, the Trump team has outshone the Obama administration in both putting forth candidates for the bench and getting them confirmed. The latter accomplishment got a big assist from a procedural change put in place by the Senate Democrats during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term that reduced the number of votes required from 60 to a simple majority. Not surprisingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees are more likely to be white than those of any president since Ronald Reagan. He has also nominated a startling four candidates for the judiciary rated \u201cunqualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, and three of his nominees have already had to be withdrawn. Finally, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to these lifetime positions are relatively young, effectively tilting the ideological balance of the federal courts for decades to come.First-year nominations for two presidents, and race and gender of nominees for the last seven presidents.Supreme CourtCONFIRMEDDistrictcourtsCircuitcourtsPENDINGObama139911Trump1127643White nominees as percent of totalReagan94%Trump91Bush I89Bush II83Carter79Clinton75Obama64Male nomineesReagan92%Carter84Bush I81Trump81Bush II78Clinton71Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Get Theresa May for Christmas", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Varoufakis is the former Greek finance minister and his book sets out in excruciating detail the story of the 2015 negotiations between Greece\u2019s government and its creditors. It feels like necessary reading for the Brexit team.In the nine months of negotiations so far, there has been remarkably little give and take. What Britain agreed to last week was largely what Europe had demanded at the beginning.European Union citizens\u2019 rights have been largely protected, with Britain agreeing that its courts will take into account rulings of the European Court of Justice, the European Union\u2019s supreme legal body. The money being paid by Britain for the divorce is less than what some politicians on the Continent were hoping for, but about double what was first offered.On the Irish border, the two sides have agreed that there will be no border with passport and customs checks \u2014 but also that the details will be left to later talks. If there is no mutually agreeable solution, then Britain has promised to maintain \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with the European Union to ensure that customs checks aren\u2019t necessary, even though Britain will have no say over those regulations. A country that voted for Brexit as a way to \u201ctake back control\u201d will be acceding even more control to the European Union.All this is as Mr. Varoufakis might have predicted. In the wake of the financial crash of 2008, the Greek economy had imploded. The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (collectively known as the \u201ctroika\u201d), stepped in to provide huge loans, not for spending in Greece, but largely to bail out the banks (many of them German and French) that had so recklessly lent to Greece in the first place. In return, the troika insisted on an eye-watering austerity program, slashing jobs, welfare payments and pensions.Mr. Varoufakis, who led the Greek negotiating team, writes in \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d that rather than negotiate in good faith, the troika employed a number of tactics to ensure that it got its way. The key maneuver was insisting that negotiations be staged in two parts: Greece first had to \u201ccommit to the compromises they wanted and then, much later, we could begin negotiations on debt relief.\u201dIt has been a similar story with the Brexit talks. Britain is dealing not with the troika, but directly with the European Union. The bruising negotiating tactics, however, are much the same.The European Union insisted at the beginning that the negotiations be split into two parts. Only when \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made on the \u201cdivorce\u201d could talks on future relations begin. Britain\u2019s real interest is in signing a post-Brexit trade deal. London\u2019s desperation to move on, Brussels knew, would lead it to capitulate on the terms of divorce.And that is exactly what happened. With much bluster but little resistance, Britain accepted not only the two-part process, but also most of the European Union\u2019s demands in the first phase.Recognizing this, the European Union is already hemming in Britain\u2019s options for the next phase of the negotiations. It has again demanded that the talks be split in two, the first part to deal with the terms of the transition period \u2014 a period of probably two years starting in March 2019, when Britain formally leaves the European Union, and ending when it fully separates from it \u2014 followed by the terms of trade relations.The issue is not simply European Union intransigence. It is also that of British incompetence. Mr. Davis, the Brexit secretary, recently admitted that he had not commissioned a single study of Brexit\u2019s impact on the economy. Only on Monday did the cabinet finally formally discuss what exactly it wants out of Brexit negotiations. To negotiate with neither detailed information nor a firm vision of the endpoint is akin to playing poker blindfolded.The combination of European Union inflexibility and British incompetence means that however, and whenever, Britain finally exits, it is likely to be on the European Union\u2019s terms. \u201cAdults in the Room\u201d is necessarily a one-sided account from Mr. Varoufakis\u2019s perspective. But it does provide a glimpse of the maneuverings usually shielded from public view. Reading it will change little, but at least it might prepare British ministers for what is to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Promised to Protect Steel. Layoffs Are Coming Instead.", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. \u2014 At this sprawling steel mill on the outskirts of Philadelphia, the workers have one number in mind. Not how many tons of steel roll off the line, or how many hours they work, but where they fall on the plant\u2019s seniority list.In September, ArcelorMittal, which owns the mill, announced that it would lay off 150 of the plant\u2019s 207 workers next year. While the cuts will start with the most junior employees, they will go so deep that even workers with decades of experience will be cast out.\u201cI told my son, \u2018Christmas is going to be kind of scarce, because Mommy\u2019s going to lose her job soon,\u2019\u201d said Kimberly Allen, a steelworker and single parent who has worked at the plant for more than 22 years. On the seniority list, she\u2019s 72nd.The layoffs have stunned these steelworkers who, just a year ago, greeted President Trump\u2019s election as a new dawn for their industry. Mr. Trump pledged to build roads and bridges, strengthen \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions, protect factories from unfair imports and revive industry, especially steel.But after a year in office, Mr. Trump has not enacted these policies. And when it comes to steel, his failure to follow through on a promise has had unintended consequences.Foreign steel makers have rushed to get their product into the United States before tariffs start. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, which tracks shipments, steel imports were 19.4 percent higher in the first 10 months of 2017 than in the same period last year.That surge of imports has hurt American steel makers, which were already struggling against a glut of cheap Chinese steel. When ArcelorMittal announced the layoffs in Conshohocken, it blamed those imports, as well as low demand for steel for bridges and military equipment.James Rockas, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, said the administration was \u201caware of the plight of American steelworkers and will continue working to halt unfair trade practices that harm our economy and kill American jobs.\u201dIn 2008, before the financial crisis struck, the plant ran around the clock. Now, the mill coughs to life just five days a week, for eight hours at a time. The machines shovel 10-ton steel slabs into a furnace, where they are heated to 2,000 degrees, then funnel them through giant rollers and cooling jets of water, like a massive, fiery carwash.The plant\u2019s specialty is ultrastrong, military-grade steel \u2014 something that Eric Smith, a former Army paratrooper who has worked at the plant for over 30 years, prides himself on. Mr. Smith ranks 16th on the plant\u2019s seniority list, and he expects to survive the coming round of layoffs.He grew up just down the street. The weathered houses of his old neighborhood on that dim day were fringed with icicle lights, evergreen bows and flags paying homage to Santa and the Philadelphia Eagles.As a boy, he would long to work at the factory as he passed it. These days, he said, he gets a sinking feeling as he goes through the turnstile and enters the plant.\u201cYou just got to keep on pushing forward. It is sad that Christmastime is coming around,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to splurge for your kids like you want to, because the plant may be closing.\u201dWhile he didn\u2019t support Mr. Trump, Mr. Smith said he hoped that the president would follow through on his plans. \u201cIt\u2019s still kind of early,\u201d he said.Reforming trade was one of the president\u2019s signature campaign promises, and in his first months in office, Mr. Trump issued dozens of executive actions. One pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade pact. Others ordered investigations into imports or renegotiations of trade pacts.Uncertainty about how these measures will reshape trade rules is now weighing on many industries. Companies are waiting to invest, or finding additional suppliers outside the United States, executives in agriculture, automobiles, solar energy and information technology have said.In April, the president ordered parallel investigations into imports of steel and aluminum under the little-used Section 232 of a 1962 trade law, which permits sweeping restrictions to protect national security.Earlier this year, tariffs seemed imminent. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said in late May that he expected to conclude the steel investigation by the end of June.And in early June, Mr. Trump told a crowd in Cincinnati, \u201cWait till you see what I\u2019m going to do for steel and your steel companies,\u201d vowing that he would \u201cstop the dumping\u201d of products at superlow prices by other nations.\u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing that very soon. The steel folks are going to be very happy,\u201d he said.But the announcement never came.\u201cI think the White House is immobilized, because they have such a cacophony of voices,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio who describes himself as an ally of the president on trade. \u201cThis administration doesn\u2019t seem to know what it thinks about trade.\u201dThe administration will face a series of deadlines on the steel measure next year. The Commerce Department must present the results of its investigation to the president by Jan. 15. The president will then have 90 days to decide what to do.Still, the delay has threatened to fracture the brittle alliance the president has forged with some labor unions, who liked Mr. Trump\u2019s populist approach to trade.Senator Bob Casey Jr., a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said the administration\u2019s commitment to workers would probably be an issue in the 2018 midterm elections. \u201cThey\u2019ve sat on this for far too long,\u201d he said.The United Steelworkers, the union that includes the workers in Conshohocken, has historically aligned with Democrats. But many workers opposed trade agreements forged by Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and viewed Hillary Clinton\u2019s stance on trade as insincere.But Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade group that represents steelworkers, said he had \u201ca profound sense of frustration that the president has been using steelworkers as political props.\u201d\u201cThe president\u2019s own words and lack of action have actually put the industry in a worse position than if he had done nothing at all,\u201d he said.Kameen Thompson, the union president at the Conshohocken plant, said many workers had voted for Mr. Trump because of his support for steel. \u201cYou want to vote for what you believe is going to help you keep a job,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.Ms. Allen, whose father worked at the Conshohocken plant before her, was not a Trump supporter. \u201cHe told them what they wanted to hear so they would vote for him, and now they\u2019re seeing what president he is,\u201d she said.But other workers who supported the president are keeping the faith.Chuck Hauer, who has worked at the plant for 22 years and ranks around 80 on the seniority list \u2014 meaning he is likely to be laid off \u2014 said he had voted Republican because he believed that Mr. Trump was \u201cfor the people.\u201d He said he still believed that the tariffs would happen, though perhaps not soon enough to save him.\u201cHe\u2019s just delaying it,\u201d Mr. Hauer said of the president. \u201cAnd I think the delay is hurting us more than he knows.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hard Truth About the West\u2019s Wild Horse Problem", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWe have a wild horse problem \u2014 and it\u2019s having a devastating impact on these majestic animals that so many of us love.I grew up on a farm in Idaho. No one has to show me how to put a saddle on a horse. I respect these powerful animals and consider them emblems of the West. But though we may envision bands of mustangs sprinting through lush fields of tall grasses, we have to realize that the truth is much bleaker.The federal government\u2019s Wild Horse and Burro Program is broken, leaving thousands of animals to starve. The Bureau of Land Management says that the nearly 27 million acres it manages for wild horses and burros can sustain only about 27,000 animals. This year, the bureau estimates that there were more than 72,000 wild horses on the land, almost 50,000 too many and all fighting to survive.Making matters worse, wild horses are very fertile; their population increases 20 percent a year, meaning the number of wild horses will double in the next four years. Overgrazing by these horses has also hurt local deer and elk populations. The range could take a generation to recover.This isn\u2019t just a horse management disaster, it\u2019s a financial disaster too. In addition to the 72,000 horses it oversees on the range, the B.L.M. keeps about 45,000 horses that it has removed from the wild in corrals, off-range pastures and in sanctuaries. Over their lifetime, these horses will cost taxpayers roughly $1 billion overall, according to the B.L.M. That\u2019s $1 billion we could otherwise spend on defense, education, job training or any other worthy cause.But the alternative for these horses is starving in the wild. For example, in 2015, the B.L.M. employees were dispatched to a desert in Nevada outside of Las Vegas to round up about 200 wild horses that were reported to be starving to death. Federal land managers had determined that the 100,000-acre expanse where these horses were grazing produced only enough grasses and water to sustain 70 horses.How can anyone consider this acceptable?Although the finger is routinely pointed at the B.L.M. for mismanagement, the bulk of the blame lies with shortsighted decision-making by misinformed but well-meaning members of Congress.Congress had once supported laws that allowed for proper management of these animals. Horses in excess of what the land could sustain were to be captured, put up for adoption, sold without restriction \u2014 including to slaughterhouses, which the B.L.M. does not do as a matter of policy \u2014 and as a last resort, humanely euthanized. The program wasn\u2019t perfect, but the B.L.M. was able to keep the herds\u2019 numbers in check while ensuring that the ranges were viable and healthy year after year.But since 2010, Congress has used annual appropriations acts to significantly restrict the ability of the B.L.M. to sell or euthanize horses. And while in the early 2000s people were willing to adopt 8,000 horses a year, more recently that number has dropped to 2,500, possibly because of the economy.Some horse advocates urge expanded use of birth control to keep horse populations in check. Birth control is part of the solution, but it\u2019s not a panacea.The most humane methods require mares to be treated once a year. That\u2019s feasible in herds that roam small areas, such as those on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but herds in the West are scattered over thousands of acres that equal the land mass of Mississippi. Is it any wonder that the B.L.M. is able to treat a mere 1,000 mares each year in the West?I understand that some will recoil from this approach. But anyone who really cares about these majestic animals must understand that other efforts have failed to curb their exploding population and that culling these herds to numbers the land can sustain is the best way to prevent further suffering and death.An earlier version of this essay misstated a detail of the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s contraceptive program. It is not the case that pregnant mares cannot be given contraceptives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Kaplan Says Technology Is Holding Down Inflation", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy is gaining strength, and Mr. Kaplan said it made sense to raise rates while times were good, so that the Fed was in position to lower rates during a future economic downturn.Mr. Kaplan worked as an investment banker and a business school professor before joining the Fed in 2015, and he continues to view the economy through that lens. He said he saw a clear explanation for the slow pace of inflation in recent years: Technological change is increasing competition in a wide range of industries, making it difficult for many companies to increase their prices.\u201cI talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said.The interview was conducted last week; Fed officials are not allowed to comment publicly on monetary policy in the week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Do you expect strong growth to continue next year?We certainly think next year we\u2019ll continue to grow at solid rates \u2014 sufficient growth to continue to take slack out of the labor market. There\u2019s the headline rate of unemployment, but the measure I look at much more is what\u2019s called U6 [which measures both people who are actively seeking work and those who say they\u2019d like a job]. That\u2019s back at 7.9 percent, at its pre-recession level, and that suggests we\u2019re either at or near full employment, and I would expect those numbers to improve. And Texas? How goes the recovery from the hurricane? Should the Fed raise its benchmark interest rate in December?Whether we\u2019re at full employment, we\u2019ll know in hindsight, but I believe we\u2019re going to continue to take slack out of the labor market. I\u2019m very aware that we\u2019re undershooting inflation, but my team believes we\u2019re going to get to 2 percent in the medium term. It may be slower and more uneven than people expect, but from a risk management point of view, I think it would be wise to take the next step. I\u2019m being very careful in the way I\u2019m saying it because I continue to believe that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient way. Why does inflation remain below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target?I am a strong believer that cyclical pressures are building and, as we continue to take slack out of the labor market, they\u2019ll continue to build. The issue is, there\u2019s a headwind in terms of inflation: technology-enabled disruption. What do I mean? Yes, of course, technology is replacing people, and that has been going on for a long time. Increasingly, though, consumers have more use of technology to shop for goods and services at lower prices \u2014 that\u2019s accelerating. And a third thing is the emergence of new models for selling goods, manufacturing goods or distributing goods.The obvious ones you think of are Uber vs. taxis, Amazon vs. retail, Airbnb vs. hotels. But every business is facing disruption. What we\u2019re finding is increasingly businesses lack pricing power. Even since I\u2019ve been sitting in this seat, I talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war. Give me an example of where that\u2019s happening.Autos. Fifteen years ago you\u2019d deal with a salesperson. Today the car is sold online. The salesperson is a much less important job. People shop online and walk in, and they\u2019re ready to transact. So there are fewer salespeople. The person who does your website is a much more valuable person. The automotive technician is a much more valuable person. And you can\u2019t find enough of them. Shouldn\u2019t those workers be able to negotiate higher wages? In your story, it\u2019s profits that should be squeezed. But instead, the opposite is happening.So companies are replacing people with technology. Older workers are getting bought out, and the work force is getting younger. And you\u2019ve got to segment this by educational attainment. If you\u2019ve got a college education and you\u2019re in a high-skilled job, I actually think you\u2019ve got pretty good negotiating capability for wages. If you\u2019ve got a high school education or less, what I\u2019ve been seeing \u2014 and this is more anecdotal, and we need to be doing more research on this \u2014 it is highly likely that your job is either getting restructured or eliminated and you don\u2019t have the educational background to easily move, unless you get retrained, which is an easy thing to say but a very hard thing to do. Do you see evidence for this in the available data?To collect data means it\u2019s already happened. I\u2019m confident that 10 years from now we\u2019ll have good data on this phenomenon in the same way I\u2019ve seen recently some great papers on big-box retailers replacing mom-and-pop retailers. That happened years ago. Is our deteriorating relationship with Mexico affecting the Texas economy?What I am concerned about is the presidential election in the summer of 2018, and I know people in Mexico are also concerned about it. We\u2019ve benefited as a country by having strong relationships with Mexico, and I think the concern I have is as a result of the rhetoric, the political atmosphere is now to the point where you might have to be negative toward the United States in order to be elected. You\u2019ve said in recent speeches that you\u2019re keeping a close eye on the market.If we could call a timeout right now and ask if you see imbalances, I\u2019ve said that they\u2019re manageable right now. But I do know that it pays to monitor these things very carefully at this stage in the cycle. All I\u2019m pointing out is that we need to be on our toes. I don\u2019t see overheating, but I think as we continue to take slack out of the labor market, we could well see imbalances build.An earlier version of this article misstated the U6 unemployment rate. It is 7.9 percent, not 7.6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Board Reverses Ruling That Helped Workers Fight Chains", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe National Labor Relations Board on Thursday overturned a key Obama-era precedent that had given workers significant leverage in challenging companies like fast-food and hotel chains over labor practices.The ruling changes the standard for holding a company responsible for labor law violations that occur at another company, like a contractor or franchisee, with which it has a relationship.The doctrine also governs whether such a corporation would have to bargain with workers at a franchise if they unionized, or whether only the owners of the franchise would have to do so.\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Wilma B. Liebman, a former Democratic appointee on the board who once served as its chairwoman.The board\u2019s 3-to-2 vote, along party lines, restores the pre-2015 standard, which deemed a fast-food corporation a joint employer only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise, and in a way that was not limited.Employer groups had been agitating to undo the standard that was set under President Barack Obama almost from the moment it was decided, and they applauded the decision on Thursday.\u201cToday\u2019s decision restores years of established law and brings back clarity for restaurants and small businesses across the country,\u201d said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, in a statement.Ms. Liebman noted that the parties in the case that served as the vehicle for Thursday\u2019s ruling had not even asked the board to reconsider the existing precedent.The key question in determining whether a company, like a fast-food corporation, is a joint employer of workers employed by another company, like one of the chain\u2019s franchisees, is the degree of control exercised by the corporation over workers at the franchise. The ruling on Thursday declared that such control must be direct.Under the Obama-era doctrine, the fast-food corporation could be held liable for labor violations that occurred at the franchise even if the control it exerted was indirect \u2014 for example, if it required the franchisee to use software dictating certain scheduling practices \u2014 or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless didn\u2019t exercise.The reversal could have important implications for the ability of workers to win concessions from employers through collective bargaining. In many cases, a contractor or franchisee has such low profit margins that it could not afford to raise wages or improve benefits even if it wanted to.But when, as was more likely under the Obama-era doctrine, a wealthier company employing a contractor or conferring a franchise is considered a joint employer, it must join the bargaining and could in principle compensate workers more generously.The reversal could also affect the ability to unionize in the first place. A company is free to fire a contractor or end a franchise arrangement if it suspects that workers are on the verge of unionizing. But there could be legal liability for doing so if the company is a joint employer of workers with the contractor or franchisee.Employers have been so concerned about the more sweeping joint-employer standard that they have lobbied Congress to change the standard through legislation, a version of which the House passed in November. They are likely to continue to push for such legislation for fear that a future labor board under Democratic control could simply reverse the standard again, and because there are applications of the joint employer concept \u2014 as in enforcement of minimum-wage laws \u2014 not covered by the labor board\u2019s decision.The case before the board appeared relatively straightforward, involving two nominally separate construction companies in Iowa, Brandt Construction Company and Hy-Brand Industrial Contractors, owned by the same four people. In 2015, two employees of Brandt and five employees of Hy-Brand went on strike to highlight safety concerns and the level of their pay and benefits, and the ownership fired all seven in retaliation.An administrative law judge ruled that the seven firings were illegal, and that the same ownership was responsible for all of them. The board\u2019s ruling on Thursday agreed on both counts, but argued that the judge had applied the wrong standard \u2014 the Obama-era standard \u2014 for determining joint employment.At its most fundamental level, the ruling highlights deep differences in philosophy between most Democratic and Republican members of the labor board. During the Obama administration, the board majority believed that the changing structure of the economy \u2014 in which employers have steadily pushed workers outside their firms and into a throng of contractors, franchises and staffing agencies \u2014 required updating doctrine to stay true to the intent of labor law.In its 2015 ruling, the board wrote that the existing joint-employer approach was \u201cincreasingly out of step with changing economic circumstances, particularly the recent dramatic growth in contingent employment relationships.\u201dBy contrast, the ruling Thursday from the Republican-led board argued that its predecessors had been guilty of \u201cupending decades of labor law precedent and probably centuries of precedent in corporate law\u201d with no mandate from Congress to do so.While the joint-employer decision was arguably the highest priority for Republicans, the labor board is likely to overturn other Obama-era decisions strongly opposed by employers in relatively short order. Among them are rulings that made it easier for smaller groups of workers within a company to unionize, that gave workers access to a company\u2019s email network for organizing purposes and that conferred a federally protected right to unionize on graduate students at private universities.Some insiders believe that the labor board could overturn at least one more high-profile precedent before the term of the Republican chairman, Philip A. Miscimarra, ends on Saturday. At that point, the board will be evenly split between the parties, and Republicans won\u2019t regain their majority until the Senate confirms another member, whom President Trump has yet to nominate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Venezuela Collapses, Children Are Dying of Hunger", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "For five months, The New York Times tracked 21 public hospitals in Venezuela. Doctors are seeing record numbers of children with severe malnutrition. Hundreds have died.SAN CASIMIRO, Venezuela \u2014 Kenyerber Aquino Merch\u00e1n was 17 months old when he starved to death.His father left before dawn to bring him home from the hospital morgue. He carried Kenyerber\u2019s skeletal frame into the kitchen and handed it to a mortuary worker who makes house calls for Venezuelan families with no money for funerals.Kenyerber\u2019s spine and rib cage protruded as the embalming chemicals were injected. Aunts shooed away curious young cousins, mourners arrived with wildflowers from the hills, and relatives cut out a pair of cardboard wings from one of the empty white ration boxes that families increasingly depend on amid the food shortages and soaring food prices throttling the nation. They gently placed the tiny wings on top of Kenyerber\u2019s coffin to help his soul reach heaven \u2014 a tradition when a baby dies in Venezuela.But deaths from malnutrition have remained a closely guarded secret by the Venezuelan government. In a five-month investigation by The New York Times, doctors at 21 public hospitals in 17 states across the country said that their emergency rooms were being overwhelmed by children with severe malnutrition \u2014 a condition they had rarely encountered before the economic crisis began.Caribbean SeaPuerto Cabello CaracasMor\u00f3nBarquisimetoLos TequesVENEZUELAVENEZUELASOUTHAMERICACaribbean SeaPuerto Cabello CaracasMor\u00f3nBarquisimetoLos TequesVENEZUELAVENEZUELASOUTHAMERICACaribbean SeaPuerto Cabello CaracasMor\u00f3nBarquisimetoLos TequesVENEZUELAVENEZUELASOUTHAMERICABy The New York Times\u201cChildren are arriving with very precarious conditions of malnutrition,\u201d said Dr. Hun\u00edades Urbina Medina, the president of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics. He added that doctors were even seeing the kind of extreme malnutrition often found in refugee camps \u2014 cases that were highly unusual in oil-rich Venezuela before its economy fell to pieces.For many low-income families, the crisis has completely redrawn the social landscape. Parents like Kenyerber\u2019s mother go days without eating, shriveling to the weight of children themselves. Women line up at sterilization clinics to avoid having children they can\u2019t feed. Young boys leave home and join street gangs to scavenge for scraps, their bodies bearing the scars of knife fights with competitors. Crowds of adults storm Dumpsters after restaurants close. Babies die because it is hard to find or afford infant formula, even in emergency rooms.\u201cSometimes they die in your arms just from dehydration,\u201d Dr. Milagros Hern\u00e1ndez said in the emergency room of a children\u2019s hospital in the northern city of Barquisimeto, noting that the hospital had started seeing an increase in malnourished patients at the end of 2016.\u201cBut in 2017 the increase in malnourished patients has been terrible,\u201d she added. \u201cChildren arrive with the same weight and height of a newborn.\u201dBefore Venezuela\u2019s economy started spiraling, doctors say, almost all of the child malnutrition cases they saw in public hospitals stemmed from neglect or abuse by parents. But as the economic crisis began to intensify in 2015 and 2016, the number of cases of severe malnutrition at the nation\u2019s leading pediatric health center in the capital more than tripled, doctors say. This year looks even worse.In many countries, extreme malnutrition \u201ccan be caused when there is war, a drought, some sort of catastrophe or an earthquake,\u201d said Dr. Ingrid Soto de Sanabria, the chief of the hospital\u2019s nutrition, growth and development department. \u201cBut in our country it is directly related to the shortages and inflation.\u201dThe Venezuelan government has tried to cover up the extent of the crisis by enforcing a near-total blackout of health statistics, and by creating a culture in which doctors are often afraid to register cases and deaths that may be associated with the government\u2019s failures.But the statistics that have come out are staggering. In the Ministry of Health\u2019s 2015 annual report, the mortality rate for children under 4 weeks old had increased a hundredfold, from 0.02 percent in 2012 to just over 2 percent. Maternal mortality had increased nearly fivefold in the same period.For almost two years, the government did not publish a single epidemiological bulletin tracking statistics like infant mortality. Then in April of this year, a link suddenly appeared on the Health Ministry\u2019s official website, leading to the unpublished bulletins. They showed that 11,446 children under the age of 1 had died in 2016 \u2014 a 30 percent increase in one year \u2014 as the economic crisis accelerated.The new findings made national and international headlines before the government declared that the website had been hacked, and the reports were swiftly removed. The health minister was fired and the military was put in charge of monitoring the bulletins. No reports have been released since.Doctors are censored in hospitals, too, often warned not to include malnutrition in children\u2019s medical records.\u201cIn some public hospitals, the clinical diagnosis of malnutrition has been prohibited,\u201d Dr. Hun\u00edades Urbina said.But doctors interviewed by The Times at nine of the 21 public hospitals said that they had kept at least some count. They encountered nearly 2,800 cases of child malnutrition in the last year alone, with starving children regularly brought to emergency rooms. Nearly 400 of the children died, the doctors said.\u201cNever in my life had I seen so many hungry children,\u201d said Dr. Livia Machado, a pediatrician who gives free consultations at her private practice to children who had been hospitalized at Dr. Domingo Luciani Hospital in the capital, Caracas.The hospital is one of the few still accepting malnourished infants for treatment. Other hospitals often turn them away, telling desperate parents that they do not have enough beds or medical supplies to treat their children. Nearly all of Venezuelan hospitals report shortages of basic provisions like baby formula.President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has acknowledged that people are hungry in Venezuela, but he has refused to accept international aid, often saying that Venezuela\u2019s economic problems are caused by foreign adversaries like the United States, which he says is waging an economic war against his country.Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But many economists contend that years of economic mismanagement set the stage for the current disaster. The damage was masked when oil prices were high, giving the government large resources. But when oil prices began a steep fall at the end of 2014, scarcities became common and food prices skyrocketed. Inflation could reach 2,300 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund warned in October.The Health Ministry and the National Institute of Nutrition did not respond to requests for interviews or official health reports containing malnutrition statistics. But the nation\u2019s political opposition, which has been stripped of its power by the government, continues to sound the alarm.\u201cWe have a people who are dying of hunger,\u201d Luis Florido, a congressman who leads the National Assembly\u2019s foreign policy committee, told lawmakers in November, calling the food crisis \u201ca humanitarian emergency that all Venezuelans are living.\u201dKenyerber was born healthy: 6 pounds 7 ounces. But his mother, Mar\u00eda Carolina Merch\u00e1n, 29, was bitten by a mosquito and infected with a severe case of the Zika virus when Kenyerber was 3 months old. She had to be hospitalized, and doctors instructed her to stop breast feeding because of serious complications from her illness.Unable to find or afford infant formula, the family improvised with whatever they could find: bottles of cream of rice or cornstarch, mixed with whole milk. It did not provide Kenyerber with the nutrients he needed.At 9 months, his father found him listless in bed, with blood running from his nose. He rushed him to the overcrowded pediatric emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital, where patients and beds spill out of rooms, into dingy hallways paced by armed soldiers.Kleiver Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez, 3 months old, was being treated for severe malnutrition a few beds down from Kenyerber. He too was born healthy \u2014 8 pounds 2 ounces \u2014 but his mother, Kelly Hern\u00e1ndez, could not breast-feed him, either.Again, despite searching endlessly, Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez and her boyfriend, C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez, could not get infant formula for their son. It was not for lack of trying.In online inventory searches of Locatel, one of the largest pharmacy chains in Venezuela, The Times found that only one of its 64 locations across the country reported having the infant formula doctors had prescribed for Kleiver in stock.It is unlikely that Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez could have afforded it anyway. Hyperinflation has shriveled wages paid in the local currency, bol\u00edvars, to a small fraction of what they were worth two years ago. A month\u2019s worth of the formula Kleiver needed cost more than twice the entire monthly salary that Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez earned as an agricultural worker.Formula shortages hit the hospitals, too. Doctors in the emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital said they had no formula in stock to feed patients like Kenyerber and Kleiver. The 2016 National Survey of Hospitals found that 96 percent of Venezuelan hospitals reported not having all of the infant formula they needed to attend to patients. More than 63 percent reported having no formula at all.With so few options, Kleiver\u2019s mother warily prepared bottles of rice starch and water, occasionally with whole milk, when they could find it. It was not enough.His parents had taken him to three emergency rooms. Each hospital was full. \u201cI was desperate \u2014 and seeing so many, so many children in the same situation as our boy,\u201d Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez said.When they were admitted to Dr. Domingo Luciani, they were tremendously relieved. But soon they watched a steady stream of parents arriving with malnourished babies \u2014 only to leave, crying, \u201cMy child has died!\u201dThey waited anxiously for Kleiver\u2019s condition to improve, sleeping in a chair by his side or in the courtyard outside, on alert to go searching for any supplies the doctors might ask for.After 20 days in the hospital, they became one of the families they had watched in horror. A team of doctors worked for hours to help Kleiver, inadvertently covering him in blood and bruises as they tried to insert a tube into his neck. By the time doctors finally accepted that they could not save him, his lifeless body looked brutally beaten. Kleiver had suffered an incredibly painful death, his doctors said \u2014 one that they said could have been avoided had infant formula been available.More than 100 friends and family members came to the all-night wake in Kleiver\u2019s family home. His aunts and cousins hung large posters decorated with colorful hand-drawn cartoons and messages. Kleiver lay underneath, in a small white coffin, on paper wings.Just three months earlier, the family had colored signs and tacked them to the walls \u2014 to celebrate his birth. One still hung over his bed the night of his wake, cut into the shape of a balloon.\u201cWelcome Kleiver Enrique, I love you so much,\u201d it said.After the sun came up, the neighborhood held a large funeral procession to the cemetery. Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez collapsed on a nearby tombstone, sobbing uncontrollably. Overcome by the guilt of not being able to breast-feed or find infant formula for her son, she shouted repeatedly, \u201cAm I an awful mother? Please, just say it!\u201dIn Barquisimeto, Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez rushed into the emergency room, shouting: \u201cI\u2019m coming in with an 18-day-old baby. He was fed with anise tea, cow\u2019s milk and sometimes breast-fed by a neighbor. It\u2019s a bad one!\u201dDoctors and nurses at Dr. Agust\u00edn Zubillaga University Hospital of Pediatrics worked quickly to assess the baby, Esteban Granadillo. He weighed 4 pounds 10 ounces, and looked scared, fixing his hollow eyes on the doctors outside the thick plastic walls of his incubator.\u201cTell me what you gave him to eat,\u201d Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez asked the boy\u2019s great-aunt, Mar\u00eda Peraza, who had taken him to the hospital. \u201cThis child\u2019s stomach was destroyed and possibly even his liver by what you fed him!\u201dChildren suffering from malnutrition occupied four of the 12 beds in the pediatric emergency room that day in August. Doctors there said they had received malnutrition cases nearly every day \u2014 a rarity until the crisis started getting worse two years ago.But only a fraction of the medicines they need are available. In June, the hospital director at the time, Dr. Jorge Gaiti, said he had requested 193 necessary medications from the government agency responsible for distributing them to public hospitals. Only four of the 193 were delivered, according to the reports visible on his computer. The hospital even lacks the most basic medical supplies \u2014 soap, syringes, gauze, diapers and latex gloves.Nurses send parents away with lists of items to look for in pharmacies or to buy from the black-market vendors who circle the hospital, selling exorbitantly priced, hard-to-find medical supplies.Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez said she felt indignant and helpless as a doctor, as children died in her emergency room unnecessarily. \u201cIt is unfair,\u201d she said.Esteban\u2019s mother was single, disabled and unable to breast-feed him, his great-aunt said. In desperation, relatives had asked a neighbor with a young child to step in and breast-feed. The family also fed him bottles of cow\u2019s milk, or chamomile water and anise tea, to fill his stomach.\u201cWe could not find formula anywhere,\u201d said Ms. Peraza, the great-aunt, acknowledging that she knew the food could hurt the baby. \u201cYes, it was bad, but I tell you \u2014 if we had not done it, this baby would have died.\u201dMs. Peraza stayed at the hospital next to Esteban\u2019s incubator for days, stroking his stomach through the openings and whispering softly to him. He spent weeks in and out of the hospital \u2014 and died on Oct. 8.Three floors above, pediatricians examined a 1-month-old baby, Rusneidy Rodr\u00edguez, a week after she was admitted for severe malnutrition. Her mother, hospitalized with an infection, had been unable to breast-feed her. As in Esteban\u2019s case, her relatives had been unable to find formula, so they made bottles out of what they could find: whole milk, cream of rice, or water mixed with barley \u2014 an ingredient used to make beer.The emergency room was so overwhelmed that gurneys overflowed into the hallway. Sometimes the hospital has to double up patients, two per bed.In the incubator next to Esteban, a 5-month-old girl, Dayferlin Aguilar, struggled to open her eyes and smile at her mother, Albiannys Castillo. Ms. Castillo had brought Dayferlin to the hospital when the little girl became very weak, falling in and out of consciousness and suffering uncontrollable diarrhea. Doctors diagnosed malnutrition and dehydration.Ms. Castillo could not produce any breast milk, so she routinely arrived at 1 a.m. to wait in line outside pharmacies until they opened, to search for infant formula. More often than not, she said, they had none in stock or would run out by the time she got to the front of the line.\u201cYour mam\u00e1 is here with you, my daughter \u2014 and I love you,\u201d she told Dayferlin when the little girl managed to open her eyes.Dayferlin died three days after being admitted to the hospital. She was buried with fuchsia-colored wings made from paper, trimmed in turquoise, with a matching crown placed on her head.Oriana Caraballo, 29, waited in line for hours with her three children \u2014 Brayner, 8; Rayman, 6; and Sofia, 22 months \u2014 to enter a crowded soup kitchen run by a local Roman Catholic church in Los Teques. Aside from drinking water, they had not eaten for three days.Before the crisis, Ms. Caraballo fed her children using the wages from her job at a restaurant. Now she wept as she spooned soup into Sofia\u2019s mouth \u2014 and recounted how her children had foiled her suicide attempt.Ms. Caraballo could not bear the pain of watching her children go hungry. She said she had taken them outside her home, while her baby daughter was sleeping, then went back inside and shut the door. She hung a cable and wrapped it around her neck, she said. When she was just about to hang herself, she heard her daughter start to cry.\u201cI heard a voice tell me, \u2018Do it, do it, do it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThen in my other ear I heard, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it \u2014 look at your children.\u2019\u201dHer son called to her, telling her to open the door. She became overcome with guilt and decided against suicide. Her oldest son has fainted several times at school, from going without breakfast or dinner the night before. He cries every night because he is hungry and, at 8, begs his mother to let him work to buy food for the family.A recent report by the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization found that 1.3 million people who used to be able to feed themselves in Venezuela have had difficulty doing so since the economic crisis began three years ago.Caritas, the Roman Catholic aid group, has been weighing and measuring groups of children under 5 in working-class communities in multiple states since last year. Fifty-four percent of children in them suffer from some sort of malnutrition, the study has found.Many families scavenge for food in the streets or at garbage dumps. Few are homeless, and most said they had never had trouble finding food before the crisis. Hundreds of people can be seen picking through garbage cans each evening when restaurants, grocery stores and residential buildings take out their trash for collection.In the coastal town of Mor\u00f3n, dozens of people waded knee-deep in garbage at a large dump, looking for food and recyclables to sell. The nearby port in Puerto Cabello was once the driving force behind the local economy. Now it is largely empty.Many of the people picking through the trash at the dump said that they used to work in the port but were now desperate to feed their families after being laid off once ship traffic slowed to a trickle. Several mothers said they had never imagined having to feed their families from discarded garbage.Families are also increasingly sending their children into the streets to beg, or to work for money for food. Some never returned.In Caracas, two brothers \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Luis Armas, 11, and Luis Armas, 9 \u2014 said they had run away from home, where there was scarcely enough to eat. Now they live in the streets with other homeless boys in street gangs, getting into knife fights to expand or defend their territories and to control areas for panhandling or picking through garbage for recycling.Several of their friends have been killed, they said. Luis raised his shirt to show a large gash across his stomach \u2014 the result, he said, of a machete attack by a member of another gang. The attack nearly killed him, he said.They say they prefer to live on the streets, despite the danger, because they eat better than they could living at home with their families. They spend their days panhandling, searching for discarded food and recyclables, bathing in public fountains, stashing their belongings in trees and storm drains, while constantly avoiding run-ins with the police and rival gangs.Nelson Villasmil, a government social worker in the capital, said that before the crisis, most of the homeless children he encountered lived in the streets because of parental negligence or abuse. But now when he interviews them, he says, they often tell him they left their homes because there was no food to eat.\u201cWhat they cannot find in their houses, they go to find in the street,\u201d Mr. Villasmil said.Three months ago, Yail Fonseca, 13, said he left his home in Los Valles del Tuy to search for food in Caracas.\u201cI left my home because things are hard,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t eating well.\u201dHe says he eats better as a homeless person on his own in the capital than at home with his family on the outskirts of the city. He sleeps under an overhang at an outdoor skate park with a group of other homeless adults and children, waking up at 6 a.m. to search through garbage for food or beg for handouts from local restaurants.In the evenings, he says, he practices sparring with other young members of his gang, using sticks to become more agile at knife fights. His leader requires them to practice at least 30 minutes a day.The gang leader, an adult who would not reveal his full name, said they had a code: If anyone in the gang is attacked by a single member of a rival gang, he must defend himself alone, even to the death, no matter how old he is. The rest of the gang will step in only if a member is attacked by multiple rivals at once. Four young members of the gang had been stabbed to death in recent months, the leader said. The boys around him lifted up their shirts to show their own scars.Sometimes the state steps in, taking away children from some homes where hunger is common. After two of their children died of complications from malnutrition, Nerio Parra and Abigail Torres lost three more \u2014 to social workers.Their 7-month-old daughter, Nerianyelis, died in September 2016 when the family could not find infant formula for sale, they said. Mr. Parra had a full-time job at a company that makes labels, but the couple said they could afford to feed their children only once a day. The morning Nerianyelis died, she was sluggish and very thin. Her parents said they had carried her in the rain to the hospital, to no avail.Abigail was so distraught that she broke down and refused to let go of her daughter\u2019s body, they said. Hospital security had to forcibly separate the two. Then on Dec. 1, 2016, their 5-year-old son, Neomar, who suffered from malnutrition, dehydration and other ailments, died as well, his case worker said.After Neomar died, social services took away the three remaining children and placed them in group homes. Now, the couple visit their surviving children and go to the cemetery to visit the graves of their deceased ones.The burden of caring for children in Venezuela can be so great these days that many women are opting to be sterilized. Just after dawn one Saturday in July, 21 young women dressed in surgical gowns waited to be surgically sterilized during a free event at the state-run Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez Hospital in a working-class neighborhood of the capital.The hospital says it has sterilized more than 300 women through this program. On that Saturday, all 21 of the women, who ranged from 25 to 32 years old, said they already had children and wanted to be sterilized because the economic crisis had made it too difficult to raise children. Each feared becoming pregnant again, citing dire shortages of essential supplies like diapers, formulas, milk and medicine.The crisis has also led to widespread shortages of birth-control pills and condoms. Many of the mothers at the sterilization event said that their most recent pregnancies had been unplanned and unwanted, but that they did not have access to birth control.Eddy Far\u00edas, 25, a hair stylist, said she was nervous about the operation but resolute in her decision to undergo it. As a single mother with a full-time job, she said her wages at a salon were barely enough to feed her five children.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be a mom,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your child gets sick, you have to run circles trying to find a hospital,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a war just to survive day to day.\u201dAfter her operation, she said, she was in pain from the large incision across her lower abdomen, but relieved.\u201cIf I got pregnant again, that would mean I\u2019d have to go to war again for diapers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is like war to have to buy diapers on the black market, or have to wake up before dawn to wait in long lines and fight others for the food, the diapers, the personal things a child needs.\u201dSix weeks after cutting out angel wings from the food rations box to bury Kenyerber, his family was still battling hunger.His mother, Mar\u00eda Carolina Merch\u00e1n, said she had wilted to 66 pounds from skipping meals so that her four surviving children had a little more to eat. Government social workers said she was severely malnourished, as were her own mother and her 6-year old daughter, Marianyerlis. The family has gone as long as five days at a time without consuming anything besides water.Marianyerlis follows Ms. Merch\u00e1n around for hours, wailing and sobbing, begging for food. Ms. Merch\u00e1n stares blankly at the floor as tears roll down the little girl\u2019s cheeks.\u201cMama, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d she cries.Her weight fluctuates between 20 and 29 pounds, depending on how much food she is able to get. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 6-year-old girls who weigh less than 35 pounds in the lowest fifth percentile. Marianyerlis recently fainted after going two days without eating.The family have made their home with relatives in an abandoned government housing project, with no running water or indoor plumbing, and jury-rigged electricity. It is uncomfortable, but all of their income must be spent on food.Baby portraits of the children, one of their few cherished belongings, hang prominently on the wall. The only food in the entire house is half a bag of salt, and one lime.\u201cThis is a nightmare,\u201d said Ms. Merch\u00e1n\u2019s sister, Andre\u00edna del Valle Merch\u00e1n, 25, describing how the children start to vomit, sweat and become sluggish after days of not eating. Her own 5-year-old daughter had lost 11 pounds this year and now weighed only 17 pounds, she said.The suffering of Venezuelan families is expected to worsen next year. Beyond the I.M.F.\u2019s warning that inflation could surpass 2,300 percent, observers worry that the leftist government will continue to refuse international aid for political reasons.\u201cIf they accept the help, they accept that there is a humanitarian crisis here, and officially recognize that their population is vulnerable, and just how much their policies failed them,\u201d said Susana Raffalli, a specialist on food emergencies who consults for Caritas in Venezuela.The Venezuelan government has used food to keep the Socialists in power, critics say. Before recent elections, people living in government housing projects said they were visited by representatives of their local Socialist community councils \u2014 the government-aligned groups that organize the delivery of boxes of cheap food \u2014 and threatened with being cut off if they did not vote for the government.Kenyerber\u2019s relatives do not expect the economic crisis to improve anytime soon. They fear that another child in the family may die as well.\u201cI worry about it day and night,\u201d said his aunt, Andre\u00edna.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Venezuela\u2019s president.

{"Headline": "George Weah Wins Liberia Election", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONROVIA, Liberia \u2014 For decades, Liberia has waited through war and strongmen for a peaceful democratic transfer of power. On Thursday, as the last ballots in a presidential election were being tallied, that appeared to be on the verge of happening.In electing Mr. Weah, Liberian voters are investing in him hopes that he can build on one certain accomplishment of Mrs. Sirleaf: keeping the country out of war. But Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s government has also been plagued with corruption charges, high unemployment and a shambolic health system that is still trying to regain its footing after the devastation of the 2014 Ebola epidemic, which killed more people in Liberia than anywhere else.Mr. Weah, 51, will take over the running of Liberia without Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s long history of public service. His only experience in government office has been his three years as a senator, representing Monrovia, a time during which his opponents criticized him for failing to speak up during legislative sessions.Unlike Mrs. Sirleaf, who came to power in 2005 after 35 years on the global scene, Mr. Weah will not be able to call on an international network of allies to help. When Mrs. Sirleaf was trying to rescue the Liberian economy, she got her country\u2019s $4.7 billion debt erased. When her country\u2019s health system needed help fighting Ebola, Mrs. Sirleaf got President Barack Obama to send 3,000 American troops to Liberia.Mr. Weah\u2019s global contacts are primarily in the international soccer world, and he recently credited Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, coach of the English powerhouse Arsenal Football Club, with mentoring him when he was a soccer player in Europe. Whether Mr. Weah can use his sporting credentials to help build roads and schools and bring back jobs will be among his biggest challenges. It also remains to be seen whether he will continue to allow the level of freedom of speech that has characterized Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s tenure.Mr. Weah responded by stepping back, keeping his supporters off the streets and remaining quiet as the drama unfolded around him.The runoff, originally set for October, was finally scheduled for the day after Christmas. That is a day when many voters might be expected to be recuperating at home after the holiday \u2014 and the result was as many people expected. Voter turnout was low. It was a last-gasp effort by the vice president\u2019s forces to save him from defeat, critics in Monrovia said. But in the end it did not work.Liberia\u2019s National Elections Commission announced on Thursday that Mr. Weah, with 98 percent of votes counted, was beating Mr. Boakai handily. Mr. Weah had 61.5 percent of the more than one million votes tallied, while Mr. Boakai had 38.5 percent, the commission announced.The elections commission stopped short of declaring Mr. Weah the outright winner at a news conference on Thursday, with officials saying they would have final results soon. But at Mr. Weah\u2019s Congress for Democratic Change Party headquarters, hundreds of people with crackling radios held to their ears erupted over the results.In Gibraltar, the Monrovia neighborhood where Mr. Weah grew up, residents on Thursday spoke about how their slum was now a \u201cpresident\u2019s community.\u201d\u201cPeople can classify our community, saying that\u2019s so-so gronah people living here, and today this community is coming to produce a president,\u201d said Veronica Doe, 46, using a Liberian-English reference to street boys.Ms. Doe, a mother of seven, said she had played kickball on the same dusty soccer field as Mr. Weah in the 1980s. Now she sells small plastic bags of water out of a cooler, one of the thousands of market women who drive the local economy.Next to her stall, a narrow alleyway edged by concertina wire led to the modest house where Mr. Weah was raised by his grandmother, which is now occupied by other tenants. Women sold charcoal, biscuits and bread on the stoop and children ran around.Mr. Weah\u2019s is a rags-to-riches story. He emerged from the slums of Gibraltar with an uncanny ability to weave behind a soccer ball all the way up the pitch, and eventually gained fame as a world-class striker for the Italian team A.C. Milan. He won the soccer world\u2019s greatest individual honor, the Ballon d\u2019Or, and was named by FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body, as the African Player of the Century.He never got to compete in the World Cup, because Liberia was engulfed by civil war, instigated by President Charles Taylor, during the height of Mr. Weah\u2019s soccer years and was unable to muster up 10 other players good enough to qualify.Mr. Taylor is now locked up in a British prison for war crimes. But in the surreal world of Liberian politics, Mr. Weah\u2019s running mate, who will now presumably be his vice president, was Mr. Taylor\u2019s ex-wife, Jewel Howard Taylor.Ms. Taylor caused a stir early in the election campaign when she told reporters that although her ex-husband was no longer involved in Liberian politics, he still had promises that needed to be kept. She called for putting Mr. Taylor\u2019s agenda \u201cback on the table.\u201dThe resulting uproar led Mr. Weah\u2019s party to muzzle Ms. Taylor, and she became more circumspect on the campaign trail.Mr. Weah, meanwhile, was running against an ex-girlfriend, a model turned philanthropist named MacDella Cooper who says he is the father of her third child.But his behavior during his third election bid converted many former skeptics. In his first two campaigns, which he lost to Mrs. Sirleaf, Mr. Weah\u2019s youthful supporters were criticized for threatening their opponents with violence. Many young men who supported him went through the streets of Monrovia, chanting \u201cNo Weah, No Peace,\u201d and getting into fights.For 43 days in 2005, Mr. Weah himself protested Mrs. Sirleaf\u2019s election. It was only under heavy pressure from the international community and local authorities, who dismissed his allegations of fraud, that he finally accepted the election results to \u201callow peace,\u201d he said, in Liberia.This time around, with Mr. Boakai claiming that Mr. Weah\u2019s lead in the polls was a result of fraud, the candidate took the high road. His youthful supporters stayed off the streets. Even when the runoff election was delayed by Mr. Boakai\u2019s complaints, Mr. Weah\u2019s supporters stuck with the electoral process.On Thursday, they were reaping the rewards. Richard M. Nahas, 20, a Weah supporter, said he had high expectations of Mr. Weah.\u201cI want him to bring job opportunities and to build the economy of the country \u2014 that\u2019s the main thing now we need,\u201d said Mr. Nahas, dressed in a yellow Cameroon national team soccer jersey.Clair MacDougall reported from Monrovia, and Helene Cooper from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hito Steyerl Is an Artist With Power. She Uses It for Change.", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Blurry selfies, pixelated screen shots, Photoshop disasters: Low-quality, mass-reproduced pictures flood our screens every day. They are easy to dismiss, but the German artist Hito Steyerl makes a case for their value.In her films, lectures and essays, Ms. Steyerl, 51, has never shied from revealing the secrets she uncovers. She illuminates the world\u2019s power structures, inequalities, obscurities and delights. She pushes buttons as she spins parables.Ms. Steyerl\u2019s films are densely packed, mixing fact and fiction, documentary footage, computer-generated images and often appearances by the artist herself. They zoom in on, and pan out from, some of the most complex, pressing issues of our time \u2014 among them surveillance, alienated labor, militarization, protest culture, corporate domination and the rise of alternative economies.But the films\u2019 politics are served up with appealing, accessible pop-culture aesthetics, sardonic humor and the odd four-letter word. Viewers have stood in long lines at venues like the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles or the German pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale to enter Ms. Steyerl\u2019s installations, which present the films in environments that might look like a giant wave or the blue lines from the 1982 movie \u201cTron.\u201d Visitors might leave pondering exploitation, dancing to a disco tune from the soundtrack, or both.\u201cIn my films, accessibility is something I do on purpose,\u201d said Ms. Steyerl (pronounced SHTYE-earl), speaking in measured English sentences in a cafe in the Kreuzberg district here. When not lecturing to packed audiences or teaching media art at this city\u2019s University of Arts, she works from her home nearby. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make films that are so specialized that they\u2019re only accessible to people with prior knowledge or histories or references.\u201d The films always, she explained, have one layer that anyone can understand.Ms. Steyerl\u2019s influences range from Godard, New German Cinema and the work of the experimental filmmaker Harun Farocki, to martial arts flicks and Monty Python. References swing from Bruce Lee to the Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor W. Adorno. (Ms. Steyerl earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Vienna in 2003.)Beyond the films are Ms. Steyerl\u2019s writings and her \u201clecture performances,\u201d which are famously hypnotic. Delivered in a yoga teacher\u2019s or Jedi master\u2019s slow, soothing voice, her speeches weave disparate ideas together. \u201cShe\u2019s a legend onstage,\u201d Mr. Koch said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who made a lecture performance into an aesthetic event. They\u2019re sometimes sublime. She transcends her material.\u201dAnd there\u2019s something almost digital about reading her essays, many of which evolve from her talks. The writing seems almost as if it were toggling among browser tabs.\u201cHito\u2019s writing is stylistically very different than that of an academic or a journalist \u2014 there are juxtapositions and allegories that go far beyond the usual range of writing,\u201d said the American artist Trevor Paglen, a longtime friend whose art also explores information flows and power structures.Steyerlisms like \u201ccirculationism\u201d (the more an image moves through the digital or real world, the more power it accrues), or \u201cjunktime\u201d (the fragmented, distracted experience of the harried freelancer) fascinate undergrads and professors alike.Ms. Steyerl explained the concept in her new book\u2019s title. On the one hand, \u201cduty-free art\u201d can refer to art in \u201cfree ports,\u201d tax-free storage facilities in places like Switzerland or Singapore: \u201cnondescript and pedestrian buildings in the suburbs, where a lot of art would accumulate without being seen,\u201d she said.\u201cBut duty-free art,\u201d she continued, \u201ccould also be art that\u2019s not subject to the duty of having to represent either a culture of a nation or some other interests involved in presentation and production.\u201d Does she mean the avant-garde dream of truly autonomous art? \u201cThere\u2019s no complete autonomy \u2014 you can only even start thinking about autonomy in relation to other things,\u201d Ms. Steyerl said.\u201cIn Defense of the Poor Image\u201d became an instant classic in art theory circles. \u201cHer previous texts don\u2019t become dated; her ideas keep circulating,\u201d Ms. Aranda said. \u201cPeople take her work and build upon it. And she\u2019s not afraid of the truth of her time. That\u2019s important for generations that come after her.\u201dAs broad as Ms. Steyerl\u2019s practice is, she sees herself first and foremost as a filmmaker. Born and raised in Munich, she trained as a camera operator, then studied filmmaking in both Japan and her hometown. In the late 1980s, she worked as an assistant to the German director Wim Wenders. She intended to become a classical documentary filmmaker, but things didn\u2019t quite work out that way.According to Mr. Koch, part of this artist\u2019s appeal is her integrity. \u201cShe has complete loyalty to her ethical positions,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is the personification of her work.\u201d It is perhaps odd, then, that Ms. Steyerl took the No. 1 spot on ArtReview\u2019s Power 100 list. \u201cI had no idea whatsoever that this would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a lot of attention. It\u2019s not focused on my work, so it\u2019s not helpful. So I\u2019m trying not to engage with it.\u201dIn the Kreuzberg cafe, Ms. Steyerl discussed world politics and changing contemporary conditions. We might either become so addicted to the web that we lose track of the material world, or we will \u201cjust get bored and log off,\u201d she said. The art scene is also shifting. \u201cA few strands are slowly forming, pulling into different directions,\u201d she said. \u201cOne is heavily involved in fashion and branding. Then there\u2019s a noncommercial section of art. Those paths will grow apart even more in the next couple of years.\u201dFor all the accolades and recent ubiquity \u2014 or claims, in some circles, that she takes advantage of the very system she critiques \u2014 Ms. Steyerl is refreshingly humble. She is also inquisitive, punctual, quick to respond to emails, and married with a 12-year-old daughter. She was even uncomplainingly game for walking through mud in her trademark hot-pink sneakers to be photographed.\u201cI don\u2019t think the internet or a big digital corporation will manage to capture all of human relations. It\u2019s too boring,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a while, people want to talk to one another, one on one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Year of Nonstop News, a Batch of Business Books Worth Reading", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThis year has been a big one for business news. But if you have some time during this holiday week to step back from the information onslaught, there are a handful of truly eye-opening business books that are worth your attention. As I do every year, I pored over dozens of books to identify several gems.Ms. Goldstein admirably shows all sides of this story, capturing in microcosm all of the issues that so many communities across the United States are facing. You will probably be left doing some hard thinking about what is driving the politics of the moment, although Ms. Goldstein brilliantly, and respectfully, paints the book\u2019s characters with such nuance that readers from across the ideological spectrum are likely to arrive at different conclusions about heroes and villains.While we\u2019re on the topic of the declining middle class, Walter Scheidel\u2019s \u201cThe Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality From the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century,\u201d is a smartly argued book. As you may be able to tell from the title, Mr. Scheidel makes the case that throughout history, inequality has led only to terrible things (think pandemics and wars). For anybody who has ever debated issues related to inequality and their broader meaning, this book provides more than just a powerful thought experiment.Another well-told book about leadership, one that intelligently masquerades as a book about sports, is Sam Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Captain Class: The Hidden Force That Creates the World\u2019s Greatest Teams.\u201d Mr. Walker spent years identifying the most successful sports teams in history, and then tried to figure out what had made them that way. His answer: \u201cThe most crucial ingredient in a team that achieves and sustains historic greatness is the character of the player who leads it.\u201dWith genuine insight, he describes seven characteristics of great captains, whom he refers to as Tier One captains. One trait in particular stuck out to me, especially in this age of selfies: \u201cMost of the Tier One captains had zero interest in the trappings of fame. They didn\u2019t pursue the captaincy for the prestige it conveyed.\u201dMr. Enrich, a former Wall Street Journal editor who is now an editor at The New York Times, turned what could have easily been a dry academic story into a page-turning, John Grisham-like thriller. Mr. Lashinsky\u2019s book gives readers an inside view of the ride-hailing giant\u2019s creation and what created the broken corporate culture that yielded so many negative news stories this year.Although she lost her case, she may have won something larger, or at least started a larger movement. \u201cI could have received millions from my adversaries if I would just have signed a nondisparagement contract; I turned it down so I could write this book and share my side,\u201d she writes.If you\u2019re a wonk, two books worth nerding out on are \u201cAdaptive Markets: Financial Evolution at the Speed of Thought,\u201d by Andrew W. Lo, and \u201cMachine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future,\u201d by Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson. Fair warning: These books are not beach reads, but they do make significant contributions to the fields they cover.Mr. Lo\u2019s book offers a unique way to think about the idea of \u201cefficient markets\u201d \u2014 a new hypothesis worth considering about how markets can be rational and irrational at the same time. \u201cMachine, Platform, Crowd\u201d is a forward-looking take on how business will interact with artificial intelligence and what that will mean for the transformation of industries.Advertisement"}

They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences \u2014 to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.Already, the tax bill has been pushed ahead in an unprecedented fashion. Obamacare had months of hearings and debates. So did the tax cuts signed by George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan and the deficit-reduction packages signed by Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.Only three Republican senators are needed to stop this. It can be any combination of senators who care about the dignity of the institution, the deficit and the middle class.I hope that there are at least three such senators, who woke up this morning and realized the madness of passing major tax legislation in extreme haste.\u201cThe irony is that older, white America needs more of younger, diverse America to ascend into the middle class so it can generate the tax revenue to support the baby boom\u2019s retirement.

{"Headline": "Review: the Agrarian Kitchen Eatery & Store in New Norfolk, Tasmania", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Sculptural light fixtures, which look like geometric antlers with glowing tips, stand out dramatically. Sunlight streams in through the tall, antique windows, illuminating the farm equipment hanging on the wall. These \u201cartisan garden tools\u201d are for sale, along with a few other well-chosen kitchen and decorative objects. The spade costs $225; the hoe is $113.The food here is focused on simplicity and seasonality, the kind of pleasure one might derive from a thick piece of dense and springy sourdough bread served with fresh cultured butter. Many things are pickled or otherwise fermented. Fresh farmer\u2019s cheese arrives on your polished wooden table sprinkled with tiny, purple garlic flowers alongside chewy pretzels encrusted in caraway seeds.At one end of the room you can glimpse through to a gleaming kitchen, where hunks of meat are cooked over an open fire, giving the whole dining room a slight scent of wood smoke. Behind the long bar, Adi Ruiz, one of Australia\u2019s most accomplished bartenders, shakes and stirs drinks using garden-fresh ingredients.But there\u2019s a stark, almost shocking contrast between Agrarian Kitchen and its surroundings. That room\u2019s high ceilings and striking windows are linked to its history, as the infirmary for the women\u2019s wing of Tasmania\u2019s largest mental hospital. The restaurant is smack in the midst of the ruins of that asylum, a hulking sprawl of old brick and stone buildings that rise ominously from the side of the road as you enter New Norfolk, the town where Agrarian Kitchen makes its home.The word \u201cagrarian\u201d conjures the kind of fantasy that wealthy urbanites like to indulge, centering on a relationship with nature and food that is full of beauty and wholesomeness. Romantic notions of country life are an important part of Tasmania\u2019s, and indeed Australia\u2019s, self-image. But despite its stunning natural beauty, the economic and social reality in much of the state is fraught.Inside that beautiful room, all seems well. The head chef, Ali Currey-Voumard, is from Tasmania, but honed her skills in some of Melbourne\u2019s best-known kitchens. Now that she is back in her home state, Ms. Currey-Voumard is helping to invent a regional Tasmanian variant of new Australian cooking, with produce leading the way.At the height of spring, the most astonishing thing on the menu was a pile of fresh asparagus, blanched and shocked, and set over kefir cream sprinkled with chives and crumbled bresaola. The accompaniments were nice enough, but the revelation came with the lush green flavor of the asparagus itself. A few weeks later, as spring leaked into summer, the dish was still lovely but not quite as thrilling, the vegetable having lost some of its adolescent charm.A lot of what is on offer at Agrarian Kitchen resembles wholesome farmers\u2019 market-driven home cooking, but with slight cheffy twists. A fat pork chop, cooked just a tiny bit past juiciness, sat in a pool of dark green sauce made from lovage and anchovy. There is always one shareable large-format hunk of wood-fire-cooked meat on the menu, served with a flurry of sides. A Berkshire pork shoulder came with tongs for pulling apart its tender meat and crackling crispy skin, accompanied by boiled pink eye potatoes with bay leaf butter. It made for the kind of meal that felt communal and hearty and nourishing, almost humble. Like getting back to the land, to something that is true and pure.Despite all this, the contrast between the restaurant\u2019s feel-good aura and the surrounding landscape made it hard for me to feel particularly pure about the experience. The dark history of the Royal Derwent hospital, and the dark present of New Norfolk, give the entire operation a haunted quality.The hope, of course, is that New Norfolk will eventually match the bucolic story that Agrarian Kitchen is selling. Many see it as a beacon of hope, a use for these vast historic buildings, a lure for other like-minded businesses and a way to bring tourists and jobs to New Norfolk. (A significant percentage of the business\u2019 employees are from New Norfolk and Lachlan; many of them work at both the restaurant and the farm.)If Agrarian Kitchen represents the future of Tasmania \u2014 its potential tourist economy, its charm, the deliciousness of its food \u2014 it also hints at the problematic stories that the moneyed creative class tells itself about the value of its own consumption. Agrarian Kitchen is a lovely restaurant. It is also a bourgeois fantasy, one that trades on some dubious strengths: the sugarcoated romantic charms of rural life; our blas\u00e9 slavishness to all things artisan; and the precarious thrill of eating a $200 lunch on land that\u2019s stained by human misery.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

Beijing is overreaching and starting to burn bridges across the West and in the developing world.This position echoes that of other European leaders who argue Beijing has kept the door closed to foreign investment in too many sectors of its economy while exploiting the openness of European markets and snatching up leading European technology companies over the past few years. Demands are growing that Beijing offer equal treatment to European companies in China.China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, a grandiose trillion-dollar trade and investment strategy to reconnect Eurasia and position China at the center of the global economy, is also facing resistance. While the United States is only now waking up to the threat from Chinese money to its democracy, the developing world has long known the extent to which Beijing is willing to influence politics and societies abroad.Backlash is likely in Sri Lanka as well. After accepting Beijing\u2019s talk of \u201cwin-win development,\u201d and amassing billions in Chinese loans, the Sri Lankan government recently ceded control of the strategic port of Hambantota to Beijing for a 99-year lease in return for debt forgiveness. But few tenants love their landlord, particularly one that is charging you rent to live on your own land. Prominent politicians have already accused the Sri Lankan government of selling the country\u2019s sovereignty to Beijing.It should be no surprise that authoritarian powers are not good at making friends, particularly with democracies, which favor open markets and freedom of speech. If Beijing seeks to calm concerns in the West over its influence in politics and society, it may need to revamp its policy that prioritizes economic gains. Instead, China would be well served to consider its own history of resentment regarding outside intervention, and look to build new cooperation and compromise with the West.Beijing is gradually building warmer relations with Tokyo based on economic and social cooperation. This may offer a path forward for Beijing to overcome its differences with Western democracies, to disengage from political interference, and to refocus on building partnerships that can expand the trade and investment that brought it to the heights of the global economy in the first place.China leaves 2017 with frayed relations across much of the West. If it does not pull back from these intrusions on Western democracies, the overreach will ultimately reduce China\u2019s global power.Luke Patey is a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and author of \u201cThe New Kings of Crude: China, India, and the Global Struggle for oil in Sudan and South Sudan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a season when Washington politics has been overwhelmed by the naked greed of special interests, this may win pride of place as the single most greedy, corrupt and damaging such action.It is hardly a secret that American telecommunications markets are monopolized by a very few large corporations, and that the current F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, worked for one of those large firms, Verizon.

Giving monopolies more power will make it harder for new companies to enter the marketplace and limit the pace of innovation.In sum, Mr. Pai and the end of net neutrality exemplify everything that is currently wrong with Washington. Vested interests corrupt the policy process, lie to the American people and make decisions that further concentrate wealth and power in the hands of an elite few, with bleak consequences for the American people and our economy.Taking a clear stand against this may at the very least increase the chance that the inevitable next such outrage can be stopped.The writer is a professor of political science at Marquette University.To the Editor:Pay for what you use.

{"Headline": "A Fed Rate Increase Is Expected. But What Comes Next?", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is expected to end the year by raising its benchmark interest rate for just the fifth time since the financial crisis, as it continues to slowly unwind its post-crisis stimulus campaign. But pressures are building that could prompt the Fed to start moving a little more quickly.The Fed is widely expected to acknowledge the strength of the economy by increasing its benchmark rate by one quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, after its final policy meeting of the year. Investors, however, already are looking beyond that decision. They want to know what comes next and whether the Fed, which will soon have a new chairman and several new governors, will deviate from the patient approach of the current Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.The Fed predicted in September that it would increase rates three times in 2018 and two more times in 2019. On Wednesday, the Fed is also scheduled to release a new round of economic projections. Some Wall Street analysts expect stronger growth will push the Fed to add at least one rate increase in each of those years.\u201cMost F.O.M.C. members had not built tax reform into their September projections, and progress has been much more rapid than they (or we) expected,\u201d Seth Carpenter, chief United States economist at UBS, wrote in a research note, referring to the Fed\u2019s policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee.He said the Fed was likely to predict faster growth, less unemployment \u2014 and more rate increases.The pace of increases has broad implications for the economy. The Fed held interest rates at a low level after the financial crisis to stimulate economic growth by encouraging investors to take risks and consumers and businesses to borrow money. By increasing rates, it is reducing those incentives.The Fed is trying to keep growth at a sustainable pace. It does not want the economy to grow so fast that it drives inflation above 2 percent a year, and it does not want to stall the economy and cause a recession.\u201cI think conditions are supportive,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, the Fed governor who is awaiting confirmation as the Fed\u2019s next chairman told the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing last month. Still, Mr. Powell said, there must be a vote. \u201cWe need to go ahead and have the meeting.\u201dFinancial markets have also shrugged off the Fed\u2019s efforts to tighten borrowing conditions. Rates on many loans have declined since the Fed\u2019s most recent rate increase, in June, and credit terms have loosened.The pending tax cut is a complicating factor. Monetary policy influences economic conditions gradually. In adjusting interest rates, the Fed must anticipate the evolution of those conditions. It also faces political pressure from Republicans who do not want the benefits of their tax legislation to be offset by faster rate increases.Mr. Powell tiptoed gingerly around tax cut questions at his confirmation hearing. He said that the Fed had not attempted to estimate the impact of the bills passed by the House and the Senate, and that it would not to seek to forecast that impact until the legislation became law.\u201cWe will incorporate, when it\u2019s done, fiscal changes that are made,\u201d he said.The presidents of some of the Fed\u2019s regional reserve banks have offered their own forecasts, generally in line with the consensus among independent economists that tax cuts would be likely to increase both economic growth and inflation by a modest amount in the short term.Because some Fed officials think the economy is already growing at a pace that is likely to increase inflation over time, they have said that faster growth would not be welcome.\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy doesn\u2019t really need it,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said late last month.Economists at Goldman Sachs analyzed the Senate version of the tax cut using the Fed\u2019s economic model and concluded that it would add about 0.25 percentage points to economic growth for a few years, which could cause the Fed to raise rates by an additional half a percentage point above current projections.Proponents of the tax plan argue that it will deliver a larger increase in economic growth, both in the short term, by increasing spending, and in the long term, by increasing investment.But Fed officials have expressed skepticism about such forecasts. The government is planning to leave more money in taxpayers\u2019 pockets, and some of that money is likely to be spent. But most economists expect the benefits will be tempered by a large increase in the federal debt, driving up interest rates. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 2014 that every dollar of increased federal borrowing reduced private sector investment by about 15 to 50 cents.Some proponents of the tax plan argue that interest rates will not rise, increasing the benefit. But Mr. Powell at his confirmation hearing indicated that he shared the conventional view.Regarding the increase in the federal debt, he said, \u201cEither taxes will have to go up to pay for that, or you\u2019ll have even more debt, and that will crowd out private capital and private investment.\u201dThe Fed is unlikely to give a complete account of its thinking on Wednesday.Fed officials want to avoid taking sides in the final stages of the congressional battle over the tax cuts. The House and Senate are still in the process of reconciling the differences in their tax bills. Ms. Yellen, who is expected to step down in February, will hold her final scheduled news conference after the announcement, but she may defer questions about the future to her successor.\u201cHer comments will likely not be very interesting,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management. \u201cShe certainly does not want to stir the pot.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jacob Zuma Prepares to Depart a Diminished A.N.C.", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Nelson Mandela\u2019s African National Congress once inspired hope across Africa. It helped liberate black South Africans from white-minority rule, promoting reconciliation with former oppressors and the ideal of a post-racial \u201cRainbow Nation.\u201d It seemed even poised to lift up the rest of the continent with its vision of an \u201cAfrican Renaissance.\u201dBut as A.N.C. members began gathering on Saturday to elect a new leader, many analysts described the still-dominant party as a shadow of what it once represented \u2014 bereft of ideals, roiled by insiders fighting over diminishing spoils, abandoned by a growing list of disillusioned graying party heroes known as \u201cstalwarts.\u201dFor many at home and across Africa, the once heroic liberation movement is now synonymous with corruption and cynicism. South Africa has become a normal nation.The winner of the party election is expected to become South Africa\u2019s next president in the 2019 elections unless the A.N.C. loses its overwhelming strength in Parliament, which selects the nation\u2019s top executive.In his final address as party leader, Mr. Zuma acknowledged that the A.N.C. had been weakened and needed to be renewed. But he blamed outside forces \u2014 which have also been the ones to check his exercise of power \u2014 and launched into a broad and bitter attack on the opposition, the judicial system, the news media and civil society.He reserved his harshest words for the white-dominated business community, saying that the party needed to be protected from \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d\u201cTheft and corruption in the private sector is as bad as that in government,\u201d he said.Two front-runners are locked in a tight race to succeed him, embodying starkly different strains within a deeply divided party.Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a medical doctor and anti-apartheid veteran who served in several roles in previous governments, is also a former wife of Mr. Zuma. She has his support and that of many of his allies, and has adopted his populist rhetoric.State enterprises, through the awarding of contracts, or tenders, have created an entire class of A.N.C. loyalists sometimes derided as \u201ctenderpreneurs.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing exceptional in what has happened to the A.N.C. because it is the path that all African liberation parties have taken,\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst. \u201cIt has failed to modernize from liberation politics to managing a complex modern society.\u201d\u201cWhat makes this different is that people\u2019s expectations of the A.N.C. were higher because it was a latecomer and because of Mandela.\u201dApartheid ended in 1994, well after liberation had swept the rest of the continent. Mr. Mandela served as South Africa\u2019s first democratic president from 1994 to 1999. His successor, Thabo Mbeki \u2014 whose Pan-African vision was encapsulated in his phrase \u201cAfrican Renaissance\u201d \u2014 was forced out of power in 2008 before the end of his second term by Mr. Zuma and his allies.As the A.N.C. and other liberation parties have remained virtually unchallenged, the nation\u2019s fiercest political fighting has occurred inside the governing party. As A.N.C. delegates from across the country converged in Johannesburg, the closeness of the leadership contest underscored the deep fissures inside the party.Should Ms. Dlamini-Zuma win \u2014 and she has the support of the party\u2019s youth and women\u2019s leagues \u2014 most experts predict a continuation of the Zuma era. Analysts point out that Mr. Zuma, who is still dogged by a multitude of corruption charges, would probably be protected under a government she led.Ms. Dlamini-Zuma has adopted some of her ex-husband\u2019s populist language, railing against \u201cwhite monopoly capital,\u201d the term used by critics of the concentration of wealth in the hands of white South Africans.She has said that, as president, she would focus on \u201cradical economic transformation\u201d by redistributing the country\u2019s wealth from whites to blacks and that she did not care about getting the backing of the country\u2019s business groups.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised white minority capital is not endorsing me,\u201d she said last month.Ms. Dlamini-Zuma has defended her public record \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t loot government coffers,\u201d she said \u2014 but she has said little about the widespread corruption under her former husband.A victory for Mr. Ramaphosa, in contrast, would be likely to give the economy a quick boost and prevent a further downgrade of the country\u2019s national sovereign debt, which has fallen to junk level because of Mr. Zuma\u2019s efforts to gain direct control over the country\u2019s treasury and other policies that have driven away investors.Mr. Ramaphosa could also win back some black middle-class voters who, in recent years, have begun abandoning the A.N.C.A key negotiator in the talks that led to the end of apartheid, Mr. Ramaphosa was Mr. Mandela\u2019s chosen successor as president. But after losing to Mr. Mbeki, Mr. Ramaphosa entered business, where his career has given him a more troubling legacy.In 2012, in the worst killing of civilians since the end of apartheid, the police shot dead 34 wildcat strikers at a platinum mine in Marikana belonging to Lonmin, a company where Mr. Ramaphosa sat on the board.Mr. Ramaphosa, who returned to politics in 2012, has pledged to fight corruption. But during the more than three years he has served as deputy president under Mr. Zuma, he remained largely silent on the issue and stood behind the president, though he has tried to distance himself in recent months.Neither candidate has inspired people the way past leaders have done over the A.N.C.\u2019s 105-year history. Africa\u2019s oldest liberation party, it once captured minds and hearts across the continent.\u201cFor people in my generation, we grew up in the anti-apartheid struggle,\u201d said Owei Lakemfa, a veteran labor activist in Nigeria, where many A.N.C. leaders sought refuge before the end of apartheid. \u201cThe A.N.C. held a lot of promise for us then.

The interviews were conducted last week; officials are not allowed to comment publicly on monetary policy in the week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.The obvious ones you think of are Uber vs. taxis, Amazon vs. retail, Airbnb vs. hotels. But every business is facing disruption. What we\u2019re finding is increasingly businesses lack pricing power. Even since I\u2019ve been sitting in this seat, I talk to maybe 30 C.E.O.s a month, and some businesses that had pricing power two years ago are now telling me stories that they\u2019re in the middle of a price war.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Near a Big Win \u2014 but Will It Lift Them Politically?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut it remained to be seen whether the result \u2014 a convoluted measure that would cut corporate taxes and have mixed benefits for individual taxpayers \u2014 will spare Republicans from an emerging political backlash that was evident in Democratic election victories around the country last month.Democrats said Republicans were sacrificing their core claim as the party of lower taxes for middle income Americans, while populist voters allied with President Trump may be unimpressed with deep cuts to the corporate tax rate, added protections for multimillion-dollar inheritances and other breaks for the rich.Still, after an epic failure in their efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and little else of legislative note to show for their control of Congress and the White House, Republicans breathed a sigh of relief after they rounded up enough votes to approve the measure and send the Senate into final tax-cut negotiations with the House.The satisfaction was evident in the wide grin sported on Friday by Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, as he prepared to celebrate on the floor with his colleagues \u2014 a stark reversal from his downcast demeanor when the bill momentarily teetered Thursday evening in a potential replay of the health care fiasco.\u201cThis is about doing what we promised the American people,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the head of the Republican Senate campaign organization that will play a major role in selling this tax plan to voters in advance of midterm elections next November.Republican leaders did not see much alternative to meeting the final demands of uncommitted Republican senators since they were under immense pressure to get a win \u2014 any win. They hastily added provisions to appease Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana and offered assurances to Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on immigration policy to guarantee their votes.Democrats conceded that approval of the legislation \u2014 a sweeping bill that will cut corporate taxes and double the standard deduction \u2014 will prevent the first year of the Trump administration from being a legislative failure. But they believe that Republicans have made a political blunder because the reconfiguration of the tax structure \u2014 particularly new limits on the ability to deduct state and local taxes \u2014 will produce a tax increase for some voters who will be very unhappy when they realize it.That could cost Republicans one of their bedrock principles. To appease party contributors demanding action on taxes, they may give up their mantle as the party of \u201cno new taxes.\u201d\u201cToday may be the first day of a new Republican Party \u2014 one that raises taxes on the middle class,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cThe one thing Republicans always promised the middle class is \u2018we are not going to raise your taxes.\u2019\u201dTop Republicans were hoping that their success on the tax legislation after a difficult struggle would break through to the public and provide evidence to Americans that the Republican-controlled Congress could be effective. They say that the deep cuts in business taxes should spark an economic expansion that will benefit all Americans, though that argument has been disputed by economists and not reflected in past experience.\u201cThis is a signature effort,\u201d said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, adding: \u201cThis is at least in our view the restoration of an American renaissance and economic opportunity, for kids, grandkids and everybody present.\u201dParty strategists note that the Senate tax bill also includes some other long-sought Republican goals such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration and elimination of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\u201cConsidering the conventional wisdom that surrounded this Congress eight weeks ago, this is nothing short of a complete and total 180,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains in close contact with him.Democrats say that many voters already see the tax overhaul as heavily tilted toward the affluent, and they promise to drive that point home in the coming months.\u201cI am overwhelmingly hearing from people, what are the Republicans doing? Why are they pushing this big agenda that is going to put our country in trouble?\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cThey all say it\u2019s such a giveaway to the wealthy and are just really stunned that this is happening.\u201dTax policy can be hard for voters to grasp, as former President Barack Obama learned early in his term. The economic recovery act that he signed into law in 2009 included a number of tax cuts; the biggest one was titled \u201cMaking Work Pay,\u201d and it offered a tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples.But Jason Furman, who advised Mr. Obama on economic policy and is now teaching at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the cut did not register in the American psyche.\u201cOur perception in the White House was that no one had any idea that we had cut their taxes,\u201d he said.Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, pointed to the strong Democratic showing \u2014 including a win in the governor\u2019s race \u2014 in his state in November and said voters are going to be disappointed when they don\u2019t see the benefits of the tax bill.\u201cIn Virginia this past year, you had a Republican candidate that was running on a platform of tax cuts, and you had a Democratic candidate who was running on a platform of health care, and you saw the results,\u201d Mr. Warner said.But Republicans were frantic to do something big legislatively and a tax bill was the obvious policy area where they could come to agreement, even if it didn\u2019t come very easily. The months ahead will determine whether the effort staved off a political debacle or contributed to one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Korea, the Virtual Currency Boom Hits Home", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Choi Whal-soo has been through the wringer of speculative bubbles.After selling his real estate agency near Seoul, he invested in South Korean stocks and then watched them plummet in value after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. He tried to recover, continuing to play the stock market and lotteries, but lost yet more money.Last week, Mr. Choi visited the physical location of one of South Korea\u2019s many new virtual currency exchanges, with a plan to put about a quarter of his remaining $18,000 in savings into virtual currencies.\u201cI may have missed the Bitcoin boat but new boats are coming and I want to hop on those,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that some might be scams but even with those, the prices will rise at least in the middle of their life cycles so that there will be a chance to make money from trading them.\u201dAround the world, ordinary people, with no prior experience in virtual currencies, have been lured into the virtual currency markets in recent weeks by the soaring prices of Bitcoin and its competitors.In Japan, small-time speculators have swarmed to Bitcoin since the government there essentially legalized the virtual currency earlier this year and gave licenses to several exchanges.But nowhere has the public frenzy been more feverish than in South Korea. It was on South Korean exchanges that the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 last Monday, hours before traders in the United States reached the same level of exuberance.These volumes are all the more remarkable because just a year ago virtual currency markets barely existed in Korea, unlike in the United States and China, where virtual currency trading has grown over a number of years.\u201cThis can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,\u201d he said in a statement after a cabinet meeting.Mr. Lee called on the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to take a closer look. South Korean regulators have already announced a ban on so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies.But the exchanges where existing virtual currencies are traded come under essentially no regulatory oversight in South Korea, unlike in the United States and Japan.Mr. Lee said he was particularly worried about young people who have gotten caught up in the markets.\u201cThere are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multilevel marketing for frauds,\u201d he said.Virtual currencies are not the first speculative markets to take off among ordinary investors in South Korea. The country has some of the most active foreign currency markets for small-time investors, allowing people to trade between the won, dollar, euro and smaller currencies.Ha Tae-hyeong, a professor of economics at the University of Suwon, said that South Koreans have been drawn to speculative trading because of the lack of other high-yield investment options.\u201cPeople were looking for anything that would bring them higher return on investment,\u201d Mr. Ha said.Chung Gong-jin, a 16-year-old high school student, said he had been drawn to Bitcoin because it has gone up so quickly, and doesn\u2019t require the same amount of knowledge as stock investing.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to study so much to invest in Bitcoin \u2014 about the market or the economy, for example \u2014 that I need to do to invest in stocks,\u201d said Mr. Chung, who lives in a suburb of Seoul.Mr. Chung is part of a 100-person group that meets to talk about investments and attend virtual currency conferences.Even virtual currency enthusiasts in South Korea are concerned about the sudden rush into Bitcoin and Ether. They say investors are often getting in with little grasp of how virtual currencies work, like the decentralized network where all the transaction records are kept, or why they may be valuable over the long term.\u201cI do feel sorry to see so many people being shortsighted about Bitcoin, just trying to predict its price changes over short term to make quick money,\u201d said Kim Joon-young, a 28-year-old who runs a popular virtual currency Facebook group, Plan B.For now, the South Korean Bitcoin exchanges that have sprung up over the past year have done their best to stoke the excitement.Unlike in the United States and Japan, where exchanges are entirely online, a number of South Korean operations have set up store fronts where investors can come to buy in and learn more.Coinone, the second largest exchange in the country, opened a location in September in the financial district of Seoul, Yeouido, with an area for meetings, a help desk and virtual currency ATMs.One day last week, around lunch time, a group of about 35 students from Konyang University were visiting the Coinone office for an introductory class on virtual currency investing.Lee Jeong-min, a 39-year old social worker and author, was there to buy Ripple, a virtual currency that has been popular for cross-border bank transfers.Ms. Lee said she saw some of her conservative friends, including teachers and pharmacists, getting rich on Bitcoin and she didn\u2019t want to miss the next wave.\u201cI realized that I missed a bus, the Bitcoin bus, so that I can\u2019t hop on that bus anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t miss the next bus coming, can I?\u201dMs. Lee said she spent around 300,000 won, or around $275, on 900 Ripple.Mr. Choi, the 77-year-old former real estate agent, was also at Coinone, getting advice from the help desk on how to log in and invest from his home computer. He didn\u2019t trust his cellphone with the transactions.Like Ms. Lee, Mr. Choi felt it was too late to get in on Bitcoin. He is placing his big bet on the Ethereum network, and its Ether currency, which was designed to allow for a wider variety of transactions than Bitcoin.He said he knows he might lose money, but he was holding out hope.\u201cI might die tomorrow. I am an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that hope keeps people going. Without dreams, there is nothing for a man. Hoping that things would get at least a little better is important.\u201dSu-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea and Nathaniel Popper reported in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Even in Poland, Workers\u2019 Wages Flow to North Korea", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPOLICE, Poland \u2014 At an isolated shipyard on Poland\u2019s Baltic coast, men in coveralls used welding torches under a cold drizzle, forging an oil tanker for a customer in the Netherlands. The scene was unremarkable, save for the provenance of a dozen of the workers.\u201cYes, we are from the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWe have been here quite a while.\u201d Then he hurried away, alarm seizing his face.Four other welders confirmed that they were also from North Korea, the pariah state threatening the United States and much of East Asia with nuclear weapons. They, too, then scampered off.But the continued presence of these workers in Poland \u2014 a NATO ally at the heart of the European Union \u2014 underscores how difficult it is to fully sever North Korea from the global economy, even as the nation accelerates efforts to build a nuclear missile capable of striking the United States.Poland sent soldiers to fight alongside Americans in Iraq, but is nonetheless one of the few countries still hosting North Korean workers over Washington\u2019s objections.The State Labor Inspectorate, which regulates working conditions at Polish companies, said that perhaps 450 North Koreans remained in the country as of mid-2017, employed by at least 19 companies, including a complex of greenhouses growing tomatoes south of Warsaw.But The New York Times found North Korean workers at two other businesses \u2014 the shipyard in Police, near the German border, and a factory that makes shipping containers in the town of Czluchow, 100 miles southwest of Gdansk.In Poland, provincial governments issue work permits to foreign laborers, and there is little coordination with national agencies. As a result, no one appears to know precisely how many North Koreans are in Poland or what they are doing.The Foreign Ministry has urged local governments to stop approving work permits for North Koreans, and new legislation taking effect in January will require them to do so. But until now, the provinces have persisted, illustrating the durability of commercial relationships forged during the Cold War, when Poland was a fellow member of the Communist bloc.Relations between Poland and North Korea cooled after the fall of the Soviet Union, but Poland remains one of seven European nations to maintain embassies in Pyongyang.The Times requested information on work permits issued to North Koreans from Poland\u2019s 16 provincial governments. Nine responded, reporting that they had given 124 new permits to North Koreans in 2017, and 253 the previous year.Washington has intensified pressure on countries to stop hosting North Korean laborers, and the list of countries doing so has dropped to perhaps 16, including Austria and several Persian Gulf states, from about 40, according to human rights groups and United Nations reports.\u201cThe E.U. has been afraid of driving Poland further away,\u201d said Remco Breuker, a historian and Korea expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands.In a warren of streets near the Oder River in Police, a dreary town of 40,000, North Korean workers are often seen walking near train tracks from the Partner shipyard to a grocery store.Sometimes they squat on the sidewalks in front of their dormitory, smoking cigarettes while braced against a biting wind. In the evenings, they trudge to buy pastries or vegetables. On Sundays, they congregate at a local elementary school for soccer games.\u201cIt\u2019s something very unusual,\u201d said Pawel Wieczorkowski, deputy director of the local unemployment office. \u201cIt\u2019s exotic.\u201dThe workers appear intent on maintaining a low profile. With few exceptions, North Korea\u2019s totalitarian government forbids citizens from mixing with outsiders. Those who fall under suspicion can face arrest.\u201cWe are here legally. We pay taxes to the local government,\u201d a North Korean worker said after being approached outside the dormitory. Asked about reports that workers have been mistreated, he snapped, \u201cThey are all lies!\u201d Then he got in a van and drove away, down a muddy alley.North Koreans working elsewhere in Poland also keep to themselves.At the greenhouse complex that employs North Koreans, the workers\u2019 dormitory was surrounded by a seven-foot-high concrete wall. But through a crack, a heavyset man in a thick parka could be seen directing six women to wash a blue Ford van in the winter chill.In Koldowo, a speck of a village some 200 miles northwest of Warsaw, residents said a group of North Koreans arrived in early 2017 for jobs at Remprodex, a manufacturer of shipping containers in the nearby town of Czluchow.During their first months, they slept inside empty containers despite the cold, residents said. Later, the workers rented half of a house tucked inside a walled compound.Remprodex did not respond to questions, and Times reporters were turned away at the estate of the Kociszewscy family, which owns the greenhouses.The countries hosting North Korean workers have defended the arrangements, arguing that they expose the laborers to the outside world and help them support their families. Conditions back home can be so desperate that some North Koreans pay bribes to get these jobs.But human rights organizations, North Korean defectors and United Nations monitors have described the assignments as forced labor because the workers are physically confined, under constant surveillance and deprived of most of their wages.As many as 147,000 North Koreans now work abroad, according to a recent estimate by the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, and the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in Pyongyang is said to seize anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of each laborer\u2019s earnings.That amounts to a significant revenue source for a regime increasingly pinched by international sanctions \u2014 between $200 million and $500 million annually, according to most experts.The call that would put her in business with North Korea came around 2007, Cecylia Kowalska recalled.At the time, she ran a company in the port city of Gdansk that supplied electrical and welding services to the shipping and construction industries.A shipyard in Gdansk needed someone to manage 10 North Korean welders who had worked there in the past, she said. They had been employed through another firm that had struggled to pay them on time.Ms. Kowalska, now 67, said her company, Armex, assumed responsibility for the workers, and then established a relationship with the North Korean partners who had brought them to Poland.She later began supplying North Korean welders to two other shipyards, run by Crist S.A. and Nauta S.A., both companies that make war vessels for NATO members.\u201cThey were skilled and hard-working,\u201d she said of the North Koreans.Ms. Kowalska also served as the legal representative of a company called Wonye that was established to supply workers to factories, shipyards, and fruit and vegetable wholesalers, according to Polish corporate records.The records identify Wonye\u2019s president as a North Korean named Jo Chol-yong.In the mid-1990s, a man of the same name and birth date worked for a North Korean company controlled by the ruling party department that oversees the nation\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, according to a registry of Pyongyang residents smuggled out of North Korea.Wonye\u2019s vice president is listed as Kang Hong-gu, who appears to have previously served as commander of a unit involved in construction, the 8th Sokdojon Brigade, according to the Pyongyang registry.Ms. Kowalska said she helped establish Wonye in 2015 as a favor to one of her North Korean partners but never took an active role and sold her shares the next year.Asked about her partners, Ms. Kowalska said she was uncertain of their names and promised to look them up. But she later declined to identify them, saying that doing so would divulge \u201ctrade secrets.\u201dOnce, she recalled, one of the North Koreans suggested she buy a gift for officials in Pyongyang \u2014 a sword. \u201cA sign of our thanks for this partnership,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was like buying someone flowers.\u201dMs. Kowalska said the partnership proceeded smoothly until three years ago, when a North Korean welder without adequate safety gear burned to death at the Crist shipyard. The accident alarmed Crist\u2019s customers, among them a Danish shipbuilder that had employed the Polish shipyard to handle work on a war vessel for Denmark, another NATO member.Soon afterward, Ms. Kowalska said, she stopped hiring North Korean workers \u201cbecause it became such a sensitive issue.\u201d She added that she was now retired and no longer managed North Korean workers.But her North Korean partners still appear to be active in Poland.On a recent afternoon, Times reporters spotted two vehicles with Polish license plates parked outside the workers\u2019 dormitory at the tomato greenhouses: the van that was being washed and a dark Mercedes sedan.According to records seen by The Times, the van is registered to Wonye\u2019s vice president, Mr. Kang, and the Mercedes to its president, Mr. Jo.Though the European Union maintains extensive labor protections, North Koreans who have worked there describe a parallel reality.\u201cOur girls lived as if they were in prison,\u201d said Kim Tae-san, a North Korean defector who worked in the Czech Republic from 2000 to 2002 supervising 200 young North Korean women in a shoe factory.He said the women were forced to remain during off-hours in their dormitory, where they attended ideological study sessions and could watch only movies and propaganda documentaries sent from home.Once a week, he added, they were allowed out to go to the market \u2014 but only in groups.North Koreans sent to work overseas are vetted for political loyalty, but the government also sends minders to watch them. Mr. Kim said the workers also \u201cmonitored each other.\u201dThe women worked six days a week, earning $150 a month but keeping only about $25 for food and savings. Their supervisors took the rest, Mr. Kim said, spending some of the money on housing but sending most of it back to the authorities in North Korea.Poles who have worked with North Koreans describe similar conditions. A shipyard worker at Crist, for example, recalled how a North Korean colleague fell ill on the job and was urged by a paramedic to stop working. Instead, the man became frantic, insisting he had to continue.Ms. Kowalska scoffed at allegations of abuse and said the North Koreans she managed enjoyed \u201ca normal life.\u201d\u201cThey asked us for advice on what to buy their wives and kids,\u201d she said. \u201cThey liked to buy lingerie for their wives. It was a popular gift, and they would ask us about inexpensive shops.\u201dShe said her company paid the workers about $780 per month. She acknowledged at first that Armex sent a portion of their wages to a North Korean company, but later said she had misspoken and no one took a cut.As international scrutiny has intensified, the State Labor Inspectorate has vowed to investigate claims of abuse. So far, the agency has found \u201cno signs of forced labor,\u201d said Dorota Gorajska, an official responsible for companies that employ foreign workers.Officials acknowledged, however, that inspections have generally been confined to paperwork and that when interviews are conducted, investigators typically rely on translators provided by employers.Given North Korea\u2019s reputation, does that not taint their findings? An official at the inspectorate, Michal Tyczynski, took a deep breath.\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no good answer to this question.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the year when Poland\u2019s provincial governments gave at least 124 new work permits to North Koreans. It was 2017, not 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened to Germany\u2019s Social Democrats?", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHamburg, Germany \u2014 If Chancellor Angela Merkel gets her way, the next German government will include the big loser of the September elections, her center-right Christian Democrats, and the even bigger loser, the center-left Social Democrats. After a failed attempt to forge a coalition made up of the Christian Democrats, the pro-business Liberal Party and the Green Party, Ms. Merkel is urging the Social Democrats, who allied with her in the previous government and were punished at the polls for it, to enter into yet another grand coalition.The Social Democrats are understandably wary of Ms. Merkel\u2019s courtship. Ms. Merkel used the coalition to co-opt many of their ideas, and analysts here believe they need time for therapy rather than another opportunity to ruin themselves in office. But their problems go further and deeper than the past four years; their party has been in steady decline for two decades \u2014 getting 20 percent of the vote today compared with 40 percent in 1998.This downward trend is not limited to Germany \u2014 in most major Western European countries, center-left parties are in retreat, and in some cases they have practically ceased to exist. Just what has happened to social democracy?In Germany, the Social Democrats\u2019 woes are as simple to explain as they are difficult for the party to accept. It begins with a rift between political consciousness and practice: Despite its internationalist outlook, social democracy has always relied on the nation-state as the framework for safeguarding the rights of workers and redistributing wealth.During the late 19th and much of the 20th century, this made sense. But now, this framework is shaken. Ironically, it was the Social Democrats themselves who, after 1989, embraced the idea of a globalized, post-national, post-wall era. In this brave new world, like-minded states fostered transnationalism to limber up for the increased competition of a global economy.But this concept came with two built-in contradictions, a democratic and a social one. Both took their time to become visible, but today they loom large.The first contradiction is that democracy\u2019s apparent victory in 1989 also marked the beginning of the degradation of democracy. The convenient self-delusion of the \u201cneoliberal\u201d decades was that you could strengthen both national democracy (including welfare-state capitalism) and transnational policymaking. Capital could be harnessed to the nation-state at the same time it was being freed to move beyond it. Regional integration, meanwhile, came to mean more than just markets; transnational governance was the watchword.Davos and Brussels were the capitals of this elitist complacency. In the headquarters of worldwide economic liberalization and European integration, respectively, dissenters of the cosmopolitian consensus were branded as narrow-minded or as \u201cEurophobes.\u201d Yet the truth is that you cannot have transnational governance without limiting the powers of national parliaments, thereby limiting the power of the people. And you cannot attempt to control capital at home while loosening the reins that prevent it from moving abroad.The result has been long in coming, and predictable. Democracy has pushed back, through bottom-up agitation from ordinary people who had taken to the streets from Leipzig to Bucharest. And when the elites pushed back, whether it was over the Greek debt crisis or the refugee influx, who was standing alongside them? The erstwhile voice of the people, the Social Democrats.This is not to indict the European center left; who can forget the flush of post-Communist optimism? Democracy\u2019s thorough victory in the Cold War appeared to prove that it was self-supporting. But that optimism led to carelessness, and the na\u00efve belief that labor and capital could finally unite under the flag of Davos.Nor was this completely wrong; the world is a much better place thanks to freer markets and political integration. The problem is that these benefits have been dwarfed by the trickle-up effects to a fortunate few. The increasing wealth has been spread unfairly, and not just in terms of money: Risk of failure has been handed downward to the citizens. This became ultimately apparent in the wake of the financial and the euro crises. It was the regular European who eventually had to pay for high-flying dreams of the Davos elite.Social democracy\u2019s second contradiction is that you can\u2019t promote a borderless world and the welfare state at the same time. Ms. Merkel\u2019s predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, recognized this and pruned back Germany\u2019s overgenerous welfare spending to make the economy more competitive. It was the right move, however unpopular, and the party wisely defends it today. But following these welfare restrictions, how can you convey to your electorate that you are opening the doors of your country to a million refugees and migrants who are entitled to welfare payments?In the last election, millions of angry left-wing voters in places like the Ruhrgebiet, Germany\u2019s equivalent of the Rust Belt in America, saw a state that had plenty of money for others but not for them. The response of Social Democrat leaders was to label such critics \u201cright-wingers\u201d and to demand they embrace even more liberal virtues, like identity and gender politics. This prompted a defection of hundreds of thousands of Social Democratic voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany, which scored almost 13 percent in the election.Sigmar Gabriel, who preceded Mr. Schulz as the head of the Social Democrats and who remains vice chancellor until a new government is formed, seems to get this. In an essay for Der Spiegel, he wrote that the plight of the Democrats in the United States shows \u201chow dangerous it is to focus on issues of postmodernism.\u201d He added, \u201cIf one loses the workers of the Rust Belt, the hipsters in California aren\u2019t going to be of any great use either\u201d in winning national elections.It\u2019s not clear his party gets it, though. With no idea how to appeal to both Berlin hipsters and industrial workers in the Ruhrgebiet, it is no surprise the Social Democrats lack the courage to dig down to the root of their misery. As long as they avoid the two fundamental contradictions of modern social democracy, the decline will continue. And rightly so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. at a Crossroad as It Confronts Turmoil in Honduras", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country has lived through a version of this turmoil before. Eight years ago, a leftist president was ousted by a coup in a fight over what his opponents said was a plan to overturn the constitutional ban on a second presidential term. The resistance movement that sprang up to support him has endured, and the discord that split Honduran society then still defines today\u2019s divisions.Both in 2009 and now, the return of stability in Honduras is important to the United States, which seeks a president there who can be counted on to support American policies to stem the flow of drugs and migrants from reaching the Texas border.The question is whether the United States is willing to overlook a possibly fraudulent election to ensure that outcome.President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, a conservative hoping to win a second term, has been a willing partner on the concerns that matter most to the United States. And as he increased control over every branch of the government since his election in 2013, no objections were raised from the Obama or Trump administrations \u2014 not even when his handpicked Supreme Court justices found a circuitous way to lift the prohibition on running for re-election.How well the White House navigates a resolution of the contested election may not only affect Honduran democracy but also could resound across the region, where elections are scheduled over the next year in seven countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia.\u201cWill the United States remain consistent in defending the electoral process, regardless of whether the country in question is friend or foe,\u201d wrote Juan Gonzalez, an adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Central America, in an email, \u201cor equivocate when the process breaks down in a country that cooperates with the United States?\u201dMore than two weeks after Hondurans voted, the election outcome is still in doubt. According to the count by the electoral commission, which is controlled by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s allies, the president won nearly 52,500 more votes than his main opponent, Salvador Nasralla, who leads a leftist coalition.The Trump administration has endorsed the O.A.S. measures as a way to \u201creach a credible conclusion,\u201d the United States charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires, Heide B. Fulton, told local reporters last week. She delivered the message standing beside the embattled president of the electoral commission, which many Honduran critics viewed as a gesture of support for the agency.In what critics called another diplomatic blunder, the State Department gave Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez a public lift just as the election conflict escalated. Two days after the vote, it certified that Honduras was meeting human rights conditions, strengthening transparency and cracking down on corruption. That approval was required to release 50 percent of the American aid earmarked for the Honduran central government.Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s National Party jumped on the certification as a vote of confidence in the president from the United States, proof that outside countries had recognized his \u201carduous fight against corruption and criminality.\u201dThe aid, about $17 million, goes to Honduran security forces, for counternarcotics and anti-gang programs and to fund an effort to purge the police of corrupt officers and train recruits.But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, who wrote the law requiring approval and is empowered to release the aid, is likely to withhold it for now, his office said. He has yet to release an amount allocated last year.\u201cIn the past, U.S. administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 have always had an overriding foreign policy goal: fighting communism, terrorism or drugs, or stopping migrants,\u201d Mr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in an email.\u201cThese considerations have taken precedence over human rights,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cThat has been the pattern, and the money has kept flowing. It hasn\u2019t produced the results that Honduras needs and that we all want. That needs to change.\u201dThe dispute over the election result can be traced to the erratic behavior of the electoral commission, which first declared that Mr. Nasralla was leading before suspending the count for a day and a half. When it resumed, the trend reversed, giving Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez his small margin.Largely peaceful protests filled the streets in support of Mr. Nasralla. But in some places, security forces shot at protesters, while looting and violence prompted the government to declare a nighttime curfew. Fourteen people, including two police officers, were killed, according to an advocacy group, the Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras.The peaceful demonstrations have continued, although a few clashes between the police and protesters have erupted at roadblocks. Radio Progreso, an opposition broadcaster, said its antenna in Tegucigalpa, the capital, was sabotaged this past weekend.The protests echo the weeks after the 2009 coup when the political and business elite allied with the military to remove Manuel Zelaya from the presidency.The Obama administration sought a quick solution after the coup, pressing Honduras to move ahead with elections already scheduled for a few months later.What followed was an eruption of violence under a presidency that appeared unwilling or unable to control gangs and drug traffickers. The murder rate rose to one of the highest in the world.At the same time, drug gangs corrupted high-ranking police officers and politicians. The son of Porfirio Lobo, a former president, is serving a 24-year sentence in the United States for conspiring to import cocaine.When Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez took office, Washington appeared willing to overlook his more autocratic actions in the hope that he would restore stability. He worked closely with John F. Kelly, then the commander of United States Southern Command and now President Trump\u2019s chief of staff.Only after Honduran children and families began appearing at the Texas border seeking asylum did the Obama administration begin to acknowledge that corruption and the failure of the rule of law were partly responsible for that problem, Ms. Beltr\u00e1n said.The Trump administration has proposed cutting aid to Central America and pushed to end a special immigration status for some long-term migrants in the United States. Sending them home would strain the Honduran economy, which relies on remittances from abroad and could not integrate tens of thousands of deportees.With the White House pushing law and order policies, many worry that the deeper problems facing Honduras will be overlooked.Jeff Ernst contributed reporting from Tegucigalpa, Honduras.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Consider More Generous State and Local Tax Break", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe behind-the-scenes discussions on Tuesday among House and Senate Republicans come ahead of an expected Senate vote to begin the process of aligning its bill with the House-passed legislation. The vote could be held as early as Wednesday.Right now, taxpayers can deduct state and local tax expenses. Both the Senate and the House bills would significantly scale back that deduction, allowing individuals to write off up to $10,000 in property taxes.House Republicans are discussing giving taxpayers some kind of option to deduct income taxes, perhaps within that $10,000 cap.\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at how we make tax-reform relief better for those high-tax states,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, said there were discussions about adding income taxes into the mix when it comes to the state and local tax deduction.\u201cI think there\u2019s a natural conversation being had in regards to expanding the state and local tax deduction from not just property,\u201d he said.Significant changes to the tax bill will probably lean in favor of the Senate because of its narrow majority and strict budget rules, which require that the bill add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade in order to pass along party lines.Some Republican senators suggested Tuesday that they were open to making changes to the bill that they passed in the early hours of Saturday morning, but that they would need to find ways to pay for those changes.\u201cI\u2019m open to trying to make this bill fairer for the upper-middle-income taxpayers in high state and local tax states like California and New York,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cI would like to help everybody, but again, you have to be mindful of the impact on the deficit and on the nation\u2019s debt.\u201dAnother provision being looked at for revision is the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was inserted into the Senate bill at the last minute to help pay for the tax cuts. But its insertion has raised concerns among business groups, which say it will undercut their ability to use valuable tax breaks like the research and development tax credit.Mr. Kennedy said that \u201cin a perfect world,\u201d the corporate alternative minimum tax would be repealed, but he said that deficit concerns might not allow that to happen. \u201cThat\u2019s only one half of the equation \u2014 the other half is can we afford it?\u201d he said.House Republicans fully repealed the corporate and the individual alternative minimum tax in their bill, and Mr. Brady made the case on Tuesday that doing so was the right decision.\u201cBoth of them are very costly, and they add complexity,\u201d he said.Lawmakers are also considering raising the proposed corporate tax rate to 22 percent from a proposed 20 percent to help pay for additional changes. However, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, was cool to the idea on Tuesday.\u201cI think the corporate rate should be at 20,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of the rate, which is currently 35 percent. \u201cBoth bills reflect 20 percent.\u201dThe preliminary deliberations come as Congress faces a Friday deadline to extend government funding while it rushes to get the $1.5 trillion tax cut legislation to President Trump\u2019s desk before Christmas.Despite the optimism among Republicans about their tax plans, some data points on Tuesday suggested reasons for skepticism.Arguments from Democrats that the Republican tax plan will mostly benefit the rich and big companies also appear to be taking hold with the general public. A Gallup survey released Tuesday showed that just 29 percent of Americans support the proposed tax changes in the bills.Protesters organized by progressive groups packed the halls of the Capitol complex on Tuesday wielding signs that read, \u201cDon\u2019t cut health care to pay for corporate tax cuts.\u201dAs the tax code rewrite approaches the finish line, Mr. Trump has taken on the responsibility of making sure that the momentum does not stall.On Tuesday, he hosted a \u201ctaxpayer family event\u201d at the White House for four families from across the country to talk about why they want lower taxes. Mr. Trump also invited Republican senators over for lunch to make sure that the process was moving forward smoothly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Oil and Gas Sector Is Changing \u2014 and So Is Geopolitics", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Geopolitics is power played out against geographical settings. In this battle, ideas and ideologies matter. But it is often the most technical and complex factors \u2014 the ones we least understand and therefore discount, according to Columbia University\u2019s Robert Jervis \u2014 that carry the greatest weight. There may be no factor more influential in contemporary geopolitics and yet least understood by journalists and policymakers than the energy revolution, which is less about renewables like wind and solar power than about how the oil and gas sector itself is changing. A Harvard professor and former assistant to President George W. Bush, Meghan L. O\u2019Sullivan, has dissected the intricacies of this industry to offer a riveting and comprehensive geopolitical theory in \u201cWindfall.\u201dThe decline in crude oil prices from $100 per barrel to around $60 and below over the past two years, along with the widespread ability to extract shale gas through hydraulic fracturing of rock, or fracking, has moved the United States from being \u201cthe world\u2019s thirstiest consumer of overseas oil to a position of greater self-sufficiency,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan writes. Falling energy prices have also stabilized Europe\u2019s economy, helped Japan manage the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, allowed China to more aggressively pursue its new Silk Road strategy across Eurasia (while reducing the pain of a decelerating economy), kept Russia from becoming an energy superpower and weakened the prospects for energy-rich sub-Saharan African countries. \u201cOn the whole,\u201d the author says, \u201cthe new energy abundance is a boon to American power \u2014 and a bane to Russian brawn.\u201d In fact, it was new extraction techniques in tight oil and shale gas that helped ease America out of the recession.But triumphalists beware. Though the United States is now the world\u2019s largest energy producer, it can never be the swing producer of hydrocarbons that Saudi Arabia once was, able to determine world prices by simply deciding how much to pump. That is because the United States is not an autocracy with a national oil company, but a vast network of hundreds of small producers making their own decisions and taking their own risks.At the same time, the energy revolution has laid the basis for a more politically and economically unified North American continent. For this reason, O\u2019Sullivan criticizes Barack Obama for alienating Canada with his delays of the Keystone XL pipeline and Donald Trump for alienating Mexico with his insults and talk of a \u201cwall\u201d between the two countries. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s book lays out Trump\u2019s ignorance of the whole United States-Mexico relationship. In 2015, the two countries traded \u201cmore than $1 million of goods and services every minute.\u201d Rather than \u201csimply trading in final products, the United States and Mexico build goods together, utilizing complex supply chains that crisscross the border,\u201d a grid-work that includes 20 natural gas pipelines.It was on the American side of the Gulf of Mexico where a floating storage and regasification unit was deployed in 2005 for the first time. Once natural gas is shipped in liquefied form, it can be converted back into gas upon arrival across the sea for actual use. Such units are now helping countries in Central and Eastern Europe receive gas from abroad, lessening their dependence on Russia for energy and creating a more globally integrated energy system. No longer dependent on continental pipelines, countries can now receive more gas by sea. This, in turn, has led to cheaper prices worldwide and stark geopolitical implications. China, for one, has benefited. It became less reliant on piped gas from Russia just at the moment when Moscow, reeling from the shale gas boom, was desperate for a natural gas export deal. The result was price concessions to Beijing that Russia otherwise would not have made.For Russia, the rise of liquefied natural gas has placed the country in an increasingly greater disadvantage in competing with China for markets and influence in former Soviet Central Asia. Russia may still have an advantage because of its energy reserves, but it cannot wield energy for political ends as bluntly as it used to. While Russia is weakened, O\u2019Sullivan posits that China will become in some respects a better global actor, since cheaper gas and oil will gradually reduce China\u2019s need for friendship with energy-rich autocratic regimes and, as O\u2019Sullivan observes, \u201creinforces Chinese confidence in one of the key elements of the liberal international order: the market.\u201dThough not wholly original, O\u2019Sullivan writes with great clarity about a frankly dry and complicated subject. In tackling the Middle East, she observes a number of devastating ironies. Cheap oil does not spell the end of Middle East oil producers. It actually helps them, since it could price out high-cost American, Canadian and European oil. A United States that is more self-sufficient in energy will still have to be active in the Middle East to fight terrorism, resist nuclear weapons proliferation, support Israel and bolster other regional allies. Cheap oil spurs economic reform in Saudi Arabia, but also weakens the cause of Kurdish independence, since a successful Kurdish state will depend on oil revenues. Because energy is still only one factor in geopolitics, albeit a crucial one, power shifts will usually be oblique rather than immediately obvious.Yet will Saudi Arabia have a revolution? Will Russia eventually become a low-calorie version of the former Yugoslavia? Will oil-rich Nigeria collapse, or oil-rich Venezuela continue to implode? Much will depend on the price of hydrocarbons in the years and decades ahead. In geopolitics, a $40-per-barrel world will be vastly different from a $100-per-barrel one. Rather than the usual policy pablum, \u201cWindfall\u201d is a smart, deeply researched primer on the subject.Robert D. Kaplan is the author of \u201cEarning the Rockies: How Geography Shapes America\u2019s Role in the World.\u201d He is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a senior adviser at Eurasia Group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once the W.T.O.\u2019s Biggest Supporter, U.S. Is Its Biggest Skeptic", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As officials from the 164 countries in the World Trade Organization gather in Buenos Aires this week for their first major meeting in two years, they will be watching to see whether the United States, once the group\u2019s biggest advocate, is seeking to subvert it.The World Trade Organization knits together countries around the world by working to reduce trade barriers and resolve disputes among its members but it has come under criticism not just from globalization\u2019s critics. Its supporters have said it has fallen short of its ambitious goals to create trade agreements among scores of countries with different economies, cultures and income levels.But it has never faced such uncertainty as it does now, when its longtime leader and champion, the United States, has turned into a skeptic \u2014 putting the future of the group and the kind of broad trade agreements it is aimed at forging in doubt.In recent months, the Trump administration has led the United States in stepping back from its traditional role at the head of global institutions like the World Trade Organization, creating a vacuum in leadership and throwing their future into question.The change reflects a philosophy, shared by the president and his top trade advisers, that the current global structure of rules and organizations compromises the United States\u2019 sovereignty and cheats American workers. In his first year in office, Mr. Trump has criticized international agreements like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pulled out of the Paris climate change accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and began renegotiating trade deals with Canada, Mexico and South Korea.Like many of the administration\u2019s positions, its view of the World Trade Organization represents a historic shift, said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.\u201cThe Reagan and Bush administrations wanted to create it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations tried to strengthen it. Now we have an administration that is very skeptical of it, and some would say has tried to undermine it.\u201dBut what the Trump administration intends to do about the organization\u2019s perceived shortcomings is less clear. Some of the measures proposed under Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic policy appear to make use of the World Trade Organization, while others could violate its rules and undermine its very existence.The question, trade analysts say, is what the Trump administration would do if the World Trade Organization rules against these policies. Several administration officials have suggested that they might respond by ignoring the trade organization or withdrawing from it altogether \u2014 two options that might weaken the organization enough to serve as a death blow.\u201cOn China, there\u2019s lots that can be done using our current trade laws,\u201d said Dan DiMicco, a trade adviser to the Trump administration. \u201cWe can go to the W.T.O. and file more trade cases. And if they don\u2019t work with us, we can leave the W.T.O.\u201dProponents of the trade group are also concerned by what they describe as the Trump administration\u2019s effort to undermine the organization\u2019s system for settling trade disputes among its members.Since President Trump came into office, the White House has blocked the appointments of new judges to a body that considers appeals, slowing the pace at which the World Trade Organization can process trade cases. As more judges see their terms expire in the coming months, experts fear the dispute settlement system could be paralyzed.Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the trend may be intentional. Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer, has been critical of the appellate body for passing judgments outside the scope of the original World Trade Organization agreement \u2014 akin to what some in the United States term \u201cjudicial activism.\u201dIn a speech in Washington in September, Mr. Lighthizer said that Americans tended to view the trade group as a contract with clearly defined rights. \u201cOthers \u2014 Europeans, but others also \u2014 tend to think they\u2019re sort of evolving kinds of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a very different idea between these two things.\u201dThe Trump administration has also been slower than its predecessors to bring trade cases against other countries at the World Trade Organization \u2014 cases that the United States frequently wins, Mr. Bown said. That could soon result in a situation where the United States is losing cases, but not winning many \u2014 a set of circumstances that could fuel opposition to the World Trade Organization in the White House, he said.In other matters, however, the Trump administration is making use of the organization\u2019s rules. That includes the decision to join the European Union in arguing its case before the World Trade Organization for not labeling China a \u201cmarket economy\u201d \u2014 a distinction that would entitle China to preferential economic treatment that the United States feels it does not deserve.So far, the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy does not appear to be greatly dampening international trade.Few trade experts expect much progress out of the meeting in Buenos Aires, which runs through December 13. It\u2019s unclear whether the members will reach a consensus on new rules on global fishing. Other recent efforts toward reforming digital trade and services that were formerly pushed by the Obama administration now appear to be bogged down.\u201cEvery country in the world hates the W.T.O., they just hate all the other alternatives worse,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council and the World Trade Organization\u2019s former deputy director general. \u201cThat\u2019s really the lesson that the U.S. has to draw. It\u2019s easy to hate some system of rules. The question is, what\u2019s the alternative?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Nasty, Nafta-Related Surprise: Mexico\u2019s Soaring Obesity", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "Few predicted when Mexico joined the free-trade deal that it would transform the country in a way that would saddle millions with diet-related illnesses.Supported bySAN CRIST\u00d3BAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico \u2014 William Ruiz S\u00e1nchez spends his days grilling burgers and slathering fried hot dogs with pepperoni and cheese at his family\u2019s restaurant. Refrigerators and fire-engine red tables provided by Coca-Cola feature the company\u2019s logo in exchange for exclusive sale of its drinks.Though members of the Ruiz family sometimes eat here, they more often grab dinner at Domino\u2019s or McDonald\u2019s. For midday snacks, they buy Doritos or Cheetos at Oxxo, a convenience store chain so ubiquitous here that nutritionists and health care advocates mockingly refer to the city as San Crist\u00f3bal de las Oxxos.The family\u2019s experience in food service began in the 1960s, when Mr. Ruiz\u2019s grandmother sold tamales and home-cooked food made with produce from a nearby farm; those same ingredients sustained her boys with vegetable stews, beans, tortillas and eggs. Meat was a luxury.Since then, the Ruizes have become both consumers and participants in an extraordinary transformation of the country\u2019s food system, one that has saddled them and millions of other Mexicans with diet-related illnesses.It is a seismic shift that some nutritionists say has an underappreciated cause: free trade.Mexico began lifting tariffs and allowing more foreign investment in the 1980s, a transition to free trade given an exclamation point in 1994, when Mexico, the United States and Canada enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement. Opponents in Mexico warned that the country would lose its cultural and economic independence.But few critics predicted it would transform the Mexican diet and food ecosystem to increasingly mirror those of the United States. In 1980, 7 percent of Mexicans were obese, a figure that tripled to 20.3 percent by 2016, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Diabetes is now Mexico\u2019s top killer, claiming 80,000 lives a year, the World Health Organization has reported.For many Mexicans, Nafta promised to make real \u201cthe fever dreams of joining the modern economy,\u201d said Timothy A. Wise, a trade expert at the Small Planet Institute and Tufts University. \u201cAll former rural workers would be in new jobs in the burgeoning manufacturing industries of the post-Nafta world. That just hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\u201cThe only way that Mexico became a \u2018first world\u2019 country was in terms of diet.\u201dMr. Zabludovsky said that Mexicans had long been enticed by American food, and that high tariffs used to make it expensive, not unavailable. The economy is now more stable, he said, and Mexicans are living longer \u2014 which is partly why more people are dying from noncommunicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease. \u201cIt\u2019s a symptom of relative prosperity,\u201d he said.Critics of Nafta acknowledge the complex causes of obesity, but argue free trade intensified the problem by opening Mexico\u2019s largely isolated economy.In addition to dramatically lowering cross-border tariffs, Nafta let billions of dollars in direct foreign investment into Mexico, fueled the growth of American fast food restaurants and convenience stores, and opened the floodgates to cheap corn, meat, high-fructose corn syrup and processed foods.The surge in agricultural investment from the north modernized Mexican farming practices but it also displaced nearly five million people who worked on family farms. Many migrated to cities, adding to the ranks of those who rely on Western, processed food.The top two grocery chains and most of the top food service outlets in Mexico are American backed or partners with companies like Walmart, Subway and Pizza Hut. Oxxo, the convenience store chain, is owned by Femsa, a Mexican food and beverage conglomerate that received hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment, helping it grow to 16,000 stores from 400 in 1990.The Ruiz family followed a characteristic narrative, migrating from family farms to cities and adopting the new American-style diet, not just as consumers but as middlemen. They buy ingredients for their restaurant, including cheese, mayonnaise and ground beef, from Sam\u2019s Club, the members-only retail giant owned by Walmart.\u201cI like that a lot of their meat comes from American cows,\u201d said Mr. Ruiz, 28. \u201cIt\u2019s softer and fattier than meat from Mexican cows.\u201dMr. Ruiz, at 275 pounds, and his older brother, Gabriel, at 300, are notably overweight. Their parents\u2019 diets have also changed: Two years ago their father suffered a stroke brought on by hypertension, while their mother has diabetes.Across the world, trade deals have made food more affordable and accessible. A major selling point for the World Trade Organization, founded in 1995, was that it would relax trade barriers so \u201cfood is cheaper\u201d \u2014 though such deals can also influence diet for the worse.In 2007, Samoa, the South Pacific republic, banned the import of turkey tails, a fatty, fried delicacy that nutritionists say has played an outsized role in the island\u2019s roughly 30 percent obesity rate. But when Samoa joined the World Trade Organization in 2012, it was forced to lift its ban on turkey-tail imports.The stark changes carried the Ruiz family along for the ride.During a lull one recent evening at the their restaurant, Dogo Express, the mother of William and Gabriel, Maricela S\u00e1nchez Espino, 62, reminisced about her childhood. Her parents raised corn, zucchini, mushrooms, pigeons and rabbit, and the family ate what they grew.Her husband, Gabriel Ruiz Barbosa, 60, also grew up in rural Mexico. His father, a farmer and beekeeper, was murdered, and his mother made ends meet hawking homemade food.Mr. Barbosa studied agricultural engineering, but Mexico was moving away from its reliance on small family farms.Until the mid-1980s, Mexico had been a protectionist, inward-looking economy but a financial crisis in the early 1980s spurred talk of free trade to stabilize the country, attract foreign investment and spur growth.To its supporters, Nafta would complete the transition. \u201cIt was a change in the economic model,\u201d said Mr. Zabludovsky, the deputy chief negotiator. \u201cWe started to seek the advantage of the geographical proximity to the United States.\u201dThe agreement removed hurdles to cross-border investment and fully eliminated Mexican restrictions on foreign majority ownership in Mexican companies. The United States, Canada and Mexico became an open trading bloc.Mexican exports of fruits and vegetables to the United States soared; enormous quantities of the raw ingredients of processed foods flowed in the other direction.United States exports to Mexico have been dominated by meat, soybeans and corn. The average annual value of grains crossing into Mexico jumped to $4.7 billion in 2016 from $897 million before Nafta. Pork and beef exports also surged during the same period; exports of high-fructose corn syrup jumped to $345 million annually from $5 million.Duncan Wood, director of the center\u2019s Mexico Institute, said falling food prices, coupled with a stagnant economy, have left many Mexicans in a curious economic position. \u201cPeople are able to indulge in more processed food, consuming more calories,\u201d Mr. Wood said, \u201cbut not rich enough to have an affluent lifestyle where they are able to be healthier.\u201dSo went the Ruiz family. As a boy, William Ruiz adored home-cooked meals like traditional thick stews with squash, carrots, potatoes and green beans. The family rarely ate out.But when he was 11, the family moved to Villahermosa, the bustling, heat-scorched capital of Tabasco where American fast-food joints had become plentiful. The Ruizes became avid patrons of Domino\u2019s and Burger King. McDonald\u2019s was their favorite.William savors the memory of his first Happy Meal \u2014 the crispy fries, chicken nuggets and toys nestled in the box. \u201cIt was like having something first-world on your uncivilized ranch,\u201d he said, \u201cIt was beautiful.\u201dIn 2012, after the bar they owned in Tabasco went out of business, the family moved to San Crist\u00f3bal and opened Dogo Express.The sons began to put on considerable weight in their late teens but the elder Mr. Ruiz was not worried. In fact, it was a point of pride. \u201cWe were in a good financial position so we could offer them foods heavy in protein and also fast food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d say to one another, \u2018If they\u2019re a little fat, it means they\u2019re well fed.\u2019\u201dOn a recent Sunday, the Ruiz brothers went to Sam\u2019s Club to stock up for the restaurant. They like the expansive meat section with marbled beef that is often cheaper than the sinewy cuts sold by local butchers.While the causes of obesity are complex \u2014 involving genetics, lifestyle changes and other factors \u2014 multiple studies have linked weight gain to consumption of processed foods high in salt, sugar and fat that are staples of retail giants.In 1991, as negotiators hammered out Nafta\u2019s details, Walmart made its first foreign investment by partnering with Mexico\u2019s largest retailer, Cifra.Oxxo is second in grocery market share.

It\u2019s one of the reasons the growth of these foods is so fast in these countries,\u201d said Corinna Hawkes, director for the Centre for Food Policy at City University London and an expert on trade policy and nutrition. \u201cOxxo is exactly the kind of thing we\u2019re talking about.\u201dJavier Astaburuaga, Femsa\u2019s chief financial officer for 11 years, dismissed the role of free trade in the rise of obesity, saying unhealthy eating habits were taking hold before Nafta. He attributed Oxxo\u2019s growth to its aggressive corporate strategy, not free trade, though he conceded that outside investment gave the company a stronger financial footing to grow all its divisions, including Oxxo.Dr. Wise, from Tufts, said the investment sounded like \u201ca classic paradox \u2014 give with one hand, take with the other.\u201dA spokesman for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust declined to comment.She concluded that, at a minimum, Nafta had sped up Mexico\u2019s dietary transition and the rise of obesity.The impact is a variation on what was feared by Zapatista rebels who swept into San Crist\u00f3bal on New Year\u2019s Day 1994, the day Nafta took effect, burning military barracks and occupying government buildings.\u201cThey said it would be bad,\u201d said Juan Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, 64, a community leader in San Juan Chamula, a farming community near San Crist\u00f3bal, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t believe them.\u201dThese days, he said, diabetes touches most households, and locals seem more enamored by processed food and soda than the fruits and vegetables that grow all around them.\u201cAmerican food and products dominate our lives,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who is also diabetic. \u201cEveryone is sad about the changes but, at the same time, we still go to Sam\u2019s Club and McDonald\u2019s.\u201dThe Ruiz family shared his sentiments.\u201cI know this stuff is bad for me, but I can\u2019t stop,\u201d Gabriel Ruiz Barbosa said, glancing at a tray of McDonald\u2019s sundaes his son was carrying into the restaurant. \u201cMy cardiologist says I should look after myself but I\u2019m very stubborn.\u201dHis son drinks Coke compulsively and suffers from high blood pressure and achy joints. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that one day I\u2019m going to have a heart attack and die,\u201d he said.The family has mixed feelings about open trade.

{"Headline": "How to Build a Tax Calculator That\u2019s Actually Useful", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy job at the Times is to cover data-driven stories about business and the economy. That means I\u2019m used to working with big, complicated data sets, and to figuring out how to present them to readers in a compelling way.Tax data, though, poses a unique challenge. The tax code is a spider web of intersecting provisions \u2014 one small tweak can set off a cascade of effects, which makes modeling the impact of the Republican tax bill difficult. Moreover, every family\u2019s financial situation is different. For all the talk about how the bill would affect the \u201ctypical\u201d household, there\u2019s really no such thing as a typical American family. That makes it a balancing act: Generalize too much, and you won\u2019t provide enough information to be useful. But get too specific, and readers will get lost in a sea of details.In mid-November, my colleague Quoctrung Bui approached me with an idea: What if, instead of showing the bill\u2019s effects for a few broad groups, we showed the effects for thousands of specific people?The highlight of that story was the striking graphic, which Bui, who specializes in data visualization for the Upshot, dubbed our \u201ctax volcanoes.\u201d The volcanoes \u2014 thousands of dots representing individual families \u2014 served a real purpose. They illustrated the wide range of possible outcomes, how families that look similar on paper could experience very different results under the bill.Readers embraced the story, but many of them also reached out to me to ask the same question: Could we present this data in a way that would let them see how they, specifically, would fare?So Bui and I started talking about whether we could build a calculator to let readers enter their financial information and get an estimate of what the bill would mean for them. The trouble is, the data we were using wasn\u2019t up to the task. The Current Population Survey does a good job of collecting data on middle-class families. But it, like most surveys, has trouble capturing people at the top and bottom of the income distribution, meaning we couldn\u2019t show how the bill would affect the really rich or the very poor.Fortunately, Bui had been talking to the Internal Revenue Service about acquiring more detailed data about taxpayers. In early December, we received a file of more than 150,000 real-life tax returns. Now we could see how Americans \u2014 even very wealthy ones \u2014 made their money, what they paid in taxes and what deductions they took.(Don\u2019t worry, the IRS mixes and matches information from different returns to avoid revealing any personally identifiable information.)In putting together the calculator, we made a few big decisions. Most people, we figured, haven\u2019t memorized all their financial information, and they probably won\u2019t have last year\u2019s 1040 on hand when they\u2019re visiting the Times website. So we decided not to ask too many detailed questions about specific deductions or sources of income. Instead, we stuck with five basic questions that pretty much anyone can answer without thinking too hard.That decision led to another one. Since we weren\u2019t asking people for a ton of financial details, we couldn\u2019t figure out exactly how their taxes would change. So instead we provided a range of outcomes, and showed that range visually \u2014 the tax volcanoes made a triumphant return. (Making an interactive graphic with tens of thousands of dots is no mean feat, especially if you don\u2019t want it to take forever to load. So we recruited Adam Pearce and Blacki Migliozzi from our graphics desk to help us make it work. And by \u201chelp us,\u201d I mean \u201cbuild the whole thing.\u201d)The calculator does come with some important caveats. It covers changes only to personal income taxes, not business taxes. As a result, it underestimates how much many wealthy taxpayers would benefit under the plan.And it covers what would happen only in 2018, not what would happen after 2025, when most of the personal-tax changes in the bill are set to expire. With the votes in Congress that have moved the bill closer to being signed into law, we may try to address those shortcomings in the future. There\u2019s always more work to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ajit Pai Nears His Biggest Win With Net Neutrality Repeal", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Small tech companies, consumer groups and many celebrities have been up in arms for weeks about a proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to dismantle landmark rules that guarantee an open internet.But in one speech, Ajit Pai, the chairman of the agency, called the complaints \u201chysteria\u201d and \u201chot air.\u201d In another, he dismissed criticism that by pushing the change, he was doing the bidding of companies like Verizon, his former employer. He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies.\u201cHow do you choose,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween a longtime love and a newfound crush?\u201dThe agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners.Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai\u2019s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers.\u201cAjit Pai has the potential to be one of most consequential commissioners in the agency\u2019s history,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, who is an expert in telecom policy and who supports Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.Even Mr. Pai\u2019s detractors acknowledge that Mr. Pai has been efficient at moving his agenda. Mark Cooper, a staff member of Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Pai has far outpaced his recent predecessors, even if Mr. Cooper does not agree with those efforts.\u201cIn every way,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201chis decisions are bad for consumers and good for big corporations.\u201dMr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement, the F.C.C. said that he \u201chas been focused on making the agency more transparent, closing the digital divide, and updating the Commission\u2019s rules to reflect the modern communications marketplace.\u201dThe agency added that \u201cthe F.C.C. has modernized its rules across a wide range of areas to encourage more competition and innovation.\u201dMr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory fervor began well before the presidential election and his nomination by President Trump.The child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai was lauded by Republicans and Democrats when he was appointed in 2011 by President Obama to the F.C.C. Lawmakers and public interest groups hoped the young nominee would bring a greater appreciation for how communications was shifting online than past commissioners.But for five years as a minority member of the F.C.C., Mr. Pai consistently voted against regulations such as those limiting business broadband prices and a broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. He complained that the agency\u2019s Democratic leaders, including Tom Wheeler, were too heavy-handed with companies.The biggest offense, in his opinion, were the 2015 net neutrality rules, which included the declaration that broadband would be subject to more utility-style rules. He said the regulations would burden the fast-growing high-speed internet market. In dissenting comments during the debate over the rules, he echoed the arguments of telecom companies that the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules made it hard for telecoms to expand their networks, leading to less innovation in business plans and would eventually harm the economy.He also accused the White House of presidential interference in the activities of the F.C.C., an independent agency. Mr. Pai said that the agency had taken its direction only after President Obama posted a video in favor of the net neutrality rules.Mr. Pai\u2019s consistent opposition attracted supporters from free-market think tanks and conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who recently praised the proposal to scrap net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media and was praised in the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.Supporters of net neutrality argue that telecom companies want to become the gatekeepers of the internet, deciding whether sites have access to fast or slow connections. But Mr. Pai has responded by saying the bigger threat is from the big tech companies. Google, Twitter and Facebook, he argues, can deprive consumers of free expression.He says Twitter, for example, sometimes wrongly suspends users just because they do not share the same views as the company.\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d Mr. Pai said last month at an event sponsored by the R Street Institute, a free markets think tank. \u201cWhen it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When the Richest U.S. Cities Turn to the World?", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the economy has changed, so have the relationships between places, to the disadvantage of smaller cities and rural areas.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Well before anyone thought of this place as the center of the tech economy, the Bay Area built ships. And it did so with the help of many parts of the country.A changing economy has been good to the region, and to a number of other predominantly coastal metros like New York, Boston and Seattle. But economists and geographers are now questioning what the nature of their success means for the rest of the country. What happens to America\u2019s manufacturing heartland when Silicon Valley turns to China? Where do former mill and mining towns fit in when big cities shift to digital work? How does upstate New York benefit when New York City increases business with Tokyo?The answers have social and political implications at a time when broad swaths of the country feel alienated from and resentful of \u201celite\u201d cities that appear from a distance to have gone unscathed by the forces hollowing out smaller communities. To the extent that many Americans believe they\u2019re disconnected from the prosperity in these major metros \u2014 even as they use the apps and services created there \u2014 perhaps they\u2019re right. Such a picture, Ms. Sassen said, \u201cbreaks a past pattern where a range of smaller, more provincial cities actually fed the rise of the major cities.\u201d Now major cities are feeding one another, and doing so across the globe.\u201cThese links have been broken,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. Of course, some remain. And antipathy toward prosperous big cities is not a new theme in history. \u201cBut this is different: This is deeper,\u201d Mr. Longworth said. \u201cIt is also, as far as we can see, permanent, simply because the economy that supported the earlier relationships has gone away and shows no sign of coming back.\u201dThe Rise of Global Cities\u201cBig changes have been happening over the last 30 years,\u201d Ms. Giannone said. \u201cNow we\u2019re actually seeing the impact of them.\u201dThose changes have come from multiple directions \u2014 from globalization, from computerization, from the shift in the United States away from manufacturing toward a knowledge and service economy. These trends have buffeted many smaller cities and nonurban areas. The uncomfortable political truth is that they\u2019ve also benefited places like San Francisco and New York.For all of the talk of how globalization has cost America manufacturing jobs, it has created American jobs, too \u2014 but the high-paying ones have tended to go to such cities.Ms. Sassen argues that a global economy has created new kinds of needs for companies: accountants specializing in Asian tax law, lawyers expert in European Union regulation, marketers who understand Latin America. Global cities must connect to other global cities to tap these resources, which have become more valuable to them than lumber and steel.Inventors in these global cities are also increasingly connecting to one another. Using the addresses of patent co-inventors, Mr. Mudambi has traced a steep rise starting in the early 1990s of global connections from a few American metro areas, which are today among the most prosperous in the country.Inventing \u2018New Stuff\u2019 Before Anyone Can Catch UpBut these kinds of ties aren\u2019t truly spreading the Bay Area\u2019s prosperity. Server farms don\u2019t create mass middle-class employment. Using Google isn\u2019t the same as having a hand in engineering it.To put it more harshly, when global cities need other communities today, Ms. Sassen said, it\u2019s often to extract value out of them. New York bankers need Middle America\u2019s mortgages to construct securities. San Francisco start-ups need idle cars everywhere to amass billion-dollar valuations. Online retail giants need cheap land for their warehouses. The rest of the country may receive the innovations that flow out of global cities, and the benefits to consumers are real. \u201cBut by the time that\u2019s done, the cities have already invented something new and made themselves richer again,\u201d Mr. Storper said. \u201cBefore anywhere else can catch up, San Francisco has already leapt ahead again with new stuff they\u2019ve invented.\u201d\u201cThe Torontos, Ottawas and Waterloos in countries like Canada and the U.S., they will link with Shenzhen in China, they will link with Munich and Stockholm in Europe,\u201d Mr. Bathelt said. \u201cAnd other places will be kind of left out.\u201dIn the international network that emerges, global cities stand out. Other places connect to the global economy by going through them.An earlier version of this article misstated a type of ship that was assembled in the Bay Area during World War II.

The younger brother had urged the pardon, so Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s decision on Sunday was seen as a way of rewarding Kenji Fujimori for his help. The younger brother is viewed by some as more likable and a more promising face for the party, compared with his sister, who has twice failed to win the presidency.Both Keiko and Kenji Fujimori issued statements praising the pardon.Other opposition politicians immediately denounced it. Even Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s former allies called the move troubling. Alberto de Belaunde, a congressman, said he would resign from Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s party.Mr. Fujimori, 79, would have remained in prison until age 93 if he had served his full sentence.Suffering from arrhythmia, tongue cancer and other ailments, Mr. Fujimori had requested a humanitarian pardon. He was taken from his prison cell to a hospital on Friday after a drop in blood pressure, doctors said.In a statement, Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s office said that a medical board had determined \u201cthat Mr. Fujimori suffers from a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease and that the prison conditions mean a serious risk to his life, health and integrity.\u201d The board\u2019s conclusions were presented to a presidential pardon commission, which recommended that Mr. Fujimori and seven other inmates be pardoned \u201cfor humanitarian reasons.\u201dRonald Gamarra, a human rights lawyer and anti-corruption prosecutor, dismissed that characterization. \u201cThis pardon is fake and under no circumstance should it be considered a humanitarian pardon,\u201d Mr. Gamarra said. \u201cIt is a political pardon.\u201dBut he also ran roughshod over Peru\u2019s laws and institutions. He was lauded for suppressing two uprisings, the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, but the brutality of his methods drew criticism worldwide and ultimately landed him in prison.\u201cThere will be no peace, no democracy or justice when the pain of the family members who are victims of the atrocities of Fujimori and Montesinos is not respected,\u201d Marisa Glave, a member of Congress from the leftist Nuevo Peru party, said Sunday.Marco Arana, a member of Congress from the leftist Broad Front party, condemned the pardon as a \u201cslap in the face,\u201d saying it would polarize Peru. \u201cWe reject this criminal act,\u201d Mr. Arana said. \u201cThe president has made a mistake and it is an act of criminal politics.\u201dAndrea Zarate reported from Lima, and Sewell Chan from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rouhani Urges Calm in Iran as Protests Continue", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter four days of rare protests that shook Iran, President Hassan Rouhani tried to calm the nation on Sunday, saying that people had the right to protest and acknowledging public concerns over the economy and corruption.\u201cWe are a free nation, and based on the Constitution and citizenship rights, people are completely free to express their criticism and even their protest,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said, according to the state-run PressTV.But he also exhorted Iranians not to resort to violence, after reports of protesters attacking banks and municipal buildings across the nation, including a local government building in Tehran.In 2009, protesters were supporting reformers, but now their discontent appears to be with their leaders in general.Video shared on social media showed the police in Tehran firing water cannons to try to disperse demonstrators in Ferdowsi Square, Reuters reported, although the footage could not be independently confirmed.Two protesters were reported killed in recent days in the city of Dorud, and there were reports of dozens arrested across Iran.With the Iranian news media tightly controlled, it remained difficult to assess the extent of the protests. But they were clearly severe enough that Mr. Rouhani felt the need to respond.State television also said the authorities would temporarily restrict access to Instagram and the messaging app Telegram, to \u201cmaintain peace.\u201d Reports about the demonstrations were being spread on such platforms.The protests flared against the backdrop of a deep economic malaise in Iran, punctuated by rising prices and high unemployment, especially among young people.Those hopes, however, have so far turned into disappointment. Despite the relaxation of nuclear-related economic sanctions and increased sales of oil \u2014 Iran\u2019s most important export \u2014 core American restrictions, including a ban on Iranian use of the United States banking system, remain in place, severely limiting Iran\u2019s efforts to become less isolated economically.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s failure to improve people\u2019s livelihoods has been further aggravated by recent price spikes in staples like eggs, coupled with the government\u2019s plans to sharply reduce subsidies that many Iranians are accustomed to receiving. So resentment toward the government over economic issues is not unexpected.While the Iranian authorities appear to have been surprised by the spontaneity and speed of the demonstrations, outside analysts have little doubt that Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates would use force to suppress them if they felt it necessary. And there is little to suggest that the protesters have leaders or a cohesive message, like those in the 2009 uprising.\u201cThe ongoing protests, by contrast, show no well-defined demands, no leadership or organization, and are diffuse around Iran,\u201d Cliff Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk consultancy, said in an advisory emailed to clients on Sunday.But he also cautioned: \u201cunrest is admittedly unpredictable \u2014 coming days could take unexpected turns. Signposts of a surprise include; a leader or small group of leaders emerging, a defined manifesto, and much larger protests.\u201dIn an apparent response to Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Rouhani said: \u201cThis man who today in America wants to sympathize with our people has forgotten that a few months ago he called the Iranian nation terrorist,\u201d according to PressTV. \u201cThis person who is against the Iranian nation from head to toe has no right to feel sorry for the people of Iran.\u201dSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he had talked to Mr. Trump on the phone on Sunday morning to urge him to be more forceful with the Iranian government. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to watch,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump is tweeting very sympathetically to the Iranian people.

There was a widespread belief that this was just a good thing to do for the country and for us politically.\u201dMr. McConnell said time would tell. \u201cThey are convinced it is good politics to be against it, and we believe it is good politics to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe either get the growth rates or we don\u2019t. In other words, one of these sides is going to be proven wrong.\u201d\u201cWe had endless meetings getting everybody comfortable with the substance,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThat was a stark contrast with a lot of the meetings we had on health care.\u201dSome senators who would require attention were obvious from the health care debate, including Mr. McCain, Ms. Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. And others, including Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, had raised alarms early on about the deficit.Mr. McConnell consulted regularly with Mr. Trump about the influence he could apply on wavering members or those he should steer clear of, as the case may be.\u201cWe talked about it a lot,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of his dealings with the president. \u201cThere were some members who were in doubt that he was helpful with and some he would not have been helpful with.\u201dMr. Johnson, who complained that the bill shortchanged small businesses, was one who came in for added attention from Mr. Trump, who pointedly urged him by name during a private party meeting last Tuesday not to bring down the bill.Mr. McCain was a special case, given his stature and because he had brought down the health care repeal with his complaints that the Senate hadn\u2019t followed \u201cregular order\u201d in developing and debating the bill. His fellow Republicans took pains to keep him updated on the committee consideration and review of the bill and to make the case that a strong economy contributed to America\u2019s strong posture internationally.The potential holdout senators were able to wring out concessions as leaders scrambled to push the legislation to approval, an outcome Mr. McConnell attributed to their skillfully using their leverage. In the end, only one of them, Mr. Corker, peeled away for the final, 51-to-49 vote.Mr. McConnell acknowledged that some Americans would see their taxes go up under the proposal and said it was impossible to do such a broad overhaul without someone paying more.Despite projections the legislation could cost the government $1.5 trillion, he insisted it ultimately would not add to and might even shrink deficits because of the economic expansion he expects it to generate.\u201cWe are pretty confident this is going to get the country up to a higher growth rate, which will improve wages because demand for employees will go up and improve the government revenues as well, which makes the deficit shrink,\u201d he said.Mr. McConnell expects negotiations between the House and the Senate to resolve differences between their two measures to move quickly and meet a goal of delivering a measure to the president by Christmas.Mr. McConnell said the combination of the tax bill and his record of advancing conservative judicial nominees he sees as changing the federal courts for a generation should put those complaints to bed.\u201cIt would be hard to argue that is not a year of significant accomplishment,\u201d he said.How the Republican plan resonates politically could depend on how quickly any benefits from the tax bill are realized, if there are broad benefits to be had.Democrats held united against the legislation and are gearing up to attack it in the coming months as a reckless giveaway to the rich that was forced through along partisan lines and does little for the middle-class voters Mr. Trump promised would be the chief beneficiaries of his tenure.If the predicted economic gains for businesses and individuals don\u2019t materialize, Republicans could pay a steep price \u2014 a fact not lost on Mr. McConnell, who hopes to see hints of accelerated growth soon.\u201cObviously, they hope none of this happens before November 2018,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of Democrats. \u201cAnd obviously, we hope the signs are there before that.\u201d\u201cWe would love for it to happen sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. McConnell said with a wry chuckle.For Mr. McConnell and Republicans, the clock is ticking even as they close in on one of their long-sought achievements.Advertisement"}

Women have charged, with what seems like extreme credibility, that he sexually assaulted them when they were 14 and 16. You\u2019d think that would be enough to do him in.Yet the chronicles of American politics are absolutely stuffed with stories about politicians who shocked their constituents with bad behavior, generally along the sexual line, without being punished at the polls.At this very moment, the House of Representatives includes Scott DesJarlais, a physician and a staunch opponent of abortion rights, who was given a new term after voters learned he had dated his patients while still married to his first wife and pressured one of them to get \u2014 yes! \u2014 an abortion.And of course Mark Sanford, who famously disappeared while on a tryst with his mistress during his tenure as governor of South Carolina, leading to the \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail\u201d explanation, which still has to rank as one of the worst cover-up lines in political history. Although possibly now under stiff competition from Moore\u2019s response when asked whether he\u2019d dated teenage girls. (\u201cNot generally.\u201d)Sanford was censured by the state legislature but finished his term and then won a House seat in 2013, despite a new scandal involving a trespassing complaint by his ex-wife.There are times when I really miss the Mark Sanford era.

And we could keep going back and forth all day.But here\u2019s the bottom line, people. Suppose your state was having a very important U.S. Senate election and one of the candidates was an upstanding family man who was going to vote against all the things you most want Congress to do. And the other was an awful slimeball who you could count on to support all the things you believe in. Which way would you go?No fair answering \u201cto another state.\u201dLet\u2019s hope.Is it fair to compare Trump to Bill Clinton? People never had to listen to tapes of Clinton bragging about all the girls he\u2019d groped. And it really wasn\u2019t until the impeachment that his supporters were confronted with unavoidable evidence that he was the worst kind of sexual harasser. Yet even then, the public did not want him tossed out of office. In areas not involving wanton, repulsive adultery, he was doing a good job. The economy was up. Crime was down.So it\u2019s hard to expect that voters will reject Roy Moore for his extremely creepy sexual history. However, Moore is a special case since he\u2019s awful in so many different ways. It\u2019s not often you run into a modern Senate candidate \u2014 even a modern conservative Republican Senate candidate \u2014 who says that homosexuality should be illegal, that Muslims shouldn\u2019t be allowed in Congress and that the last great age in American history was the one when we had slavery. And really, if Alabama is prepared to overlook all that \u2014 wow Alabama, shame on you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In One New Jersey Town, Pending Tax Changes Create Anxiety", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThey\u2019re crippling us,\u201d said Walter Levine, who has lived in this New Jersey community since 1976.As Mr. Levine sees it, Livingston, a fairly affluent town with a population of about 30,000, could become even less affordable as residents face rising tax bills and falling home values. They could be left with less disposable income to spend in the local stores, setting off a \u201cdomino effect\u201d that could derail the town\u2019s economy.Livingston\u2019s Republican representative in Congress, Rodney Frelinghuysen, voted against the House version of the tax bill because, he said, of the \u201cvery negative impacts it would have on so many of my fellow New Jerseyans.\u201d\u201cNo one gets creamed more than New Jersey from this tax bill,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics. He said the state was particularly vulnerable because its homes are expensive, its property taxes are the highest in the nation and it also has a high state income tax.\u201cIt\u2019s going to put really severe fiscal pressure on local governments, and they\u2019re going to be between a rock and a hard place,\u201d Mr. Zandi said.The tax bills passed by the House and Senate would take away people\u2019s ability to deduct much of what they pay in state and local taxes from their income on federal tax returns. Those deductions would be limited to $10,000 in a combination of property taxes and other state and local taxes.Those changes loom like a dark cloud over Livingston, where the average homeowner pays more than $15,000 a year in local taxes and many pay a multiple of that sum.Mr. Levine estimated that his taxes would rise by $14,000 a year, just from the loss of deductions on the state and local taxes he pays. He said he anticipated more questions from his brothers about why he has not packed up and moved to Florida, as they did.Indeed, the most frequently cited example of a refugee from New Jersey\u2019s high taxes involves a former Livingston resident, David Tepper. Mr. Tepper, a wealthy hedge-fund manager, moved to Florida two years ago and took his business with him.Elected officials in Livingston, who pride themselves on the town\u2019s highly rated schools, broad array of services and ethnic diversity, worry that their town could lose some of its appeal. Rudy Fernandez, a council member and former mayor, said he feared that job-seekers would steer clear of Livingston and neighboring suburbs if they could not deduct the taxes they would pay to the state and local governments.Shawn Klein, an ophthalmologist who serves as mayor, said, \u201cWe\u2019re also worried about if there is a depression in the economy. How does that affect our local economy? Do we start having empty storefronts?\u201dCheryl Press, who runs a jewelry business with her husband, George, on South Livingston Avenue, said they had to \u201creinvent\u201d their business after the financial crisis of a decade ago to emphasize service and repairs because customers had less money to spend. \u201cWe had that conversation this weekend,\u201d Ms. Press said. \u201cAre we going to have to reinvent ourselves again?\u201dOn a recent weekday afternoon, one of the largest gatherings in Livingston was a group of about 100 people playing bridge in the V.F.W. hall. Many of them were from other towns, but they all seemed to share concerns about the tax bill making their lifestyles more precarious.Richard Bindelglass, a retired executive from the Martinsville section of Bridgewater, a town south of Livingston, estimated that his federal tax bill would rise by about $5,000, an increase that would spur him to consider selling his house and moving. He said the local school system had already cut some programs to save money, but he expected the schools-or-taxes tension to grow.\u201cI assume we\u2019re going to get some anti-tax candidates for the school board with a mandate to lower the total spend and lower the tax,\u201d he said.Sumner Freedman, 73, a resident of Short Hills, another well-off town near Livingston, said the property taxes in his town were \u201cridiculous\u201d and sharp cuts to the ability to deduct them would hurt the middle class in the region. He admitted that the $17,000 he pays in annual property tax indicated that his home was quite valuable. But, he added, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat your house.\u201dThe pending tax changes have been a prime topic of conversation this week among the diners at Eppes Essen, a Jewish delicatessen on one of Livingston\u2019s main thoroughfares, said its manager, Jeff Lajqi.Mr. Lajqi, a native of Kosovo, said some customers had called him conservative for saying that he did not mind paying taxes as long as the revenue was put to productive use. Then again, he admitted that he was among the minority of Livingston residents paying less than $10,000 in annual property taxes and could not relate to the concerns of some of his rich neighbors.\u201cIf they\u2019re raising the taxes, you know what\u2019s going to happen: Everyone\u2019s going to raise prices,\u201d Mr. Lajqi said. Picking up a loaf of challah bread, he added, \u201cRaise my taxes, I raise your challah.\u201dStill, some Livingston residents were more sanguine about the potential impact of the tax changes. Rajesh Agarwal, who commutes to Manhattan to work on Wall Street, took a financier\u2019s approach to the situation.\u201cProperty taxes always tended to be on the high side,\u201d in Livingston and surrounding towns, he said. The question for people like him and his wife, Anju, will be: \u201cHow much incrementally worse off are you willing to be?\u201d he said.With one child in middle school and one at Livingston High School, where nearly one-quarter of the student body is of Asian descent, Mr. Agarwal said his family was unlikely to decamp for a place with a lower cost of living. \u201cThe school district and the town and the quality of life will probably rule the day,\u201d he said.Punam Bhargava, a real estate agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices who said she had sold 180 homes in Livingston to Indian couples, including the Agarwals, was holding out hope that the proposed tax changes would not come to pass. She and her manager, Christian Quaritius, had just returned from an industry convention in Atlantic City where speculation of a price decline of as much as 10 percent was flying about.Ms. Bhargava said the Livingston market has been so strong, she had trouble imagining a significant drop in demand. She said her office had sold more than 400 homes this year at an average price of $723,000, with most of them on the market for no longer than a few weeks.\u201cThere are people that are just Livingston people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not moving no matter what.\u201dBut a precipitous spike in taxes could force some people\u2019s hand. \u201cI think there are homeowners that would sell,\u201d Mr. Quaritius said. \u201cBut then the question is, where would I go?Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misattributed a quote about reinventing a local jewelry business. As the article correctly notes, it was Cheryl Press who said it, not George Press.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keeping the Family Tree Alive", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhat keeps venerable old families together? They are, after all, only as strong as the roots that bind them.Most of us know our relatives back to our grandparents. Counting our own children, we might have to contend with four generations.But there are families who can trace their history back centuries. Sylvia Brown, for instance, is the 11th generation of the family whose name adorns Brown University. And Alessia Antinori is the 26th generation of the Italian winemaking family whose company bears her surname.For families like these, their strength often lies in their hereditary wealth, in its varied forms of businesses, partnerships and foundations. But the strategies they use to stay together can be adopted by any family, whether or not money is at stake.One thing prosperous families have in common is a sense of ownership of their wealth, through either a business or a foundation.\u201cOwning something seems to be the most important factor because you have a responsibility to it,\u201d said John A. Davis, chairman of the Cambridge Family Enterprise Group and a former Harvard Business School professor. \u201cYour responsibility to it influences what you get from it, both financially and in terms of pride.\u201dA family business is often both the repository and generator of a family\u2019s prosperity, which can make decisions about the business more difficult. \u201cI often ask my wealthy families: \u2018What would this decision be like if there wasn\u2019t any shared wealth? Would this be different if you were poor?\u2019\u201d said Jeff Savlov, founder of Blum & Savlov, a family wealth consultancy. \u201cA lot of what makes these families successful is family first.\u201dAnd that is where these families \u2014 even those linked by finances \u2014 need stories, context and shared memories to continue to prosper.\u201cWhat keeps these families motivated besides wealth is a sense of mission for the family,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cWhat is this family trying to do? The second part is, \u2018How can I contribute to the mission?\u2019\u201dAnother strategy shared by such families is having a communal desire to understand their history, warts and all.Ms. Brown said she had been motivated to delve into her family\u2019s past after hearing a lecture at Brown University that focused on her family\u2019s connection to slavery. She realized she could not rebut what seemed untrue to her because she did not know her family\u2019s history well enough.\u201cWe didn\u2019t sit around the table discussing our ancestors,\u201d she said. So she called her father and aunt to find out if what she had heard was true. \u201cTheir attitude was, there is very little we can do. Our ancestors were successful merchants in the 18th century when the Atlantic economy was dominated by slave-trading. They dabbled in it. But my direct ancestors were antislavery.\u201dIn addition to exploring her family history, she also hoped the book would draw her family, which has only eight direct descendants in her generation, closer together.The Antinori family, which traces its lineage back to the year 1000 and its entry into the wine business to 1385, is still linked by its vineyards and grand homes. It produces two of the country\u2019s best wines, Tignanello and Solaia, as well as a Chianti Classico.\u201cWhen you grow up surrounded by art, beauty, traditions, when you are little, you don\u2019t really feel the difference\u201d between a multigenerational family and a smaller one, said Ms. Antinori, who runs the family business with her two older sisters. \u201cSlowly, you come to understand the difference.\u201dHer connection to her family\u2019s business came from the work she, like her sisters, did with their father when they were young: marketing the wine and scouting for vineyards abroad. \u201cWe were never obligated to work in the business,\u201d she said.Family heritage is not always enough. People move away from their childhood homes and do not always return as adults. Communication becomes vital.Newsletters are an easy way for families to keep in touch. But they require someone to take the lead and appoint a successor.Mitzi Perdue, heiress to the Sheraton Hotel fortune and the last wife of the chicken magnate Frank Perdue, asks each family member to write an essay about what it means to be part of the family. They\u2019re collected and bound in a book.\u201cWe get to know everyone, and everyone has a different view of what it means to be us,\u201d Mrs. Perdue said.Philanthropy is often used to help knit a family together, particularly when the family business is gone.Ms. Brown\u2019s family has supported causes in Rhode Island for some 250 years. But that philanthropic tradition \u2014 and what some family members felt was mistreatment by the university that bears their name \u2014 has some descendants looking to make their mark elsewhere.Ms. Brown said only she and a cousin live in Providence; the six other descendants in her generation live farther away. When it comes to the family foundation, those relatives\u2019 interests are not as focused on the organizations the family has traditionally supported.Mr. Davis, the consultant, said that philanthropy was often the key to a successful family and a way for descendants to be reminded of the wealth they take for granted. \u201cPeople need to ask, What is the purpose of doing it?\u201d he said, and more broadly: \u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of our family?\u201dTo answer these big questions, there is little substitute for time spent together. Ms. Brown said her generation returns to Providence or Newport once a year, though not at the same time. They do have family meetings, but people often call in rather than appear in person.Mrs. Perdue said the Henderson side of her family, to which the Sheraton wealth accrued, has an annual vacation at a family home \u2014 complete with ballroom \u2014 in Dublin, N.H. Similarly, she said, Frank Perdue left an endowment for family vacations, and every 18 months, up to 60 Perdues travel somewhere together.The Antinoris have found a way to spend most weekends together on their land in Bolgheri, near the coast in Italy. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time together in the past,\u201d Ms. Antinori said. \u201cThe important thing is for the future generation to spend time with my father because he has the history and knowledge.\u201dThat time together helps make the family stronger. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on a few things, but the important thing is, we share the same values \u2014 respect, passion, the concept that you want the business to stay in the family,\u201d Ms. Antinori said.No matter how well siblings and cousins get along, families are not closed systems. Spouses bring with them another family\u2019s traditions.Finding a way to welcome them can be tricky. Mr. Savlov said the blending of families must be handled delicately so that it did not seem like spouses were leaving their old families behind. The receiving family also must be mindful that a new member may not want to be part of everything all at once.Mrs. Perdue said that she interviewed people who married into the Henderson family about their lives and wrote biographies about them for other family members to read. The new spouses are given the essays on what it means to be a Henderson.\u201cIf you jump into a large family and you meet 60 people, that\u2019s going to be intimidating and overwhelming,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve seen their pictures and know their interests ahead of time, that makes it easier.\u201dThat transparency can help families look honestly at their past and move forward together.As Ms. Brown said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the 11th generation and the family keeps meticulous records, there are going to be skeletons in your closet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Uber Car Creates Congestion. Should You Pay a Fee to Ride?", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sputtering traffic in Manhattan has long been blamed on cars and delivery trucks pouring onto the streets from the rest of the city and beyond.Since at least the 1970s, New York City officials have proposed various toll systems to deter drivers from coming over bridges or piling into the busiest neighborhoods.\u201cYou\u2019ll see an entire row of Lyft, Uber and Juno drivers on the streets waiting to pick people up,\u201d said Chanse Gierbolini, 27, a baker in Lower Manhattan. \u201cIt seems like everybody\u2019s driving the same black sedan \u2014 they\u2019re everywhere.\u201dAbout 103,000 for-hire vehicles operate in the city, more than double the roughly 47,000 in 2013, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Of those, 68,000 are affiliated with ride-hailing app companies, including 65,000 with Uber alone, though they may also provide rides for others. In contrast, yellow taxis are capped by city law at just under 13,600.The ride-hailing cars average 11 minutes of unoccupied time \u2014 compared with eight minutes for yellow taxis \u2014 in between dropping off one passenger and picking up another, according to the report.\u201cThe governor has been clear we need to reduce gridlock, cut emissions and fund mass transit,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Ajemian, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, \u201cwhich is why he empaneled Fix NYC to explore all options.\u201dIn Chicago, where Mayor Rahm Emanuel contends the ride-hailing services have cost his city millions in lost taxes and fees, the city introduced a 20-cent-per-ride fee in 2014 and raised that to 50 cents the following year. The fee will rise to 65 cents next year, and then to 70 cents in 2019 \u2014 with the additional increases dedicated solely to modernizing the transit system, city officials said.In the meantime, there is no escape from gridlocked streets. Jennifer Brown, 46, an architect, was recently trapped in a cab on Fifth Avenue near 72nd Street en route to an appointment. After going two blocks in 20 minutes, she finally jumped out to walk to a subway station. \u201cI was late, so it was anxiety inducing,\u201d she said.Alexis Licairac, 47, a law firm clerk in Lower Manhattan, said it takes him about two hours to get to work by bus from his home in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see how bad the congestion is in the city, I think if there\u2019s a disaster, we\u2019d never get out.\u201dSam Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who is on the state task force, said that a new ride fee could compel some passengers to seek cheaper alternatives, including subways and buses. He said that growing car congestion has hurt the city economy at all levels, from making it harder to get to work to increasing delivery costs for stores and restaurants.Alix Anfang, an Uber spokeswoman, said simply adding a fee would not address an already unfair fee system in which Uber riders pay more in sales tax than taxi riders pay with the 50-cent M.T.A. fee. The minimum fare for an individual Uber ride in New York City is $8, which amounts to a sales tax of 71 cents. She said the system is especially a burden on riders outside Manhattan, who have fewer subway and bus options.This week, Uber started a campaign calling for a comprehensive approach to congestion pricing, which could include a per-ride fee in Manhattan among other measures.\u201cThe existing ride-hailing tax unfairly burdens outer borough New Yorkers who pay far more in taxes per trip than Manhattan taxi riders,\u201d Ms. Anfang said, \u201cwhich is why Uber believes a new transit tax system should fully fund mass transit by setting fees based on how crowded the roads are, not the type of vehicle people are traveling in.\u201dCampbell Matthews, a Lyft spokeswoman, said the company has focused on increasing occupancy in cars on the road and reducing individual car ownership. \u201cWe are supportive of holistic efforts to address congestion in New York to ensure that all transit options available to New Yorkers are convenient and affordable,\u201d she said.Drivers for ride-hailing services and cabs said they would oppose a new ride fee, arguing that they, too, are hurt by congestion and that such a fee would unfairly single them out when there were other causes, such as construction, garbage pickups and truck deliveries.Mohammed Zzaman, who drives for Uber, Lyft and Juno, said he made fewer pickups and less money during his \u201chell month\u201d in December, when holiday crowds descend on the city and it takes twice as long to cross Midtown.George Vountouvas, 60, an Uber driver, said he started at 4:30 a.m. because \u201cthere\u2019s no congestion, no traffic at that time.\u201dNino Hervias, a taxi owner and spokesman for the Taxi Medallion Owner Driver Association, said the hefty prices for taxi medallions should already include access to Manhattan streets, though he supported a new fee for ride-hailing cars.Mr. Schaller has called for reducing the unoccupied time for ride-hailing cars and yellow taxis in addition to other efforts to reduce congestion, such as a new ride fee or toll system. He noted that Uber already uses technology at the airports to \u201crematch\u201d cars dropping off passengers with new pickups to reduce congestion \u2014 a practice that could be expanded to city streets.Many riders said something had to be done about congestion, but were wary of another fee. \u201cWe already pay taxes \u2014 what more do they want from us?\u201d said Evelyn Jimenez, 38, a dental assistant who already spends at least $15 a day on Uber.But Mr. Gierbolini, the baker, said that he would be willing to pay a little more since he still depends on the subway to get to work. He spends $25 a week on Lyft, but only when he is not under pressure to be someplace on time.\u201cThere\u2019s almost no reliable way to get anywhere on time other than walking,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acting Studios Are Struggling. Does It Matter?", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "Schools that trained actors like Robert De Niro and Jessica Lange are facing rising costs, competition from colleges, and shifting cultural attitudes.Supported byThe three friends would all go on to win Academy Awards, helping to establish the classic blueprint for pursuing an acting career in New York: Move here, hone your craft at a gritty acting studio, do a handful of plays, conquer Hollywood.Things have changed since the heyday of theater-trained movie stars and the independent acting schools that shaped them. Many small studios, threatened by rising rents, decrepit buildings, well-funded university programs, and instant internet stardom, are now struggling.Just ask Mary Boyer, who moved to the city from the Midwest in 1973 to pursue an acting career. She eventually became a teacher and a director, opening her own school in 2003. But by 2008, Boyer\u2019s 150 students had dwindled to about 50.\u201cThe economy changed,\u201d Ms. Boyer said, \u201cand what actors and audiences wanted sort of changed all at the same time.\u201d She noticed more students expecting \u201cinstant gratification.\u201d Her \u201ccraft of acting\u201d courses, what she felt most passionate about, were not filling up. Auditioning classes became her new staple.\u201cI just could not keep doing it,\u201d Ms. Boyer said. The lease for her school was up for renewal, and she had realized two things: her rent would continue to increase, and the only way to survive would be to teach more audition classes. \u201cMy creative soul was crumbling,\u201d she said.A symbolic example of the neighborhood\u2019s changing priorities is the fact that the tech giant Google, now the Atlantic\u2019s landlord, has plans to raise the school\u2019s rent to market rate next year when the school\u2019s 12-year lease expires.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved around Chelsea all this time, and it\u2019s just heartbreaking for the school to have to leave the neighborhood,\u201d said Mary McCann, the Atlantic\u2019s executive director.A successful alumni network will no doubt help the Playhouse face the daunting task of maintaining the 1920s-era property it owns.\u201cIt\u2019s like driving a 1947 Chevy,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman of the Playhouse, which has been on East 54th Street since Irene and Alice Lewisohn, its founders, bought the two adjacent buildings in Midtown in 1947. The Playhouse has five floors, including a light-filled dance studio designed by Martha Graham, as well as a 99-seat theater.\u201cWe are all afraid of the roof caving in,\u201d said Ms. Moller Kareman, who had to pay $20,000 to fix the building\u2019s out-of-commission elevator when she was first hired. \u201cThe elevator guys said we don\u2019t even have parts for this anymore,\u201d she recalled.\u201cWhen Herbert Berghof died in \u201990, I think it was still $5 a class,\u201d said Edith Meeks, HB\u2019s current artistic and executive director. But even by 2004, when Ms. Hagen died, HB had only marginally increased tuition. Modest, incremental fee hikes were just not \u201cenough to catch us up to the real expense of running a nonprofit and managing three buildings in the 21st century,\u201d said Ms. Meeks.So in 2013, for the first time in its history, HB streamlined its curriculum and significantly raised its bargain-basement prices as part of a \u201cone-time adjustment-to-market,\u201d said Ms. Meeks, who confirmed that enrollment is stable but nowhere near the numbers it had in the 1960s. \u201cWe were super affordable, and now we are affordable.\u201dThe change was made with a heavy heart, said Ms. Meeks, who admitted that young actors are affected by New York\u2019s real estate and job market just as much as the institutions training them. \u201cThey commute from farther and farther away to study with us at HB; many of them have crushing college debt and they struggle to stay employed and to have enough flexibility to continue their creative work,\u201d she said.For acting schools that pay rent, the situation is even more tenuous.The Atlantic Acting School moved into the Chelsea neighborhood 26 years ago, when \u201cno one wanted to be there\u201d and \u201crent was cheap,\u201d said Ms. McCann. With a pedigree that includes the playwright David Mamet and the actor/director William H. Macy \u2014 not to mention a thriving children\u2019s program, a connection to a professional theater with 12 Tony Awards, and even a coveted affiliation with N.Y.U. \u2014 it would seem that the school would have a rosy outlook.\u201cWe can\u2019t afford market rate,\u201d said Ms. McCann, the school\u2019s executive director.So, over the last two years, Mr. Lawson and his team have been looking for an affordable space, but the specifics for what the school needs \u2014 at least 20,000 square feet of office and open studio space at an affordable price \u2014 have proved to be a daunting challenge.And yet the Atlantic hopes to have a deal in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen area, according to Mr. Lawson, who reported that his team is currently considering two options. The rent, he said, will be difficult but doable, something between what the Atlantic is currently paying and \u201cChelsea market rate.\u201d Google, meanwhile, has offered the Atlantic a new lease for its theater, housed in the basement of 111 8th Avenue, for reduced rent.The T. Schreiber Studio, also in Chelsea, has survived by keeping its classrooms and administrative areas but letting go of its theater.In the mid-90s, Schreiber was riding high on the success of at least two former students, Edward Norton and Peter Sarsgaard. Around the same time, the school was offered the opportunity to buy its East 4th Street building, which was located across the street from the experimental theater La MaMa, next door to New York Theater Workshop, and included a theater space, offices, dressing rooms and a downstairs class area, for $90,000. But the money simply wasn\u2019t there, said Sally Dunn, its managing director.Instead, the now-49-year-old acting school moved to Chelsea right when it was becoming hot, said Peter Jensen, its artistic director. \u201cYou could just see all the hotels going up,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, student interest in the traditional scene-study class \u2014 what Mr. Norton and Mr. Sarsgaard cut their teeth on at Schreiber \u2014 was leaning more toward on-camera, commercial and casting classes, said Mr. Jensen. The whole nature of pursuing acting in New York was evolving, while the costs of teaching the trade were rising.But that might not be as easy or as affordable as hoped. Over the last decade, the city has also lost approximately 50 small performance venues, and according to Ms. Dunch, the arts fundraising expert, this \u201cspace crunch\u201d affects the entire nonprofit theater industry, including acting studios.Main stage productions at Barrow are happening again, some to critical acclaim. That said, the school\u2019s revenue is beginning to plateau and there\u2019s no more space for expansion. The annual rent is around $300,000, with 3.5 percent increases each year, and the booming Hudson Yards development nearby threatens to raise market rates even more. \u201cWith the rising cost of everything, it\u2019s scary,\u201d said Mr. Serrell. \u201cWe\u2019re a $2.1 million company; we\u2019re still scratching our heads. It\u2019s terrifically challenging, but we\u2019re determined to figure it out.\u201dPerhaps the answer is to leave Manhattan. The Atlantic looked in Brooklyn, but \u201cit\u2019s not any less expensive,\u201d said Ms. McCann. Even the actor and Renaissance man James Franco, who in 2014 opened a branch of his acting and film school, Studio4, in Fort Greene, couldn\u2019t work his magic: the studio announced it was closing on Oct. 1.\u201cI knew I wanted to be in Brooklyn \u2014 three-fourths of my students live here,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, who opened his school in 2015.\u201cI had this restless itch to make something of my own,\u201d said Mr. Knickerbocker, a high-profile acting coach whose clients include Sam Rockwell and Emmy Rossum. \u201cI have that corny thing from \u2018Field of Dreams,\u2019 if you build it, they will come.\u201dSo far, they have come. After taking out a home equity line of credit and some money from his retirement account (\u201ccompletely against the advice of my lawyers and accountants\u201d), he has about 100 students. Mr. Knickerbocker \u201cwanted to have a studio that would be an affordable alternative to an M.F.A. program,\u201d he said. The two-year conservatory, with an optional third year, costs about $8,000 annually.Although students are treated to regular Facebook Live events with movie stars and solo performance workshops, the focus remains on traditional stagecraft and acting technique. And the students are into it.

Schreiber Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. But the Knickerbocker showcase does not take place on a stage. In a sign of the times, it is virtual. \u201cWe write and produce three- to four-minute films with these people, and put them online for casting directors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe write it to their sweet spots, shoot it with two cameras, edit it and score it.\u201dMeanwhile, in Toledo, Ms. Boyer is embracing, somewhat, the changing tides of the acting school business.

Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future.

{"Headline": "Recovering What Was Lost in the U.S. Virgin Islands, One Boat at a Time", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "Back-to-back hurricanes destroyed hundreds of boats that were people\u2019s livelihoods and even homes.Supported byThe wrecks lie half-sunk in marinas, fully submerged in coves, tangled in mangrove roots, tossed akilter against trees, or piled atop one another, a jumble of punctured hulls, snapped masts and bent propellers.In a territory that is heavily dependent on tourism, where no spot is more than three miles from the sea, boats are as integral to the economy as the islands\u2019 beaches and their now-battered hotels. Boats are the livelihoods and even the homes of many locals, and for the mainlanders who leave their vessels there year-round, they are a big reason to spend time and money on the islands.He and his partner, Ashley Coerdt, had insurance on the boat, and they want to use the money to buy another one, \u201cbut it would not be a good business move right now,\u201d Mr. Cofield said. \u201cThe timing depends on how fast St. John bounces back, how fast the tourists come back, and nobody knows the answers yet.\u201dThree months after the Category 5 Hurricanes Irma and Maria ravaged the islands, about half of the customers remain without electricity, and about one-quarter of the territory still lacks cellphone service. Thousands of homes and other buildings were damaged or destroyed; the total number is unknown, but the Army Corps of Engineers has installed 3,600 temporary blue plastic roofs, and 11,000 families have applied for disaster assistance.Among the many arduous tasks that remain in their early stages are identifying the owners of lost boats, recovering the vessels, salvaging those that can be fixed and disposing of the rest.The Coast Guard has identified 459 boats in the United States Virgin Islands, population 106,000, that were left derelict by the storms \u2014 more than in nearby Puerto Rico, which has more than 30 times as many residents.That figure understates the true number of wrecks. The Army Corps of Engineers removed some early on because they posed a threat to navigation, and the Coast Guard is still finding more boats.In Benner Bay on St. Thomas and Coral Harbor on St. John, as many as 50 boats in each location lie thrown together. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s under there,\u201d said Cmdr. David J. Reinhard, the Coast Guard officer directing the salvage operation.\u201cIt\u2019s very likely we\u2019re going to find many more,\u201d he said.Commercial vessels like Survivan were required to have insurance, but most of the boats owned for personal use were uninsured.\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford the insurance, and neither could just about anyone I know,\u201d said Philip Faulkenberry, 57, who lived alone on his 41-foot ketch rig sailboat, Nugget 2. Hurricane Maria ripped it from its moorings at Christiansted, on St. Croix, and deposited it on a beach, leaning against the roots of an upturned tree. After the storm, he said, people stripped it of anything of value.The day before the hurricane hit, he flew to Louisiana, where he grew up, for temporary work in an oil refinery. Three days later, the company that had hired him sent him back to the Virgin Islands to work on a damaged refinery there.\u201cWhen I got off the plane, I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 it looked like Hiroshima or Nagasaki,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a leaf on a tree, not a blade of grass.\u201dThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, denied his claim for housing assistance, he said, because the storm took the paperwork he had that showed that the boat was his home. So for months, he has slept on an air mattress in a back room of the scooter store and bar he owns.He said his business, which was also looted, had only liability insurance, so he was not covered for damage or lost inventory. Like many people in the territory, he thinks about closing up shop and relocating to the mainland.\u201cI think I\u2019ll go work at least a few months in the States to build up some cash,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to come back and I want to come back, but honestly, I can\u2019t see how I can get back to where I was financially.\u201d\u201cWe raise them, clean them, take all the potential hazards off, and return them to their owners when we can,\u201d said Chief David Mosley, a spokesman for the Coast Guard operation. \u201cThey range from being in pretty good condition to total losses.\u201dAbout 100 people have been engaged in the effort, Commander Reinhard said, and it has been slow going. Fewer than one-third of the boats have been recovered so far \u2014 primarily by the Coast Guard, but also by boat owners and their insurers \u2014 and many of the recovered boats were damaged so badly that the owners declined to take them back.One of the first and most difficult jobs has been finding those owners. The Coast Guard has located only about 60 percent of them despite extensive public outreach, including through ads on radio, television and websites, and simply having personnel walk through marinas, talking with people.Some owners have been reluctant to step forward because they expect to be charged for the salvage, or because they are unsure what to do with their property once they get it back. Others live on the mainland or in other countries.Private contractors do most of the recovery of damaged or sunken boats, using barges with cranes, and scuba divers who attach pontoons and inflatable airbags to wrecks. Vessels that sank or were grounded in environmentally sensitive areas are handled with particular care.The work is expected to take many months. The limited number of qualified contractors are stretched thin, with thousands of storm-tossed boats needing to be recovered along the coasts of Florida, Texas and numerous Caribbean islands.Another big challenge looms in the distance: The Department of Planning and Natural Resources has to decide what to do with unclaimed boats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Expanded From Silicon Valley to Bubblegum Alley", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetSAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. \u2014 San Luis Obispo has a reputation for being a sleepy town in central California known for its laid-back charm. Top tourist draws are a nearby 18th-century Spanish mission and Bubblegum Alley, a walkway lined with chewed gum. But Rick Stollmeyer, the chief executive of MindBody, envisioned it as a bustling tech hub.Nestled along the coast about 230 miles south of San Francisco, San Luis Obispo is far from Silicon Valley. The distance presented a challenge for Mr. Stollmeyer, who sought to lure talent to a small college town known by the acronym SLO, where nature buffs and health food junkies go to find their nirvana.Today, the tech community is growing, Mr. Stollmeyer said: \u201cIt is hopping. I\u2019ve seen a dozen tech start-ups launch in the past year.\u201dVenture capitalists are also chiming in. \u201cMindBody has proven that a billion-dollar company can grow up in SLO, and that is a massive milestone,\u201d said Stephen Beck, managing partner at Serra Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. \u201cThe tech scene has become authentic, dynamic and real enough to pay attention to.\u201d He is so convinced, he has invested in WhiteFox Defense Technologies, a local start-up selling devices that mitigate drone threats.To date, more than 7,800 tech employees work in San Luis Obispo County, an increase of more than 20 percent in the last five years, according to the California Center for Jobs and the Economy.At the crux of this growth is a rebounding economy and a pool of engineering and computer science students from California Polytechnic State University. Added to that is a network of support from government, education and community agencies that provide access to real estate, funding and business connections to encourage fledgling enterprises.And not only are new companies sprouting up, but renowned high-tech firms are moving in. Amazon leases two spaces downtown, and in October, Amazon Web Services announced a strategic partnership with Cal Poly. Called the Digital Transformation Hub, the organization will be staffed with employees from both entities to help solve \u201cpublic-sector business challenges,\u201d said Amy Schwartz, a university spokeswoman.GE Digital is moving into offices at the Cal Poly Technology Park. Erected on the former campus softball field, the tech park will be expanded to include four more facilities over 10 years, said Jim Dunning, the director of economic development and technology transfer at Cal Poly.The SLO HotHouse brings together the center\u2019s students and entrepreneurs, who rent shared work space. HotHouse inhabitants have access to mentors, venture capitalists and sources to help with prototypes. In the center\u2019s 13-week accelerator program, each student business gets $10,000 in seed money.Since the center\u2019s inception in 2010, Cal Poly students and graduates have started 75 companies and generated more than $150 million in venture capital funding, said Tod Nelson, the center\u2019s executive director.The SLO HotHouse has proved so energizing that when a building across the street that was once home to a bread bakery was up for lease, the university jumped at the chance to transform it into the Cal Poly Lofts, 32 apartments rented exclusively to the center\u2019s students. The apartment building opened last year, allowing residents to connect, brainstorm and participate in one another\u2019s companies. One student hired a fellow resident who was an accounting major to do the books for his start-up, said the Cal Poly media relations director, Matt Lazier.Start-ups in the city are typically clustered downtown or near the regional airport, where MindBody has its headquarters. It operates four eco-friendly buildings, including fitness facilities with yoga classes and a health-conscious cafeteria selling items like acai bowls.The growth in the number of new firms in San Luis Obispo means that office space is becoming harder to find. Derek Senn, a broker at Anderson Commercial Real Estate Services, said it was possible for a start-up to find office space of up to 3,500 square feet.\u201cBeyond that, it\u2019s challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cInventory for larger spaces is low, and it\u2019s not easy to build something right away since not much land is available for development.\u201dThe firm offers over 31,000 online guides on how to fix everything from broken iPhone screens to torn jeans. Luke Soules, a founder and a Cal Poly graduate, said the company is a 10-minute bicycle ride from campus.\u201cWe have a lot of employees tired of the Silicon Valley pace and come to raise a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest contention we have is not having enough bike parking spaces.\u201dSeveral recent decisions by the city should help offset the shortage. For instance, it has approved more than 2,000 new homes and housing units over the next 10 years, Mayor Heidi Harmon said.But residents have already started to grumble about the newcomers encroaching on their quiet town.And Gary Dwyer, a former Cal Poly professor who taught urban design for more than 30 years, said the tech workers were using San Luis Obispo as a playground to surf and ride mountain bikes.\u201cThe techies are building and buying secondary homes they can use as time shares,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are already here, and more are on the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homeowners Have Had It Good. Too Good, Says the Tax Bill.", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the tax code has been filled with rewards for homeownership. Tax breaks encourage people to get into first homes and to trade up as they get older, building a national mind-set that you\u2019re never quite middle class until you\u2019ve qualified for a mortgage.It amounts to a vast social engineering project that assumes society is better off with owners instead of renters. But the tax bill making its way toward final passage is upending that premise.The bill will increase many homeowners\u2019 monthly housing costs by scaling back deductions that allow them to reduce mortgage interest and property taxes. And by roughly doubling the standard deduction, it reduces the incentive to buy homes by making far fewer homeowners eligible for preferential tax treatment.The Republican plan, in short, is tinkering with subsidies so entrenched in the social fabric that they have become entitlements in all but name.\u201cIt suggests a limit in the federal government\u2019s willingness to subsidize ownership,\u201d said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard. \u201cIt\u2019s also a reflection of just how expensive housing has become, and how it feels problematic to be using the tax code to support people buying houses that are this expensive or, even worse, to be encouraging housing prices to rise further.\u201dBoth parties have long championed homeownership as a way to help people build wealth and keep neighborhoods more stable. But economists like Mr. Glaeser have been critical of the resulting subsidies.In their view, the government has made homeownership and its financing artificially cheap through the tax code and mortgage backers like Fannie Mae. As a result, people are encouraged to take on more debt than they might otherwise \u2014 to buy bigger homes and second homes, and to plow the equity they accrue into renovations and personal spending.This distorts the economy in a number of ways. For starters, it\u2019s unfair: Since the benefits of these deductions get bigger with larger and more expensive homes, the bulk of the benefits accrue to wealthier homeowners in pricier markets. This alters the landscape by encouraging more single-family homes and suburban sprawl. That, in turn, prompts the government to spend more on roads and infrastructure and makes housing a bigger portion of the economy than it would be in the absence of federal help.Construction, though, is one of the least productive industries. By funneling more of the national debt and savings into construction, the government is hindering sectors, like education and manufacturing, that have a bigger economic payoff.Edward J. Pinto, co-director of the conservative American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Center for Housing Markets and Finance, has described the interest deduction and other homeowner subsidies as a wasteful giveaway that inflates home prices and encourages people to borrow excessively.\u201cMy basic view is if you subsidize something you\u2019ll get more of it, and as a country we\u2019ve been subsidizing debt,\u201d he said.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.Jeff Neubauer is already thinking more conservatively. Mr. Neubauer, 34, who helps manage his family\u2019s electrical contracting business and lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., is looking to trade up from his two-bedroom condominium to a larger home in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range. Now, he is worried that the cost of ownership will be much higher and will rather play it safe until the effects of the bill are clearer.\u201cIt makes me want to not spend as much money,\u201d he said.The size of the deduction made it a tempting target for Republicans. To stay within legislative boundaries, the Republicans need to limit the budget consequences of tax cuts largely benefiting corporations and the wealthy. Reducing housing deductions \u2014 benefits that disproportionately flow to homeowners in wealthier Democratic cities \u2014 helps recover some revenues while concentrating the impact on relatively few people, most of whom are unlikely to vote for Republicans.\u201cThe final tax reform bill released punishes homeowners and weakens homeownership,\u201d the California Association of Realtors said in a statement issued on Friday, \u201cand in fact, it looks at homeowners and the housing market as nothing more than a piggy bank.\u201dEarlier versions of the bill prompted real estate agents in Bakersfield, Calif., to protest and chant \u201cSave Homeownership\u201d in front of the local office of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. And the provisions affecting homeownership were among the few main sticking points among House Republicans, particularly those from Mr. McCarthy\u2019s state.It is, of course, hard to gauge the long-term ramifications of a tax bill that is flying through Congress in hopes of allowing Republicans and the Trump administration to claim a major legislative victory.That uncertainty is leading to major confusion for home shoppers like Morgan Molnar. Ms. Molnar, a 29-year-old who works in product marketing, lives in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale and is looking for a home costing $1 million to $1.2 million. She and her husband have been approved for a mortgage and were ready to make offers, but are now feeling hesitant.Better to push forward because the Bay Area\u2019s already-low inventory is going to shrink? Or will reduced tax deductions lower prices by reducing the number of people who can afford homes?\u201cYou\u2019re leaning forward but afraid to make that leap because of the situation,\u201d she said.One thing that seems certain is that the lack of inventory already plaguing the housing market will get worse. By allowing homeowners already benefiting from the existing mortgage interest deduction cap to keep it, the bill is likely to encourage people to stay in place a bit longer.The plan could also affect consumer spending. Over the past two decades, homeowners have become accustomed to using steadily rising home prices to periodically refinance their mortgages so that they can take money out of their homes and spend it on everything from renovations to college tuition and vacations.These \u201ccash-out refinancings\u201d were widely abused before the housing crisis \u2014 the proverbial \u201cpeople using their homes as A.T.M.s.\u201d It has been less of a problem since the crisis. Today, some 42 million homeowners have about $5.35 trillion in home equity that they could hypothetically tap into, according to Black Knight, a software and data provider to the mortgage industry. This assumes they don\u2019t borrow more than 80 percent of the value of their home.Whatever happens, it has led to a chaotic end of the year for real estate agents. Kalena Masching, a Silicon Valley agent for Redfin, a real estate brokerage based in Seattle, has one group of clients trying to push sales through before any tax changes take effect. Another group is holding off to see how the loss of homeowner deductions ends up changing the math of buying a home.\u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming sense of people being upset and a lot of uncertainty, and mostly feeling like it\u2019s not a good thing,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It came a day after the witness, Reza Zarrab, testified in Federal District Court that he was told in 2012 by a Turkish official that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, ordered two Turkish banks to participate in a billion-dollar sanctions-busting scheme.Mr. Zarrab, 34, entered a secret guilty plea in October to conspiring to evade the sanctions and other charges, and, in a bid to reduce his punishment, agreed to assist prosecutors. Mr. Zarrab, whose plea agreement was reported this week in court, testified on Wednesday that \u201ccooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once.\u201dA newly unsealed transcript of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s plea hearing shows that when he appeared before Judge Richard M. Berman on Oct. 26, he gave a detailed admission of his crimes, saying that from 2010 until his arrest in 2016, he conspired with others to obstruct the Treasury Department\u2019s enforcement of the Iran sanctions.He also admitted that while being jailed in Manhattan, he bribed a correctional officer in return for alcohol and the use of a cellphone. He ultimately pleaded guilty to seven charges.As part of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s plea deal, the transcript shows, the government agreed to take steps to ensure his safety and that of \u201chis family and loved ones,\u201d including potential placement in the witness protection program.The case involving Mr. Zarrab and the Turkish bank executive on trial, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, and seven other defendants who remain at large, has raised tensions between Turkey and the United States. Turkish officials have said the case is based on fabricated evidence and is a politically motivated plot to undermine the country\u2019s economy and its leader, Mr. Erdogan, who is now president.In a speech in Istanbul, Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, on Friday called for Mr. Zarrab to reverse his decision to cooperate with the American authorities.\u201cGod willing, he will turn back from this mistake,\u201d Mr. Yildirim said.Turkish state and pro-government media outlets have not reported on key developments in the trial, including Mr. Zarrab\u2019s testimony this week implicating Mr. Erdogan and his account of paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Zafer Caglayan when he was the country\u2019s economy minister, as part of the scheme. Mr. Caglayan has also been charged in the case and is one of the defendants not in custody.The Turkish state news agency, however, was the first to report on Friday\u2019s court order to confiscate all of the assets of Mr. Zarrab and his family, including his wife, Ebru Gundes, a famous Turkish pop singer.Asked about the Turkish order to seize Mr. Zarrab\u2019s assets, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said, \u201cIt would be inappropriate to comment until after the trial of Mr. Atilla is completed.\u201d Prosecutors had no comment.Mr. Zarrab testified in court for a third day on Friday, offering more details about the oil-for-gold scheme. He also described how the conspirators disguised some of their transfers of Iranian oil proceeds as food sales.\u201cWere you actively sending food?\u201d a prosecutor, Sidhardha Kamaraju, asked Mr. Zarrab.\u201cYou mean physically, food?\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo, I never sent food, physically,\u201d Mr. Zarrab said.Follow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter: @BenWeiserNYTAdvertisement"}

The $2 coin, which Canadians call a \u201ctoonie,\u201d features a lake scene with a sky that glows blue-green, in honor of the aurora borealis.11. A cancer drug breakthroughFor the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug to treat any tumor sharing certain genetic characteristics \u2014 regardless of cancer type. For years, doctors focused on treating cancer cells depending on where they were in the body. Pembrolizumab (known by its brand name Keytruda) is an immunotherapy drug that blocks the cancer cell\u2019s ability to protect itself from the body\u2019s immune system.12. Pinpointing baby dinosaur\u2019s parentageFor the first time, paleontologists have determined the species of one of the largest known dinosaur eggs, found in central China nearly 25 years ago. According to scientists, the fossilized embryo is a giant oviraptorosaur, a large feathered dinosaur that weighed up to one ton and had sharp claws and a toothless beak.13. India\u2019s latest launch has the world watchingIndia\u2019s space agency set a new world record when it launched 104 satellites from a single rocket in February, overtaking Russia\u2019s previous record of 34. It is no secret that the country has made space exploration and commerce a priority, and this latest launch makes it a serious contender in the private space-travel market.14. Nepal holds local electionsFor the first time in two decades, millions of Nepalese voted in local elections, seen as a promising if precarious step as the country slowly transitions to a full-fledged democracy. Nepal has been plagued with years of political instability and virtually no local governance following a 10-year civil war that ended in 2006 and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.15. Beware the \u2018borgs?For the first time, companies are equipping their employees with technology inside their bodies. Epicenter, a company in Sweden, has given its workers the option to have radio frequency identification, or R.F.I.D., technology implanted in their hands. A U.S. company, Three Square Market, has followed suit, giving its employees the option to be \u201cchipped,\u201d which would allow them to open doors and log in to their computers, among other abilities. Critics, however, expressed privacy concerns.16.

A major edit for anatomy booksScientists have discovered a new organ in the human body. Called the mesentery, it was first thought to be a fragmented part of the digestive system. Researchers in Ireland, however, have proved that it is one organ \u2014 a set of tissues that line the abdominal cavity.Coming Up:Women to take the wheel in Saudi ArabiaA royal decree has lifted the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia. The decision, which will allow more women to work and ease the financial and logistical burden of having to hire a driver, is in line with the new crown prince\u2019s plan to stimulate the country\u2019s stagnant economy.

Last year, her year-end news conference was held at the presidential building in Taipei, the capital.The military-themed setting for this year\u2019s news conference, attended by domestic and foreign journalists, was meant to underline Taiwan\u2019s commitment to defending itself, she said.China, however, has not given up its claim to Taiwan. Beijing has threatened to attack if Taiwan declares formal independence, or if it decides that peaceful annexation options have disappeared.On Friday, Ms. Tsai reiterated her pledge to increase Taiwan\u2019s military spending and military development capabilities in the face of the threat from Beijing. She also said at the news conference that where necessary, and possible, Taiwan would seek military cooperation with other countries.In recent years, the United States has been alone in its willingness to sell military hardware to Taiwan in the face of Chinese pressure. This summer, President Trump approved a relatively small $1.4 billion arms package to Taiwan.China cut off official communication channels with the Tsai administration last year after she declined to accede to Beijing\u2019s demand that she accept the so-called 1992 Consensus, which posits that mainland China and Taiwan are part of \u201cone China.\u201dSince then, Beijing has ratcheted up diplomatic pressure by poaching Taiwan\u2019s few remaining diplomatic partners and blocking its observer status in international organizations, especially those under the United Nations. Taiwan, which has world\u2019s 22nd-largest economy and a population nearly as large as Australia\u2019s, is not a member of the United Nations.China has not hidden its displeasure. Speaking at a Chinese Embassy event in Washington this month, Li Kexin, an embassy minister, said he had told American officials that if United States Navy vessels visited Taiwan\u2019s southern port in Kaohsiung, China would attack the island with the aim of unification.Ms. Tsai said on Friday that she welcomed Taiwan-friendly legislation, but emphasized that Taiwan must rely on itself for defense. This month, the Ministry of National Defense published a report in which it noted that it is focusing on strengthening its asymmetric warfare capabilities while expanding the area in which it considers Chinese invasion to be possible.As chairwoman of the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, Ms. Tsai has shelved that stance in favor of maintaining the status quo. She said Friday that her administration would seek to maintain regional peace and stability, while also working to improve Taiwan\u2019s domestic and international circumstances for future generations.\u201cWe want to enable the next generation of Taiwanese to live in a different country,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meeting a Town\u2019s Beloved Resident, Months After Telling His Immigration Story", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe DailyWEST FRANKFORT, Ill. \u2014 The first time I came to this small Southern Illinois city, in February, the person I was here to write about \u2014 Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco \u2014 was nowhere to be found. He was locked up in a Missouri detention facility.Mr. Hernandez had been arrested for being undocumented, amid a national conversation over President Trump\u2019s promises to crack down on illegal immigration.In letters to the immigration court that could decide whether he will be deported, influential residents raved about Mr. Hernandez, someone most people in this mostly white coal-mining crossroads had not realized had been living here without papers for about 20 years.West Frankfort\u2019s mayor, Tom Jordan, called him a \u201cgreat asset\u201d to the city who \u201cdoesn\u2019t ask for anything in return.\u201d The fire chief described him as \u201ca man of great character.\u201d The recommendation that may have stuck with me most came from a resident who confided that he really did not like having many people in his life at all but Mr. Hernandez was the rare exception, someone who was welcome at his home for dinner.This month, I returned to West Frankfort. I wanted to know what community leaders like Mayor Jordan were thinking now. And I wanted to meet Mr. Hernandez after hearing all those stories \u2014 about how he always asked after peoples\u2019 family members by their names at the Mexican restaurant he managed; how he donated scholarships to the local high school; how he hosted fund-raisers to support local police officers.He was grateful and humbled when he emerged from several weeks in detention to find out about the avalanche of support. But he was also a little uncomfortable knowing that people had been ticking off stories about acts of charity that he had never meant to be public.He was stunned, he recalled, when he turned on his phone the day he was released from the detention facility. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!\u2019\u201dEmails flooded in from around the world. Supporters wrote to say that Mr. Hernandez\u2019s acts of civic responsibility over two decades should matter more than how he got here from Mexico. Plenty of critics wrote, too: Some said laws were laws and noted that Mr. Hernandez also had two drunken-driving convictions from 2007; some fellow Latinos viewed him as betraying or rejecting Mexico.But in West Frankfort, feelings about Mr. Hernandez seem not to have changed much, and life has moved on.People seemed more worried about the future of coal, on which the area has depended; about hopes for some new major employer; about whether young people, dreaming of decent jobs, will stay put; about the strain that state fiscal woes have placed on this part of Illinois; and about the flood of drugs that the local sheriff, Don Jones, said had some role in the lives of nearly all 114 inmates in his jail.\u201cI love the coal industry,\u201d said Jim Muir, the county\u2019s circuit court clerk, who spent almost two decades working at a coal mine, starting when he turned 18. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it will ever be back to where it was.\u201dMayor Jordan said West Frankfort was \u201cbuilt on coal,\u201d and recognized people in the audience who had worked in the mines or were children of those who had. The region\u2019s challenge, most believe, is finding a thriving economic path forward.\u201cWe don\u2019t really get involved in a lot of immigration issues in West Frankfort,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.For Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco, though, those questions are far from answered. His next court date has been set for April 19, 2021.It is a date he says he thinks about endlessly. He swerves from miserable (if he is deported, his family will remain here) to hopeful (maybe a judge will allow him to stay). On the one hand, he\u2019s counting down to what he sees as the equivalent of an execution date; on the other, he feels he has been granted precious time.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

And this reminds me of a controversy that raged around four or five years ago, during what now seems like a golden age \u2013 an era when it seemed as if facts and reasoned debate might actually matter for policy.The structural view had clear policy implications, because if you believed it the case for employment-boosting stimulus was much weaker than if you believed that high unemployment really, truly represented lots of Americans willing to work.But here we are: there hasn\u2019t been a significant change in the skills of the workforce, but unemployment is now lower than it was in 2007, and wage growth is still low. The demand siders were right.And this $8 trillion loss didn\u2019t have to happen: adequate, sustained stimulus could have eliminated most of it.I\u2019d like to think that the way things turned out would serve as a lesson in future crises.

Eighty-seven people will need new jobs. Businesses are worried about their workers\u2019 compensation premiums rising, and how this city of about 4,100 people will attract anyone without a hospital to help them once they are here.\u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation if that hospital closes,\u201d said Holly Watkins, a real estate agent who was shopping on a downtown block already dotted by empty storefronts. \u201cThe hospital closing is the No. 1 issue.\u201dBut during the United States Senate race that will culminate on Tuesday, the sensational has overshadowed the myriad problems in one of the nation\u2019s poorest states. And as voters prepare to cast their ballots, they often lament the issues that have fallen outside the spotlight\u2019s glare during the nationally watched campaign between Doug Jones and Roy S. Moore.Those issues are still haunting Alabama in a race that has revolved almost entirely around Mr. Moore\u2019s extreme views and the allegations against him of improper behavior with young girls.Polls suggest that about half of the voters believe that the accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moore, the Republican nominee, are not the most important issue in the race. For every voter who calls the allegations crucial, there is another who worries more about education, health care, job creation, same-sex marriage, race relations or the state\u2019s roads and bridges. (Mr. Moore has denied the charges.)\u201cAlabama voters do care about infrastructure, health care, the military,\u201d said Paul DeMarco, who was a Republican state legislator until 2014. \u201cThose issues are important, but they\u2019ve gotten drowned out with the headlines of the past 30 days.\u201dThe state is so often stellar in football, residents say ruefully, and not much else, a consequence of generations of bitter fights, political turbulence and eternal divides over race and class.About 17 percent of Alabamians live in poverty \u2014 the fifth-highest rate in the country \u2014 and the state\u2019s violence-wracked prisons are jammed to 159 percent of their intended capacity. With budget troubles a chronic fact of life, spending on Medicaid, which has not been expanded, lags. Standardized test scores are among the nation\u2019s lowest. Heart disease and diabetes are endemic.Last year, Marion, a rural city in central Alabama, suffered a tuberculosis outbreak so severe that its incidence rate was worse than that of many developing countries.\u201cI think we really don\u2019t know why it\u2019s going up,\u201d said Grace Thomas, the assistant state health officer for family health services with the state\u2019s Department of Public Health, who called the rates a \u201ckey indicator of a health care system\u2019s effectiveness\u201d and said black, Hispanic and poor women were less likely to get the care they need.Paris Daves, 24, said it took her several months after she found out she was pregnant last year to get on Medicaid, although she has since drawn support from an organization called Gift of Life, which works to prevent infant mortality in Montgomery. But as a young, single parent, there are other problems, too, like unreliable public transportation and low wages.\u201cMinimum wage here is $7.25,\u201d said Ms. Daves, who earns a dollar more than that as a shift manager at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough to pay my rent or take care of my son.\u201dIn Haleyville, northwest of Birmingham, the coming shutdown of the hospital looms over the city where, in 1968, the country\u2019s first 911 call was made.But you can pick anyplace in Alabama and find issues that feel somewhere between daunting and suffocating. In the Black Belt, named for its rich topsoil, but now a region of widespread rural poverty, people still wonder whether once-plentiful jobs will ever come back.Along the Black Warrior River in Tuscaloosa, professionals and university professors worry about Alabama\u2019s reputation and whether companies with money to spend might look elsewhere. Indeed, many fear that the ultimate fallout from the race will be yet another hit to the state\u2019s reputation and attractiveness as a place to do business.Huntsville cares about federal spending that helps power an economy that depends on rockets and missiles.National reporters flocked to a town hall last month in Gadsden hoping for animated discussion of Mr. Moore and the Senate race. Instead, most of the conversation was about opioids, economic development and the extension of Interstate 759.People here know that no single senator can fix all of Alabama\u2019s ills. Many of the state\u2019s troubles, residents acknowledge, must be solved at the State House in Montgomery, not in Washington. But as the campaign for a rare open Senate seat droops to an end that just about everyone here says cannot come soon enough, there is no shortage of regret that the tawdry overtook the tangible, and topics of statewide concern got little hearing.\u201cThere\u2019s really no other way to put it than a missed opportunity,\u201d said Will Walker, a bank president in Haleyville, the largest city in a county where President Trump won 90 percent of the vote last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so little discussion about issues, it\u2019s disappointing.\u201dThe state, like its neighbors in the South, is desperate to preserve the economic lifeboats that have emerged in recent decades: big-name foreign manufacturers who put down stakes in exchange for cheap labor, low taxes and lavish incentive packages.The economic model has created a strange dichotomy: While Alabama often generates headlines about culture-war battles that outsiders view as hopelessly provincial, the flavor of commerce is increasingly, and proudly, international.Samuel N. Addy, an economist at the University of Alabama, said the state still has glaring public sector needs in education, infrastructure, health and prisons.\u201cThose are our four major ones,\u201d said Mr. Addy, \u201cand all of them require raising revenues to meet the needs here. But I don\u2019t think the climate is such that we are open to raising revenues much.\u201dThe poor quality of public education, in particular, has long been a concern in a state where the gap between rich and poor residents \u2014 and white and black ones \u2014 remains a nagging reality.The concerns have only seemed to mount with the realization that 21st century manufacturing jobs often require advanced understanding of computer systems: Building a jet is just not the same as running a loom. A year ago, then-governor Robert Bentley, a former church deacon not prone to strong language, at least in public, put the matter in shockingly blunt terms: \u201cOur education system in this state sucks.\u201d\u201cHe hears and sees things that maybe he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said.Ms. Gentry, who said her husband is serving a prison term elsewhere in Alabama, also described the state\u2019s deteriorating prisons. Her husband, she knows, can take care of himself behind bars, but she said the strain on the system is obvious to her family.\u201cMy husband\u2019s last probation officer told me he\u2019s sorry he failed me and my children, because he\u2019s got 70 guys to look after, because it\u2019s hard,\u201d Ms. Gentry said.Indeed, Escambia County is but one place that struggles. Even with the state\u2019s vast presence and a nearby casino, Main Street is sprinkled with shuttered businesses.\u201cWe are 49th or 50th in too many categories,\u201d said Robbie Drummond, 63, a pharmacist. \u201cIn Alabama, we always say, \u2018Thank God for Mississippi.\u2019 I know they say the same about us.\u201dAlan Blinder reported from Haleyville; Jess Bidgood from Atmore, Ala.; and Richard Fausset from Mobile, Ala.

{"Headline": "China Shrugs Off Debt Worries as Xi Takes Firmer Economic Grip", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 It\u2019s Xi Jinping\u2019s economy now, and he isn\u2019t too worried about debt.China signaled its economic priorities on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of top Communist Party economic leaders with a statement indicating that President Xi is fully in charge. Labeled \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialist Economy With Chinese Characteristics,\u201d the statement called for trimming industrial overcapacity, controlling the supply of money and other moves that have been staples of China\u2019s other recent declarations.\u201cPrudent monetary policy should be kept neutral, the floodgates of monetary supply should be controlled, and credit and social financing should see reasonable growth,\u201d the statement said.The statement illustrates both Mr. Xi\u2019s growing clout and what economists say is a subtle shift in how China may address its debt pile \u2014 a shift that suggests leaders may be willing to tolerate even more debt if it will help growth.\u201cIt shows that \u2018I am the boss,\u2019\u201d said Gary Liu, president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a nonprofit economic research group in Shanghai.The absence of major concern about debt also echoed recent Chinese statements. Since October, Chinese economic policymakers have expressed little interest in tackling the country\u2019s mountain of debt, which has accumulated rapidly over the past decade. By contrast, the work conference\u2019s statements over the past two years devoted more attention to the subject.Instead, the new statement called for stabilizing China\u2019s often-volatile housing market, particularly by helping to develop a stronger rental market, and for trimming the list of industries in which foreign investors are restricted from participating.China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second largest after that of the United States, is fueled to a considerable extent by lending from its state-controlled banking system. A relaxed stance on debt suggests leaders could be less inclined to take steps that would trim the debt load but also might hold back short-term economic growth.Chinese officials in recent months have signaled a \u201csubtle change of emphasis\u201d toward tolerating an overall increase in debt as long as corporate debt stays under control, said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist.The efforts seem to have slowed the rate at which debt is growing relative to the economy. Data from the Bank of International Settlements, a group of big central banks that is based in Basel, Switzerland, shows that China\u2019s ratio of nonfinancial corporate debt to economic output fell slightly in the second quarter of this year, the most recent for which data is available.\u201cHigh leverage is the general source of macrofinancial fragility, manifested in the real sector as overindebtedness and in the financial sector as an excessively rapid expansion of credit,\u201d he said in a statement on the central bank\u2019s website on Nov. 4.Meanwhile, there are persistent questions about how much debt has really been incurred by local governments and their corporate affiliates.China\u2019s debt accumulation is \u201cslower than before, but if you use the West as a benchmark, it\u2019s still pretty bad,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cruise Ships Have Made Bar Harbor Popular. But Have They Ruined It?", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "A Maine town is embroiled in a debate over the ships that have magnified its status and brought huge crowds.Supported byBAR HARBOR, Me. \u2014 Residents of this scenic coastal town have struggled for the last several years with a conundrum familiar to anyone living in a beautiful place that attracts tourists: How do you maintain its essence when crowds threaten the very qualities they come to enjoy?Since the late 1990s, Bar Harbor has been a popular port of call for cruise ships. Much of the attraction is nearby Acadia National Park, where deep evergreen forests meet the craggy, glacier-sculpted coast of the Atlantic and where Cadillac Mountain, the highest point along the Eastern Seaboard, offers spectacular views.But in recent years, the number of cruise ships has sharply escalated, aggravating tensions between residents whose livelihoods depend on tourists \u2014 and want to cater to the cruise ships \u2014 and others who may or may not depend on tourists but who worry that too many could spoil what draws people here in the first place.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg,\u201d one town resident said at a packed meeting last month on the issue. \u201cBut the goose is already sick.\u201dOutsiders have been flocking to Mount Desert Island, home to Bar Harbor and the national park, since the mid-1800s, when painters from the Hudson River School discovered its natural beauty. Rockefellers, Astors, Vanderbilts and Carnegies homesteaded here in Gilded Age style, building mammoth 1,000-room hotels and opulent \u201ccottages.\u201dMuch of that fell to ruin in 1947 when a fire roared across the island, consuming scores of mansions and scorching thousands of acres of the park.The community that has sprouted up since retains vestiges of those exclusive summer colonies, but they coexist with T-shirt shops, tour buses and a large middle class of shopkeepers, retirees and telecommuters who live year-round on the island, about two-thirds of the way up the Maine coast.\u201cWhy should people from somewhere else care about this?\u201d asked Anna Durand, owner of the Acacia House Inn, as the aroma of fresh-made quince paste filled her kitchen. \u201cBecause it could happen to you. We are a cautionary tale. When is enough too much?\u201dBut Bar Harbor has generally welcomed the industry, seeing it as a vital spur to the seasonal economy.\u201cBefore the cruise ships started coming to Bar Harbor, our tourist season ended after Labor Day,\u201d said Kristi Bond, who owns and operates four restaurants downtown. \u201cNow, September and October are two of our busiest months.\u201dThe number of cruise ships visiting Bar Harbor reached 163 in 2017, up from 105 in 2016. It is by far the state\u2019s largest cruise ship port.The town, cognizant of the street congestion that the passengers cause, has capped the daily number of visitors who can come ashore \u2014 3,500 in summer, 5,500 in spring and fall.But Bar Harbor has only 5,200 year-round residents, and on some days, the crowds are overwhelming. They pour in at once to the quaint downtown, where dozens of tour buses await, like a standing army. On occasion, the road to the summit of Cadillac is closed because of congestion.\u201cThis is about some folks being afraid that we\u2019re reaching our saturation point,\u201d said Paul Paradis, who owns a hardware store here and is chairman of the town council. \u201cI am not of that school.\u201dHe noted that the ship passengers \u2014 a total of about 185,000 in 2017 \u2014 make up less than 6 percent of the town\u2019s 3.3 million annual tourists. And sometimes the road to Cadillac is closed on non-cruise ship days.Most tourists come by car. Even though they take up all the parking spots and clog the roads, some residents prefer them over ship passengers because they spend more money. They stay longer, check into hotels and eat at restaurants, while ship passengers leave before dinner and overnight at sea.Critics of the ships have other complaints, saying the giant floating palaces are wildly out of scale with the town and create noise, air, water and light pollution. (Acadia boasts famously bright stars at night, and Bar Harbor has an ordinance to reduce its sky glow.)Among the uses for the terminal proposed by the town\u2019s consultants was a large berthing pier where the cruise ships could dock directly, allowing passengers to walk ashore. Right now, because the piers in town are relatively small, the big ships have to anchor out in the bay and use little boats to ferry passengers to town.But the berthing-pier idea alarmed many residents and further roiled debate over how much the town should cater to the cruise ships. At an acrimonious public session, and in polling, most residents rejected a giant pier for the ships, preferring instead a marina that could have many different uses. One group went to court to try to invalidate the June vote. The letters column of the Mount Desert Islander, the local paper, bristled with angry screeds.And then things took a surprising turn.The town agreed to let a 40-member citizens committee figure out what was in the town\u2019s best interest. The committee took its mission seriously, conducting hours of research on technical issues and holding numerous public meetings. A professional facilitator helped guide the discussions.In November, as the last of the tourists left Bar Harbor for the winter, the committee agreed that it did not want a big berthing pier.Rather, it favored converting the ferry terminal into a marina, providing public access for recreational boaters as well as parking, bike rentals and a tram to circulate through town. The cruise ships would still anchor in the bay, but smaller boats could deliver their passengers to the new marina, where they could board tour buses.The town council then unanimously accepted the committee\u2019s report. Many residents rejoiced, saying that the people, not the cruise ship industry, were controlling the town\u2019s fate.But confusion erupted later over exactly what transpired.Mr. Paradis, the council chairman, indicated in media interviews that the council had not adopted the report and would not necessarily follow its recommendation for a marina.\u201cAll we did was accept their report,\u201d said Mr. Paradis, who has long favored a berthing pier. \u201cBut we have not decided to build a pier or not build a pier.\u201dHe said the next step would be for the town\u2019s consultants to analyze whether the marina could be financially self-sustaining.At the town council\u2019s Dec. 19 meeting, residents and other council members said Mr. Paradis\u2019s comments were confusing and appeared to suggest, contrary to popular belief, that the plan for the ferry terminal was unresolved. This promised the debate would continue, as residents prepare to vote in June on whether to authorize the town\u2019s purchase of the terminal for $3.5 million.\u201cBoth the park and the town are facing the same puzzle,\u201d said Ms. Durand, the inn owner. \u201cHow do you accommodate as many people as you can while still preserving the resource?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Robert Wilmers built M&T Bank into a $120 billion in assets lender with 24 acquisitions over almost 35 years and used that platform to attack post-crisis rules that lumped mid-tier players with mega-banks. His death on Saturday at 83 robs the industry of one of its staunchest defenders.Most bank bosses ran for cover after last decade\u2019s financial meltdown, choosing to let lobby groups do their bidding in arguing against the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulations. JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon was a notably outspoken exception. Mr. Wilmers was another.He was no dyed-in-the-wool regional banker, having worked at both Bankers Trust and JPMorgan. He came to Buffalo-based M&T \u2014 now valued at almost $26 billion \u2014 as an activist investor pushing for better results. Instead, he was hired in 1982 and became chief executive officer a year later.Like Mr. Dimon, Mr. Wilmers would lay out his thesis in annual shareholder letters that could run to 30 pages or more. The big five banks were a particular bugbear. In his letter covering 2011, he accused them of \u201ca pattern of investing in areas where they possessed little knowledge,\u201d appearing to \u201cseek dominance at the expense of leadership,\u201d and stating that they \u201ccontinue to distort our economy.\u201d In this year\u2019s missive, he pointed out these five had paid $158 billion in legal settlements over a decade.He also amassed evidence of what his bank\u2019s small and midsize businesses were most concerned about: health care costs and new regulations, not competition or materials costs, he wrote last year.Most important, though, he did not hold back on the perils of new banking rules he regarded as over the top. This year he outlined how M&T underwent 27 examinations from six agencies during 50 of the 52 weeks in 2016. The bank\u2019s compliance costs shot up to $440 million that year, or almost 15 percent of operating expenses from $210 million in 2010.That is, in part, the result of regulators finding shortfalls in M&T\u2019s anti-money-laundering procedures and other areas after it bid for Hudson City Bancorp. The deal, struck in 2012, took more than three years to get the nod from watchdogs. As problematic as that was for M&T, which counts Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway as a top-10 shareholder, it also bolstered for many Mr. Wilmers\u2019 argument about regulatory overreach.His death comes just as Congress is considering a bipartisan move to ditch one of the biggest constraints he fought: the designation of any bank with $50 billion or more of assets as a systemically important financial institution, which Mr. Wilmers dubbed a decision made \u201cabruptly and arbitrarily.\u201d It\u2019s a victory he\u2019ll now be unable to savor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Does Your Airfare Actually Buy?", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not enough to look for the cheapest airfare anymore.Not when airlines are increasingly dividing and subdividing their cabins and charging separately for what used to be part of the fare. More legroom? That will be an extra charge. Overhead bin space? Only if you buy a more expensive ticket.In the new world of airfares, similar-sounding fare classes like \u201ceconomy\u201d and \u201cbasic economy\u201d can mask big differences in the level of service being offered. Complicating matters further, booking websites often do a poor job of explaining what travelers are actually getting for the listed price.\u201cYou need a supercomputer sometimes to figure out what you are getting and what you are not getting,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group. \u201cJust to add confusion to the mix, obviously not every airline\u2019s lowest fare includes or excludes the same things.\u201dWith a basic economy ticket on American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, travelers can\u2019t select a seat in advance. But on Delta, basic economy passengers are still permitted to use the overhead bins if there is available space. On American and United, those overhead compartments are off limits to those who purchase the lowest fares \u2014 unless the passenger is an elite member of the airlines\u2019 reward programs.\u201cYou have to do more research than ever,\u201d said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cEven if you think you know your way around this, things are changing to the point that you have to constantly review what\u2019s best for you.\u201dNot that long ago, airline tickets were much more self-explanatory. There were just two or three \u201cclasses\u201d of seats, and even the coach fare came with decent legroom and allowed at least one checked bag. For no extra charge, a lucky traveler might wind up with some extra legroom in an exit or bulkhead row.That started to change in 2008, when American Airlines introduced a fee for a passenger\u2019s first checked bag. Since then, the whole industry has introduced more and higher fees each year, charging for priority boarding, Wi-Fi, onboard entertainment and even selecting a seat in advance. The Trump administration recently rejected a rule that would have compelled airlines to alert passengers to baggage fees earlier and more prominently in the booking process.All those fees have played a big role in helping airlines return to profitability after years of losses and bankruptcies. The airlines have also benefited from lower fuel costs over the past decade and less competition on most routes.Revenue from fees and other payments is \u201cgrowing every year because it works,\u201d said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorksCompany, a consulting firm that focuses on the airline industry.According to a report his company released this fall, the airlines made more than $82 billion in ancillary revenue \u2014 fees from passengers and other payments from partners like credit card companies and hotels \u2014 in 2017. That is about $46 billion more than five years ago. The report, sponsored by CarTrawler, a company that provides car rental recommendations on many airlines\u2019 websites, used data released by 66 airlines last year to extrapolate the likely ancillary revenue of 184 carriers worldwide. The majority of the reported revenue came from \u00e0 la carte service fees.\u201cAirlines that make good profits are better airlines,\u201d Mr. Sorensen said in a phone interview between connecting flights. \u201cWe came through the \u201980s where the airlines were threadbare. I\u2019m in Minneapolis right now in a gate area where there are new carpets, all the seats work and there\u2019s lots of information available on flat screens.\u201dAlison McAfee, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, an industry trade group, defended the new fare and fee structure as a good thing for everyone. \u201cThe concept of unbundling fares has enabled carriers to keep base fares low, while providing customers with more choice about what they value and are willing to pay for to meet their individual needs, at price points that work for their budgets,\u201d she said in an email.Many travelers are especially concerned with the initial cost of their ticket. \u201cThey will spend hours, sometimes as much as several days, shopping for flights where the airfare fits their budget,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. However, once they buy the cheapest ticket, many travelers go on to purchase small upgrades that improve the quality of their trip.\u201cWhile they\u2019ll certainly shop to find that base airfare, they\u2019ll turn around and spend some of that money they saved on amenities to have a more pleasant trip, whether that\u2019s a seat with more legroom or lounge access or whatever else,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said.He also pointed out that booking megasites like Kayak and Orbitz usually emphasize low prices above all, but do a poor job of explaining what is excluded from basic economy fares. Often, he said, such sites do not detail the benefits of buying a slightly more expensive standard economy ticket \u2014 if the option to do so is listed at all. Mr. Hudson, the consumer advocate, said that many times, travelers are best off visiting individual airline websites to see the full array of options available to them.As the airlines continue to further unbundle their fares, Mr. Harteveldt said, customers may have to change the way they consider ticket purchases. \u201cIt helps to think about shifting your minds from buying fares to buying products,\u201d he said. \u201cNose to tail, it\u2019s just a matter of time before everything on the airplane becomes an \u00e0 la carte experience.\u201dCarriers have also been using years of data on passenger preferences and behaviors to determine which amenities can be mined for moneymaking fees.\u201cAirlines have perfect information on this because every time someone assigns themselves a seat, they know about it,\u201d Mr. Sorensen said. \u201cThey can go in and capture that data and learn when this happened and which seats go first.\u201dHe compared choosing \u2014 and possibly paying extra for \u2014 a particular seat to buying real estate. \u201cA lakefront cabin with a beach is worth more,\u201d he saidBusiness travelers can often opt for that higher priced ticket. Corporate policies vary, but many companies allow their employees to buy regular economy fares rather than basic tickets, Mr. Harteveldt said.He suggested that leisure travelers consider more than just the official price tag. Booking a ticket or flying an airline that prevents you from selecting a seat in advance, for example, can mean getting separated from your family on the plane.Some may find a more expensive ticket with fewer restrictions worth the extra cost \u201cif they\u2019re traveling with children or a trip where there\u2019s a lot of emotional pressure on them \u2014 a family vacation or something,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said. \u201cThe last thing you want to do is have your vacation ruined.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals Need to Take Their Fingers Out of Their Ears", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGiven the triumph of contemporary conservatism, it may be time for liberals to take a look at the vulnerabilities of their own orthodoxies.Voters in red America are 44 percent less likely to be college graduates and 22 percent more likely to have served in the armed forces. Geographically speaking, red counties are virtually nonexistent on the West Coast and on the East Coast north of the Mason-Dixon line.Many Democrats continue to have little understanding of their own role \u2014 often inadvertent, an unintended consequence of well-meaning behavior \u2014 in creating the conditions that make conservatives willing to support Trump and the party he is leading.Consider some of the core features of our ideal liberal democracy: absolutely unfettered freedom and diversity; acceptance and promotion of multiculturalism; allowing retention of separate identities; maintenance of separate communities, lifestyles and values; permitting open criticism of leaders, authorities and institutions; unrestrained free expression (of what many will consider offensive/outrageous/unacceptable ideas); strict prohibitions on government intervention in \u2018private\u2019 moral choices.In fact, Stenner argues, these values are the subject of intense debate. They lie at the core of what divides America:These reflect some of the fundamental fault lines of human conflict and are unlikely ever to be resolved or settled because we can\u2019t just be socialized or educated out of our stances on these issues, as they are the product of deep-seated, largely heritable predispositions that cause us to vary in our preference for and in our ability to cope with freedom and diversity, novelty and complexity, vs oneness and sameness.Not only are the values that the left takes for granted heatedly disputed in many sections of the country, the way many Democratic partisans assert that their values supplant or transcend traditional beliefs serves to mobilize the right.Stenner makes the point thatliberal democracy\u2019s allowance of these things inevitably creates conditions of \u201cnormative threat,\u201d arousing the classic authoritarian fears about threats to oneness and sameness, which activate those predispositions \u2014 about a third of most western populations lean toward authoritarianism \u2014 and cause the increased manifestation of racial, moral and political intolerance.I am quoting Stenner \u2014 and later in this column, the public policy analyst Eric Schnurer \u2014 at length because they both make arguments about complex ideas with precision and care.\u201cLibertarians and/non-authoritarians,\u201d Stenner writes,are likewise aroused and activated under these conditions, and move toward positions of greater racial, moral and political tolerance as a result. Which increases political polarization of the two camps, which further increases normative threat, and so it goes on. This is what I mean by the core elements of liberal democracy creating conditions that inevitably undermine it.How does the undermining process work?A system like our ideal liberal democracy, which does not place any constraints on critiques of leaders, authorities and institutions; and does not allow any suppression of ideas no matter how dangerous to the system or objectionable to its citizens; and does not permit itself to select who can come in, or stay, based on their acceptance/rejection of fundamental liberal democratic values, has both:(1) guaranteed perpetual generation of conditions of normative threat, and all the activation, polarization, and conflict that that produces, and(2) disallowed all means for protecting itself against that \u201cauthoritarian dynamic,\u201d which otherwise might have included allowing: some selectivity in regard to the fundamental values of those who are allowed to come, and to stay; constraints on certain kinds of critiques of leaders, authorities and institutions; constraints on free speech that exclude racist or intolerant speech; some ability to write moral strictures into public policy to reflect traditional beliefs where the majority \u201cdraws the line.\u201dIf a liberal democracy were to allow those things, it would no longer be a liberal democracy. But if it does not allow those things, it is extremely difficult to protect itself from fundamental threats to its continued existence.Stenner\u2019s analysis poses a strategic dilemma for liberalism and the Democratic Party. Insofar as Democrats seek to stem the conservative tide, a crucial factor will be their ability to increase their understanding of their own role in the process that has culminated in conservative dominance.Blue America spent the last eight years dictating both economic and cultural changes invalidating virtually every aspect of Red America. Liberals see all that as both righteous and benevolent \u2014 we\u2019re both promoting better values and willing to help train them to be more like us.Schnurer elaborated on this line of thought in an email:The prototypical Trump voter sees a changing America leaving him behind; part of this is economic, part of it demographic, part cultural. I think liberals tend to see this as a thin cover for racism, a reflection of troglodyte viewpoints, and in any event unwarranted as the world these folks are resisting would be better even for them if only they\u2019d let it, by giving up their benighted religious views, accepting job training in the new technologies, and preferably moving to one or the other coasts or at least the closest major city.Red and blue America often draw diametrically opposed conclusions from the same experiences and developments, Schnurer contends:I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much argument that the modern economy is killing off small towns, US-based manufacturing, the interior of the US generally, etc. There is, or could be, an argument as to whether that\u2019s just the necessary functioning of larger economic forces, or whether there are political choices that have produced, or at least aided and abetted, those outcomes. In any event, while most of us in Blue World see these changes as beneficent, they have had devastating effects on the economies of \u201cred\u201d communities.Schnurer observes thatThis is a classic political problem of general benefit at the cost of specific individual harm. At a minimum, \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 as a country but also as a self-styled progressive subset of that country \u2014 have given inadequate thought to those harms and how to ameliorate them; but I think you can also make the argument that we have exacerbated them.Long-term trends may be working in favor of the left, as the recent governor\u2019s races in Virginia and New Jersey suggest, but liberals, Schnurer argues, are using policy to accelerate the process without determining the costs:For example, we could adopt protectionist policies, which of course we haven\u2019t because both mainstream Democrats and Republicans see them as counterproductive in the long term; but we have also attempted more actively to steer the economy more quickly to the likely, proper, outcome by shifting national tax and spending priorities toward new energy technologies, and away from fossil fuels.Schnurer notes thatYou don\u2019t have to buy the right\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric to accept that, even if that\u2019s the direction the world is headed, anyway, hastening coal\u2019s demise and shifting federal subsidy policy away from it and into alternative energy sources will have a negative economic effect on certain communities.In addition to the economic setbacks experienced in heavily Republican regions of the country, Schnurer, himself a liberal, argues that blue America has over the last decade declared war on the \u201cred way of life.\u201dHe makes a case very similar to Stenner\u2019s:The political, economic, and cultural triumph nationwide of a set of principles and realities essentially alien to large numbers of Americans is viewed as (a) being imposed upon them, and (b) overturning much of what they take for granted in their lives \u2014 and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re wrong about that. I think they\u2019ve risen in angry revolt, and now intend to give back to the \u201celite\u201d in the same terms that they\u2019ve been given to. I don\u2019t think this is good \u2014 in fact, I think it\u2019s a very dangerous situation \u2014 but I think we need to understand it in order to responsibly address it.Do liberals in fact need to understand \u2014 or empathize with \u2014 their many antagonists, the men and women who are sharply critical of the liberal project?Steven Pinker, a professor of psychology at Harvard, observes that \u201cbelievers in liberal democracy have unilaterally disarmed in the defense of the institution\u201d by agreeing in many cases with the premise of the Trump campaign: \u201cthat the country is a hopeless swamp.\u201d This left Democrats \u201cdefenseless when he proposed to drain it.\u201dWhere, Pinker asks,are the liberals who are willing to say that liberal democracy has worked? That environmental regulations have slashed air pollutants while allowing Americans to drive more miles and burn more fuel? That social transfers have reduced poverty rates fivefold? That globalization has allowed Americans to afford more food, clothing, TVs, cars, and air-conditioners? That international organizations have prevented nuclear war, and reduced the rate of death in warfare by 90 percent? That environmental treaties are healing the hole in the ozone layer?Pinker remains confident:Progress always must fight headwinds. Human nature doesn\u2019t change, and the appeal of regressive impulses is perennial. The forces of liberalism, modernity, cosmopolitanism, the open society, and Enlightenment values always have to push against our innate tribalism, authoritarianism, and thirst for vengeance. We can even recognize these instincts in ourselves, even in Trump\u2019s cavalier remarks about the rule of law.Pinker continues:Over the longer run, I think the forces of modernity prevail \u2014 affluence, education, mobility, communication, and generational replacement. Trumpism, like Brexit and European populism, are old men\u2019s movements: support drops off sharply with age.Pinker is optimistic about the future. I hope he is right.The problem is that even if Pinker is right, his analysis does not preclude a sustained period in which the anti-democratic right dominates American politics. There is no telling how long it will be before the movement Trump has mobilized will have run its course. Nor can we anticipate \u2014 if and when Trumpism does implode \u2014 how extensive the damage will be that Pinker\u2019s \u201cforces of modernity\u201d will have to repair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alabama Says No to Trump\u2019s Tribalism", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are so many things I could say right now after watching Doug Jones defeat Roy Moore in the Senate race in Alabama, but for me it comes down to just two words: \u201cThank you.\u201dThank you to the majority of Alabamians for loving our country more than you hated Democrats. Thank you for voting as citizens, not as members of a tribe. Thank you for understanding that sending a credibly accused child molester to represent Alabama in the U.S. Senate would not only have denigrated your state, it would have denigrated that whole legislative body. Thank you for seeing the decency of Doug Jones, even though he is a Democrat, and seeing the indecency of Roy Moore.God bless every one of you. Yours was a deeply patriotic act.It\u2019s too soon to say for sure, of course, whether this is a national trend, but when the majority in a deep-red state like Alabama \u2014 where anti-abortion sentiments run so high, making it nearly impossible for a pro-choice Democrat to be elected \u2014 repudiates the effort by Trump and Bannon to turn us from citizens into tribes, there is hope for the country after all. It is a real sign of health.I speak from some experience, because I have peered into this tribal abyss. Back in the late 1970s, when I was covering the Lebanese civil war, a story made the rounds in Beirut that the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia had come up with a novel way of discovering a Palestinian trying to pass through one of its checkpoints. The Phalangists would show the driver a tomato and ask: What\u2019s this? If the driver used the standard Lebanese pronunciation, \u201cbanadurra,\u201d he was allowed to pass. If he used the Palestinian pronunciation, \u201cbandora,\u201d he could be pulled out of his car and shot on the spot.That is tribal politics at its raw essence: It doesn\u2019t matter how you live your life or what you aspire to for your society. All that matters is your sectarian or tribal identity, revealed by how you pronounce the word for tomato.Middle Easterners have a saying for this kind of thinking: \u201cMe and my brother against my cousin. Me, my brother and my cousin against the outsider.\u201dThe Alabama Senate race reminded me of that story \u2014 not the shooting part, of course, but the way Alabamians were being told to let someone babysit our precious country, someone they wouldn\u2019t let babysit their own kids \u2014 just because he was supposedly from their tribe.We\u2019ve confronted such thinking before in our history. But in the past moments of raw, tribal/cultural divisions, our system was always able to produce leaders able to summon our better angels and pull us together to rise to the challenges of the day.But even with Jones\u2019s victory in Alabama I worry that technology \u2014 social networks in particular \u2014 and archaic laws that prevent new players from entering politics work against the emergence of such national leaders. I worry that irreversible damage is being done to our norms and institutions by this poisonous cocktail of Trump, Twitter and tribalism.I was not surprised to hear former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya tell CNBC on Tuesday that social media is creating a society that confuses \u201cpopularity\u201d with \u201ctruth.\u201d The tools we\u2019ve created, he explained, \u201care starting to erode the social fabric of how society works.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to forget, in this age of Twitter, how much a daring leader who can pull people together can accomplish \u2014 even in the most difficult of times.We are going through a similar period of rapid change today. The pace of destructive weather events is quickening; the world is going from interconnected to interdependent; and machines and software are devouring ever more middle- and even high-skill jobs. The country needs a plan for investing in more resilient cities, in lifelong learning systems for every worker and in a safety net of mobile/universal health care. And what do we have instead? A highly tribal Republican tax bill that targets none of those issues.But maybe, maybe just maybe, the narrow majority in Alabama has sent both Trump and the country a message. We are fed up with your cynicism, we are fed up with your effort to break us into tribes, we want a president who is a uniter not a divider, because we have big hard work to do as a country right now \u2014 and it can only be done together.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Tax Plan to Turbocharge Inequality, in 3 Charts", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republican tax bill is an audacious attempt to accelerate the economic trends of the last half-century.If you\u2019re a fan of these trends \u2014 rapidly rising inequality and stagnant middle-class incomes \u2014 you should love the bill. If you\u2019re not a fan, you can at least take comfort in knowing that you\u2019re in the majority of Americans, as polls consistently show.Over the last few decades, the rich have not only enjoyed the largest pre-tax raises, by far. They have also received big tax cuts. The middle class and poor, meanwhile, have suffered from slow-growing incomes \u2014 and from overall tax rates that are higher today than in the mid-1960s.The first part of that story is widely known. The rich have gotten richer, for a whole variety of reasons.The second part of the story is less known. But it\u2019s also crucial. The great tax-cutting revolution of the last half-century hasn\u2019t actually been a tax-cutting revolution for most Americans.True, they have benefited from a series of cuts in income-tax rates, signed by Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. At the same time, though, another tax has been rising. It is the quiet giant of federal tax policy: the payroll tax.This makes no sense in an economy where wealthy households have enjoyed the largest pre-tax raises. They are bringing home many more dollars, and each of those dollars is being taxed less than in the past. The middle class and poor are on the unhappy end of both trends.But these efforts haven\u2019t been nearly enough to make up for the soaring pre-tax inequality \u2014 or even to make the tax code more progressive than it used to be. Middle-income families face a higher rate than a half-century ago: 28.6 percent in 2014, versus 24.8 percent in 1964. The economist Gabriel Zucman notes that the increased taxes on lower-income families have made it harder for them to save and invest. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason you have such high wealth inequality,\u201d he said.Now President Trump, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are trying to widen inequality even further. Their tax bill doesn\u2019t touch the payroll-tax rate \u2014 again, the single biggest tax that most households pay. The bill does cut income taxes for the middle class, but only modestly and only temporarily. The tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, including cuts to the inheritance tax and the corporate tax, are much larger and permanent.Researchers at the Tax Policy Center, a vital source of independent analysis on a plan that\u2019s been rushed through Congress, have estimated the long-term effects on each income group. Crucially, their estimates don\u2019t ignore the bill\u2019s impact on the deficit \u2014 and thus include the spending cuts that will eventually need to follow. Even if those cuts fall equally on each household (and, in reality, Republican leaders favor cuts that fall disproportionately on the middle class and poor), the tax bill amounts to an enormous effort to increase inequality.Republican leaders have evidently decided that most Americans deserve more of what they\u2019ve had over the past few decades \u2014 more income stagnation and more inequality. Polls have repeatedly shown that most Americans disagree, but Congress is forging ahead anyway. It\u2019s an affront that deserves to be a defining issue in next year\u2019s midterm campaigns.An earlier version of this column misidentified the payroll tax rate in 1990 and today. It was and is 15.3 percent, not 12.4 percent.Advertisement"}

Earlier in the evening, when she just kind of kicked me in the rear end, when I was down. So this has been a wonderful night. I gotta thank my family. I\u2019ve got my wonderful sons, Carson, Christopher. My daughter, Courtney. My beautiful granddaughter. Her son-in-law [unintelligible]. All these friends back here. U.S. attorney buddies. My mom who [unintelligible] make it here.My dad, who\u2019s here with us in spirit, who\u2019s too ill, and unfortunately, my sister, Terrie, and her husband, Scott, Terrie Savage and Scott Savage, hey girls. Thank you, thank you, she couldn\u2019t make it, either.I am truly overwhelmed. I am truly, truly overwhelmed. But, you know, folks, and you have all heard me say this at one point or another in this campaign. I have always believed that the people of Alabama have more in common than to divide us. We have shown not just around the state of Alabama but we have shown the country the way that we can be unified.We have spent so many hours, I have got so many people that I can thank, but I will tell you just very quickly, there are three people that I want to acknowledge tonight because if it wasn\u2019t for them, we would not be here. They\u2019re the folks that sat me down in early May and said, \u201cDoug, you can do this,\u201d and they showed me the way.And I want to make sure that everyone in this room \u2014 and we had an incredible staff. It started with a small group of folks, Jess and Wade and Trey and Garrett. But the three people I need to acknowledge before I go any further, I have the greatest political consultant in the world in Joe Trippi. I know you\u2019re tired of seeing my ads, but they were all Joe\u2019s work and he showed me the way. Doug Turner, we\u2019ve been friends for so long, showed me the numbers. And then the one that I called the Yoda of the campaign, Giles Perkins. Giles has had his own issues to deal with over the summer, but this campaign and what he has done is \u2014 whenever the history is written about Alabama politics, remember those names, Giles Perkins, Doug Turner and Joe Trippi. There are so many \u2014 there are too many people here.I want to just say this, folks, we have come so far. We have come so far and the people of Alabama have spoken. They have said we \u2014 [cheers and applause] They have said to each other that this, I have said from the very beginning this campaign has never been about me, it\u2019s never been about Roy Moore. It has been about every one of you, every one of you and your sons and daughters. It\u2019s all of those volunteers that knocked on 300,000 doors. It\u2019s the volunteers who made 1.2 million phone calls around this state.It\u2019s those volunteers to make sure that we knew, it was every community. You know, I keep hearing about the different communities in this state. The African-American community, thank you. [Cheers and applause]My friends \u2014 my friends in the Latino community, thank you. To all my Jewish friends, happy Hanukkah. We have built this everywhere we have gone. We have had that same energy. We\u2019ve had that same excitement. At the end of the day, this \u2014 this entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign \u2014 this campaign has been about the rule of law.This cam \u2014 this campaign has been about common courtesy and decency, and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life. And let me just say this, folks, to all of those \u2014 all of my future colleagues in Washington, to all \u2014 I had such wonderful help.But I want to make sure, in all seriousness, there are important issues facing this country. There are important issues of health care and jobs and the economy. And I want to \u2014 I would like, as everyone in the entire probably free world knows right now, we\u2019ve tried to make sure that this campaign was about finding common ground and reaching across and actually getting things done for the people.So, I \u2014 I have a challenge. I have this challenge to my future colleagues in Washington. Don\u2019t wait on me. Take this election from the great state of Alabama \u2014 [cheers and applause] Let me finish. Take this election \u2014 take this election where the people of Alabama said we want to get something done, we want you to find common ground, we want you to talk. Take this opportunity, in light of this election, and go ahead and fund that CHIP program before I get up there. Put it aside and let\u2019s do it for those million kids and 150,000 here in Birmingham, Ala.I\u2019m not going to talk too much longer. It\u2019s been a long night. It\u2019s been a long campaign, but let me \u2014 no, let me \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me \u2014 I know I\u2019ve forgotten so much. I\u2019ve forgotten so much, so many thank you\u2019s and how we feel. This vote \u2014 this vote, I\u2019ve said it before, Alabama has been at a crossroads. We have been at crossroads in the past. And unfortunately we have usually taken the wrong fork.Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, you took the right road.[Cheers and applause]That\u2019s exactly \u2014 U.S.A.[ Crowd chanting \u201cU.S.A.\u201d ]On a very personal level, let me tell you, and I said this at the top and I do mean this. It seems \u2014 I want to thank each of you for helping me fulfill a lifelong dream of serving in the United States Senate that started out with my mentor, Howell Heflin and ever since then, that has been my dream. Thank you for that. At the end of the \u2014 So as we approach this history \u2014 as we approach this crossroads, we have work to do. We have work to do in this state. To build those bridges within this state. To reach across with those that didn\u2019t vote for us to try to find that common ground.I\u2019m pledging to do that tonight, but I will tell you, tonight is a night for rejoicing because as Dr. King said, as Dr. King liked to quote, \u201cThe moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d Tonight, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, tonight, tonight in this time, in this place, you helped bend that moral arc a little closer to that justice and you did it, not only was it bent more, not only was its aim truer but you sent it right through the heart of the great state of Alabama in doing so.Thank you, all. I love you. Thank you. Thank you. And God bless you and God bless the great state of Alabama and the United States of America.Thank you, all. Thank you. Thank you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Takes Mantle of First Bull as the Stock Market Rises", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has broken with many of the norms set by his predecessors, but in few ways has this been clearer than his cheerleading about the roaring stock market.He is the unapologetic First Bull.Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size. Immediate expensing will have a big impact. Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed. Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!Other presidents have occasionally talked about market booms, but often avoided saying anything that could move markets, particularly on individual company stocks. More commonly, they have talked about unemployment numbers, housing starts and other indicators that are less sensitive to market forces.Mr. Trump has ignored those conventions, with relish.\u201cI think that in some sense, he might be responsible for the show he is putting on for some of the increase in stock prices, but I don\u2019t think it is rational,\u201d said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate.Mr. Shiller said the president has \u201clegitimized\u201d the mood that \u201cthe market might continue to go up and up.\u201dThe peril for Mr. Trump is that market cycles invariably have downturns, too, sometimes significant ones, and claiming credit for the rise could also mean owning the fall.\u201cI liken him to Calvin Coolidge, a pro-business president who kept constantly trying to boost the stock market,\u201d Mr. Shiller said. \u201cHe was president until 1929 and then it started to crumble.\u201dStock markets have been rising essentially since March 2009, when the global financial crisis was near its worst. The stock markets are now in the second-longest bull run in history, trailing only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.\u201cThere is no doubt that the promise of a big corporate tax cut and rampant deregulation have had some effect on the markets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s also a fake measure of the rooster taking credit for the dawn, as the economy here and globally were steadily improving when he arrived.\u201dConsumer confidence is also on the rise, which helps to add to an overall pro-market investment psychology.\u201cThe market is not the economy,\u201d said Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cThe market is a measure of future profitability.\u201dThat is a compelling statement \u2014 as long as the market climbs. But even the longest bull markets have eventually come to an end.\u201cIf you want to say everything on a market going up is to your credit, it would seem to follow that if it goes down, it is to your blame,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that in this case.\u201dPresident Bill Clinton also benefited from a stock market surge in the late 1990s, but within the White House, there was concern about aligning too closely with the gains.Paul Begala, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton, said that the Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, \u201cused to tell me that the thing about stocks is that they go down as well as up, so he never wanted President Clinton to associate himself too closely to the stock market.\u201d\u201cWe felt like jobs and wages were what we should focus on, as well as the deficit,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s rating hit that level \u201cwith a roaring stock market,\u201d Mr. Begala said. \u201cWhere do you think he will be when there\u2019s a correction?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Target in Beijing\u2019s Migrant Crackdown: Schoolchildren", "Date": "2017-12-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Ding Fei, a truck driver from rural China, was thrilled to find a school in a crowded migrant neighborhood where his 7-year-old daughter might flourish. Finally, he thought, she could learn to read and write, and maybe even have a shot at becoming a doctor or nurse, as her mother hoped.Then the government intervened. On a bitterly cold day last month, Beijing officials informed parents and teachers that the school was unsafe and illegal. Within hours, the school, which served more than 200 students from rural areas, had been shut down and marked for demolition.These schools exist in an educational gray zone, often operating without licenses and with teachers who \u2014 like the families of their students \u2014 do not have official permission to live and work in Beijing. Educators say that more than a dozen schools have been shut down or demolished this year, often with just a few days\u2019 notice, cutting off access to education for as many as 15,000 children. Many of these children are under 12.The campaign has pitted migrant workers\u2019 dreams of better lives against an authoritarian vision of an orderly, regimented society embraced by the ruling Communist Party.\u201cMy Chinese dream is for my family to live a happy and healthy life, without having to worry about whether my children can attend school,\u201d said Mr. Ding, whose family has been evicted from homes twice in the past month. \u201cThe government simply doesn\u2019t want us here anymore.\u201dCities across China have kicked off similar campaigns as growing populations of migrants from poor, rural areas have placed an increasing burden on urban infrastructure and social services. To drive them away, cities largely restrict benefits like access to affordable health care and public schools to longtime residents.But the migrants keep coming in search of higher-paying jobs, often with families in tow. Their children end up attending privately run, low-cost schools that may be hobbled by poor teaching, insufficient funding and crumbling facilities. Teachers often lack formal credentials and rarely follow a standardized curriculum.More than 200 million migrants live in Chinese cities, including around 38 million children, who face significant obstacles to getting a decent education, experts say.In Beijing, a sprawling network of more than 100 privately run migrant schools serves hundreds of thousands of students for whom these are often the only option. (The government does not publicize exact figures.)At Yingbo, a kindergarten in northern Beijing, more than three dozen security officers showed up outside its gates late last month and forced students and teachers to evacuate. The government said the school was operating illegally, according to staff members. Firefighters sealed off classrooms one by one.The kindergarten has since opened in another part of Beijing, though educators say many families have returned to their hometowns or withdrawn their children from classes entirely.\u201cThe government never explained anything to us,\u201d said Wang Hai, Yingbo\u2019s founder.Advocates say such shutdowns are a crippling blow that may leave behind an entire swath of society as China\u2019s economy shifts to high-tech industries.\u201cYou are basically destroying a whole generation of children,\u201d said Kam Wing Chan, a professor at the University of Washington who studies China\u2019s rural-urban divide.The school closings may also add to simmering discontent. More than a third of Beijing\u2019s nearly 22 million residents are now rural migrants, many of whom express anger at being treated like second-class citizens. Advocates say migrant children will grow up in what is essentially a segregated society.At the Shijingshan Huangzhuang School in southern Beijing, which has been ordered to close next month, parents and teachers have taken the rare step of publishing open letters denouncing the decision in a bid to remain open. The school, which opened in 2005, serves more than 1,500 students.\u201cEducation should be fair and equal,\u201d said Teng Chunlan, whose 6-year-old son is a student there. \u201cWhich article of law have we migrants violated?\u201dSheng Ying, a Chinese-language teacher at the school, said the threat of eviction had distressed staff and students. A bulldozer showed up while classes were in session, she said, only to turn around after school security guards turned them away. Many staff members were in tears, she said.Ms. Sheng said the government should do more to ensure the well-being of migrant children, especially after President Xi Jinping promised greater attention to the plight of rural students at a major Communist Party meeting in October.\u201cIt\u2019s cruel,\u201d Ms. Sheng said. \u201cThe children see demolitions all around them. We have to calm them down and tell them our school can survive.\u201dLi Hongbo, a second grader at the school, worries that he will have to return to his hometown because his parents, who are unemployed, are facing eviction. \u201cI\u2019ll miss my friends here,\u201d he said.Much of the problem lies in China\u2019s way of determining residency, known as the hukou system, which has existed since the Mao era as a way to manage population flows. The system makes it very difficult for people from the countryside to change their legal residence to the cities, even if they live and work there. Their children are also designated residents of the original rural provinces, even if they were born in the cities.Many families have lived in Beijing for years and are reluctant to send their children back to rural areas that can lack modern schools and hospitals.Song Yingquan, a researcher at Peking University, has found that migrant children who do return to the countryside are at higher risk of depression, abuse and dropping out than counterparts who grew up there.\u201cDriving out migrants like this is wrong,\u201d Mr. Song said. \u201cWe should give them the chance to chase their dreams in the cities, no matter what their family background is.\u201dThe Communist Party, fearing mass protests, has tried to limit criticism of its efforts to drive migrants from big cities. Local officials have defended the clearances as a way to improve safety and eliminate subpar schools.Already, there are signs of efforts to organize against the campaign. In Shaanxi, a northern province, hundreds of parents recently protested new rules making it tougher for migrant children to enroll in schools.At Zhanbei Elementary in Fuzhou, a southern city, parents and educators have accused the government of abusing children by shutting off hot water and electricity in an effort to force the school to close.\u201cIt\u2019s a crime,\u201d Xu Jiyuan, its principal, said by telephone. \u201cWhat we have here are little living creatures. You cut off their water and electricity, how do you want them to feel? What will they think of the country when they grow up?\u201dThe Dings \u2014 including Miaoke, 9, Shanshan, 7, and Tianyu, 3 \u2014 now live in a neighborhood in southern Beijing emptied out by bulldozers. They sleep in a cramped, $227-a-month room without heat and only intermittent electricity.Shanshan, whose school was demolished, said she was bored at home and missed her friends. She has been forced to repeat preschool three times. Now she spends her days watching cartoons and playing with a pet turtle.The family was dealt another blow this fall when they learned about the possible closing next month of Shijingshan Huangzhuang School, where Miaoke is a second grader.Their mother, Fang Juan, who takes care of the children while Mr. Ding works, lives in fear of another eviction notice in the form of the Chinese character \u201cchai,\u201d which is painted on the side of buildings that are slated for destruction.\u201cI was so happy when I first came to Beijing,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be forced to go home.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

Real estate developers and technology companies could see big tax cuts, while low-income households and people buying health insurance could lose out.With the bill finally headed to a vote this coming week, taxpayers are scrambling to determine whether the legislation renders them winners or losers.Under current law, that income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Under the bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent, subject to some limitations. Real estate also avoided new limits on interest deductions and retained its ability to defer taxes on the exchange of similar kinds of properties. The benefits of lower rates on pass-through income will extend to Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner\u2019s partners at real estate investment trusts as well. At the last minute, lawmakers added language to make it easier for real estate owners to avoid some of the pass-through provision\u2019s restrictions and maximize the tax benefits even more.Want to know how the tax bill will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Plus, American companies will no longer owe full corporate taxes on future profits they say they earn abroad, providing more incentive to push income into tax haven subsidiaries. The law even includes provisions that could encourage companies to move workers abroad, despite pledges to do the opposite.Plus, the top rate applying to wages and interest income would be cut to 37 percent from 39.6 percent.Patricia Mazzei, Thomas Kaplan and Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "F.C.C. Repeals Net Neutrality Rules", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeveral public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.\u201cWe are helping consumers and promoting competition,\u201d Mr. Pai said. \u201cBroadband providers will have more incentive to build networks, especially to underserved areas.\u201dHis plan for the net neutrality rules, first outlined early this year, set off a flurry of opposition. The issue has bubbled up occasionally for more than a decade, with the debate getting more intense over the years as digital services have become more ingrained in everyday life.Critics of the changes say that consumers will have more difficulty accessing content online and that start-ups will have to pay to reach consumers. In the past week, there have been hundreds of protests across the country, and many websites have encouraged users to speak up against the repeal.In front of a room packed with reporters and television cameras from the major networks, the two Democratic commissioners warned of consumer harms to come from the changes.Mignon Clyburn, one of the Democratic commissioners, presented two accordion folders full of letters protesting the changes, and accused the three Republican commissioners of defying the wishes of millions of Americans by ceding their oversight authority.\u201cI dissent, because I am among the millions outraged,\u201d said Ms. Clyburn. \u201cOutraged, because the F.C.C. pulls its own teeth, abdicating responsibility to protect the nation\u2019s broadband consumers.\u201dBrendan Carr, a Republican commissioner, said it was a \u201cgreat day\u201d and dismissed critics\u2019 \u201capocalyptic\u201d warnings.\u201cI\u2019m proud to end this two-year experiment with heavy-handed regulation,\u201d Mr. Carr said.During Mr. Pai\u2019s speech before the vote, security guards entered the meeting room at the F.C.C. headquarters and told everyone to evacuate. The commissioners were ushered out a back door. The agency did not say what had caused the evacuation, other than Mr. Pai saying it had been done \u201con advice of security.\u201d The hearing restarted a short time later.Despite all the uproar, it is unclear how much will eventually change for internet users. Major telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast, as well as two of the industry\u2019s major trade groups, have promised consumers that their experiences online would not change.Mr. Pai and his Republican colleagues have echoed the comments of the telecom companies, which have told regulators that because of the limits to their business imposed by the rules, they weren\u2019t expanding and upgrading their networks as quickly as they wanted.\u201cThere is a lot of misinformation that this is the \u2018end of the world as we know it\u2019 for the internet,\u201d Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president, David Cohen, wrote in a blog post this week. \u201cOur internet service is not going to change.\u201dBut with the F.C.C. making clear that it will no longer oversee the behavior of broadband providers, telecom experts said, the companies could feel freer to come up with new offerings, such as faster tiers of service for online businesses willing and able to pay for it. Some of those costs could be passed on to consumers.Those experts also said that such prioritization could stifle certain political voices or give the telecom conglomerates with media assets an edge over their rivals.These critics of Mr. Pai, who was nominated by President Trump, said there isn\u2019t enough competition in the broadband market to trust that the companies will try to offer the best services. The rule changes, they believe, give providers incentive to begin charging websites to reach consumers.\u201cLet\u2019s remember why we have these rules in the first place,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, the trade group. \u201cThere is little competition in the broadband service market.\u201dDozens of Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, have pushed for Congress to pass a law on the issue.One Republican commissioner, Mike O\u2019Reilly, said he supported a law created by Congress for net neutrality. But he said any law should be less restrictive than the 2015 rules, protecting the ability of companies to charge for faster lanes, a practice known as \u201cpaid prioritization.\u201dAny legislative action appears to be far off, however, and numerous online companies warned that the changes approved on Thursday should be taken seriously.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have net neutrality protections that enforce tenets of fairness online, you give internet service providers the ability to choose winners and losers,\u201d Steve Huffman, chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. \u201cThis is not hyperbole.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Treasury Defends Tax Plan Cost With One-Page Analysis", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department released a one-page analysis of the nearly 500-page Senate tax bill on Monday that suggested the $1.5 trillion plan would more than pay for itself, assuming the economy grows much faster than any independent analysis of the bill has projected.The Treasury acknowledged that its analysis was based on optimistic economic forecasts that assumed a host of policy changes yet to be enacted, including increased infrastructure spending, further loosening of business regulations and changes to welfare programs.The analysis left many tax experts scratching their heads and prompted criticism that the Treasury was offering misleading data.\u201cThe report does not appear to be a projection of the economic effects of a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg, a tax analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation. \u201cIt appears, on the other hand, to be a thought experiment on how federal revenues would vary under different economic effects of overall government policies. Which is, needless to say, an odd way to analyze a tax bill.\u201dTreasury has come under criticism for failing to produce a full assessment of the $1.5 trillion tax plan moving swiftly through Congress. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly insisted that his department would provide details to back up the claims that he and other Republicans have made that the tax cuts will generate enough economic growth to avoid adding to the national debt.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David H. Brockway, staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration. \u201cIt\u2019s just a political statement.\u201dThe Treasury analysis assumes gross domestic product to grow at a rate of 2.9 percent over the next 10 years, rather than the 2.2 percent rate that many other groups have projected. That faster growth would raise $1.8 trillion over that period, paying for the $1.5 trillion tax cut and raising an additional $300 billion, the Treasury report said.On a conference call to discuss the report, a senior Treasury official said that about half of the difference between Treasury\u2019s estimates for higher growth was based on the proposed corporate tax cut, which would reduce the tax rate for corporations to 20 percent from 35 percent. The rest of the difference is attributed to reducing taxes for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses, whose profits flow through to their owners and are taxed at individual rates, and the administration\u2019s plans for infrastructure, deregulation and changes to the welfare system that were outlined in the White House budget proposal this year.\u201cIt\u2019s not a dynamic score of the bill, because it includes regulatory reform, infrastructure and welfare reform,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who was chairman of former President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cIt looks to me like it\u2019s a restatement of their budget.\u201d\u201cWe acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,\u201d the Treasury Department wrote in the report outlining its analysis of the plan.Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said the Treasury analysis was \u201cabsolutely defensible.\u201d He said that they started with the assumption that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies would boost growth by about one percent per year over the decade and worked backward to demonstrate the effects of the tax cuts would not add to the deficit.\u201cIf you just assume you would get that kind of growth, then you say how much revenue you get from that,\u201d Mr. Hassett said on CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s all really just math.\u201dSeveral groups that have analyzed the Senate plan using sophisticated economic modeling have found it would not generate anywhere close to the revenues needed to pay for itself.The Joint Committee on Taxation, the economic scorekeeper of Congress, projected in late November that the Senate bill would increase the size of the economy by 0.8 percent over 10 years, beyond what it would otherwise have achieved \u2014 which is well short of the growth path implied by the Treasury one-pager. The committee\u2019s so-called dynamic analysis projected that the Senate plan would add $1 trillion to federal deficits over that time, after accounting for increased growth. That analysis was for the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s version of the bill, not the amended version later approved by the chamber.Kent Smetters, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, said that Treasury\u2019s view of what the tax cuts would do for economic growth was \u201caspirational in nature\u201d and not driven by analysis of an actual plan.The Treasury officials pointed to an assessment from the Council of Economic Advisers and a letter written by leading conservative economists that concluded that the tax cut plan would spur greater economic growth than some outside groups have projected.Republican lawmakers have seized upon those analyses to assert that the tax cuts will not add to the $20 trillion national debt, yet some of the economists who signed the letter have said otherwise.Robert Barro, a Harvard professor who signed the letter to the Treasury, said the corporate tax cuts would lead to less revenue in the short run before faster economic growth made up for some of the losses.\u201cMight be roughly a wash in Year 10, in which case cumulated fiscal deficit over 10 years would rise,\u201d Mr. Barro said, nodding to the fact that the debt would increase over that 10-year period.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that he was frustrated that lawmakers were characterizing the letter as affirming that the tax cuts would be fully self-financing.The Treasury analysis comes as Congress is putting the finishing touches on a tax bill that the House and Senate are hoping to vote on next week. The House and Senate are trying to reconcile their two bills, which can add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade.A senior Senate aide said Republicans on Capitol Hill were blindsided by the Treasury report and had no warning that it was coming during such as sensitive time in the legislative process.Democrats doubled-down on their criticism of the Treasury Department on Monday, calling its analysis \u201cfake math.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As China Rises, Australia Asks Itself: Can It Rely on America?", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 When the Australian government set out to write a new foreign policy paper, it faced hotly contested questions shaping the country\u2019s future: Will China replace the United States as the dominant power in Asia? If so, how quickly?The contrasting assessments have set off a debate in Australia about the durability of the American alliance and China\u2019s intentions toward Australia.The government tried to reassure the public that there was no need to make a choice between China, Australia\u2019s biggest trade partner, and the United States, its security patron. Despite the America First policies of President Trump, who is unpopular in Australia, the United States of old would endure. Australia would deal with the changing environment, it said, by working \u201charder to maximize our international influence.\u201dAustralia\u2019s heavy reliance on iron ore and energy exports to China has long raised questions about the need to diversify its economy. However, dependence on China has only grown, as an influx of Chinese students and travelers now also helps to sustain the higher education and tourism industries.Australia has tried to balance its growing economic dependence on China with its longstanding post-World War II security relationship with the United States.Australia\u2019s leaders have gone beyond the white paper\u2019s careful reassurances, openly declaring that Australia must confront the shifting power dynamics of the region.Mr. Turnbull has called this the first time in Australia\u2019s history that its dominant trading partner was not also its dominant security partner. He argued that the country should see this as an opportunity and not a risk, but his comments were also laced with uncertainty and concern.\u201cNow power is shifting, and the rules and institutions are under challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major players are testing their relationships with each other, while undergoing rapid change themselves.\u201dForeign policy experts say the white paper\u2019s assessment of American staying power does not reflect a growing consensus among many Australian policymakers that the United States, at least under its current leadership, cannot be relied on as a stable partner.Michael Fullilove, executive director at the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, described what many Australians see as a fraying of the liberal international order because, he said, \u201cthe president of the United States is neither liberal in his inclinations nor orderly in his behavior.\u201dMany say it\u2019s time for Australia to stop pretending about American intentions, and begin considering other options. This view has found one of its clearest and most strident voices in Mr. White, whose 27,000-word essay bluntly argues that Australia needs to wake up: The game is over and China has already won.\u201cWe all underestimated China\u2019s power and resolve and overestimated America\u2019s,\u201d wrote Mr. White, who worked on sensitive intelligence and military matters with the United States as a senior official at the Australian Defense Department. \u201cNot only is America failing to remain the dominant power, it is failing to retain any substantial strategic role at all.\u201dIn reply to the government\u2019s paper, Mr. White said Australia\u2019s stance was unrealistic because it clung too much to the vestiges of a fading power that would not be able to stay ahead of China\u2019s economic strength.\u201cThe paper has an elegiac feel, the sense of a sunset,\u201d he said in an interview.The biggest splash came from Mr. White\u2019s recommendations for what Australia should do about an American retreat. Faced with what he called Chinese efforts to impose its influence and different political values, he said Australia will have to do more to defend itself, including perhaps even one day acquiring nuclear weapons.\u201cAnd the logic that drives them has implications for others,\u201d Mr. White said. Australia could remain a middle power, he said, by keeping only a small nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt might look something like Britain\u2019s submarine-based nuclear force,\u201d he wrote.Another sign that Washington may seek to reassure its Australian allies has been talk of the possible appointment of Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the United States commander in the Pacific, as the next ambassador to Australia. Some American officials have said they would welcome the move because it would send a message to China that the United States will not retreat.Australia has also tried to hedge its bets by reaching out to other democracies in the region, particularly Japan and India. Citing concerns about China\u2019s advance into the South China Sea, the government\u2019s white paper backed the idea of joining India, Japan and the United States to promote a free and democratic Indo-Pacific region that could offset China.In China, the Foreign Ministry took offense at the comments about the South China Sea, saying Australia had no business meddling. The state-run Global Times suggested China might retaliate with boycotts in tourism and higher education.\u201cFortunately, the country is not that important and China can move its ties with Australia to a back seat and disregard its sensitivities,\u201d the newspaper said.In his essay, Mr. White warned that Beijing could use its growing naval power to ramp up pressure by contesting Australia\u2019s claims to remote pieces of Australian territory, such as islands that it controls in the Antarctic, or by deploying forces to South Pacific neighbors, where China enjoys good relations.Analysts sympathetic to the Turnbull government have pushed back, saying Mr. White\u2019s essay paints an overly alarmist picture.\u201cWhile many of the trends in the region are concerning, White underestimates America\u2019s stake in the region,\u201d said Andrew Shearer, who was an adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Mr. White is \u201cis premature in reaching the conclusion that President Trump will acquiesce to Chinese supremacy, and that the United States is already withdrawing.\u201dStill, the essay performed a useful service, Mr. Shearer said, by drawing attention to the rapidly shifting balance of power in Asia and the need for a more coherent response by Washington.Some Chinese analysts said Mr. White may have overstated China\u2019s success in the region. \u201cThe U.S. is still very much wanted and needed by regional countries, including Australia. The white paper makes that clear,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, professor of international affairs at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.But by 2030, Mr. Zhang said, China will have won the geopolitical race. \u201cEveryone will then live under the shadow of Chinese power,\u201d he said.America does not get entirely short shrift from Mr. White. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the dominant power in Asia,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut it will have both the means and the motive to exert some influence over China\u2019s conduct \u2014 including in East Asia \u2014 through the global system in which it will play a key role.\u201dJane Perlez reported from Beijing, and Damien Cave from Sydney, Australia.

{"Headline": "John Portman, Architect Who Made Skylines Soar, Dies at 93", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Portman, the architect and developer who revolutionized hotel designs with soaring futuristic atriums, built commercial towers that revitalized the downtowns of decaying postwar American cities and transformed Asian skylines from Shanghai to Mumbai, died on Friday in Atlanta. He was 93.Mr. Portman\u2019s family announced his death. No cause was given.One of the world\u2019s best-known and most influential architects, Mr. Portman, over a half-century, redefined urban landscapes in the United States. He built the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, the Renaissance Center in Detroit and scores of hotel, office and retail complexes in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Fort Worth, San Diego and other cities.His buildings often evoked oohs and aahs from the public, but were not always a hit with critics, who called them concrete islands, self-contained cities within cities \u2014 serving their patrons yet insular, even forbidding to outsiders. But by combining architectural talents with the savvy of a real estate entrepreneur, Mr. Portman was hugely successful and a rarity among contemporaries: both an artist and a tough businessman.In the 1960s and \u201970s, his signature hotels \u2014 skyscrapers with escarpment atriums, cantilevered balconies overlooking interiors big enough to contain the Statue of Liberty, whooshing glass elevators, waterfalls, hanging gardens and revolving rooftop restaurants \u2014 offered thrilling antidotes to the standard lot of dreary hotel lobbies, claustrophobic box elevators and shotgun corridors lined with cells for the inmates.An Atlanta maverick who defied architects\u2019 ethics codes by plunging into real estate development, Mr. Portman, who had no money to start with, made and lost millions of dollars cofinancing many of his own projects. From the 1980s on he designed and built hotels, retail marts and office towers in China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and India \u2014 and more complexes in Europe, the Middle East and the United States.As they proliferated in the United States, Mr. Portman\u2019s atrium hotels, many built for the Hyatt Corporation, were widely imitated by other architects who sought to capitalize on the dizzying exhilaration (some called it terror) of patrons soaring 50 stories in a Buck Rogers glass capsule, or dining under the stars as the city moved in a circle with the galactic night. You did not even have to rent a room.There were setbacks for the atrium concept. The 40-story Hyatt Regency Kansas City, designed by three local architects with an atrium imitating Mr. Portman\u2019s, was the scene of a collapse of two aerial walkways in 1981 during a dance competition in the lobby. The collapse killed 114 people and injured 216 others in one of the nation\u2019s deadliest structural failures.By the late 1980s, with atriums in the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles, the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco, the Marriott Marquis in New York and dozens of others, the design was so common that some motels had what passed for atriums. Travelers were no longer impressed, and critics said Mr. Portman had repeated himself too often.But his atriums were laced into popular culture. In the 1977 film \u201cHigh Anxiety,\u201d Mel Brooks, as an acrophobic psychiatrist facing a sheer drop at the San Francisco Hyatt, inches to his room clinging to the walls. And in a 1993 film, \u201cIn the Line of Fire,\u201d Clint Eastwood\u2019s Secret Service agent outlasts a would-be presidential assassin in a glass elevator at the Los Angeles Bonaventure.As federal support for urban renewal faded in the 1970s, Mr. Portman\u2019s commercial towers were hailed as downtown saviors, bringing back tourists and suburban shoppers, renewing economies and crumbling landscapes. But some failed, and a rising chorus of critics derided his structures as islands of exclusion, paradoxically cut off from the downtowns they were intended to rescue.His Renaissance Center in Detroit was a glaring example. A cluster of four 39-story office buildings and a 73-story hotel with shops, restaurants and theaters was built in the 1970s to save a depressed city. But its gleaming towers on the Detroit River were as remote as a cloud-ringed Disneyland castle. Office workers, visitors and suburban shoppers could drive in and out without ever setting foot downtown.Mr. Portman\u2019s Marriott Marquis Hotel, which opened in a still-seedy Times Square in New York in 1985 with a 45-story atrium and an eighth-floor lobby, was \u201ca cold, grim place,\u201d wrote Paul Goldberger, then The New York Times\u2019s architecture critic. \u201cLike so much of Mr. Portman\u2019s architecture, the hotel is turned almost completely inward; the architect seems interested in urban activity only insofar as it can be canned and packaged within its walls. To the rest of New York, this building turns a harsh concrete wall.\u201dMr. Portman scoffed, arguing that open spaces in congested cities relieved anxieties. Influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright, who harmonized structures with people and surroundings, Mr. Portman said his own buildings, especially hotels, were oases within cities, designed to enhance the experiences of the people who used them.\u201cAnyone can build a building and put rooms in it,\u201d he told The Times in 2011. \u201cBut we should put human beings at the head of our thought processes. You want to hopefully spark their enthusiasm. Like riding in a glass elevator: Everyone talks on a glass elevator. You get on a closed-in elevator, everyone looks down at their shoes. A glass elevator lets people\u2019s spirits expand. Architecture should be a symphony.\u201dColleagues said Mr. Portman, like his buildings, was proudly self-contained. Tall, soft-spoken, with a gentle smile and wavy hair, he worked incessantly, was not given to small talk and never shed his slight air of Old South formality.In a profession that regarded architecture and real estate development as a conflict of interest, he aggressively pursued both, designing buildings while his firm bought property and arranged financing and construction for projects that required partners and millions of dollars from lenders. At first, no hotel chain would touch his ideas. Even in Atlanta, few accepted his vision of a redeemable downtown.But the Peachtree Center in Atlanta was a spectacular success: 14 blocks of office towers, hotels and shopping arcades opened in 1961 with the Merchandise Mart, a wholesale complex that lured hordes of buyers. The Hyatt Regency was built in 1967 to accommodate them. It made Mr. Portman famous, revolutionized hotel construction and spurred Peachtree to completion. It was a key to the downtown renaissance and changed Atlanta\u2019s view of itself.\u201cPortman saw his mission as making the city safe for the middle class,\u201d Mr. Goldberger wrote in 1996, \u201cand he did so almost too well, for he filled Atlanta with buildings that brought a kind of suburban mall mentality to the center of downtown.\u201dJohn Calvin Portman Jr. was born in Walhalla, S.C., on Dec. 4, 1924, to John Calvin and Edna Rochester Portman. His father was a government worker, his mother a beautician. He grew up in Atlanta, where he played football and graduated in 1943 from Tech High School.In 1944, Mr. Portman married Joan Newton. They had six children. Besides his wife, he is survived by four sons, Michael, John C. III, Jeffrey and Jarel; a daughter, Jana Simmons; three sisters, Glenda Dodrill, Anne Davis and Joy Roberts; 19 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by a son, Jae, and two sisters, Mabel Creel and Phyllis Tippet.Mr. Portman attended the United States Naval Academy in 1944 and 1945, then transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in architecture in 1950. After an apprenticeship with an Atlanta architect, he opened his own practice in 1953. He struggled at first, designing drugstores and YMCAs.A growing respect for the hard economic realities of architecture prompted Mr. Portman\u2019s first venture into real estate, financing a small medical building he designed. The deal fell through, but Mr. Portman was convinced that development was the key to success in architecture.In 1956, he and H. Griffith Edwards, a former Georgia Tech professor, became partners. Mr. Portman designed buildings and Mr. Edwards, 20 years older, managed construction until he retired in 1968. They took joint credit for many projects, including the Hyatt Regency Atlanta, Mr. Portman\u2019s creative genesis.In the 1980s, Mr. Portman developed properties in Shanghai, Singapore and South Korea. By the end of the decade, with capital drying up and regulators tightening lending requirements, his empire was $2 billion in debt. He surrendered a controlling interest in the Peachtree Center, the keystone of his holdings.But in 1991, the lenders let him retain most of his properties and provided millions of dollars in new capital in exchange for 8 percent of Mr. Portman\u2019s assets. He was soon on his feet again, completing the huge, multiuse Shanghai Centre and properties in Beijing; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Mumbai, India.Mr. Portman rarely attended public events, though he accepted many awards in person and gave parties for hundreds. He painted abstracts, created sculptures and designed furniture at a beach house he built on Sea Island, Ga. He co-wrote several books, including \u201cThe Architect as Developer\u201d (1976, with Jonathan Barnett), and was the focus of a 2011 documentary by Ben Loeterman, \u201cJohn Portman: A Life of Building.\u201dAt 86, he was still running John Portman & Associates. \u201cA fish got to swim and a bird got to fly,\u201d he told The Times in his Southern Comfort drawl. \u201cI\u2019m here six days a week, and it\u2019d be seven if I didn\u2019t make a commitment to my wife to take a day off.\u201d He never retired.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happened to the American Boomtown?", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe places with the most opportunity used to attract the most new residents, in a cycle of fast-growing cities and rising prosperity. But no more.The places that are booming in size aren\u2019t the economic boomtowns \u2014 the regions with the greatest prosperity and highest productivity. In theory, we\u2019d expect those metros, like the Bay Area, Boston and New York, to be rapidly expanding, as people move from regions with high unemployment and meager wages to those with high salaries and strong job markets. That we\u2019re not seeing such a pattern suggests that something is fundamentally amiss. The magnets aren\u2019t working.The metro areas that offered the highest pay in 2000 have grown by some of the slowest rates since then, while people have flocked to lower-wage metros like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Charlotte, N.C. Similarly, the metros with the highest G.D.P. per capita are barely adding workers relative to much less productive areas. (This chart draws on data about metropolitan statistical areas, which align better with local labor markets than arbitrary city boundaries do. The population chart above uses city data, given that historical metropolitan estimates aren\u2019t available from the census.)Workers moved north during the Great Migration and west out of the Dust Bowl. The lure of the Gold Rush made San Francisco a boomtown after the 1850s. The rise of the auto industry helped triple the size of Detroit between 1910 and 1930. Other Northern cities like Cleveland similarly swelled as they became manufacturing hubs. Los Angeles grew to a city of more than a million in the 1920s as film sets, oil wells and aircraft manufacturing promised opportunity. Seattle boomed after World War II, as Boeing did. Houston\u2019s population took off as it became the center of the country\u2019s energy economy.It\u2019s unrealistic to think that New York or San Francisco could grow today by the same magnitude. It\u2019s much harder for a region to double in size when it already has 10 million people. And the United States is a far more urban country today than it was a century ago, meaning that there are fewer rural residents to pour into cities.To think about it another way: If these highly productive metros would build enough housing, Mr. Schleicher believes that would do more to improve the prospects of American workers and buoy the nation\u2019s economy than proposals like lowering corporate taxes contained in the tax bill the Senate passed last week.\u201cAnd it\u2019s not even close,\u201d Mr. Schleicher wrote in an email. \u201cA policy that aimed at reducing barriers to locational choice would outperform anything in the tax reform bill.\u201dFor the most part, the federal government doesn\u2019t have the power to create that policy. But local cities and suburbs do.Advertisement"}

Conservative activist groups like Americans for Prosperity, celebrating what they expect is the imminent passage of a tax package that they and the Republican Party\u2019s corporate backers have sought for a generation, now need to convince ordinary Americans that this is good for them too.These groups have marshaled their resources in almost every state in a campaign that can sound at times as if it were something a Democrat dreamed up, complete with tributes to the American worker and the middle class.The problem, as Republicans are learning, is that most Americans do not believe that is what the tax plan will do.Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist, said that amid all the talk about the need to score an important victory for their party, \u201cit bears mentioning that the \u2018win\u2019 is something that is extraordinarily unpopular with 75 percent of the American people.\u201dThe tax proposal seems ill fitting for the mood on the right, perhaps explaining some of the skepticism. It would add $1 trillion to the deficit, according to the official congressional scorekeeper, contradicting the calls for fiscal austerity that conservatives made for years under President Barack Obama. And its generosity to corporations and the wealthiest Americans is at odds with the soak-the-rich economic populism President Trump preached during his campaign.But for groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, those in the Kochs\u2019 vast network and others closely aligned with the pro-business wing of the Republican Party, the tax bill would be the only tangible legislative achievement after 11 months of an uneasy and, so far, unproductive alliance with a president they fiercely resisted during last year\u2019s election.The legislation is among the most unpopular public policy initiatives taken up by Congress in recent years, polling shows. A variety of factors is compounding that, Republicans say, from its complexity, to the secrecy and hurriedness of the process to the perception that the benefits will flow largely to a select few.Ken Spain, a Republican consultant who works on financial and tax issues and had worked for the Koch political network, said the legislation has become \u201ca blank canvas\u201d for the opposition to paint and that his party is to blame.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a cohesive messaging strategy to date, and the polling data reflects that,\u201d he added.Americans also see the tax bill as inextricably linked to the Republican Party and Mr. Trump. And majorities of the country deeply disapprove of both.But the discontent runs deeper than an affinity for one party over the other. Not only do a majority of Americans doubt it is good policy, but people in conservative areas of the country have low expectations that it would do anything to help them, new polling has found.Peter D. Hart, the Democratic pollster who helped conduct the NBC/Journal poll, called the tax cut package \u201cpenthouse populism\u201d that risked tarnishing Mr. Trump\u2019s image with those who see him as a \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d crusader fighting powerful and entrenched interests. \u201cThe swamp isn\u2019t only Washington to them,\u201d Mr. Hart added, \u201cit\u2019s Wall Street. It\u2019s the wealthy.\u201dGiven the lack of public appetite, Republicans and the conservative groups working to shift attitudes on the tax proposal have had to fine-tune their messages. Mr. Trump and White House officials, for example, used to often highlight how the tax cuts would spur an uptick in growth.\u201cGrand economic arguments don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the American Action Network, a conservative group that works closely with Republican leaders in Congress. \u201cWhat became clear is that to connect with voters you have to explain what is best for them,\u201d Mr. Bliss added, noting that voter cynicism and mistrust in politics have become increasingly difficult to overcome, even with the strongest messaging.\u201cWhen we say, \u2018This is going to create eight million jobs,\u2019 people don\u2019t believe it. And they don\u2019t care. They care about one job: their job.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity and its field staff and volunteers have hit more than 41,000 homes and made 1.1 million phone calls. In all, the Koch groups have spent $10 million on events, grass roots canvassing and advertising. In Little Havana late last week, the high school students \u2014 for whom the canvassing worked toward their community service requirements for graduation \u2014 were leaving bright orange door hangers behind on each home they visited.\u201cUnrig the Economy,\u201d the signs said, listing the various purported benefits of tax reform: \u201cImprove Lives/Leave More Money in Your Pocket/Create Stronger Job Growth.\u201dSometimes it can be hard to tell if they are making much progress. Enoch Jean-Mary, a junior, said that when he has made phone calls lately, only about two of every 10 people he reaches agree to take a survey on tax reform.But Starla Brown, the Americans for Prosperity Florida grass roots director, insisted she was seeing real enthusiasm. When she spoke to a group of Florida State University students recently, she said, \u201cThere was resounding applause when I brought up tax reform, which was a surprise.\u201dAfter their canvassing ended and the students piled into the back of Ms. Brown\u2019s S.U.V., she started flipping through the channels on her satellite radio, hoping to find an update on the looming Senate vote. The students sat behind her, talking not about taxes but the new iPhone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "8 Highlights From Miami Art Week", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith more than 20 fairs, countless parties and several off-site installations to explore, Miami Art Week is not for the faint of heart. This year, with the opening of ICA Miami, the relaunch of the Bass and Studio Drift\u2019s fleet of 300 drones flying by night, the whole spectacle felt as saturated as ever. Here, your guide on what not to miss \u2014 or, if you\u2019re not making the trip, the things to know about \u2014 in Miami.One could say the same thing about Rottenberg\u2019s videos, which swallow the viewer whole thanks to their unprecedented scale. Staring into the winding Technicolor tunnels featured in \u201cCosmic Generator,\u201d one experiences the fleeting jolt of a roller-coaster ride.A prime example of this philosophy plays out in Converso\u2019s booth, a first-timer at the fair, where an entire living room designed by the iconoclastic California Modernist Albert Frey is on display. The economy and simple lines of the set hint at a focus on the people who inhabit a space \u2014 rather than the objects. Art Basel Miami Beach feels decidedly unpolitical this year, serving up its usual mix of monumental sculptures, loud neons and wall-swallowing paintings by name-brand artists. Thankfully further from the gravitational pull of blue chip dealers like Gagosian and Gavin Brown, these tropes break down and new names emerge. Such is the case at the Pilar Corrias booth, where one can spot the bright, patchy figures of Tschabalala Self, a young painter, whose works starred in the New Museum\u2019s \u201cTrigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon\u201d show this fall.NADA Miami returned to the Ice Palace Studios, a film studio, this year, and the fair\u2019s exhibitors took advantage of the space\u2019s soaring ceilings and roomy corridors by creating booths that feel simultaneously domestic and cinematic. Take, for example, the Detroit-based artist Marie Herwald Hermann, who paired her own sculptural still lifes with a wallpaper by William Morris at fair first-timer Reyes Projects\u2019s booth.Many exhibitors embraced a salon-style approach. Canada stacked up works by both established and emerging painters \u2014 including a new figurative work by Katherine Bradford \u2014 and a small set of broccoli drawings by Adrianne Rubenstein. At the Southfirst booth, small furious drawings line the walls; these images are the output of the groundbreaking filmmaker Joe Gibbons, who spent his time in prison sketching banal scenes and goods sourced from magazines and catalogs.The prevalence of group presentations and gallery partnerships highlights the sense of community that permeates this fair. One feels this collaborative spirit peak at Queer Thoughts and What Pipeline\u2019s booth, where the two galleries came together to celebrate the figurative work of young artists like Quintessa Matranga, Bailey Scieszka and Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings.This intimacy carries into the work on view. Several of the site-specific commissions projects stem from personal narratives, including Fischer Cherry\u2019s installation, \u201cFertility.\u201d Comprising rows and rows of the artist\u2019s grandmother\u2019s crystal dinnerware stuffed with vials and needles, the installation reflects on the artist\u2019s experience going through extensive fertility treatment. \u201cThe entire experience felt like one failure after the next,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I had to make something beautiful, light and uplifting with the leftovers after all the pain and disappointment,\u201d Cherry hopes the piece will allow other hopeful mothers that they are not alone.If the art fair crowds don\u2019t appeal, a trip to the Temple House, designed by the architect Murray Dixon, will cheer you up, thanks to a bubbly installation by the design duo Studio Swine and the Swedish fashion brand COS. When the line first tapped Studio Swine, a collective comprising the artist Alexander Groves and the architect Azusa Murakami, for a collaboration, the duo imagined an installation inspired by nature that would encourage a sense of optimism. Their solution, \u201cNew Spring,\u201d a large tree structure made of recycled material emitting scented bubbles, ticks both boxes.First shown in Milan in a darkened theater, the kinetic sculpture finds a new life in the airy atmosphere of Dixon\u2019s whitewashed space. Groves and Murakami selected the building because of its connection to Miami\u2019s distinctive architecture. \u201cIn Miami, there is this amazing heritage of Art Deco architecture, and we wanted to reflect that in the tree as well,\u201d says Murakami. \u201cThe sculpture is comprised of arches and straight lines, which are always able to change based on the context. We changed the design to reflect back those influences.\u201d In addition to altering the tree\u2019s structure, the duo created five new scents inspired by the city, including a vibrant citrus and a dose of freshly cut grass.The installation is open from Wednesday, Dec. 6 to Sunday, Dec. 10 at the Temple House, 1415 Euclid Ave, Miami Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plan\u2019s Biggest Cuts Could Be in Living Standards", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneBut its conclusions didn\u2019t draw much applause from the White House: In the long term, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis found, the tax cuts would expand the economy by all of 0.7 percent. It never specified what it meant by \u201clong term,\u201d but on the assumption it means a couple of decades, the tax change would add 0.035 percent to annual economic growth over the period.Math and economics have changed little since that exercise.Still, the evidence underscores a not-insignificant weakness in the Republicans\u2019 longstanding economic platform: Tax cuts are not the secret sauce to power the American economy. They have, in fact, very little power to affect economic growth. However strenuously Republicans may argue that tax reform is about increasing economic efficiency, encouraging investment or promoting competitiveness, tax cuts are always primarily about redistribution.That\u2019s because the main effect of tax cuts is in changing how the fruits of economic growth are distributed. This means that for policymakers interested in improving the welfare of the American people, the first and most important item to consider is whose welfare is most worth improving.And this presents an immediate ethical problem. Students of the history of economic thought learn early on that taking money from the poor and the middle class to give to the rich tends to reduce overall welfare for the simple reason that an extra dollar provides much more to those who have few of them than to those already rolling in money. Most conventional proposals to increase general welfare support redistributing in the other direction.There are policies that might trim economic growth and still vastly improve living standards for most Americans. And there are others that might nudge growth ahead and still do more damage than good.\u201cFor mature economies with mature institutions, the difference in growth rates that results from different policies is considerably lower than one might suspect,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe growth effects of tax changes are about an order of magnitude smaller than the distributional effects of tax changes.\u201dAccording to Mr. Furman\u2019s analysis, changes in tax policy since 1986 \u2014 including the Bush tax cuts and increases in taxes in the Clinton and Obama administrations \u2014 altogether raised the after-tax income of the bottom 60 percent of Americans by more than 6.5 percent. Meanwhile, they reduced the income of the 1-percenters at the top by more than 12 percent.The American economy has not been doing great distributing the spoils of growth. Since 1993, the pretax income of the richest 1 percent of Americans has been growing at a steady clip of over 3 percent per year, according to data from Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics. For the bottom 99 percent, income growth has averaged only 0.6 percent per year.Of the world\u2019s seven richest large economies, the United States and Britain have experienced the highest growth in income per person since the mid-1990s. But the United States ranks second from the bottom in the income gains of the poorest fifth of households over the period. And it also fares poorly when it comes to incomes in the middle of the distribution.This lopsided distribution of riches imposes a question on Republicans perpetually pushing for tax cuts on corporations and high-income Americans: What understanding of national welfare justifies the upward redistribution they are proposing? Using growth as a justification seems like a ruse.Mr. Furman\u2019s conclusion is, in the end, fairly dark. Politics won\u2019t be pretty in a world in which policy has little power to improve average living standards and must content itself with slicing and reslicing the economic pie. This is a world of near-zero-sum games, where somebody\u2019s gain means somebody else\u2019s loss. Politics, in this world, is defined by class warfare.And yet reading about Republicans\u2019 latest step in their long march to cut tax rates at the top of the distribution \u2014 redistributing income from the bottom to the top \u2014 I can only agree that that\u2019s the world we live in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plot Behind Saudi Arabia\u2019s Fight With Qatar", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsHowever, this diplomatic spat seems to be more than just an example of Saudi Arabia\u2019s pot calling Qatar\u2019s kettle black. Saudi leaders could be using the conflict, which has resulted in a blockade of Qatar, as a strategic smoke screen to deflect attention from the simmering tension inside their own insular borders.The recently promoted heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as M.B.S., has pledged to modernize the country. His agenda includes diversifying the Saudi economy beyond oil, expanding trade, bolstering employment and loosening restrictions on entertainment. But at least two domestic factors complicate his ambitions, and we may see them play out on the world stage in 2018.Second, M.B.S.\u2019s grand strategic reform plan \u2014 known as Vision 2030 \u2014 is a direct threat to the prestige and power of the established (and reactionary) Wahhabi clergy in Saudi Arabia. The clergy has the clout, and motive, to frustrate his plans. If the economy is opened up to private enterprise, the clergy\u2019s wealth and influence will be diminished, leaving it with fewer resources to maintain its grip on the kingdom. For centuries, the royal family has relied on a pact with the Wahhabi clergy to provide religious legitimacy to the family\u2019s rule. But if modernization erodes the clergy\u2019s authority, how long will its members remain docile?The royal family may therefore have to buy the clerics\u2019 support, or at least their silence. For example, M.B.S. might offer them greater latitude in areas that are less crucial to the economy, such as \u201cda\u2019wah\u201d \u2014 the spreading of Wahhabi Islam. Since 1973, the Saudi government and its semipublic \u201ccharitable\u201d foundations have spent billions of dollars spreading fanatical Wahhabi ideology abroad, and further bolstering da\u2019wah would be bad news for the international community\u2019s anti-radicalization efforts.The Saudi clergy is powerful \u2014 a number of clerics have large social media followings, which provide a direct channel to supporters across the country. Clergy members who are agitating for a political backlash could use these platforms to criticize the aging King Salman, cast doubt on his right to rule and threaten M.B.S.\u2019s modernization agenda. They could also ignite social unrest in a country that has a chronically high youth unemployment rate.The Wahhabis share a worldview with much of the complex network of Islamist and jihadist organizations around the world. Qatar and Turkey \u2014 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Taliban \u2014 will most likely use their connections to a belligerent Saudi clergy to frustrate M.B.S.\u2019s agenda and tarnish his image abroad. In response, the Saudi leadership could seek a bigger external distraction by escalating its conflict with Qatar, just as it did with the invasion of Yemen in 2015.The stakes are high. If M.B.S. succeeds in his modernization efforts, Saudis will benefit from new opportunities and freedoms, and the world will benefit from curtailing the Wahhabi radicalization agenda. A decade from now, the kingdom could look more like the United Arab Emirates, its prosperous and relatively forward-looking neighbor.If M.B.S. fails, Saudi Arabia will relapse into authoritarian theocracy, the tiny advances in women\u2019s rights that have been made since the 1970s will be swept aside and the country will be set back, economically and socially, by decades. Worse, the kingdom\u2019s money and influence will continue to be used to export the extremism that is causing so much upheaval in the rest of the Middle East, as well as in Africa, South Asia and Europe.Middle Eastern politics is regarded by nearly all players as a zero-sum game; to compromise is to bring shame upon one\u2019s family and entire culture. Instead of acquiescing to the gulf states\u2019 ultimatums \u2014 such as requiring that it shut down news organizations and distance itself from groups like the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 Qatar has only deepened its alliances with Iran and Turkey. These forces are already in conflict in Yemen, in what is arguably a proxy war between the region\u2019s Sunni bloc and Iran and its allies. The next obvious battleground will be Syria, where Iran (to say nothing of Russia) stands to be the principal beneficiary of the defeat of the Islamic State. Also in play in the year ahead will be Iraqi Kurdistan.In June, this all seemed like a minor spat between two Arab kingdoms. In 2018, it could spark a much larger conflict.Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and founder of the AHA Foundation, a nonprofit focused on protecting women\u2019s rights that are threatened by cultural and religious practices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As a Must-Pass Republican Tax Bill Headed for the Finish Line, Rubio Saw an Opening", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Republican Party sprinted toward notching its first, and much-needed, significant legislative win in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spied an opening.A longtime champion of the working class, Mr. Rubio had tried in vain to secure a more generous tax break for lower-income Americans as Congress embarked on a sweeping rewrite of the federal tax code. On Thursday, with the hours winding down on a final version of the bill and a frantic push to pass it along party lines in a narrowly-divided Senate, Mr. Rubio took a stand: He threatened to vote no unless House and Senate negotiators expanded the child tax credit.It was a dramatic moment, as those on Capitol Hill and beyond wondered if Mr. Rubio was grandstanding, bluffing or both. But for Mr. Rubio, it was a natural extension of the promise he believes the Republican Party had made, and was in danger of abandoning, to look out for the little guy.\u201cIf you look at all the benefits that are flowing,\u201d particularly to multinational corporations, Mr. Rubio said in a telephone interview, \u201cit was important to be able to go back and do more for working families.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, the message is what it has been for 25 years from both parties \u2014 that is, when push comes to shove, we want your vote, but we\u2019re not that concerned about the working class,\u201d he said.On Friday, Mr. Rubio won an agreement from party leaders to allow families who owe no federal income taxes to still claim up to $1,400 of the $2,000 child tax credit, up from $1,100 that was in the original Senate bill.It was a hard-fought moment for Mr. Rubio, who found himself rebuffed by his own party when he proposed something similar during the initial Senate debate on the legislation. Mr. Rubio had proposed an amendment to slightly increase the corporate tax rate \u2014 to 20.94 from the 20 percent in the Senate bill \u2014 and use the money to pay for a bigger child tax credit.President Trump and White House officials did not support the amendment, Mr. Rubio said, because they were concerned it would endanger the bill\u2019s passage. Nor did the Republican leadership.And Mr. Rubio said he heard from Republican donors who complained that expanding the child tax credit \u201cis welfare, and we\u2019re helping people who don\u2019t work.\u201d To that, he replied: \u201cI think welfare is some of the provisions in this bill for multinational companies who will continue to create jobs abroad and aren\u2019t really American companies.\u201dIn speech after speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Rubio made impassioned arguments for the expansion.\u201cThese are working people, the backbone of our country, the people who have suffered the most over the last 25 or 30 years, as the economy has made some people very profitable but left far too many American workers behind,\u201d he said in one speech earlier this month. \u201cTheir anxieties, their daily concerns, the challenges they are facing really underpin a lot of the anxiety in our country, both electoral, political, and economic.\u201dHis amendment went down in flames, with just a handful of Republicans supporting it.The story could have ended there. But days later, Mr. Trump signaled his willingness to go higher on the corporate rate, and House and Senate negotiators agreed this week to set the rate at 21 percent and lower the tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to 37 percent from 39.6 percent.Mr. Rubio said that irked him.\u201cHow it bugged me is, when I proposed 20.94, the argument was that this would be catastrophic, and this would be anti-growth,\u201d he said. Twenty percent \u201cwas the best thing in the world, but 21 would make it noncompetitive. And yet, 10 days later, 21 was perfectly acceptable.\u201dHe called the expansion of the child credit \u201ca significant step forward,\u201d but said it is only one part of \u201ca broader effort, in my mind, to reform the conservative movement, the Republican Party and our national policies toward being more pro-worker, working family and not just pro-growth.\u201dCritics of Mr. Rubio \u2014 who note that he also threatened to vote against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, before agreeing to vote for it \u2014 say he was posturing, and that the final measure fell far short of what he and Senator Mike Lee, the Utah Republican who also backed expanding the credit, demanded.\u201cTen million children in low-income working families will get nothing from the last-minute changes to the G.O.P. tax bill\u2019s child tax credit increase \u2014 and as a result will get just a token increase of $75 or less per family,\u201d said Chye-Ching Huang, the deputy director of federal tax policy for the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.But Mr. Rubio\u2019s backers say he extracted significant concessions, and note that he has been pushing to expand the child tax credit since he ran for president last year.\u201cHe is not \u2018all of a sudden, at the last minute\u2019 grandstanding,\u201d said Whit Ayres, Mr. Rubio\u2019s pollster. \u201cThis is a consistent cause of his, going back to the presidential campaign and before.\u201dAnd in the interview, Mr. Rubio defended himself, saying he had secured \u201creal money for real people\u201d and that some improvements were better than none.\u201dIt is one of those things,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere you got a lot of what you want and you take it, and you keep working for more in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Plans May Give Your Co-Worker a Better Deal Than You", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn most places, a dollar is a dollar. But in the tax code envisioned by Republicans, the amount you make may be less important than how you make it.Consider two chefs working side by side for the same catering company, doing the same job, for the same hours and the same money. The only difference is that one is an employee, the other an independent contractor.Under the Republican plans, one gets a tax break and the other doesn\u2019t.That\u2019s because for the first time since the United States adopted an income tax, a higher rate would be applied to employee wages and salaries than to income earned by proprietors, partnerships and closely held corporations.\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a tax system where wage earners were substantially penalized\u201d relative to other types of income earners, said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official.So a decorator, an artist or a plumber would have a higher tax rate than an owner of a decorating business, an art shop or a plumbing supply store. A corporate accountant could have a higher rate than a partner in an accounting firm. And under the House bill, which differentiates between active and passive investors, the head of a family business who works 60-hour weeks would have a higher rate than her brother, who doesn\u2019t work there and can spend his days sleeping on the couch.Supporters argue that the revised tax regime is an attempt to update the code to reflect changes in the economy. Rather than depend primarily on individual rate cuts to further power the economy, the Republican plans focus on cutting taxes on certain types of business income. The idea is that these businesses will reinvest those higher returns and stimulate growth.\u201cThis is a radically different approach,\u201d said Fred Goldberg, commissioner of internal revenue under President George Bush.Corporations and other types of businesses get the biggest cuts. Employees don\u2019t.Indeed, economists and tax experts across the political spectrum warn that the proposed system would invite tax avoidance. The more the tax code distinguishes among types of earnings, personal characteristics or economic activities, the greater the incentive to label income artificially, restructure or switch categories in a hunt for lower rates.Expect the best-paid dentists to turn into corporations so that they can take advantage of the new 20 percent corporate tax rate, instead of having to pay a top marginal rate of nearly 40 percent on some of their income. Individual income taxes can be deferred on profits left inside a corporation instead of deposited in a personal account. What\u2019s more, corporations can deduct local and state taxes, which individual filers can\u2019t.Look for a wave of promotions as staff lawyers on salary suddenly turn into partners to qualify for the 23 percent deduction the Senate bestowed on pass-through businesses.Pass-throughs, which range from an ice cream stand to multibillion-dollar operations like Georgia-Pacific (a Koch Industries subsidiary) and Fidelity Investments, don\u2019t pay corporate taxes. Instead they pass through income to their owners or shareholders, who pay taxes at the ordinary rate on their individual returns.Uneven treatment is compounded by other rules that unintentionally introduced preferences.A graph of the rate increase looks as if a skyscraper were plopped in the middle of an open field. That is a powerful incentive to search for tax shelters.At the same time, an unrelated rule that closes a loophole affecting highly paid corporate executives will have the effect of allowing pass-through corporations \u2014 but not traditional corporations \u2014 to deduct compensation over $1 million.That included both earned income \u2014 money generated by a day\u2019s labor \u2014 and what is called unearned income, which includes dividends, interest on bonds, alimony, rent, royalties, licensing fees and pension checks.But despite countless loopholes, exemptions and special breaks in the tax code, there was never a move to single out employee compensation from other earned income.Efforts to simplify the system and move closer to uniform rates were most successfully championed by President Ronald Reagan and congressional Democrats when they sharply lowered individual rates in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Earnings and even long-term investment gains were briefly taxed at the same rate for the top bracket.\u201cThere was a simple notion there,\u201d said C. Eugene Steuerle, a deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy during Mr. Reagan\u2019s second term and now an economist at the Urban Institute. \u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s create a top rate that is as even as we can get it across all sorts of structures and most types of capital income.\u2019\u201d The source didn\u2019t matter.Long-term capital gain rates were again lowered in the 1990s. And the tax code took a major step away from the reform act in 2003 under President George W. Bush when dividends, like long-term capital gains, were taxed at a lower rate than wages.Relative to the Reagan approach, Mr. Steuerle said, the latest Republican bills are \u201cmoving in the opposite direction.\u201dIn some eyes, the message contained in the bills is as disturbing as the practical impediments. Tax codes are as much about values as they are about accounting. And rates and breaks are deployed to encourage or discourage various types of activities.\u201cWage income will be the highest taxed income,\u201d said John L. Buckley, a chief of staff for Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation in the 1990s. That\u2019s what more than 80 percent of working Americans get.\u201cI think it\u2019s grossly unfair.\u201d he added. \u201cSomebody working for a wage gets a higher tax rate than somebody doing the same job under a different legal structure.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified a tax-reduction move made in 2003 under President George W.

Mr. Abe has made liberalizing trade a centerpiece of his economic agenda \u2014 a notable shift in a country that, despite its success exporting cars, electronics and other merchandise, had long shied away from trade deals.The change of direction on trade owes partly to the waning power of Japan\u2019s farm lobby, which has fought to keep tariffs on imported agricultural products high, impeding the country\u2019s ability to strike agreements. Japanese negotiators still focus much of their efforts on protecting farmers, but with Japan\u2019s rural population rapidly aging and shrinking, governments no longer see making concessions on agriculture as politically fatal.The main beneficiaries from the agreement are likely to be Japanese carmakers and European food and beverage producers.The deal will make it easier for European producers of cheese, beef, wine and processed meat to sell in Japan, which imposes duties of as much as 40 percent on some products. European makers of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and trains are also expected to come out ahead.The pact also presents Japanese carmakers with an opportunity to increase sales in Europe, which has long been difficult for them. Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers have only a 13 percent share of the auto market in the European Union, in part because of import tariffs, compared to the United States where they account for about 40 percent.But Japan\u2019s carmakers already have major manufacturing operations in Europe which are not subject to import duties, suggesting that their meager sales also stem from lack of products that appeal to European tastes.While the pact will be important for some industries, said Angel Talavera, senior eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in Britain, its overall economic impact will be modest.The deal \u201cdoes not materially alter the outlook for the eurozone, as Japan represents only around 2 percent of total exports,\u201d Mr. Talavera said in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a game changer.\u201dJonathan Soble contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Next After the Repeal of Net Neutrality", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere is a guide to what will happen next:Consumers will probably not encounter immediate changes to their internet service. The biggest broadband companies, like Comcast and AT&T, have promised that consumers will not see a change in how they experience the web. And with such a big spotlight on them, the companies will probably be careful about changing service plans, partly to avoid angering customers and attracting lawmakers\u2019 attention.Broadband companies are \u201clikely to proceed cautiously pending final resolution of these legal challenges,\u201d said John Beahn, a regulatory lawyer at Skadden, Arps, who does not have clients with interests in net neutrality. \u201cThey recognize the ultimate fate of the regulations is still far from certain at this point.\u201dOne Republican commissioner, Mike O\u2019Rielly, said he supported some forms of paid prioritization, which could open the door for an internet model more like cable television, with different price tiers for certain websites.To be sure, there are programs that consumers may like. AT&T already offers its customers free streaming of DirecTV, which it owns. Other carriers like T-Mobile offer free streaming of apps like YouTube and Netflix, a practice known as \u201czero-rating,\u201d which at one time was viewed as a potential net neutrality violation. More programs like that could come along.But it\u2019s hard to see prices going down for internet service because of the end of net neutrality. Many economists say the only way prices could fall is through more competition in the broadband industry, which is now dominated by a handful of companies.The net neutrality rules, passed in 2015 during the Obama administration, were intended to be a protective measure for consumers as more Americans migrated to the internet for communications. The regulations were also meant to make sure new and small companies, as well as media companies, could sell their goods and distribute information without restrictions from broadband companies.Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the F.C.C., said transparency would act as the primary measure against wrongdoing. The agency will require broadband companies to disclose if they are blocking or throttling or setting up fast lanes for certain traffic. Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated to the chairmanship by President Trump, said that the disclosure would give consumers full knowledge of what they would be getting into and that if they didn\u2019t like the practices, they could switch providers.As part of the changes approved on Thursday, the F.C.C. handed oversight duties for the broadband carriers to the Federal Trade Commission. The F.C.C. said the F.T.C.\u2019s broad antitrust and consumer protection laws were best suited to stop any harmful business practices. The F.T.C. has to monitor nearly every sector of the economy and is most likely to go after alleged bad actors when they are brought forward in a complaint, a costly and time-consuming process.Comcast, AT&T and the major trade groups for broadband and cable providers say they don\u2019t and will not block or throttle sites. They say they won\u2019t engage in most forms of paid prioritization, the practice of charging sites more for faster delivery of streams and downloads.With legal challenges against the F.C.C. expected, many telecom experts say that the companies will largely to stick to those promises for at least the next year and that any changes to service will be subtle.The net neutrality debate has flared up multiple times over the last decade or so, ending in different places depending on the political party in power.Many Democrats on Capitol Hill have called for passing the Obama-era rules through legislation, instead of leaving the rule making in the hands of the F.C.C. Numerous Republicans have also suggested passing a law, though they generally argue for much lighter restrictions than the 2015 rules. Some Democratic lawmakers have also said they would overturn the F.C.C. action through a congressional review act, which would require a majority vote to abolish new agency rules. Given the Republican control in Washington, and the general gridlock in Washington, any sort of legislative resolution appears unlikely.Most certainly, there will be lawsuits, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition and by several state attorneys general, including those from New York and Pennsylvania. The suits are expected to be filed after the rules become official, which could be well into January or later.Lawsuits will most likely claim, perhaps among other things, that the F.C.C. acted hastily and capriciously by abandoning the rules just two years after they were created. For instance, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has said the F.C.C. should have delayed its vote on the ground that the law enforcement office found many public comments on net neutrality were fraudulent.It will probably argue that rolling back rules essentially returns the regulatory environment to the way it was before 2015, when there was little evidence of consumer harm.The agency is also likely to argue that it followed all the necessary procedures for making a regulatory change. The plan to overturn net neutrality was first announced in April by Mr. Pai.In a news conference on Thursday, after he had won the vote to overturn the rules, Mr. Pai said he was prepared for the legal challenges, using a tone of defiance and some sarcasm.\u201cI\u2019m shocked, shocked, that people are going to challenge this decision in court,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Will Let Its 1.4 Million Workers Take Their Pay Before Payday", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, Walmart has taken heat for how it treats its work force, including paying low wages and creating unpredictable schedules. Now, the giant retailer is trying to ease some of its workers\u2019 financial strain, allowing them to receive wages before their next payday.Instead of waiting two weeks between paychecks, Walmart workers can now use an app to access a portion of wages for hours they have already worked.But Walmart\u2019s new service also highlights, albeit unwittingly, the financial struggles of the low-wage workers in the retail and service industries. Even as the economy strengthens, many workers in stores and restaurants are not earning enough to make ends meet.Walmart said the new initiative is intended to help workers avoid costly payday loans and other debt traps, and reduce the stress that comes with financial hardship.Workers who are less worried about cash issues \u201cfeel more confident and more settled at work,\u201d Judith McKenna, Walmart\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview.\u201cWe believe this is the right thing to do, and we are happy to champion it,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Labor groups say the best investment Walmart could make is not in a new app, but in increasing pay.\u201cIt sounds like this may be a useful service but it doesn\u2019t tackle the fundamental problem Walmart workers suffer,\u201d said Paul Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group. \u201cTheir paychecks are too small.\u201dThe minimum starting wage at Walmart is $9 an hour, which is $1.75 higher than the federal minimum wage. But it is lower than the starting wage at retailers like Costco, which pays $13 an hour, and Target, which recently raised its entry-level wage to $11 an hour.The average hourly wage for a full-time Walmart worker is $13.85, while the average hourly wage at Costco is about $24.50.Walmart executives say that raising wages alone will not solve the problems many Americans have managing their cash flow. Rather, the company says, the new service is meant to help workers with the broader issues of financial management.The app, called Even, has been used by other employers, but never on such a large scale as Walmart.With the new service, every Walmart employee can obtain a portion of his or her earned wages eight times a year free of charge. For most of the workers, the so-called Instapays will be deducted from their next paycheck. The workers can pay extra if they want more than eight Instapays.Alexis Adderley, who works nights in a Walmart distribution center in Fort Pierce, Fla., has started using the Even app as part of a pilot program.At first she was suspicious, she said, that the app was yet another in a long line of financial products like payday advances and \u201coverdraft protection\u201d that end up driving low-income workers deeper into a hole.But Ms. Adderley, the mother of boys ages 8, 7, 4 and 2, said she had been pleasantly surprised.The app, which connects to her bank account, calculates how much she pays for housing, food and phone bills and tracks when she makes big monthly payments. With that data, Even provides Ms. Adderley a real-time estimate of how much she has to spend before payday.She earns $19.25 an hour, more than the average Walmart employee, and works 30 hours a week. But money is still tight, especially since she was forced to leave her home after Hurricane Irma. Earlier this week, the app warned Ms. Adderley, 30, that she had only enough money to safely spend $9.08 before her next paycheck.\u201cI would love to save more,\u201d she said.These partnerships reflect Walmart\u2019s broader effort to make inroads in Silicon Valley, where the old-line retailer is seeking to acquire talent and ideas to increase its digital heft in its battle with Amazon.Before creating Even, one of the firm\u2019s founders, Jon Schlossberg, had developed an app called Knock, which allows phone users to unlock a Mac computer by knocking on their phone.Idealistic and flush with money from the success of Knock, Mr. Schlossberg said he began studying how a cash shortage affects people\u2019s physical and mental well-being.\u201cIt is a fundamental problem with the capitalistic society,\u201d Mr. Schlossberg said in an interview.Mr. Schlossberg, 30, said he set out to create a product that could reduce the stress associated with money problems, joining a crowd of other so-called fintech start-ups seeking to disrupt the traditional banking model.Walmart pays a small fee to Even to allow workers to withdraw their wages ahead of payday. Workers can take out only a portion of wages that they have already earned during the two-week pay cycle \u2014 so technically, Even says, these are not loans.\u201cYou have earned this money,\u201d said Safwan Shah, founder of PayActiv. \u201cWho decides you should get paid every two weeks?\u201dFor years, consumer advocates and regulators have warned about the dangers of using high-interest loans to pay for unexpected expenses.Walmart workers will not be charged interest if they opt to obtain their wages in advance. But getting paid early, while it may solve an emergency cash shortage, will leave the workers with less money on payday.\u201cIt is still going to be a struggle for most people,\u201d said Alex Horowitz, a senior researcher at the Pew Charitable Trusts who focuses on consumer finance.Matt Fixel, 29, a Walmart worker in Tucson, lives on the financial edge. He works part time earning $10.20 an hour unloading trucks and stocking shelves. When he ran into trouble paying rent one month, he overdrew his bank account, incurring huge fees. Unable to obtain a credit card because \u201chis credit is just shot,\u201d Mr. Fixel pays for services like Hulu with gift cards.\u201cThat app sounds helpful,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Fixel said of the Even service, but added, \u201cI would prefer it if they gave me more hours.\u201dMs. McKenna said Walmart was making a \u201creasonably substantial investment\u201d in paying for the Even service for its employees. The company raised starting wages nearly three years ago, and Ms. McKenna pointed out that Walmart has also increased employee training programs that aim to advance workers into management, where they can earn more.\u201cWe continue to look at investing in our associates,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Economic Policies Put Business First", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican tax bill headed for President Trump\u2019s desk is the most ambitious test yet of his approach to economic policy \u2014 that his ideas for strengthening American business will increase the prosperity of the American people.Mr. Trump championed the plan to cut corporate and individual taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, forgoing revenue that could have been spent on new roads, worker training or better schools, on the theory that investors will make better use of the money, creating wealth for all Americans.And bolstering business in the United States is the guiding principle of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to trade \u2014 although his vision of what will help companies competing in a global economy differs sharply from the perspectives of many corporate executives. Mr. Trump, whose worldview is that exports strengthen the economy while imports drain away the nation\u2019s wealth, wants to erect tariffs and other trade barriers to protect American companies from foreign competition, arguing that will translate into more and better-paying jobs.In recent decades, the two political parties pursued economic policies focused on helping people directly. Republicans championed lower income taxes; Democrats emphasized expansion of the social safety net. Both parties sought to improve education through regulation and subsidies.And presidents from the two parties backed trade deals that sacrificed manufacturing jobs for a wave of imports that let consumers buy televisions, furniture and clothing at lower prices.Mr. Trump has substituted a singular focus: increasing the output of the United States economy.His political opponents, and some of his allies, have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s economic views as inconsistent. Some Democrats embrace Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns about trade deals while they bitterly oppose the tax bill and regulatory rollbacks. Republicans have welcomed his advocacy for tax cuts as some bemoan his protectionist approach to trade.But Mr. Trump sees tax cuts and trade restrictions as tools in the service of the same goal.\u201cI think a rising tide does lift all boats,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cYou increase incentives for broad categories of things, like investment and labor supply, and you kind of let the economy do its thing.\u201d\u201cWe think the country\u2019s been underperforming, and we believe this will get the country performing better,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said this month.\u201cIt\u2019s not tax reform,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said of the tax bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a heist.\u201dIt also provides little direct benefit to the one-quarter of households that do not make enough money to pay federal income taxes but are still required to make payroll tax payments. In previous tax overhauls, Republicans supported expansions of the earned-income tax credit \u2014 a cash subsidy that offsets payroll taxation. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, proposed a new expansion, but in a sign of the shift in party priorities, Republicans set aside the idea to allow larger business tax cuts. The final bill does increase a refundable credit for families with children.Mr. Moynihan said his company might expand its branch network in a wider range of cities, which would be a shift from its current approach. Bank of America has closed more than 1,600 branches over the last decade in response to tighter regulation, slower growth and the rise of online banking.Notably, the tax bill takes aim at the more traditional approach to economic development by reducing incentives for investment in infrastructure and education.The broadest change limits the federal deduction for state and local income taxes paid to $10,000, putting pressure on state and local governments to cut taxes and spending to compensate for the lost tax break.The legislation ends a popular program that provided tax credits to investors in public works projects like transportation, renewable energy and school construction.It reduces tax incentives for spending on research and development.\u201cIf you had to ask what makes Silicon Valley a global economic leader, it\u2019s not California\u2019s low taxes and low regulation,\u201d said Jason Furman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cThis bill is absolutely designed to undermine the sources of America\u2019s competitiveness. I can\u2019t put a number on it, but if you ask what the economic impact is, it\u2019s going to be negative.\u201dMr. Trump is pursuing a similar shift in regulation, seeking to reverse or rewrite a host of rules intended to protect workers and consumers, under the theory that freeing companies from \u201cred tape\u201d will allow businesses to prosper, with wide-ranging benefits.In remarks at the White House last week, Mr. Trump argued that regulation was impeding private investment in infrastructure. He held up a long, multicolored chart that he said reflected the permitting process for the construction of \u201ca highway or a roadway.\u201d\u201cBy the time you finished, you probably gave up,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The Obama administration also sought to strengthen the social safety net, which helps workers maintain a minimum quality of life, most notably through the Affordable Care Act, which makes it easier for workers to obtain and maintain health insurance, even if they shift jobs. The Trump administration is seeking to reverse that legislation. Mr. Trump and congressional leaders also have said they are planning a broader overhaul of social welfare programs.Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to trade policy is similarly focused on businesses.The administration\u2019s proposed budget, released this year, would cut funding for a variety of retraining programs that help workers who lose jobs to foreign competition \u2014 the solution long advocated by economists and politicians of both parties to help workers adjust to globalization.Instead, Mr. Trump has emphasized the importance of protecting and expanding old-line industries like coal, cars and steel. The administration asserts that expanding the industrial sector will create high-paying, blue-collar jobs, and that it is more important for workers to have good jobs than for consumers to be able to buy cheaper imported food, clothes and cars.It is a crucial reason that the administration is weighing tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum, solar products and washing machines. And why the administration is seeking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement in favor of American companies, a trade pact that Mr. Trump has threatened to abandon if Canada and Mexico do not accept major changes, like a proposal requiring a higher percentage of automobile components to be made in the United States.Many business leaders see tariffs as tax increases, and trade rules as just another kind of burdensome regulation. And many companies depend on foreign suppliers to hold down their productions costs, allowing them to compete with foreign rivals.\u201cIn industry after industry, many of the most successful American businesses are worked into global supply chains,\u201d said Phil Levy, a former trade adviser in Mr. Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cHaving low trade barriers can be as important to them as having low taxes.\u201dFor Mr. Trump, however, lower taxes and higher tariffs serve the same purpose: fortifying the United States economy in what he sees as a zero-sum competition among nations.He has said since the start of his presidential campaign that his proposals would revive America\u2019s fortunes and turn around a country he sees falling behind as a result of wrongheaded economic policies that have put United States companies at a disadvantage.In recent weeks, he has predicted that his tax cuts will provide rocket fuel for the economy and that economic growth could reach 6 percent a year \u2014 three times the average pace since the 2008 financial crisis.Mainstream economic forecasters regard such forecasts as fanciful. With the passage of the tax plan, Mr. Trump has won the chance to find out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are We an Invasive Species? Plus, Other Burning Climate Questions", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cEvery single person in the room agreed, humans are the worst invasive species,\u201d said Daniel Simberloff, a professor of environmental science at the University of Tennessee, who was at the meeting. \u201cBut the I.U.C.N. disagreed.\u201d Homo sapiens, which has colonized and deforested much of the Earth and pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to change its climate, was excluded from the list. On this point, ecologists agree. \u201cWe have had by far the most transformative and negative impact on this planet,\u201d said Matthew Palmer, a senior lecturer in ecology at Columbia University. \u201cIn that regard, we\u2019re the ultimate invaders.\u201dThe problem with that analogy is that the glaciers, unlike the ice in the glass, aren\u2019t on the water yet. The melting ice sheets that concern scientists are on land, not in the ocean.As the climate warms, those ice sheets melt into the surrounding seas. It\u2019s like taking ice cubes from the freezer and plunking them into an already-full glass of water: the cup will overflow. This is why sea levels rise as glaciers melt.Keep in mind that melting glaciers aren\u2019t the only cause of sea level rise. Warm water occupies more space than cooler water, a physics concept known as thermal expansion. As temperatures rise, water molecules expand, also contributing to sea level rise. Studies suggest that much of the rise in sea level we\u2019ve seen since the 1880s is the result of thermal expansion.According to Maureen Raymo, a paleoclimatologist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, if we don\u2019t reduce greenhouse gas emissions it would still take somewhere more than several centuries \u2014 but less than 10,000 years \u2014 for the polar ice caps to fully melt. But as some people living in low-lying regions can attest, humans are already beginning to feel the impacts of sea level rise.\u2014 Kristin Close, Norwich, Vt.Extensive use of biofuels could produce much more significant reductions. Conventional fuel is made from oil; when it is burned it adds ancient carbon back into the atmosphere. Biofuels are made from plants, and when burned release carbon dioxide that the plants absorbed while growing, so net emissions are much lower.Another approach would be to eliminate jet engines altogether in favor of electric motors that could be powered by renewable energy. But at this point, the weight-to-power ratio of such alternative designs is problematic.Batteries, or hybrid systems that couple batteries with an engine that could charge them, hold more promise. NASA and a few start-ups are designing and in some cases building prototypes of small, battery-powered planes. But large electric airliners are a long way off, if they ever become reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cyril Ramaphosa Wins A.N.C. Leadership Battle in South Africa", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG \u2014 In a humbling rebuke to President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, the African National Congress chose an anti-apartheid hero and business tycoon as its new leader on Monday, positioning him to become Mr. Zuma\u2019s successor.The vote also amounted to a rejection of Mr. Zuma, who had backed the other main contender, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a veteran politician and Mr. Zuma\u2019s former wife.Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s victory amounts to a victory for reformers in the A.N.C., which wants to root out corruption and woo back foreign investors. Ms. Dlamini-Zuma had promised the radical economic transformation her former husband had never delivered.But as a wealthy member of Mr. Zuma\u2019s government who was largely silent in the face of cronyism and corruption, Mr. Ramaphosa is seen by critics as more a creature of that system than an honest broker and corruption fighter.\u201cRamaphosa doesn\u2019t have a reputation for being gung-ho,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of muscleman politician that will go in and clean up. He\u2019s more of a conciliator and bridge mender. There are all these wild expectations now.\u201dBesides the presidency vote, delegates voted on five other top party positions. The total six posts were evenly split between the two factions, indicating that Mr. Ramaphosa will still need to negotiate and compromise with Mr. Zuma\u2019s allies, Mr. Friedman said.Mr. Zuma, who will cease to be party leader this week but whose term as the country\u2019s president does not end until 2019, will leave his successor a number of problems, but one above all: a once-heroic liberation party that has now become associated with graft, cronyism and incompetence and that has been losing core supporters.As delegates waited for the official results to be announced Monday evening at a national conference in Johannesburg, Mr. Ramaphosa could be seen joyfully greeting and hugging well-wishers on the stage, and posing for selfies. Ms. Dlamini-Zuma mostly sat expressionless. President Zuma sat sipping from a cup of tea.As expectations of a Ramaphosa victory heightened, South Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, gained sharply \u2014 reflecting the business community\u2019s preference for him. Senior political figures began posting congratulatory messages to Mr. Ramaphosa on Twitter.When the results were finally announced, Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s supporters erupted in celebration while his rival\u2019s backers sat in stony silence \u2014 evidence of the wide divide that the new party leader will have to bridge.With his victory on Monday, Mr. Ramaphosa is almost certain to become South Africa\u2019s next president, thanks to the A.N.C.\u2019s dominance in Parliament, which chooses the nation\u2019s leader. A Ramaphosa victory, experts and allies have said, will strengthen the A.N.C. before the elections in 2019.\u201cHe\u2019s always been, in his history, an incredibly smart negotiator,\u201d said Barbara Hogan, an anti-apartheid veteran who served in Mr. Zuma\u2019s cabinet for two years and supported Mr. Ramaphosa. \u201cHe\u2019s always got the long view in mind.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not the type who would smash an organization for his own ego,\u201d Ms. Hogan added, alluding to Mr. Zuma, who some say put his own interests above the party\u2019s.Largely because of older black voters who intimately remember the A.N.C.\u2019s heroic past, the party is still considered the favorite to win the next general election. But party leaders have been alarmed at the A.N.C.\u2019s rapid decline and Mr. Zuma is so widely discredited that party leaders could replace him with Mr. Ramaphosa before the 2019 elections to improve the A.N.C.\u2019s chances.A.N.C. officials are hopeful the party can regain its previous stature under Mr. Ramaphosa, whose core supporters are precisely in those categories \u2014 city dwellers and business owners, along with the black middle class \u2014 that had begun to drift away.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be relegated to a rural party,\u201d Gwede Mantashe, the A.N.C.\u2019s secretary general and a Ramaphosa ally, said as voting was taking place on Monday. \u201cWe want to regain the metros and be a strong A.N.C.\u201dThe two contenders embodied opposing strains in the A.N.C., the heroic 105-year-old liberation movement that, in recent elections, clung increasingly to its glorious past to bring voters to the ballot box.A skilled union organizer, Mr. Ramaphosa served as Mr. Mandela\u2019s key negotiator in the talks that led \u2014 peacefully, against many odds \u2014 to the end of apartheid in 1994.He was Mr. Mandela\u2019s choice to become deputy president and eventually his successor as the nation\u2019s leader. But the powerful coterie of anti-apartheid leaders in exile pressed successfully for Thabo Mbeki.Mr. Ramaphosa turned down Mr. Mandela\u2019s offer to become foreign minister and eventually entered the private sector, though he remained on the A.N.C.\u2019s national executive committee.Using his ties to the party, Mr. Ramaphosa quickly became one of the richest businessmen in the country and on the continent. He acquired interests in many areas, including South Africa\u2019s McDonald\u2019s restaurants, and served on a multitude of corporate boards.\u201cThe terrible events that have unfolded cannot be described as a labor dispute,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa wrote in an internal email after the first 10 strikers had been killed. \u201cThey are plainly dastardly criminal and must be characterized as such. In line with this characterization, there needs to be concomitant action to address this situation.\u201dTo many, Mr. Ramaphosa became the symbol of an A.N.C. elite that had enriched itself by betraying the people it had once promised to serve. In another episode in 2012, Mr. Ramaphosa was widely criticized for bidding $2 million for a prize buffalo cow at a livestock auction.That same year, Mr. Ramaphosa returned to politics, and he has served since 2014 as deputy president under Mr. Zuma. Mr. Ramaphosa supported Mr. Zuma, staying largely silent as the president\u2019s ethical problems and erratic policies damaged the economy.But to others, it is not yet clear that an insider can dismantle the very system that so richly rewarded him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beijing Bids Goodbye to Robert Mugabe", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyAs the line of Chinese-made armored vehicles rumbled into Harare last month, Zimbabwe\u2019s 93-year-old dictator, Robert Mugabe, must have wondered what happened to the \u201call-weather friendship\u201d Beijing always said they shared. For nearly four decades, Mugabe had been one of China\u2019s staunchest allies. His \u201cLook East\u201d policy signaled Africa\u2019s economic shift away from the West toward the rising superpower. Yet as the bloodless coup against him unfolded, Beijing offered no words of support or sympathy. Instead, there was silence \u2014 until afterward, when President Xi Jinping of China rushed to congratulate Mugabe\u2019s successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa.The circumstances surrounding the end of Mugabe\u2019s 37-year reign are the stuff of spy novels: a high-level meeting in Beijing four days earlier, the armed showdown at Harare airport, the old dictator\u2019s last-ditch attempt to assert his authority. But the episode also tells a tale of China\u2019s evolving relationship with the world it is shaping through loans, trade and investments. In an era when the United States seems to be on the retreat \u2014 notice the absence of Americans from this story \u2014 it can be easy to shrug off China\u2019s advance as another instance of its rapid, ineluctable expansion. But the fall of Mugabe, a charismatic despot who drove his economy to ruin, shows how Beijing is learning to navigate, very carefully, through turbulent transitions in places where it has deep economic ties, sometimes decades old, and how countries bend to the arc of China\u2019s gravity.Mugabe is among the last of a dying breed, a revolutionary hero whose relationship with China was forged in Africa\u2019s anticolonial struggle and shifted over time into an economic and diplomatic partnership. When the West issued sanctions against Mugabe\u2019s government in the early 2000s for a multitude of sins \u2014 human rights abuses, violent farm invasions, electoral fraud \u2014 China defended its ally and poured money into Zimbabwe\u2019s diamond mines and tobacco farms. It supplied weapons and fighter jets, roads and electricity plants. At a packed rally in the Chinese-built national stadium in Harare, Mugabe exulted: \u201cWe have turned East, where the sun rises, and given our backs to the West, where the sun sets.\u201dIt seemed that the sun would never set on Mugabe, even as he exploited his citizens and presided over the economy\u2019s destruction. In 2009, after a bout of hyperinflation so bad that the government printed $100 trillion notes that couldn\u2019t even pay for a loaf of bread, Zimbabwe abandoned its currency and adopted the U.S. dollar as the principal means of exchange. Even so, in 2015, President Xi made a state visit to Zimbabwe, lavishing praise on Mugabe and pledging $4 billion in energy projects. Reciprocating the good will, Mugabe made a move that would flatter Beijing\u2019s global ambition: Zimbabwe announced that it would become the first foreign country to accept the Chinese yuan as an official currency.For China, there loomed a bigger danger and opportunity: the long-awaited political transition. As the nonagenarian Mugabe approached the end of his term in 2018, China feared chaos. But after decades of waiting, it hoped to push a freer investment climate that would open up Zimbabwe\u2019s abundant mineral resources. As a one-party state, China has preferred to deal with ruling parties and their often-authoritarian leaders \u2014 and to hope that these old friends never pass from the scene, like the Communist Party itself. The \u201cwake-up call,\u201d says Yun Sun, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, came in Libya with the fall of the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. China was heavily invested in Libya \u2014 it imported 10 percent of the country\u2019s oil supply \u2014 but blindsided by the revolt against its ally. During the turmoil, more than 30,000 Chinese workers had to be airlifted out of Libya, and China lost billions of dollars\u2019 worth of investments and loans.Elsewhere, China\u2019s sheer size could pull wayward countries back into its orbit. In Zambia, the poor treatment of workers at Chinese-run copper mines provoked a national outcry. The populist Michael Sata ran for the presidency in 2006 on an anti-Chinese platform, vowing to prevent Zambia from becoming a \u201cdumping ground\u201d for Chinese workers. His defeat led to the first anti-Chinese riots in Africa. Five years later, Sata again whipped up anger at Chinese \u201cprofiteers\u201d and won the presidency easily. Once in office, however, the old firebrand mellowed. He was soon a compliant partner with Beijing \u2014 a sign, perhaps, that China\u2019s influence on the Zambian economy had become so vital that fighting against it would be too costly.The situation was different in Zimbabwe, where the uncertainty over succession spawned two sides vying for China\u2019s favor. Mugabe\u2019s heir apparent was Vice President Mnangagwa, a former security chief who trained as a guerrilla in China in the 1960s and earned the nickname \u201cCrocodile.\u201d Mugabe, however, wanted to hand the reins over to his 52-year-old wife, Grace, who studied in China. Last month, when Mnangagwa threatened to stop her, Mugabe fired him. As the Crocodile went into hiding, Zimbabwe\u2019s army chief, his ally, flew to Beijing for an official visit with top military leaders. Barely four days after he returned to Zimbabwe, the coup was underway.Suspicions about Beijing\u2019s role in the takeover were only magnified when, in his first week in office, Mnangagwa relaxed the \u201cindigenization\u201d law \u2014 and signed a $153 million loan agreement with China. Beijing, citing its official policy of noninterference, vehemently denies any involvement in the coup. And indeed, such subterfuge seems more in line with past actions of the United States, which secretly helped topple governments from Iran to Chile during the 20th century. But even if Chinese officials told Zimbabwe\u2019s army chief in Beijing they merely hoped for a more stable investment environment, this could still be regarded as the first coup d\u2019\u00e9tat carried out with the tacit approval of the 21st century\u2019s emerging superpower.The coins themselves were symbols of monetary might. First introduced in the 3rd century B.C. by China\u2019s first emperor, the uniform copper coin served as an instrument for China\u2019s unification and later its expanding power. The round coins had square holes so they could be strung into belts of a thousand. The belts got so heavy that Chinese merchants in the 9th century began depositing them in one place in return for a paper receipt. They called it fei qian, or \u201cflying money.\u201d When Marco Polo returned from his travels to China in the 13th century, his tales of paper money were met with disbelief. Europe would not have anything similar until the late 1600s.When Mugabe promised to make the Chinese yuan an official currency, it was mostly a symbolic gesture. There, as in many of the world\u2019s poorest countries, the U.S. dollar reigns supreme, despite almost no American presence. But Chinese economic power is starting to challenge that status. Beijing\u2019s push to internationalize the yuan is motivated by more than vanity. A yuan that circulates more widely would spur Chinese trade, reduce its dependence on dollar holdings and enhance its geopolitical influence. The yuan is hampered by restrictions on its trade on foreign-\u200bexchange markets; Beijing fears that full convertibility would trigger capital flight. Even so, the yuan\u2019s rise is beginning ever so slightly to nudge the system of global currencies away from the U.S. dollar. Last year, the International Monetary Fund added the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies. According to the Bank of China, as of last year, more than two dozen countries were accepting the yuan as a reserve currency, including six in Africa.The American economy surpassed the British economy in size in 1872, but it took the dollar another 73 years to displace the British pound, at the end of World War II. Over the past decades, there have been other contenders and pretenders: the yen, the mark, the euro. But given its rapid rise \u2014 and its acceptance in distant parts of Africa \u2014 the yuan might be in the best position to catch the dollar. It may take decades, even centuries. But China, it should be clear by now, is in it for the very long haul.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Republican Party in the Age of Trump", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:Mr. Brooks\u2019s excellent column doesn\u2019t just indict the current Republican leadership. It also eulogizes traditions of honor, patriotism and compromise that both parties once held in common. Democrats can pick up the flag that the current crop of opportunists and careerists have trampled in the mud. To carry that flag effectively, though, they need to identify a leader, and an idea, that can help us recover from our current national sickness. And they need to do it soon.To the Editor:David Brooks says Republicans are realizing that they are \u201cpolitically homeless.\u201d Nonsense. As a proud former Republican, I can say I have a political home. I am now a Democrat. It is that simple.To the Editor:David Brooks\u2019s column represents a sea change from his usual intellectual discourse about needed changes for our country. Instead he has devolved into parroting the hate monologues spewed by the likes of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer that make the president ineffective in his attempts to rescue our nation from the ravages of the prior administration.President Trump is attempting to bring our nation out of the trend toward fostering dependence on government that ultimately destroys attitudes of individual responsibility. This movement requires a radical change from what has transpired over the last eight years, similar to the transition under Ronald Reagan that brought us out of the Jimmy Carter years of a declining nation.I do not like some of President Trump\u2019s rhetoric, but his agenda is worthy of our support.To the Editor:Scathing as David Brooks is in his appraisal of the present-day Republican Party \u2014 and I applaud him for it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t go far enough. Because if he\u2019s right in his prediction that the G.O.P. will ultimately accept President Trump\u2019s firing of Robert Mueller along with everything else it has thus far seen fit to accept, then it won\u2019t be just the G.O.P. that\u2019s \u201crotting.\u201d It will be American democracy itself.NANCY STARK, NEW YORKTo the Editor:David Brooks\u2019s column serves as a devastating account of the collapse of the Republican Party under a president who has shown disdain for the Constitution, incompetence and lack of a moral compass.The G.O.P.\u2019s broad acceptance of President Trump reminds me of the Know-Nothing Party of the 1850s. The Know-Nothings, a secretive third party, ignited riots and torched churches yet captured about 50 seats in Congress and a few governorships with their virulent opposition to immigrants from Ireland and Germany.So many Republicans today, with their blindness to Russian intervention, sexual misconduct and a cruel tax bill, are invoking the same ignorance and acceptance of bigotry and fraudulent activity of that earlier remnant of the G.O.P.FRED HILL, BALTIMORETo the Editor:Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein are right when they argue that the Republican Party \u201chas done unique, extensive, and possibly irreparable damage to the American political system.\u201d A party over which the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Fox News hold considerable sway is seriously ill.\u201cThe Republican Party must reclaim its purpose,\u201d Mr. Mann and Mr. Ornstein conclude. It is a noble sentiment, but appeals to responsibility and genuine patriotism are inadequate. After all, relatively few prominent Republicans have found the courage to stand against President Trump and Trumpism. And yet our democratic system requires two healthy parties.What to do? The only apparent solution is to ask millions of Democrats and independents to vote in Republican primaries (which in many states would requiring registering as Republican). Putting aside ideology for this limited purpose, they should vote for candidates who honor truth, denounce bigotry, defend the rule of law, and refrain from demonizing those with whom they have honest policy disagreements.These Democrats and independents may, of course, vote for Democrats in the general election, but by lending a hand to responsible candidates in Republican primaries, they may help restore that party \u2014 and our nation \u2014 to health.CARL T. BOGUS, BRISTOL, R.I.The writer is a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law.To the Editor:As Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein point out in their excellent article, President Trump is not an outlier but rather a direct descendant of the modern Republican Party.Donald Trump is the political offspring of Ronald Reagan.To the Editor:Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein are certainly correct that the Republican Party \u201chas done unique, extensive and possible irreparable damage to the American political system,\u201d and they are right to point to the pernicious impact of right-wing media since the 1980s. The factors leading to this dangerous situation began a half century ago.In the mid-1960s, the G.O.P. could still claim to be the party of Lincoln, its congressional members having voted in larger percentages than their Democratic counterparts for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. That changed when Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy brought the Dixiecrats into the Republican Party, thus setting the stage for a party marinating in toxic racism.When Ronald Reagan subsequently courted the Christian right, he added to this mix a strain of authoritarian thinking by religious bigots unwilling to find common ground with people who differ from them. And given that the party\u2019s donor class has condoned such a shift, the prospects of its becoming once again a principled center-right party appear dim.The writer is the author of \u201cThe Trump Phenomenon.\u201dTo the Editor:One political extreme begets another extreme.When will it dawn on liberals that their extremes \u2014 globalization, an immigration \u201copen door,\u201d regulations that suffocate and an economy that leaves millions of displaced workers angry \u2014 are the result of decades of elitism?When will it dawn on conservatives that their extremes \u2014 an economy that rewards greed at the top and abandons rural America, bans on immigration from specific nations (without concern for the individuals), endless blaming of the other side for their own faults \u2014 are contributing to the advancement of President Trump, who, at least for the time being, has eclipsed them?Where is the common-sense centrist thought among either Democrats or Republicans? When will the Democrats find a voice that is something other than the party of \u201cno\u201d? When will the Republicans escape Trumpism and find a spokesperson who will look toward building a future, not just tearing down the past? When will we independents, who are more than a third of the electorate, find a replacement for dissatisfaction? Where is there real leadership?DIXON ARNETT, CORNING, N.Y.The writer is a former state assemblyman in California and deputy under secretary of Health and Human Services.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marshall Loeb, Editor Who Shaped Money and Fortune Magazines, Dies at 88", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarshall R. Loeb, a business journalist who turned a floundering Money magazine into one of the nation\u2019s most successful publications in the 1980s and then led a similar revival at Fortune, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 88.His daughter, Margaret Karen Loeb, said the cause was Parkinson\u2019s disease.On retiring as Fortune\u2019s managing editor in 1994, Mr. Loeb was hailed in The New York Times as \u201cone of the most visible and influential editors in the magazine industry.\u201dHe joined Money in 1980 as managing editor, the magazine\u2019s top editorial post, after 14 years at Time magazine. Inheriting a magazine that was barely profitable, Mr. Loeb set about expanding its coverage of personal finance, among other things.\u201cLoeb wanted to make investing and spending money fun at a time when a lot of young people were having fun making a lot of money, but not necessarily knowing what to do with it,\u201d Folio\u2019s Publishing News said in 1991. \u201cHe created a voyeuristic publication that enabled readers to peek into the finances of their neighbors.\u2019\u2019According to that 1991 article, Circulation soon climbed to 1.4 million in 1984, from 825,000 in 1980, making Money the fastest-growing magazine in the country.Fortune recruited Mr. Loeb in 1986, and under his watch the magazine became must reading in executive suites and among those who aspired to occupy them. Mr. Loeb is credited with reviving the magazine\u2019s profitability and expanding its traditionally tight focus on corporate management and the economy to embrace broader topics, like executive life, and social issues, like homelessness and public education.Mr. Loeb expanded his reach through radio and television. While running Money\u2019s editorial division, he took over as host of \u201cYour Dollars,\u201d a daily two-minute CBS Radio feature broadcast nationally.He subsequently began broadcasting \u201cYour Money Minute\u201d for the radio network; a weekly five-minute segment for CBS television; and a 30-second segment, \u201cMoney Tips,\u201d for WABC-TV in New York.In 2012, David Callaway, then editor in chief of MarketWatch, an online financial service (he is now chief executive of The Street, the business news and financial services website), called Mr. Loeb \u201cthe father of modern business journalism.\u201dMr. Loeb died at his son\u2019s home.After leaving Time Inc. at 65, he edited The Columbia Journalism Review, wrote a nationally syndicated personal finance column, continued to broadcast daily financial advice on CBS Radio and was briefly the host of the PBS television program \u201cWall Street Week.\u201dMarshall Robert Loeb was born on May 30, 1929, in Chicago and grew up on what he called the \u201cscruffy\u201d West Side of the city \u2014 yearning, by his account, to break free of its confines.His father, Monroe Harriman Loeb, owned a wrecking and salvage company in Chicago. His mother, the former Henrietta Benjamin, was a milliner and a teacher.As a young man, Marshall came to see reporters for Chicago\u2019s major newspapers as \u201cheroic\u201d figures whom he said he wanted to emulate, in part to see the world.He earned a journalism degree at the University of Missouri. (He later said he always regretted that he never studied accounting.) After graduation, \u201cwanting to find out what made Nazi Germany possible,\u201d he said, he went to Germany and worked at an international student house in Goettingen before landing a job as a correspondent for United Press in Frankfurt.There he met Irmingard Loewe (known as Peggy), a German-French stewardess for Pan American World Airways. They married in 1954. After they moved to the United States, he was hired by The St. Louis Globe-Democrat. But that job did not to satisfy his ambitions.\u201cI wanted to be sure that what I wrote would be printed or broadcast beyond the place where I was sitting,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview, and he decided he needed to go to New York or Washington \u201cto get that global reach.\u201dNew York it was, after Time hired him. He went on to flourish there as business editor, national editor and economics editor, writing or editing scores of Time cover stories, including one of 8,000 words on J. Paul Getty, billed as the first billionaire. (\u201cThere wasn\u2019t that much back then in terms of long-form business journalism,\u201d he recalled in the 2013 interview.)Over his career he interviewed presidents and covered the space program and a dozen national political conventions, he said. But he considered his work at Fortune to have been his most satisfying.He expanded Fortune\u2019s use of graphs, charts, lists and tables while continuing the magazine\u2019s tradition of deeply researched articles and its fierce circulation and advertising rivalry with Forbes magazine. He also commissioned a profile of Warren Buffett, a little-known investor at the time, helping to lift him to prominence.In 1964 he and William Safire wrote \u201cPlunging Into Politics,\u201d which recommended that neophytes begin a political career by working on campaigns at the precinct level. (Mr. Safire went to become a columnist for The New York Times.) His book \u201cMarshall Loeb\u2019s Lifetime Financial Strategies\u201d was published in 1996.Besides his daughter and son, Mr. Loeb is survived by six grandchildren. His wife died in 2010.Among his honors were two Gerald Loeb Awards for financial journalism, named for a Wall Street executive who was no relation. One of those awards was for lifetime achievement.Hannah Wulkan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Stifling Pay Raises Is Also Curbing Economic Growth", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHow is it that in this age of technological marvels, from mind-controlled prosthetics to instant machine translation, the American economy is limping through an interminable era of stagnant productivity, tepid economic growth and a sour political mood? Our menu of policy options \u2014 including the Republican plan to slash corporate tax rates \u2014 is unlikely to help.Instead, it may be time to rethink how productivity growth works. Nothing would do more to raise future living standards than jump-starting the productivity engine.Productivity goes up when we find ways to do more with less. Take a factory full of workers, rearrange them and add a powered assembly line, and suddenly you can build vastly more cars a day at far lower cost per car than you could before.Why is productivity growth so important? It paves the way for higher incomes: You can\u2019t give raises indefinitely unless the value generated by your workers is going up as well. Higher wages are not a foolproof safeguard against destructive politics, but it does become harder to scapegoat various boogeymen, from job-stealing immigrants to the idle poor, when living standards are rising rapidly.Inconveniently, we lack a clear understanding of how to jump-start productivity growth. As best we can tell, productivity rises when economies generate new ideas, and when those new ideas are then transformed by companies into new, growth-boosting ways of doing things. For that reason, our productivity doldrums are increasingly blamed on a failure of genius. As the economist Robert Gordon puts it, our iPhones and our Facebooks, while thoroughly addictive, are not nearly as transformative as electricity or automobiles or flushing toilets.And yet as time goes on, and advances in robotics, artificial intelligence and bioengineering grow more magical, the notion that unimpressive technology is keeping the digital era from being economically revolutionary becomes ever harder to maintain.A new story is therefore needed. Perhaps the problem isn\u2019t that we\u2019re out of ideas. Perhaps the problem is that most companies seem happier doing things the old way than taking a risk and trying something new. Perhaps they haven\u2019t been pushed enough to do more with less.As with oil, the way an economy employs its workers depends in part on what they cost. A company building a warehouse must choose how much of the work done within it should be handled by robots and how much by people. When low-wage jobs attract lots of potential hires, it makes sense to delay the upfront investment needed to automate the warehouse and use regular old humans instead. In the same way, carmakers with factories all over the world use many more robots in Japanese plants than in Indian ones.History also suggests the price of workers plays an important role in the process of innovation. The Industrial Revolution could not have taken place without the invention of the steam engine, but it took the relatively high cost of labor in Britain to nudge business owners to find clever ways to use steam to cut their labor costs. A century later America, rich in land and resources but short of labor, developed its own style of manufacturing, even more productive than Britain\u2019s, which helped make the United States the world\u2019s richest big economy. Just as expensive oil encourages us to wring more utility out of each gallon of gas, high wages encourage companies to make the most of their work forces \u2014 and to make full use of whatever new technologies promise to economize on payroll. It is not the technology which is at fault, but the incentives firms face to use it that are letting us down.Many cutting-edge innovations remain buggy or more prone to failure than human workers. That is why the lack of wage pressure has been a problem; employers need to be fairly desperate to tinker with raw technologies, and to fail and learn, until new techniques are reliable enough and cheap enough to be adopted widely. Early steam engines were clunky and wildly inefficient, and few people had a good idea how to harness them to boats or looms in a profitable way. But in Britain, the incentives created by expensive labor and cheap coal made it worth the trouble to find out. Tinkering in Britain led to steady improvements, until steam was ready to conquer the world.If low wages are indeed inhibiting productivity, what can we do about it? A large corporate tax cut is unlikely to help. In an economy in which large firms enjoy market power while workers have none, such cuts will raise stock prices and dividends rather than wages and investment. Big increases in the minimum wage would certainly give companies an incentive to automate, but at the cost of jobs for the most vulnerable workers.A better strategy would be to shift power from companies to workers, to allow workers to bargain for a bigger share of the gains from growth. Keeping companies from getting too big and too dominant would make a difference by increasing the number of companies competing for workers and the competitive pressure they face to maximize worker output.Making it easier for workers to unionize would improve productivity, too. A strong labor movement, were one magically to appear, could bargain for higher pay, potentially pushing firms to invest in workers and new technology.Perhaps most important, we should not allow a low unemployment rate to fool us into thinking that labor is scarce. The Fed should wait for much faster wage growth before taking steps to slow the economy. Governments at all levels should make sure that schools and agencies are fully staffed with qualified workers. And Congress should turn its attention to public investments, rather than counting on tax cuts to motivate private ones. Large-scale infrastructure spending would increase the economy\u2019s growth potential while creating good jobs. So would concerted efforts to make postsecondary education as accessible and affordable as possible.Big companies would no doubt argue that unions only gum up the works, resist change and eat into the profits that motivate firms to innovate in the first place. That is a risk. But years of falling labor power, stagnant pay and high profits have done nothing to solve America\u2019s productivity problem. Perhaps if companies are compelled to worry more about how to get the most from their workers, they will begin finding new ways to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Unveils an Ambitious Plan to Curb Climate Change Emissions", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China is the world\u2019s No. 1 polluter. It burns more coal than the rest of the world combined. It produces more than a quarter of the world\u2019s human-caused global warming gases, nearly as much as North America and Europe put together.On Tuesday, the country set out to claim another title reflecting its ambitions to change all that: keeper of the world\u2019s largest financial market devoted to cleaning up the air.China released plans on Tuesday to start a giant market to trade credits for the right to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. The nationwide market would initially cover China\u2019s vast, state-dominated power generation sector, which produced almost half of the country\u2019s emissions from the burning of fossil fuels last year. If it works as intended, an emissions market will give Chinese power companies a financial incentive to operate more cleanly.\u201cChina\u2019s move to create the world\u2019s largest carbon market is yet another powerful sign that a global sustainability revolution is underway,\u201d Al Gore, the former vice president and a prominent voice on the environment, said in a statement.The government did not issue a hard timeline, and regulations and other details still have to be worked out. But environmental groups that worked with the government said they could emerge in the next couple of years. \u201cEverything is gradual, step by step,\u201d said Li Junfeng, a senior government adviser on the carbon market plan.China\u2019s announcement could also disappoint those who were hoping the long-promised emissions market would cover the country\u2019s broader economy, the world\u2019s second largest after that of the United States. China\u2019s booming car culture, its industrializing agriculture sector and its huge chemical complexes, cement factories and steel mills are also big emitters.Still, environmental groups welcomed the move. Nathaniel Keohane, vice president for global climate at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the market for power-sector emissions alone would cover 3.3 billion tons of annual carbon dioxide releases. The European Union\u2019s trading system encompasses about two billion tons of emissions.\u201cThis is like the Mount Everest of climate policy,\u201d Mr. Keohane said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly ambitious undertaking.\u201dChina is reacting to pressure at home and abroad to clean up its act. Rising sea levels could devastate its heavily populated coast. The Chinese public is increasingly worried about broader environmental issues like urban smog, water quality and soil pollution.China has invested heavily in green technologies such as electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels.China\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas have nearly tripled since 2000, according to data from the International Energy Agency in Paris. The high tonnage partly reflects its huge population; Chinese emissions per person are still somewhat less than the average per capita figure in the United States, although the gap has been narrowing.Under emission markets, power companies and others effectively pay for the right to pollute beyond a government-mandated limit. Those that cut their emissions could sell permits to pollute to dirtier companies, ideally at a healthy price.So far, such efforts have been underwhelming. Markets in Europe and at the provincial level in China have faltered because the authorities issued too many credits to existing polluters. That gave companies little reason to buy credits, or to cut their own emissions and sell the credits.Zou Ji, the president of the China arm of the Energy Foundation, one of several Western nonprofit groups that advised the government on the new market, said that China was likely to issue many credits starting early next year in response to domestic political pressures, and then gradually tighten annual allocations to force up the price.The national market could face its own political interference that could hurt its chances of becoming a model for others. Electricity generation in China from coal and natural gas is dominated by five giant, state-controlled companies. A sixth runs the civilian nuclear power sector. Regardless of effectiveness or economics, the companies will probably do what Beijing wants them to do.\u201cI don\u2019t take the carbon market seriously,\u201d said Derek Scissors, an economist who specializes in China with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cThe first thing I would ask people is, \u2018What markets in China do you think work really well?\u2019 \u201dThe national emissions trading system being started will initially cover power companies that emit at least 26,000 tons a year of carbon \u2014 the equivalent of burning 10,000 tons of coal a year, and a threshold high enough to cover mainly larger users of coal and natural gas. Experimental markets in the seven original provinces and cities, which further cities and provinces are starting to replicate, will continue to cover the cement and steel industries as well as other manufacturing and industrial sectors. The goal is to eventually move them into the national market.Beijing already regulates emissions from China\u2019s electricity sector. On the other hand, having them trade with each other might help the central government figure out more rules to regulate trading in less regulated sectors, and also to identify which companies are the most efficient at reducing emissions.Asserting that the world\u2019s two largest economies must act together, the United States and China in 2014 jointly announced their emissions targets as part of the Paris agreement. China has previously promised that its carbon dioxide emissions would peak by 2030, and that it would increase its share of non-fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption to about 20 percent by that year.Kelly Sims Gallagher, a professor of environmental policy at Tufts University, said the Chinese government was right to be cautious by starting with just the electricity sector. Taking a good inventory of emissions, ensuring the cap is set at a level that will actually spur a reduction in carbon dioxide and sorting out emissions allocations are all complex tasks that take time, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize you can\u2019t do that overnight,\u201d Ms. Gallagher said.Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Lisa Friedman from Washington.

{"Headline": "Tax Law Offers a Carrot to Gig Workers. But It May Have Costs.", "Date": "2017-12-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new tax law is likely to accelerate a hotly disputed trend in the American economy by rewarding workers who sever formal relationships with their employers and become contractors.Management consultants may soon strike out on their own, and stockbrokers may hang out their own shingle.More cable repairmen and delivery drivers, some of whom find work through gig economy apps like Uber, may also be lured into contracting arrangements.That\u2019s because a provision in the tax law allows sole proprietors \u2014 along with owners of partnerships or other so-called pass-through entities \u2014 to deduct 20 percent of their revenue from their taxable income.The tax savings, which could be around $15,000 per year for many affluent couples, may prove enticing to workers. \u201cIf you\u2019re above the median but not at the very, very top, one would think you\u2019d be thinking it through,\u201d said David Kamin, a professor of tax law at New York University.The provision may also turn out to be a boon for employers who are trying to reduce their payroll costs. Workers hired as contractors, who tend to be cheaper, may be less likely to complain about their status under the new tax law.\u201cFirms currently have a lot of incentives to turn workers into independent contractors,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. \u201cThis reinforces the current trends.\u201dBut it could lead to an erosion of the protections that have long been a cornerstone of full-time work.Formal employment, after all, provides more than just income. Unlike independent contractors, employees have access to unemployment insurance if they lose their jobs and workers\u2019 compensation if they are injured at work. They are protected by workplace anti-discrimination laws and have a federally backed right to form a union.Those protections do not generally apply to contractors. Nor do minimum-wage and overtime laws.\u201cWhat you\u2019re losing is the safety nets for those workers,\u201d said Catherine Ruckelshaus of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group.Traditional full-time jobs also insulate workers against the peaks and troughs in the demand for their services. Consider, for instance, the erratic income of retail or fulfillment-center workers hired in the fall and let go after the holidays.And because companies have internal pay scales, the lowest-paid employees tend to make more than they would on the open market.\u201cIt used to be that companies like G.M. or the local bank or factory directly employed the janitor, the clerical worker,\u201d Professor Katz said, noting that their pay would rise along with other employees\u2019 when the company was doing well.Unwinding employment relationships eliminates these benefits, increasing the volatility of workers\u2019 incomes and magnifying pay disparities and inequality.It\u2019s difficult to say how many workers would choose to become contractors as a result of the new provision, which for couples frequently begins to phase out at a taxable income above $315,000. Mr. Kamin said joint filers who make close to $315,000 and could transform most of these earnings into business income would find it most compelling to make the change. (It could be more compelling still if one spouse\u2019s employer offered the couple health insurance, which many employers provide even though they aren\u2019t required to.)On the other hand, many individuals fail to avail themselves of existing tax deductions, like the one that freelancers can take for their expenses, said Jamil Poonja of Stride Health, which helps self-employed workers buy health insurance. That may reflect the lack of access among lower-earning workers to sophisticated tax advice.The tax benefit could also be offset in some cases by the need for contractors to pay both the employer and employee portion of the federal payroll tax.Many employers are already pushing the boundaries of who they treat as employees and who they treat as independent contractors.In theory, it is the nature of the job, and not the employer\u2019s whim, that is supposed to determine the worker\u2019s job status.If a company exerts sufficient control over workers by setting their schedules or how much they charge customers, and if workers largely depend on the company for their livelihood, the law typically considers those workers to be employees.True contractors are supposed to retain control over most aspects of their job and can typically generate income through entrepreneurial skill, and not just by working longer hours.In practice, however, many companies classify workers who are clearly employees as contractors, because they are usually much cheaper to use. And many labor advocates say the new tax deduction will encourage more employers to go that route by giving them an additional carrot to dangle in front of workers.\u201cThe risk presented by this provision is that employers can go to workers and say, \u2018You know what, your taxes will go down, let me classify you as an independent contractor,\u2019\u201d said Seth Harris, a deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama.This simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.Anything that makes workers more likely to accept such an arrangement makes it harder to root out violations of the law. That is because the agencies responsible for policing misclassification \u2014 the Labor Department, the Internal Revenue Service, state labor and tax authorities \u2014 lack the resources to identify more than a fraction of the violations on their own.\u201cYour chances of finding a worker that\u2019s been misclassified if that worker has not complained are worse than your chances of finding a leprechaun riding a unicorn,\u201d Mr. Harris said.David Weil, the administrator of the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division under Mr. Obama, believes the change will add fuel to a trend that has been several decades in the making.The tax law will accelerate the shift, he said, because employers who are already keen to reorganize in this way will recognize that even fewer workers are likely to object as a result of the tax benefits.The effect of the deduction could be especially big in industries where misclassification is already rampant.Many small-time construction contractors hire full-time workers who should be classified as employees but are kept on as freelancers or paid under the table, said Kyle Makarios, political director for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.Mr. Makarios said the pass-through provision would encourage even more building contractors to misclassify workers, allowing them to reduce their labor costs and underbid contractors who play by the rules.Neil Bradley, senior vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that gig-economy companies classify workers as contractors when it suits the needs of their business and that he did not expect that to change. He also said he did not expect firms with traditional business models to follow suit as a result of the new provision.\u201cI think the decision is going to be driven by the considerations\u201d that lawyers cite, such as the amount of control a company exercises, he said, \u201cnot by this tax bill.\u201dBut Mr. Weil was less sanguine.\u201cThese kinds of approaches to making it easier to slide into independent contractor status reflect unequal bargaining power,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you add to that an additional financial incentive, you\u2019re just unwinding the whole system.\u201dFollow on twitter: @noamscheiberJesse Drucker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Tax Bill, It\u2019s Trump vs. His Hometown", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen President Trump returned to his hometown on Saturday for a day of fund-raisers, his third and final check-collecting stop was the Park Avenue home of Stephen A. Schwarzman, where the crowd included some of Mr. Trump\u2019s old New York friends and real estate colleagues.Some in the group, including Mr. Schwarzman, a founder of the private equity Blackstone Group, have been among those pushing the Trump administration to change the Republican tax package that is making its way through Congress \u2014 in particular to save the ability to deduct state and local taxes from federal returns.Richard LeFrak, a developer and longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who has been among those lobbying, asked about what changes the president wanted to see.\u201cLeFrak always has a question,\u201d Mr. Trump mocked.Mr. Trump was vague in his response, giving some in the room the impression he was open to their concerns. Others were less certain. And Mr. Trump concluded by poking fun at his wealthy supporters\u2019 complaints. \u201cYou guys seem to be doing O.K.,\u201d he said dryly.While Mr. Trump has tried to sell the tax package as a giant tax break for all Americans, a different story is unfolding in New York and other high-tax, mostly Democratic states. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has estimated that there could be tax increases for as many as 700,000 residents if the legislation is approved. Nearly half of households in surrounding suburban counties itemize their deductions \u2014 and stand to lose valuable write-offs of state and local taxes on their federal returns.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s New York friends and colleagues are seeking changes, as are some of the Republican Party\u2019s most generous donors. They have called the White House, the Treasury Department and Congress in a furious push to soften the economic blow. Many fear their concerns are falling on deaf ears.\u201cEverybody in New York is groaning,\u201d said John Catsimatidis, a billionaire Republican who went to another of Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raisers this month at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan, \u201cand all of us have zero influence.\u201dThe fact that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax package would economically hamper his hometown is unusual.It is almost unimaginable that President George W. Bush would have championed a bill that would have harmed Texas relative to other states, or for President Barack Obama to have embraced legislation that took a particular bite out of his birth state, Hawaii, or adopted hometown, Chicago.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a president whose signature legislation will fall, in a very negative way, on people in his home state,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a presidential historian and professor of history at Princeton. \u201cUsually you bring back the pork.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with New York is more complicated. He was never elected to anything in the state. And New York\u2019s bounty of 29 electoral votes is not part of any 2020 re-election calculus for Mr. Trump, unlike the home states of presidents past.While Mr. Trump is certainly a New Yorker culturally, from his accent to his braggadocio, his political supporters tend to live far from diverse metropolises like Manhattan. He received only 10 percent of the vote in his home county.\u201cTrump\u2019s base is not New York,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, the CNBC commentator and economist who helped draft Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan during the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cIf you want to do straight politics, it\u2019s not his base. It\u2019s just not that important to him. If he runs for re-election, he\u2019s not going to carry New York State. Politically, I don\u2019t think it matters to him.\u201dMr. Trump has not entirely ignored his old New York network as the tax debate has raged in Washington.The day after the 2016 election, prominent state Democrats clung to the idea that Mr. Trump, at the least, was a passionate defender of New York. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said then, \u201cI think Donald Trump being from New York is a bonus.\u201dNow Mr. Cuomo is among those leading the charge against the tax bill, which he calls \u201cpolitical retaliation through the tax code.\u201dMr. Kudlow did not disagree about the local tax deductibility provision. \u201cIt\u2019s a blue-state tax,\u201d he said bluntly.White House aides said that the federal government should not be subsidizing high-tax states and that beneficiaries of such local deductions are typically high earners.\u201cTax-reform alarmists are hoping to get people to focus on the carve-outs that they are losing and hoping that they forget about the fact that their tax rates are being cut so much that, for the overwhelming majority of people, the tax cut more than offsets what they lose with elimination of a deduction,\u201d said Cliff Sims, a White House spokesman.While Mr. Trump\u2019s name appears emblazoned on Manhattan high-rises, he has long been shunned in the clubby world of the city\u2019s upper echelon as a tabloid sideshow.\u201cHe has this resentment toward the elite in New York that\u2019s very powerful,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biographers, \u201cbecause he was never really accepted and he loves to tweak the people who regard him as a barbarian.\u201dRepublican members of the New York congressional delegation, particularly those in higher-income areas, such as Representatives Lee Zeldin and Peter T. King, both of Long Island, have been lobbying aggressively on the local tax provision. And the state\u2019s formidable business lobby is fully engaged.\u201cPeople suddenly are understanding that this could have real ramifications for our entire economy,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. \u201cThat runs counter to what everyone is trying to achieve with tax reform.\u201dBusiness leaders reaching out include major political donors in both parties, Ms. Wylde said.\u201cPeople who are reaching out have long arms,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re in every state.\u201dSome of the largest hedge-fund managers who operate in New York are also concerned about an element of the proposed legislation that prevents executives in certain financial-services companies from partaking of the new, lower pass-through rate \u2014 even if they are structured as partnerships. Their argument: that their treatment under that bill would drive the taxes for New York-based financial-service partnerships to 50 percent or more, driving business out of New York and into lower-tax states.This week, Kenneth C. Griffin, a major political donor and the founder of the hedge-fund company Citadel, which has its headquarters in Chicago but employs hundreds of people in New York, went to Washington to press that case, according to three people with knowledge of the travels. In discussions with lawmakers, Paul Singer, the founder of the hedge fund Elliott Management and one of the Republican Party\u2019s most generous donors, made similar concerns known.There is some precedent for the idea that higher rates will force a high-net-worth exodus. Late in 2015, the hedge-fund manager David Tepper left New Jersey to become a resident of Florida. He later moved his business, Appaloosa Management, there too, taking with him tax revenues once collected by New Jersey that were estimated in the hundreds of millions.Some say they are seeing the tax legislation\u2019s effect on New York even before it has become law.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an influx of buyers who specifically said they were looking to move because they will not be able to deduct city and state income taxes,\u201d said Louise Sunshine, a former Trump executive who is now a strategic adviser to Fort Partners, the company that recently opened the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \u201cWe\u2019ve been selling so many residences to New Yorkers now. That\u2019s picked up in the last few weeks.\u201dBen Casselman, Patricia Cohen and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charities\u2019 Fear Under Tax Bill: Less Money to Help the Needy", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven before congressional Republicans finalized their tax bill, charities were worried.The final legislation roughly doubles the standard tax deduction, to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples. A higher standard deduction means fewer taxpayers will itemize their deductions on their tax returns, reducing the incentive to give to charities. Currently, only taxpayers who itemize \u2014 meaning, they detail gifts to charity and other spending on their returns \u2014 may deduct contributions.\u201cThe nonprofit sector is alarmed,\u201d said Michael Thatcher, chief executive of Charity Navigator, a charity rating website. The change in the standard deduction is \u201cthe biggest cause of concern,\u201d he said.Estimates of the impact from an increase in the standard deduction vary. According to the Tax Policy Center, more than 46 million filers would be expected to itemize in 2018 under current law, but that number would drop to under 20 million.\u201cFor charities who serve families in need, the projected declines in giving will devastate our ability to provide food assistance,\u201d said Diana Aviv, chief executive of Feeding America, a network of food banks.For many charities, 2017 is shaping up to be a good one for fund-raising, as the economy hums along and the stock market booms. The United Way of Greater St. Louis, for instance, which serves Missouri and Illinois, expects top donors to contribute 6 percent more than what they gave in 2016, said Orvin Kimbrough, the group\u2019s president and chief executive.But the future is cloudy under the new tax regime. The group estimates a potential drop in taxpayer giving to charities of $169 million annually in Missouri and $431 million in Illinois, under the new tax law. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Kimbrough said. \u201cThis is about people\u2019s lives.\u201dOne short-term bright spot: Donors, uncertain about whether they can deduct a contribution next year, may be more generous this year, giving nonprofit groups a bump in 2017 fund-raising.Some fund-raisers are asking donors to consider doing just that.The Greater Milwaukee Foundation, which makes grants to support community and civic groups, sent an email to donors explicitly noting the effect of the tax overhaul. \u201cIf you are a taxpayer who itemizes,\u201d the email said in part, \u201cit probably makes sense to accelerate some charitable contributions into 2017 to get a larger income tax deduction this year.\u201dEllen Gilligan, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, said the federal tax legislation moved so quickly that many donors were unaware of its provisions and how it might affect their taxes. Many have been appreciative of the notice, she said, and some have accelerated their contributions to the foundation\u2019s donor-advised funds. (Donor-advised funds allow people to make contributions and take a tax deduction, while designating a choice of gift recipient at a later date.)Ms. Gilligan said the foundation has an endowment and doesn\u2019t expect its grant programs to be significantly affected in 2018, but there is concern about the longer-term impact of the tax change. \u201cEliminating the tax incentive,\u201d she said, \u201chas the potential to have a very negative impact on charitable giving.\u201dUnited Way Worldwide, ranked the largest charity in 2017 by donations by Forbes, is recommending that its community-based affiliates contact important contributors to highlight the changes that are coming, said Steve Taylor, the charity\u2019s vice president of public policy. United Way Worldwide provides leadership and support to its network of groups across the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve been urging them to reach out to big donors and talk to them about tax reform,\u201d he said. Typically, the local United Way chief executive or head fund-raiser has a personal relationship with important donors, he said, and will talk by phone. (\u201cMy donors,\u201d said Mr. Kimbrough of the United Way of Greater St. Louis, \u201chave my cellphone.\u201d)Some 26,000 to 28,000 major donors nationally give a total of about $500 million a year to United Way, in gifts of $10,000 or more, Mr. Taylor said. Some of those donors may be affected by the change in the standard deduction. Donors give for altruistic reasons as well as tax breaks, Mr. Taylor said, but the increase in the standard deduction is expected to have an impact.\u201cThey\u2019ll still give,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to give less.\u201d(Millions of smaller donors, who make pledges to the United Way through workplace contribution programs, average gifts of $150 a year. They have already made their elections for next year\u2019s donations.)Major donors are often concerned about stability, Mr. Kimbrough said. So they may structure gifts to donate more this year and receive a larger deduction, but space out the funds for spending over several years to help smooth out any budget gaps.Elie Hassenfeld, co-founder and executive director of GiveWell, a nonprofit organization that recommends a handful of charities, said nonprofits are in a \u201czone of uncertainty.\u201d But the group has frequent one-on-one conversations with its donors, he said, and is raising the issue of tax reform with them. The message? \u201cYou should be thinking about the possibility that your desire to deduct is going change from this year into the future,\u201d he said.Eileen Heisman, chief executive of the National Philanthropic Trust, which oversees donor-advised funds, said the trust is seeing some larger gifts this season. \u201cPeople would rather gift when they know what their tax benefit is going to be,\u201d she said.\u201cOne thing is very consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a threat, donors will front load, and we\u2019re expecting that this year.\u201dSome donors may be waiting to see the final bill approved by President Trump before making a decision about the size of their donations. So the usual burst of last-minute giving at the end of the year may be even more intense this year, said Pam Norley, president of Fidelity Charitable, a big donor-advised fund.But not all donors have the wherewithal to double their contributions on short notice, said Michael Kenyon, chief executive of the National Association of Charitable Gift Planners. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have the opportunity to give more now,\u201d he said. That probably means, he said, that nonprofit groups are unlikely to recoup enough in donations this year to make up for what they will lose next year and beyond.\u201cThe honest answer is we don\u2019t know how many people who donate to Direct Relief are motivated by deductibility,\u201d said Thomas Tighe, chief executive of the group, which specializes in disaster relief. \u201cIt\u2019s some cause for concern, but we don\u2019t feel there\u2019s anything we can do about it other than wait and see and hope people still see value in making a contribution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaign to Drive Out Migrants Slams Beijing\u2019s Best and Brightest", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 With coding skills, a foreign degree, fluent English and an apartment barely big enough for his espresso maker and two cats, Si Ruomu thought he was the kind of go-getting young tech worker that Beijing needs to thrive in the 21st century.That was before the police arrived at his apartment building and ordered him and hundreds of others to vacate within 48 hours. Like most of his fellow tenants, Mr. Si had come from elsewhere in China to find work in the capital, which often treats migrants virtually as second-class citizens.\u201cOne minute you\u2019re drinking espressos, the next you\u2019re being evicted,\u201d said Mr. Si, 28, a bespectacled programmer who grew up in northern China and studied computer science in New Zealand. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think whether people like me have a future in Beijing.\u201dBeijing is a cultural, technological and commercial capital as well as a political one, and the tenements on its outskirts are home to tens of thousands of hopeful young college graduates who have moved here seeking better jobs and better lives.These job seekers are treated as migrants in their own capital, because China\u2019s biggest cities are fortresses of official privilege, especially Beijing. The government gives inhabitants who hold permanent residence papers, called hukou, more generous access to housing, schools and health care. But migrants must pay more for many services, and many live on the edges of Beijing, where rents are lower.Now whole swaths of these neighborhoods have been emptied out and in many cases reduced to rubble as the authorities condemn buildings as unsafe or illegal and order migrants to leave.That has ignited debate about how Beijing can function without the blue-collar migrants who serve as its cooks, cleaners and vendors, but there are also worries the campaign might harm the city\u2019s fast-growing tech sector, which employs armies of migrants who work for relatively low pay.When the authorities arrive with eviction orders, many migrants search for newer, safer homes even further from the city center. Others say they may abandon Beijing to find work elsewhere.\u201cThis will certainly change my impression of this city. I don\u2019t really want to stay in Beijing,\u201d said Zhang Mi, 25, a web application developer from Hebei, the province surrounding the capital, as he crammed his bags into a van after being evicted.\u201cTo young tech workers like me, there\u2019s really no option \u2014 only the big cities like Beijing have more opportunities,\u201d said Hu Xianyu, 22, an intern at Baidu, the internet search giant, who moved to Beijing from the northern province of Shanxi and was forced out of his apartment last month.\u201cTech workers for the bigger companies can get help from them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for those working for small companies or start-ups, the evictions can be disastrous.\u201dMigrant workers have often reacted to the eviction orders with angry resignation. But small confrontations have flared up, and the largest and most organized protest broke out on Sunday, when hundreds of people in a neighborhood in northeast Beijing scheduled for clearance gathered and chanted \u201cviolent evictions violate human rights.\u201dLast month, five delivery companies warned of delivery delays following the expulsions.Gan Wei, secretary-general of the China Electronic Commerce Logistics Industry Alliance, said the companies represented by her group would have to raise delivery prices in Beijing by about 20 percent.\u201cWhy is takeout food so cheap in Beijing? Because of all the cheap labor from the countryside,\u201d said Jia Dayong, 43, a stringy courier from the northwestern province of Shaanxi who was being expelled from Banjieta Village, a migrant neighborhood in northern Beijing.\u201cNobody cares whether we have a place to live,\u201d he said.\u201cIf they keep clearing out like this, Beijing will suffer a drought of employees next year,\u201d said Wang Le, 29, a hotel manager from the eastern province of Jiangsu.She was one of about 100 tenants \u2014 most of whom worked in finance, technology and hospitality \u2014 living in steel shipping containers that had been converted into small, brightly painted apartments. They were being torn down on government orders.In an attempt to slow the influx of job seekers, Beijing has cut the numbers of university graduates from other parts of China receiving the hukou permits that confer privileged status and benefits. But they have kept coming.Without permanent residency, they are forced to live precariously. Trying to save money, many find cheap apartments in the same run-down neighborhoods as migrants working menial jobs.\u201cEven if the industry I\u2019m in is very high-level, as far as the government is concerned, I\u2019m also a peasant worker, a migrant worker,\u201d said Zhang Xingwang, 24, who studied automation in college and came to Beijing from Hebei Province seeking work as a software programmer.He had to find new housing after his old apartment near where the deadly fire broke out last month was demolished. \u201cI thought Beijing would be relatively fair and tolerant, and the government would behave better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after this happened \u2026\u201dChina\u2019s big tech firms have refrained from criticizing the migrant crackdown, perhaps out of fear of angering the government. Alibaba, the online commerce giant, said the overall impact on its business \u201chasn\u2019t been significant.\u201dBut some experts have warned that by choking off the flow of migrants, Beijing risks losing entrepreneurial energy.Even before the recent expulsions, Yin Deting, a demographer who advises the Beijing city government, warned that heavy-handed clearances of migrants would accelerate the aging of the city\u2019s work force.\u201cIf we place our hopes for reducing the population just in demolishing illegal buildings and low-grade markets, the actual outcomes may well be contrary to what is hoped for,\u201d Mr. Yin wrote earlier this year.Mr. Si, the programmer who studied in New Zealand, eventually found a place to stay on the eastern edge of Beijing where he could keep his cats. He said he was weighing whether to move to a more tolerant Chinese city, or leave the country again to resume his studies.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will ever work,\u201d Mr. Si said of the crackdown. \u201cThere are job opportunities in Beijing, and government policies can\u2019t stop people moving to get jobs. If you do, the city pays a heavy price.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Cuts in Basic Subway Upkeep Can Make Your Commute Miserable", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "Decisions to scale back routine maintenance turned this year into the subway\u2019s worst since the 1970s.Supported byIt was the wrong place for a spare piece of rail \u2014 13 feet long, more than 400 pounds and lying, unsecured, in the center of a busy stretch of subway track.It migrated slowly during the tremorous morning hours, inching across the stained ties and grimy track bed with the vibration of each passing car until it lay atop the track, directly in the path of oncoming trains.Just before 9:40 a.m. on Tuesday, June 27, the tunnels at 125th Street in Harlem were illuminated by a southbound A train \u2014 eight cars carrying hundreds of people.What happened next felt like an explosion. The train struck the loose rail, and two cars, each weighing more than 90,000 pounds, left the tracks and hit the tunnel walls with enough force to gouge concrete and shear steel. Signal equipment dangled crazily from the ceiling as smoke filled the train cars. Subway riders choked back panic, crowded together and fought their way through the wreckage.The car walls and the tunnel felt as if they were closing in on Gabriela Martinez, 27, who was on her way to an internship at NBC at Rockefeller Center and now found herself hugging a stranger for comfort. \u201cI can\u2019t control this,\u201d she thought to herself, \u201cand I think I\u2019m going to die right now.\u201dWorkers responsible for the rail that caused the derailment should have removed it, or at least bolted it down, officials said. It was an egregious lapse in basic subway maintenance. But it was far from the only one in June \u2014 the worst month for delays in the subway\u2019s worst year since the transit crisis of the 1970s. To look closely at those 30 troubled days is to see how preventable maintenance problems cause commuter misery practically every hour.Transit officials count any instance in which a train runs more than five minutes behind, or misses a scheduled stop, as a delay. Of the 82,000 delays recorded in June, more than a third were attributed to overcrowding. About 15,000 stemmed from planned work to repair the system\u2019s failing signals and worn track.There were about 10,800 delays caused by signal and track problems and about 2,200 delays created by car equipment trouble \u2014 the equivalent of 18 late trains every hour, every day, for 30 days straight.The number of delays caused by maintenance problems could actually be higher \u2014 the transit authority\u2019s records do not account for crowding delays on one line caused by maintenance failures on another.To trace the causes of maintenance problems to their roots, The New York Times reviewed records from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the umbrella agency that runs the subways, for every delay that occurred in June and interviewed dozens of current and former transit employees. The examination showed that the transit authority\u2019s own flawed policies and practices have led to preventable breakdowns.But transit authority leaders have also struggled to stanch turnover among the ranks of its signal maintainers \u2014 skilled workers with the arcane knowledge needed to inspect and repair the antiquated traffic lights of the subway \u2014 and offered new recruits little training in preventive maintenance. In recent months, they redeployed some signal maintainers to do menial tasks in support of contractors working on the subway\u2019s electrical system.Transit leaders also were slow to restore cuts that put off car inspections and overhauls to save money, even during good financial times.They introduced major changes to the management structure of the New York City Transit Authority in 2009 and 2010, which according to current and former employees sowed confusion within the maintenance ranks and led to deterioration of tracks, tunnels and signals.Transit leaders have acknowledged that at least part of the surge in delays this year stemmed from past policy decisions. After Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared on June 29 that the subway was in a state of emergency, they unveiled a plan that makes repairing signals, track and car equipment a top priority. The proposal calls for making repairs to the signals that break down the most frequently; reducing leaks that cause tracks to wear out more quickly and electrical equipment to malfunction; and cleaning tracks to cut down on fires and other hazards that could cause problems. It also includes staffing special teams at chronic trouble spots to make repairs more quickly, installing welded rail instead of rail with joints to cut down on track failures, and overhauling cars more frequently.Keeping a 24-hour subway system up-to-date is a herculean task, and even the best-maintained signals, tracks and tunnels will fall victim to occasional maintenance problems. Adding to the complexities in New York City are the system\u2019s age (the oldest lines opened 113 years ago), the fact that it runs constantly and its size: It has 665 miles of track and relies on 13,000 signals and 1,600 switches. It operates 6,400 subway cars, which are maintained at 14 facilities across the city.John Samuelsen, a former track inspector and the former president of Transport Workers Union Local 100, said rank-and-file workers do all they can just to keep up with the workload.\u201cYou\u2019re constantly trying to get tonight\u2019s hot potato off your lap,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said. \u201cEvery single night there\u2019s a scramble in order to get rush-hour service off without a hitch. That\u2019s a stressful atmosphere. It\u2019s this industrial ballet that goes on in the hole while everyone is sleeping.\u201dThe loose-rail derailment of the A train was just one among June\u2019s mishaps. A signal failure that struck the northbound D line at 34th Street-Herald Square on a busy Tuesday morning, a week earlier, was another glaring example of a maintenance breakdown that could have been avoided.Officials had known for years that the station\u2019s signal interlocking \u2014 the mechanism that sorts trains among tracks where multiple lines come together \u2014 needed attention. The M.T.A. approved a plan to modernize the 1930s-era machinery in 2010. It was not finished by 5:59 a.m. on that Tuesday, June 20, when a failing cable caused a short circuit. That set off transit pandemonium in Midtown Manhattan at the start of the morning rush.According to M.T.A. officials, the electrical failure tripped a fuse and caused the system that moves trains among intersecting tracks to freeze up. Suddenly, every signal was glowing red, which prevented trains on three of four tracks from moving past the station until M.T.A. workers physically got on the tracks and started waving them through.As tens of thousands of people poured through the turnstiles on their commutes that morning, the B, D, F and M lines, as well as portions of the E and R lines, all were stricken by delays in both directions.Michael Posso, a 36-year-old web developer, was on his way from Queens to his office on Delancey Street when his usual commute on the F train halted abruptly. The delay meant he would lose time working with collaborators in Berlin, where the day ends six hours earlier than it does in New York City. In frustration, he pulled out his phone and started tweeting: \u201cAnother morning another hellish commute for New Yorkers. Where is the plan to fix the mess?\u201dMeanwhile, about 50 transit employees worked frantically. Some directed trains through at a crawl, a job that requires signal maintainers to hand-crank rail switches into position and then guide each passing train on its way.Others began the painstaking work of searching along every inch of thousands of feet of cable for the fault.At last, they narrowed the problem down to a 1,000-foot length of cable and then disabled circuitry so that only two signals were offline.By the time regular service resumed, it was 10:35 a.m., and all that commuters like Mr. Posso knew was that some nameless part of the aging subway system had failed yet again. \u201cWe are one of the richest cities in the country, in the world, and we have decaying subway systems,\u201d Mr. Posso said.In all, the signal malfunctions at 34th Street-Herald Square directly caused at least 623 train delays, records show \u2014 the most delays caused by a maintenance breakdown of any kind in June. And that number does not count crowding delays resulting from frustrated passengers jamming onto other subway lines.During the overnight hours, transit workers replaced the entire 1,000-foot length of problem cable, M.T.A. officials said.Problems such as the short-circuited interlocking system will be eliminated when the replacement work is finished at 34th Street-Herald Square, said M.T.A. spokesman Jon Weinstein. The estimated completion date is June 2018. That interlocking is one of 183 across the entire subway system, and one of at least 17 the M.T.A. has identified in recent years as needing work.Signal problems happened every day in June. In recent years, union officials and transit workers say, the authority has struggled with the basics of keeping the system in good repair. But at least one effort to ease the problem resulted in unintended consequences.When Mr. Cuomo declared a state of emergency, he also directed the state Public Service Commission to oversee Consolidated Edison\u2019s efforts to shore up the subway\u2019s power supply. The process required hiring contractors to inspect and repair relay equipment, signals, cables, track circuits and other key parts.Because work cannot be done on or near the tracks without transit employees acting as \u201cflaggers,\u201d essentially lookouts for oncoming trains, and because there is a shortage of lower-level workers to act as flaggers, skilled signal maintainers were pressed into this task, current and former employees said.John Chiarello, a subway signal maintainer and representative in Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said about 10 percent of the transit authority\u2019s signal maintainers, who are specially trained to take apart and put back together some of the most complex pieces of the subway, were working as support for contractors in November.Mr. Weinstein said the M.T.A.\u2019s subway action plan is \u201caccelerating signal inspection, maintenance and upgrade projects throughout the system\u201d and added that even if maintainers were acting as flaggers, critical work was being done. \u201cWhat matters is that more qualified people than ever before are now working to inspect and maintain signal and power components in the subway,\u201d he said.Not long before the June 20 electrical breakdown, the M.T.A. cut more than $400 million from its proposed signal funding and added money to pay for station enhancements and other improvements that are priorities of Governor Cuomo.Mr. Weinstein said the reduction had nothing to do with the governor and resulted from changes in planned signal work.It was the most recent instance of transit leaders focusing on expenditures such as new subway stations, countdown clocks and Wi-Fi, which improve the rider experience but are small solace to those trapped in stopped trains.Peter S. Kalikow, a former M.T.A. chairman, said keeping the subway in good condition required constant vigilance, though that work receives less attention.\u201cIf you dedicate the Hoyt-Schermerhorn pump room,\u201d Mr. Kalikow said, \u201cyou think you get a press conference and anybody shows up?\u201dRecords show that the authority\u2019s signal maintainer work force also has not kept pace with the subway\u2019s demands.The number of signal problems rose from 2012 to 2016, but the transit authority added just 57 signal maintainers during that period.Transit leaders also began requiring less frequent inspections of signals in the late 1990s because of a worker shortage, and they never restored the cuts, according to the transit union. Twenty years ago, workers had to inspect signals, many of which date to World War II, every 30 days. Today signals are inspected every 90 days.The authority also, until recently, offered no standard guidance in how to perform preventive maintenance on the antiquated equipment \u2014 and instead left new maintainers to learn on the job, the transit union said. Mr. Weinstein denied that the M.T.A. was not training its workers in basic skills. But current and former signal workers said it was the case.\u201cThe training aspect was limited to a book the manufacturer puts out, \u2018Grease this, grease that, put oil here, put oil there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chiarello said. \u201cSo you would get that, but there wasn\u2019t anything formal. You weren\u2019t trained to do maintenance.\u201dNow the authority is making a concerted effort to improve training, Mr. Chiarello said.When the authority hires new maintainers, it often cannot keep them for long. Subway signal maintainers toil in dark, rat-infested tunnels, are often called on to work overtime and are paid far less than what they could earn in the private sector. They earn about $35 an hour; an electrician with similar skills can make $60 an hour elsewhere.Even if the M.T.A. were to solve all its problems with signals and track, there would still be the trouble caused by failing subway cars.The Times found that more than 300 car equipment breakdowns caused about 2,200 delays in June.And the M.T.A. actually recorded more delay-causing incidents involving broken guard lights \u2014 the indicators on the sides of trains that tell conductors if doors fail to close or lock \u2014 than signal malfunctions.The subway\u2019s 6,400-car stable is perhaps the most intensely used rail fleet in the nation, yet car maintenance was one of the first places transit leaders looked to save money during the Great Recession.They stretched the maintenance cycle for most subway cars from about once every 10,000 miles to about once every 11,000 miles, and began putting off major overhauls.Soon after, breakdowns went on a steep rise \u2014 a startling development, after an era of major improvements when reliability increased for 20 consecutive years and doubled every five to seven years. Now, though, reliability \u2014 measured by how far a car travels between failures \u2014 has declined for five years in a row, and in 2016 was more than one-third lower than its peak in 2005, according to the state comptroller. The decline has been so sharp that even cars bought in the past 10 years are breaking down as often as some that went into service 25 years ago.Inside the authority\u2019s 14 maintenance centers and two major overhaul shops, the culture puts a premium on turning cars around quickly, former employees said.Kevaughn Hammond, 26, a former subway car inspector who left New York City Transit last year, said he was often asked to cut corners.\u201cThese trains run through the city, and they are filthy and caked with grease,\u201d said Mr. Hammond, who became a pilot in the Army. \u201cThey just try to get it out to put it into service. When you\u2019re not fixing everything you can, and you\u2019re just trying to make numbers, when it actually breaks, it breaks. Then a train is out of service for a longer time.\u201dMr. Weinstein denied that car equipment workers are encouraged to skimp on maintenance and said most of them take pride in their work.No single event or choice plunged the subway system into disrepair. Today\u2019s maintenance problems stem from a collision of bad luck and poor decision making.The 2008 recession took a major hit to the authority\u2019s finances, prompting officials to relax maintenance procedures and to cut hundreds of front-line workers. As the economy rebounded, leaders did not restore the cuts, even as train delays skyrocketed. The number of subway maintenance workers fell to 15,558 in 2010, from 16,497 in 2008, according to the authority\u2019s financial documents. Mr. Weinstein called those numbers a \u201cselective snapshot\u201d and added that the M.T.A. has added maintenance workers since 2010.\u201cThe difficult choices you make during a crisis aren\u2019t necessarily the same choices you make when times are good,\u201d Mr. Walder said.Hurricane Sandy put an enormous strain on the system\u2019s already fragile infrastructure, and the M.T.A.\u2019s all-hands response to the storm saved critical pieces of the subway from damage \u2014 but it meant less time and resources for other, less pressing maintenance needs, current and former employees said.There was also, in the midst of the financial crisis and just before the storm, a series of changes to the transit authority\u2019s management structure that created confusion and needlessly set maintenance back, according to interviews with five former transit leaders.In 2009, Howard H. Roberts Jr., then the president of the New York City Transit Authority, put a general manager in charge of operating and maintaining each subway line, essentially making lines their own stand-alone railroads. It was modeled after his reorganization of the authority\u2019s bus system in the 1980s, a management structure that is still in use today.Critics of the plan said it did not work as well on the subway because, unlike bus operators, subway operators are responsible for maintaining traffic signals and the tracks trains ride on. They said it caused confusion among maintenance workers in areas where multiple lines came together and that it sometimes led to arguments over whose line would pay for replacing key track parts.They also said general managers prioritized running trains over interrupting service for time-consuming maintenance jobs.\u201cIt was flawed from the beginning. It led to confusion for transit workers, but particularly for bosses about not only how to maintain the system but about how to procure supplies,\u201d said Mr. Samuelsen, the former transit union president. \u201cIt blurred lines of responsibility.\u201dMr. Weinstein downplayed the effects of the changes, calling them \u201ca managerial reorganization with little impact upon maintainers and their day-to-day tasks.\u201dMr. Roberts and his supporters denied that the new model caused maintenance problems and said the plan \u2014 which was discontinued after barely a year \u2014 was not given enough time to succeed.And, offering a glimpse at the kinds of divisions and disagreements that can occur among the city\u2019s transit managers, they countered that throwing out the general manager model contributed to this year\u2019s problems with signals and track, not the other way around.\u201cYou just put error on top of error on top of error, and you end up where we are today,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cAnd again, it\u2019s going to get worse, much worse, as time goes on.\u201dJim Dwyer and Vivian Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "There Is a Water Crisis in Cape Town. Travelers Should Be Prepared (and Can Help).", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisitors will be alerted to the need for conservation when they land at the airport. The city and hotels are encouraging sustainable practices.Thanks to its famous coastline and peninsular setting, tourists in Cape Town expect that they will be surrounded by water \u2014 and lots of it. But as visitors have descended this month for the peak summer tourist season, they have been greeted at the airport with signs beseeching them to \u201cSlow the flow: Save H2O\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t waste a drop!\u201d among others.\u201cThe city of Cape Town could conceivably become the first major city in the world to run out of water, and that could happen in the next four months,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Turton, a professor at the Centre for Environmental Management at the University of the Free State. \u201cIt\u2019s not an impending crisis \u2014 we\u2019re deep, deep, deep in crisis.\u201dAs the city races to implement alternatives through recycling, boreholes and desalination by February, residents are restricted to 87 liters (23 gallons) of water per person per day. \u201cWe are all in this together and we can only save water while there is still water to be saved,\u201d Zara Nicholson, the spokeswoman for Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille, said in an email. Residents are asked to meet that number by limiting showers to two minutes, turning off taps while brushing teeth, avoiding flushing toilets regularly (\u201cIf it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow,\u201d as one sign puts it) and using recycled water when they do, not watering gardens or topping off swimming pools, and using hand sanitizer instead of soap and water. But as the city struggles to hit a household consumption target of less than 500 million liters per day, anxiety continues to build. Despite the gravity of the situation, officials say that visitors are welcome. \u201cThe City of Cape Town certainly welcomes and encourages all tourists to Cape Town to visit our beautiful iconic city,\u201d Ms. Nicholson wrote. \u201cTourism is a major job creator and one our most important sectors.\u201dAbout 150,000 people, or 10 percent of the city\u2019s 1.5 million annual foreign visitors, visit Cape Town in December, but many tourists are unaware of the severity of the situation until they hear pilots making announcements just before landing at Cape Town International Airport. Experts say there\u2019s no reason for travelers to stay away, but raising awareness and water consciousness is essential. Ms. Scriven pointed out that the surge in tourists does not correlate to a surge in water consumption \u2014 many Capetonians leave the city for the holidays and the construction industry shuts down; tourists only represent a 1 to 3 percent increase in population during the season. But the travel industry is encouraging sustainable practices for all, locals and visitors alike: hotels send notices upon booking and add signage asking guests to be conscientious during stays, while also removing bath plugs, installing new shower heads that reduce water flow, adding timers to help guests keep showers under two minutes, and refraining from daily linen changes. \u201cNow do you see this beautiful bath? It\u2019s now a sculpture,\u201d the Airbnb host Alison von During said she tells her guests as she shows them around, before briefing them on the water restrictions.Although things may change if Day Zero becomes a reality, for now travelers are encouraged to be respectful of the crisis while still enjoying a visit to one of the world\u2019s most beautiful cities \u2014 the income generated by tourism is not something South Africa can afford to lose, as tourism accounts for 9.4 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. \u201cThe tourist dollar is lifeblood of economy, and we obviously don\u2019t want send out a symbol that the city is going to collapse,\u201d Dr. Turton said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that all tourists become hyperaware that there is a serious water crisis, but I don\u2019t think we want them to have a bad experience as a result of that. We want to appeal to the tourists\u2019 conscience, to enjoy the city but do the right thing by the local community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are Mutual Fund Fees So High? This Billionaire Knows", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe billionaire investor Ronald S. Baron flashed the grin of a proud father at his annual investor jamboree in November, as the chief executives of his favorite companies explained how slashing prices stoked their bottom lines.That is, until a shareholder in one of his mutual funds drew an awkward parallel.\u201cExcuse me \u2014 Schwab is charging a very low fee,\u201d a woman pointed out, after a presentation by Walter W. Bettinger II, the chief executive of the discount broker Charles Schwab. \u201cGod bless him, but no one ever said Baron\u2019s fees are little.\u201dYou can say that again.Mr. Baron\u2019s mutual funds charge some of the higher investment fees around, and the fees have held steady despite a $1 trillion exodus out of old-school mutual funds into cheaper, better performing rivals that track a variety of indexes and investment styles.In a global economy where competition and Amazonian price destruction have forced companies to cater to cost-wary customers, the mutual fund industry is a rare outlier. Fees on most actively managed mutual funds, which house the retirement savings and other assets of millions of Americans, have barely budged.The reasons for that \u2014 quiescent mutual fund boards, complacent investors and a general unwillingness to call a halt to one of the great gravy trains in financial history \u2014 are all visible inside Mr. Baron\u2019s fund family.The Baron Funds group manages $26.4 billion in assets on behalf of hundreds of thousands of small and large investors. An old-fashioned stock picker, Mr. Baron achieved renown in the 1990s and the 2000s for successfully betting on small companies.But his performance has suffered in recent years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, his flagship fund, Baron Growth, trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by an average of seven percentage points.This year, the results have been better: He is up 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for the S. & P.The 13 Baron funds impose fees that were 54 percent higher than last year\u2019s industry average \u2014 and vastly higher than what a comparable exchange-traded fund would charge.In November, Baron reduced fees on three of its smaller funds. But the largest, Baron Growth, with $6.3 billion in assets, still charges 1.3 percent of assets. That is a third higher than the median level for similar funds, according to Morningstar.Since 2010, investors have withdrawn, in net terms, just over $5 billion from the growth fund, according to Morningstar. But many have stuck around.Mr. Baron, 74, is perhaps best known for his annual investment conference, now held at the Metropolitan Opera House at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center and in its 26th year. Mixing rock stars, pop entertainment (Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney have performed in the past), patriotism (this year celebrated the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth) and triumphant chief executives, the gala is a giddy ode to American capitalism.Few fund companies offer a comparable perk, and some 5,000 Baron fund holders travel to New York to attend.At the conference in November, with markets hitting new highs each day, investors were exultant. But there was a lingering concern.\u201cThe fees are very high,\u201d one man said to a friend as they exited the Chris Rock comedy show. \u201cYou really have to have the market go up to do well.\u201dEven longtime fans acknowledge they are paying up.\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhen the shareholder asked Mr. Baron why his rates were so much higher than Schwab\u2019s, the audience response was telling: The opera hall erupted in sympathetic laughter \u2014 and applause.Mr. Baron has been getting flak for his funds\u2019 high costs for years.Mr. Baron is unapologetic about the high fees. He argues that his skills and experience \u2014 and the arduous task of researching small growth companies \u2014 justify the fees.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dBut if you want to bet on American growth stocks, \u201cyou can double your money in 10 years,\u201d he said. He frequently sticks with his top picks for decades.While this year has been stellar, over a longer stretch his performance is less robust.Mr. Baron believes that the true measure of his success is performance since his fund\u2019s launch in 1994. A $10,000 investment in his main fund then would be worth $163,207 today, according to Baron data. That compares with $57,889 for the Russell growth index and $84,904 for the S. & P. 500, per Baron.Mr. Baron\u2019s funds are not the only ones refusing to budge on fees. In fact, the average fee for 2,000 actively managed mutual funds has remained 0.84 percent of total assets for the past three years, according to Morningstar.Some, like the Capital Group and Fidelity, have gotten the message and have reduced their fees over this period.Industry experts say there are several reasons that active mutual fund fees have not succumbed to broader pricing trends in the economy.The first is their power. While more than $1 trillion has left higher-fee funds in favor of passive competitors, that still leaves some $10 trillion. That generates about $100 billion in fees for fund companies. And it suggests they don\u2019t need to cut fees to retain assets.It\u2019s dizzyingly complicated for investors to figure out what fees they\u2019re paying. With funds\u2019 multiple share classes, varying structures and oceans of boilerplate, even sophisticated investors may not realize they are paying up for a laggard.Another reason for elevated fees, experts say, is lax oversight.Every mutual fund is overseen by a board of trustees \u2014 a mix of executives from the fund company and mostly independent officers that must, by law, look out for investors\u2019 interests.But are these boards truly effective advocates for investors?A number of lawsuits brought against major investment companies, including Axa, BlackRock and Pimco, allege that trustees are not pushing hard enough for lower fees. The judge overseeing the BlackRock case in 2015 declined to dismiss the suit, saying the allegations raised questions about \u201crubber stamping\u201d by boards.BlackRock has said the suit lacks merit.At the Baron fund family, the fee oversight is complicated by the fact that Mr. Baron, the largest shareholder in the investment company and the manager of its largest fund, has a financial incentive to keep fees high. In addition to his salary and bonus, tied to performance among other measures, he gets a reward based on a percentage of the fees his funds bring in, according to regulatory filings.That is unusual. At most fund companies, compensation packages reward managers for beating their benchmarks \u2014 not collecting fees.While the average age for independent mutual fund directors is 66, some directors stay on boards into their 80s and even 90s. Such long tenures often make directors weak voices for investors, he said.Baron funds are overseen by nine directors. Seven are listed as independent. Four of those seven have served as trustees since Mr. Baron established his first funds 30 years ago.One of them, David A. Silverman, has zero financial experience: He is a doctor with an expertise in infectious diseases.The lead independent trustee, Raymond Noveck, worked as a managing director at Baron from 1985 to 1987.\u201cTrustees have very little incentive to fight managers,\u201d Mr. Birdthistle said. \u201cKicking and scratching is unlikely to lower fees but certainly will antagonize the manager, which is the one institution that can arrange for the trustees\u2019 dismissal. Besides, trustees will tell themselves, if a fund\u2019s fees really are too high, the market will sort things out and investors simply won\u2019t invest in the fund.\u201dThe board has taken steps to recruit trustees with bulkier backgrounds, most recently Tom Folliard, a former chief executive of CarMax.In a statement, Baron Funds said that it regularly assessed its board\u2019s effectiveness and that the long tenure of some members was a sign of the board\u2019s experience and expertise. It said fees were approved via data and analysis from an outside party. The board also said it was represented by an independent lawyer.One clear winner of this arrangement is Mr. Baron. \u201cIn 1970, my net worth was minus $15,000,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cNow my children and I have over $670 million invested in our funds.\u201dForbes pegs his wealth at just over $2 billion \u2014 and he is not shy about showing it off.His office in Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building is a museum of trophies and curiosities, from paintings by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to Kennedy\u2019s rocking chair. He has invested about $150 million in a 59-acre beachfront estate in East Hampton, N.Y., that he bought in 2007.Mr. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy \u2014 that over the long term the stocks that he picks will keep doubling \u2014 is fired by a relentless optimism that he attributes to his life\u2019s good fortune.A grandchild of immigrants from Poland and Russia, Mr. Baron grew up scraping for extra cash in Asbury Park, N.J. He worked his way through college and law school, which he left without getting a degree.In 1982, after a stint as a Wall Street analyst, he founded his investment firm.His timing was perfect. It was the start of a bull market, and he developed an expertise in picking small companies that would grow into big ones such as Charles Schwab, Vail Management Company and Tesla.It was the heyday of the individual stock picker. Peter Lynch at Fidelity and Bill Miller at Legg Mason gained cultlike followings, accumulating billions of dollars in assets and gracing the covers of the personal finance magazines that lionized them.Mr. Baron\u2019s star power was of a lesser variety, but it was not insubstantial. He became a regular television commentator and won a reputation as the longest of long-term investors, holding positions for decades. His assets peaked at $28 billion in 2015.\u201cWe have made $23.6 billion for our clients,\u201d Mr. Baron said.But it is his annual investor gala, which he pays for himself, that defines him. Onstage, he cultivates a grandfatherly mien, bragging about how much money the chief executives of his portfolio companies made for Baron shareholders. His chief maxim is \u201cWe invest in people,\u201d and he treats management as family.There are warm bear hugs onstage for some. Others get personal advice.Spotting a top executive from the data firm FactSet, another portfolio holding, he offered to connect her with his longtime tax lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what he has done,\u201d Mr. Baron said.A surprise raffle is part of the atmospherics, and this time a Model 3 from Tesla was the grand prize. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed.As the event ended, attendees streamed out of Lincoln Center into a freezing evening. Mr. Baron, without a coat, greeted them on the plaza. He hugged and kissed old friends and posed for selfies with new ones.Nobody complained about the fees.An earlier version of this article misstated how the iShares Russell 2000 Growth fund performed over a five-year period. It is up 15 percent, not 96 percent.Advertisement"}

He said they should listen more to constituents, renew political leadership and draw closer to social movements.Mr. Guillier vowed to help lead a \u201cconstructive opposition\u201d in Congress to defend the \u201creforms we believe in.\u201dMr. Pi\u00f1era, a 68-year-old billionaire who governed Chile from 2010 to 2014 \u2014 having been both preceded and succeeded by Ms. Bachelet \u2014 moved to the right politically as he campaigned for a second term in this deeply polarized nation.Chile\u2019s presidential election is the first in a series that may alter the political trajectory of Latin America. Voters in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay will elect presidents in 2018.\u201cChile is helping kick off a year of important elections throughout the region, and many of the divides seen there will be repeated in their own way in the races to come,\u201d said Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, a Latin America expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cToday\u2019s election pits not just the left versus right for the presidency, but also reflects a lighter version of the insider-outsider drama that is developing in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil.\u201dThroughout the race, many voters in Chile expressed deep dissatisfaction with the political establishment and described their choice as one between the lesser of two evils.\u201cWe lack a person that sparks enthusiasm in the country,\u201d said Julio Salviat, a university professor and former sports journalist. \u201cWe\u2019re voting for the least bad one, not the best. We\u2019re at a crossroads we shouldn\u2019t be in.\u201dJulio Preusser, 90, an engineer, agreed, but said he had come to see Mr. Pi\u00f1era as the most palatable.\u201cGuillier lacks a significant political trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he got to where he is. Pi\u00f1era is better prepared. I don\u2019t quite like him, but he\u2019s the least bad.\u201dSome Chileans expressed concern that Mr. Pi\u00f1era\u2019s policies would benefit wealthy Chileans at the expense of the middle class, which expanded during the Bachelet era, and the poor.\u201cThe middle class is always on the losing end, and with his victory there will be an economic project for those who have resources,\u201d said Ver\u00f3nica Soto, a nurse at a public hospital. \u201cIt will absolutely be a pro-business government.\u201dAfter performing more poorly than polls suggested he would in the first round, Mr. Pi\u00f1era made overtures to the far right, a small but animated base. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, a conservative candidate and a champion of the Pinochet dictatorship, got almost 8 percent of the vote.Mr. Pi\u00f1era promised to halt the same-sex marriage bill Ms. Bachelet introduced in August and said he would improve the conditions of military officers serving sentences for crimes against humanity.He warned that Mr. Guillier would empower the \u201cextreme left,\u201d derailing an economy that has been growing slowly and is grappling with the low international price of copper, Chile\u2019s main export.Yet, the left retains substantial appeal in Chile. Center and leftist candidates captured a total of 42 percent of the vote in November, although some factions felt Ms. Bachelet\u2019s reforms didn\u2019t go far enough.Mr. Guillier won 22 percent of the vote during the first round. Beatr\u00edz S\u00e1nchez, a journalist who led the leftist Frente Amplio coalition, exceeded expectations, coming a close third with 20 percent of the vote.\u201cThe Frente Amplio votes were not in support of Bachelet\u2019s reforms, but rather in protest of the New Majority and how it has handled them,\u201d said Roberto Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile.The vote appears to mark the end of the political career of Ms. Bachelet, a transformative leader who championed women\u2019s rights at home and abroad and set in motion comprehensive economic and social reforms.She will leave office in March as the last woman leading a government in the Americas.Under Ms. Bachelet\u2019s leadership, higher taxes were levied on large corporations to pay for free higher education for low-income students; abortion in some circumstances was legalized; and union rights were strengthened.And a new electoral system approved during her government loosened the grip on political power that traditional parties enjoyed, opening the door to greater participation by minority parties, women and independents.Ms. Bachelet also set in motion a process to reform the Pinochet-era Constitution and the private pension system.Mr. Pi\u00f1era accused her government of scaring off investors, deepening the public debt and sending Chile\u2019s economy on a downward spiral. He promised to reverse some of these changes and to spur the economy by reducing state bureaucracy, offering incentives to investors, lowering taxes on corporate earnings and spending more on infrastructure projects.His government, however, will face significant hurdles in Congress, where his coalition of parties did not win a majority in the November elections.As of March, for the first time since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1990, with the appearance of the Frente Amplio, politics will not be dominated by the same two coalitions, and the composition of Congress will be younger, more female and politically diverse.Ms. Bachelet congratulated Mr. Pi\u00f1era during a call Sunday night, and agreed to meet him for breakfast on Monday to start coordinating a transition of power. The president-elect said he hoped he could count on Ms. Bachelet\u2019s \u201cexperience and wisdom.\u201d And he told her he was envious of the new chapter in her life.\u201cYou will be able to rest and enjoy life,\u201d he told her.Pascale Bonnefoy reported from Santiago, and Ernesto Londo\u00f1o from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Launching (and Scrapping) of Navy Ships, a New Mission", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetKEARNY, N.J. \u2014 Though small, this town has played an aircraft-carrier-size role in naval history.Numerous warships set sail from the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company here on the Hackensack River. And after tours in areas like the South Pacific and Korea, famous vessels were sliced up and sold as scrap here, too.\u201cWe had a decision to make,\u201d said Wendy Kelman Neu, the chief executive of the Hugo Neu Corporation, the landlord, referring to the time after Hurricane Sandy swept through in 2012. \u201cWhat should we do with the site? What could we do that would be transformative?\u201dThe storm significantly damaged the property, which then housed the types of businesses one might associate with a gritty industrial parcel in a remote corner of the Meadowlands: a trucking company, an electrical-inspection firm and a nut importer.Adding smaller-scale offices and workshops, plus stores, a food hall and public parks \u2014 as well as better flood protections \u2014 was a bet made with an eye on the modern economy, Ms. Neu said. A decline in the electronics-recycling industry, a previous Hugo Neu business, was also a factor, company executives said.Hugo Neu started its $1 billion, seven-year project in 2014. Through a combination of razing some crumbling structures and renovating others, the company hopes to eventually remake its entire 130-acre property.The initial step was gutting a four-story, 1930s warehouse and renovating it as an office building by polishing its concrete floors, installing a stylish ground-floor bistro and creating a roof deck with Manhattan views. The family-owned Hugo Neu tapped its own reserves for the $30 million renovation, said Steve Nislick, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Today, the 160,000-square-foot structure, called Building 78, is home to around 175 companies with berths from 120 square feet to 12,000 square feet, Mr. Nislick said.Rents at the building, which is 95 percent leased, range from $14 to $25 a square foot, steeper than rates for comparable real estate in nearby Newark but below the average in Brooklyn. Tenants at Building 78, including several manufacturers, can opt for leases as short as six months, somewhat unusual in commercial real estate.Started in Jersey City in 2015, when the company used a deli\u2019s kitchen after hours to make its desserts, Elements Truffles moved to a 400-square-foot room in Kearny in March of last year.Three months later, the company traded up to an 800-square-foot space, said Ms. Vasa, who added that landlords elsewhere had wanted inflexible 10-year leases.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to make a big investment in real estate and stress about it,\u201d Ms. Vasa said, \u201cbut grow as the business grows.\u201dRelying on start-ups as tenants can be a risky approach for a real estate venture, said David E. Thurston, a vice president of the brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap based in New Jersey, who has handled industrial deals.\u201cA landlord is most interested in steady income,\u201d he said. \u201cA plumbing company, even a guy who just wants to park his trucks, can be more advantageous.\u201dSimilarly, banks that underwrite redevelopment projects can be skittish if a property has few demonstrable long-term tenants, said Mr. Thurston, who is not involved with the project.Yet despite its infusion of small entrepreneurs, Kearny Point is not showing its larger tenants the door.\u201cWe want a mix,\u201d Mr. Nislick said. \u201cSmall tenants bring more energy.\u201dHugo Neu picked up the $26 million tab for the second major project at Kearny Point, Building 197, a 197,000-square-foot development to open next year.Mr. Nislick said he was also talking to lenders about helping fund the repurposing of a third site, a towering 150,000-square-foot column-lined structure where ship boilers were made, with a ceiling 62 feet high.As housing nibbles away at manufacturing zones and the military has less demand for an armada, former naval facilities have become tempting targets for redevelopment, even if they are sometimes in out-of-the-way locations.Once employing about 70,000, the yard has about 7,000 workers today.Three other federally owned naval yards \u2014 in Kittery, Me.; Portsmouth, Va.; and Washington \u2014 have more traditional maritime uses.\u201cOne of the great things about the redevelopment of the Navy yards is that there\u2019s been so much preservation of the historic character,\u201d said Andrew Gustafson, who has led tours of the Brooklyn Navy Yard since 2010. \u201cThe history\u2019s a selling point. It makes the place unique and attractive.\u201dA visit helps convey the vastness of Kearny\u2019s shipbuilding operation, which at its peak during World War II churned out a finished ship every six days courtesy of 35,000 employees, according to Hugo Neu.Later, scores of ships were also dismantled at the site, like the Essex, an aircraft carrier that earned 17 battle stars for its service in World War II and the Korean War. In 1975, Hugo Neu workers chopped up the 28,200-ton giant and sold the pieces for scrap.Advertisement"}

It has been prepared with little transparency, significant input from lobbyists and considerable misrepresentation. We have no idea how much this bill will cost us, but I am sure it will be more than the $1.5 trillion we have been told.The major beneficiaries of this bill are large corporations, the real estate industry and the wealthiest Americans. Corporations will spend these savings on stock buybacks and dividends to drive up the price of their stock and options \u2014 none of which generate jobs.A period of low unemployment and rising wages is absolutely the wrong time to create a huge federal deficit. We should be paying down prior debt used to stimulate the economy.This bill is a payoff to the financial supporters of members of Congress, and we are footing the bill. Our government is going into debt to transfer more wealth to the wealthy. This is crazy and irresponsible.RICHARD L. HECHT, WHITE PLAINSThe writer is a certified public accountant.To the Editor:There are two ways to increase the deficit over the next 10 years.One way is to spend a trillion dollars on social programs, infrastructure and finding ways to improve health care and education. That would promote positive economic activity and create jobs.The other way is to cut taxes on corporations and the rich. That would cut funding for social programs, health care and education, and our infrastructure would continue to crumble. The impact on the economy and jobs is questionable.We have picked the wrong way.To the Editor:As a former registered Republican voter, now an independent, I question whether there are any Republican members of Congress who are representing their constituents and not their donors. They have proposed two disastrous pieces of legislation, a health care bill (which fortunately failed), and a tax bill, which provides most of the benefits to the top income earners and corporations.I hope voters remember how the Republicans in Congress value them when they go to the polls next year.KAREN COFFEY, WESTWOOD, MASS.To the Editor:Yes, the people are \u201chopping mad,\u201d and this is exactly the climate that will foster a wave of authentic populism among an electorate that overwhelmingly believes in progressive taxation. The opportunity for a populist uprising was missed in 2008 during the Great Recession, which was caused by the reckless and criminal behavior of Wall Street.The appropriate anger that swept the populace at that time was cleverly directed away from the financial community and redirected against government by the Tea Party folks.

{"Headline": "Ikea Is Focus of European Inquiry Over Possible Skirting of Tax Bills", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIngvar Kamprad, the founder of the global furniture retailer Ikea, is known for buying his clothes at flea markets, driving an old Volvo and flying only economy class. Although he is a billionaire many times over, he revels in his reputation for saving money.Now, European regulators are accusing Mr. Kamprad\u2019s company of pushing the concept of thriftiness beyond the limits of the law by maneuvering to reduce its tax bill in the countries where it operates.Although Ikea is Swedish \u2014 the acronym combines Mr. Kamprad\u2019s initials with those representing the bucolic area of the country where he grew up \u2014 the company is effectively owned by a Dutch trust controlled by the Kamprad family, with various holding companies handling its franchising, manufacturing and distribution operations.The arrangement is designed to ensure maximum financial independence for Ikea, Mr. Kamprad has said.On Monday, in a separate statement issued in response to the regulators\u2019 accusations, Ikea said it was \u201ccommitted to paying taxes in accordance with laws and regulations wherever we operate.\u201d It said it had operated \u201cin accordance with E.U. rules\u201d and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry.Mr. Kamprad established the parent company, now called Inter Ikea, in the 1980s in the Netherlands, a country with attractive tax structures that have attracted Apple, Starbucks and many of the world\u2019s biggest multinational companies. Using a Dutch subsidiary, Inter Ikea Systems, Inter Ikea collects fees from Ikea\u2019s franchise businesses around the world equal to 3 percent of the revenue from all Ikea stores.European regulators say that Ikea received a favorable ruling from Dutch tax authorities in 2006 that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of those franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to another company that Ikea created in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Investigators are also examining how Ikea got a second favorable ruling from the Dutch authorities in 2011, after European regulators deemed the Luxembourg tax structure illegal under the European Union\u2019s rules prohibiting companies from receiving state aid. That ruling endorsed a model that let Inter Ikea send a substantial portion of its franchise profit, via interest paid under an intercompany loan, to a company based in Liechtenstein.The case is similar to one that Ms. Vestager brought against Starbucks in 2015. At issue were tax rulings, also issued by Dutch authorities, that she said helped the company artificially reduce its tax burden, an arrangement that ran afoul of the bloc\u2019s state aid rules.In addition to targeting companies like Ikea and Starbucks directly, Ms. Vestager has focused on employing a separate legal tactic to pursue countries that may be providing state aid to companies through special tax rulings. The rulings, known as comfort letters, often help the companies find the most favorable tax jurisdiction.The Ikea inquiry is the latest investigation by European regulators since 2013 into the tax structures of multinational companies operating in Europe and how local tax authorities treat them.The European Commission has ordered several members of the 28-nation bloc to collect billions of euros in back taxes from companies such as Amazon, Apple, Fiat and Starbucks.The commission is also investigating Luxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019s and Engie, the French power utility formerly known as GDF Suez, and a British tax program for multinational companies.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In developed countries where parental leave is guaranteed by law and governments ensure free child care, women work at a much higher rate than in the United States.Still, the consensus is incomplete. It misses perhaps the most significant impediment to women\u2019s continued engagement in the labor market, one that is getting tougher with each passing year: aging. Focused laserlike on child care, we haven\u2019t noticed that the United States is walking into an elder-care crisis.Today almost 15 percent of the American population has reached the official retirement age, according to figures from the United Nations.

It means that for every four Americans of working age, there is one of retirement age, the World Bank says.Lots of these older Americans \u2014 14 million, according to Paul Osterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management \u2014 can\u2019t live independently and care for themselves.Sean Fahle of the State University of New York at Buffalo and Kathleen McGarry of the University of California, Los Angeles, tracked women in their early 50s to their early 60s for 20 years. Those who provided care, they found, were 8 percent less likely to work. Those at work cut their hours and had lower wage growth. Over time, Professor McGarry told me, caregivers risked lower incomes and a higher risk of poverty in old age.This is expensive. Older Americans may be healthier than ever. Still, as they age, they will inevitably develop disabilities and chronic conditions like dementia. \u201cIf you are superwealthy and can afford all sorts of things, this is not an issue,\u201d noted Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cBut if you are middle class, this tends to end with your relatives\u2019 losing all of their assets and relying on Medicaid or family care.\u201dThese pressures may draw more men to take responsibility for care. So far, though, experience suggests the burden will fall mainly on women.Unlike the boomers now taking care of their parents, their millennial children will not have as many siblings to help care for their parents. Higher divorce rates imply that many aging boomers will have no spouse to care for them, putting additional demands on their children. And the elderly of the future are going to live longer, which suggests there will be a lot of caregivers well into their 50s juggling work with care for their children and their parents.But there is a broader societal challenge: how to fit a social safety net built in the 1930s, when wives stayed at home and life expectancy was 20 years shorter, into a world in which husbands and wives must juggle work with the demand for care from their elders and their children.It is probably na\u00efve to harbor these thoughts just as Republicans in Congress and the White House are engineering a tax cut for corporations and wealthy Americans that will reduce government revenue by $1 trillion over a decade. It may sound crazy to say this just as Republican leaders are turning their sights on the next step of the strategy: cutting spending on programs like Medicaid and Medicare to pay for the tax effort. But perhaps this is time to beef up the safety net to incorporate the rising demand for care.Ai-Jen Poo, co-director of Caring Across Generations, a coalition of advocacy groups pushing for an expansion of public insurance to incorporate universal care, notes that private insurers are not the solution: They can\u2019t cobble together a big enough risk pool to cover the enormous cost of care for everyone. \u201cAll the insurance companies are trying to get out of that market,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a problem that the market can\u2019t solve.\u201dAnd if prime-age women start leaving the work force in even higher numbers to care for their aging parents, this will also be a problem for the American economy.Advertisement"}

African-Americans got shortchanged by agencies that administered the G.I. Bill; private colleges kept control of their admissions policies; and minorities continued to face exclusion and quotas. (Goldfield\u2019s pages are filled with freshly unearthed nuggets, like the fact that in 1951, American Airlines ordered its ticket agents to segregate passengers.) Nor were these gifts guaranteed to last: For instance, in terms of careers and incomes, children no longer do better than their parents, numbers that declined sharply between 1940 and 1980.Goldfield, the Robert Lee Bailey professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has a romantic view of three presidents who, apart from having been reared in rural America, could not have been less alike: Harry Truman, a New Deal Democrat, forced (after the sudden death of Franklin D. Roosevelt) to come to terms with postwar America; Dwight D. Eisenhower, Truman\u2019s successor, a five-star general and middle-of-the-road Republican, who preserved the status quo; and Lyndon B. Johnson, a Texan, whose presidency promoted antipoverty programs as well as major advances in civil rights and health care, but who was consumed by the divisive Vietnam War. All three, Goldfield believes, moved the government \u201cto extend the pursuit of happiness to a broader population,\u201d and all three \u201cperceived that the nation could not be whole until everyone had the opportunity to succeed. They knew from personal experience that government was not only good but also necessary to address society\u2019s inequalities.\u201dIn a style that often relies on bold assertions, Goldfield is bound to assert some clunkers. For instance, while it\u2019s true that Truman, as a senator, attended some of Justice Louis Brandeis\u2019s celebrated \u201cteas,\u201d and that both were suspicious of Wall Street, the claim that it was \u201cperhaps\u201d Truman\u2019s \u201cclosest friendship\u201d is insupportable, even with the \u201cperhaps\u201d qualifier. When he writes that Jack Kerouac\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d was \u201cthe 20th-century version of \u2018Huckleberry Finn,\u2019 of \u2018lighting out for the territory,\u2019\u201d one can only wonder why his editor didn\u2019t stop him.Still, Goldfield is right to point to the risks of government\u2019s increasingly recessive role, and to make one worry how it will play out by the time the millennials become grandparents. \u201cThe major difference between the time the gifted generation came of age and the present is that the federal government\u2019s role as the great umpire, the leveler, has diminished,\u201d he writes. That carries with it the suggestion that, without an umpire, a society may be forced to function without the rules that help to guarantee order, fairness and, as the Constitution put it so well, \u201cthe general welfare.\u201dJeffrey Frank\u2019s latest book is \u201cIke and Dick: Portrait of a Strange Political Marriage.\u201d He is working on a book about Harry Truman \u2014 his era and his circle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW Chief Breaks Ranks on Diesel, Suggesting End to Subsidies", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chief executive of Volkswagen said on Sunday that the German government should consider phasing out the subsidies that encourage Europeans to buy diesel cars, a startling change of position by the company largely responsible for diesel\u2019s popularity in Europe.Mr. M\u00fcller is the first German auto boss to publicly suggest that the government should stop subsidizing diesel, a step that would certainly hasten the technology\u2019s demise. Though cautiously formulated, his comments represented a major turnaround.Mr. M\u00fcller\u2019s statement to Handelsblatt caused a minor sensation in Germany.\u201cThe government is being urged to phase out diesel subsidies by none other than the biggest diesel fraudster,\u201d Tobias Austrup, a transportation expert for Greenpeace, the environmental activist group, said in a statement.Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who has frequently been critical of Volkswagen, said that \u201cif there was a Nobel Prize for company bosses, M\u00fcller would earn it.\u201dMr. M\u00fcller stopped short of calling for a quick end to the subsidies, and he may have just been acknowledging reality. Until last year, more than half of all cars sold in Europe were diesels, which were marketed as being not only economical but also environmentally friendly.But diesel began to lose popularity after studies by the governments of France, Germany and Britain showed that the diesel cars from almost all manufacturers polluted much more than advertised. Though only Volkswagen has been accused of criminal behavior, many others exploited weak enforcement and loopholes in regulations. As a result, European cities like Madrid or Athens often have unhealthy levels of nitrogen oxides, which can cause asthma and lung cancer.In another break from his peers, Mr. M\u00fcller said on Sunday that he was in favor of banning older diesels from city centers. But he said such restrictions should not apply to newer diesels that meet stricter standards on nitrogen oxide emissions.Previously, Mr. M\u00fcller and the chief executives of BMW and Daimler insisted that diesel engines with the latest antipollution equipment were clean and that the technology still had a future.An end to diesel subsidies could fall particularly hard on BMW and Daimler because they would have trouble selling large, profitable luxury cars without the fuel economy benefits offered by diesel. Volkswagen has recently begun converting one of its German factories to produce electric cars, vowing to be the company that will make battery-powered vehicles practical and affordable for the masses.Germany and most other countries in Europe tax diesel fuel at a lower rate than gasoline, providing a powerful incentive for consumers in a region where gasoline costs $6 a gallon or more. The subsidy was based on the theory that diesel cars burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline and thus contribute less to global warming.Diesel has been fundamental to the success of German carmakers. Volkswagen was among the first manufacturers to offer affordable diesel passenger cars that did not smoke and rattle, and parlayed its technical advantage into dominance of the European car market.If diesel were taxed at the same rate as gasoline, Professor Dudenh\u00f6ffer said, the German government would collect 8 billion euros, or $9.4 billion, more in revenue.\u201cDiesel is not the future, it\u2019s the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes no sense to spend billions of tax money on the technology.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now that she\u2019s leaving, her many fans are sad to see her go.Supported byMs. Yellen, the first woman to serve as the head of the Federal Reserve Board, didn\u2019t ask to become a feminist icon, and she almost never talks about gender in the abstract or her historic role as the agency\u2019s chairman (she bristles at being called \u201cchairwoman\u201d). And yet, during a tenure characterized by a plummeting unemployment rate and consistently low inflation, Ms. Yellen became a pop culture phenomenon.Despite his unorthodox decision to replace her, even Mr. Trump has agreed that Ms. Yellen has performed well in the job. In the Rose Garden announcing Mr. Powell\u2019s nomination, the president called Ms. Yellen an \u201cabsolutely spectacular person\u201d and said she had \u201cdone a terrific job.\u201dSo, why, many women wondered, replace her with a man?\u201cJanet should\u2019ve been renominated, as every past Fed chair has been renominated for nearly the last 40 years,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the first time and certainly not the last a highly qualified woman is passed over for a job she clearly deserves.\u201dIt\u2019s a funny thing Americans have about powerful women. Voters haven\u2019t always responded to women who ask for the big jobs (see: Hillary Clinton), but when they see a woman simply doing the job \u2014 and a good one, at that \u2014 they seem happy to give her rock star status.It\u2019s true of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who has become known to many young women simply as \u201cthe Notorious RBG.\u201d And it was true of Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, traveling the world and negotiating with world leaders in a scrunchie and glasses while basking in 70 percent approval ratings. (When Mrs. Clinton was asked about her in-the-toilet favorability numbers during the 2016 presidential campaign, she said, \u201cOnce I\u2019m doing the job, we\u2019ll be back to people viewing me as the person doing the job instead of the person seeking the job.\u201d)\u201cI\u2019m the biggest Janet fangirl,\u201d said Julia Coronado, founder of the economic research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.Mr. Powell, the incoming chairman, studied closely under Ms. Yellen and is largely expected to continue the economic path she has laid. \u201cThey appointed the apprentice instead of the master,\u201d Heidi Hartmann, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, said.The change, Ms. Hartmann added, speaks to the broader problem of a lack of women represented in finance and economic policymaking. \u201cI think men have a fair amount of loyalty to other men, and the other people Trump consulted would\u2019ve been more open to a man,\u201d she said.The White House shunned any accusations of sexism playing into the decision. \u201cThe mere suggestion is an affront to Chair Yellen,\u201d the press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Described as even-keeled and soft-spoken, but fierce (\u201cPeople underestimate her at their peril,\u201d Ms. Warren said), Ms. Yellen has never inserted herself into the gender wars but by virtue of that \u201clarge I.Q.,\u201d she has inadvertently found herself in the cross hairs.The Brooklyn-born Ms. Yellen was the only woman among those earning a Ph.D. in economics at Yale in 1971. For years, she was known in academic circles as \u201cthe trailing spouse,\u201d overshadowed by her husband, George Akerlof, a Nobel-prize winning economist. The couple has a son, Robert Akerlof, who is also a highly regarded economist.This trailing spouse, however, went on to be a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the central bank\u2019s board of governors. Then, in 2013, 100 years after the Federal Reserve was founded, she made history as its first woman chair.But history making is often a messy matter. And even with her low profile, Ms. Yellen managed to kick up a central-banking storm.Mr. Obama\u2019s initial choice to steer the nation\u2019s shaky economy through the recession had been the economist Lawrence H. Summers, who had served as an adviser. But many Democrats in the Senate, including Ms. Warren, protested the move. They argued that Ms. Yellen, who had worked closely with the outgoing chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was the obvious choice.Then there was the issue of Mr. Summers, who during his time as president of Harvard had caused controversy and a suitable backlash when he argued that inherent differences between the sexes were a possible reason for the lack of female science professors.Theories abound that Ms. Yellen has been accepted \u2014 and even beloved \u2014 in a high-powered role because she has not made being a woman a central theme of her career. In contrast to Mrs. Clinton who made gender a significant part of her 2016 candidacy, Ms. Yellen has inserted the issue more subtly.\u201cYou try to make the economy better and reflect priorities of the nation, and there isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s budget,\u201d said Alice M. Rivlin, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget and as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board during the Clinton administration. \u201cI felt the same way about the Federal Reserve.\u201dWomen in the workplace have been \u201champered by barriers to equal opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life balance,\u201d Ms. Yellen said, adding that \u201cif these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy.\u201dConsidering her tenure at the Federal Reserve, economists said that having a woman in that role had brought about a more representative approach to monetary policy, even if Ms. Yellen did not emphasize an agenda intended to advance the interests of women. Several academic studies, for example, show that women economists are more likely to address inequality than their male counterparts.\u201cThe economic profession as a whole has a terrible white male problem,\u201d Ms. Coronado, said. \u201cAre you even going to ask the right questions if you have a lot of privileged people setting the agenda?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lifeboat for Student Debtors", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe national epidemic of student loan defaults is hurting the economy and casting a shadow over the lives of struggling borrowers. Their ruined credit histories work against them in the job market while also making it almost impossible for them to buy cars or homes or to save money.The federal government could help lift these burdens by making it easier for these borrowers to enroll in an existing income-driven federal student loan repayment plan that would help to keep them out of default by allowing people with low incomes or high debt \u2014 or both \u2014 to pay less each month, or nothing at all, until their financial circumstances improve.The Times investigation, based on public records requests, found that firefighters, nurses, teachers, lawyers, massage therapists, barbers, psychologists and real estate brokers have had their credentials suspended or revoked in connection with nonpayment of student loans. It also found that many state agencies and licensing boards do not even keep records on how many credentials they suspend in a given year.In one especially outrageous case, a nurse in Tennessee defaulted on her loans after epileptic seizures made it impossible for her to work. She eventually got her disorder under control but was unable to return to work because the State Nursing Board had suspended her license. The board wanted more than $1,500 to return the license \u2014 a small fortune for a person of no means.State officials argue that these licensing policies are in the best interest of taxpayers, who guarantee many student loans, and that borrowers will somehow find the money if pressed. The truth is that people who lose professional licenses or driver\u2019s licenses are often propelled deeper into poverty with no hope of ever paying off their loans.In a sensible world, the companies that are paid by the federal government to manage loan accounts and collect payments would enroll struggling borrowers in income-driven payment plans that allow them to pay only what they can afford \u2014 without penalty, before they go into default \u2014 until their financial condition improves.Meantime, the states that are making life so hard for borrowers by robbing them of the credentials they need to survive should rethink policies that drive their neediest citizens ever deeper into debt and despair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Tightens Legal Immigration, Canada Woos Tech Firms", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Flatiron district artificial intelligence start-up was recently looking to expand, adding new engineers who happened to know a niche computer language.The people it hired hail from Morocco, Belarus, France, Georgia and Canada. But they are not working in New York. They are in Montreal, where immigration policies make it possible to get work permits within two weeks, and the Canadian tech industry is aggressively trying to woo foreign companies.While much attention has been paid to President Trump\u2019s policies cracking down on illegal immigration, the administration has also moved to restrict legal immigration, especially in the tech industry, which draws many workers from abroad. In April, Mr. Trump introduced an executive order, Buy American and Hire American, which included requests to reform a visa program known as H-1B as a way to benefit American workers.The program awards 85,000 temporary visas annually to highly skilled foreign workers in what are deemed \u201cspecialty\u201d occupations through a lottery. Between application and legal fees, the process of applying for one H-1B visa can cost a company up to $6,000, lawyers say, and can take months; it is also as uncertain as roulette, with hundreds of thousands of applicants for the spots.Last week, the Department of Homeland Security published a set of proposed rule changes that would make the visas even harder to qualify for, to ensure that only \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d foreign workers were selected. It also hoped to eliminate a work permit for spouses of some of these visa holders.In 2017, the organization conducted eight international recruiting missions, in London, Paris, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Its directors have made several informal visits to New York, where it came this month to woo a video game company.Last year, trueEx\u2019s chief executive and president, Karen O\u2019Connor, was looking at options to expand the company\u2019s computer engineer group. A consortium related to Montreal International invited her to Canada for a visit that made her feel like a foreign dignitary, she said. There was the elegant lunch, the precisely coordinated meetings with potential business partners and a visit to the Montreal Stock Exchange.Ms. O\u2019Connor said the 50-person company could save more than $1 million in wages if it hired engineers based in Montreal. In part, that was because the cost of living was far less compared with New York and because the company could qualify for certain tax benefits.But after Mr. Trump was elected, trueEx hesitated, to gauge the climate; now, it is again considering expanding north of the border in 2018, Ms. O\u2019Connor said, in part because it got a spot site visit from the Department of Homeland Security this summer to verify employment records for its H-1B visa holders. They were in order, but the company\u2019s executives found the process nerve-racking.\u201cMy advice to other companies would be: Hold on for dear life, but explore other options,\u201d Mr. Hirani said.But John Miano, a lawyer who represents American workers who say that they have lost jobs unfairly to low-skilled H-1B visa holders, thought it was \u201cposturing\u201d for companies to say they are moving north of the border to find the best talent. \u201cThe problem is, you got to go to Canada,\u201d Mr. Miano said. \u201cThe reality is, the place to do business is still the United States.\u201dDatalogue\u2019s expansion to Montreal, Mr. Delisle\u2019s hometown, evolved swiftly. He and a partner founded Datalogue in 2016 at Cornell Tech in Manhattan and were lucky when a tech mogul, Charles E. Phillips Jr., the chief executive of Infor, gave him two desks on the fifth floor of Infor\u2019s elegantly restored Flatiron headquarters.By spring 2017, Datalogue had grown to five employees and had raised $1.5 million in seed funding. But to bring in more engineers would have cost thousands of dollars in visa fees, Mr. Delisle said, and even then, the process would not be guaranteed. Canada has a burgeoning artificial intelligence sector, and the company opened its Montreal office in April in the trendy Mile End neighborhood; it raised another $1.5 million in seed funding by November.Still, Mr. Delisle said that his company has better access to customers in New York, and for that reason he has kept seven employees there for sales and marketing.While tech is still thriving in New York, where it is the fastest-growing industry in the city, losing offices or whole companies to Canada could be a concern, said Kevin Ryan, an entrepreneur who had founded a half-dozen start-ups. The multiplier effect of the start-up world is a powerful one.\u201cWhen someone decides not to come here to join a start-up, and they go to Toronto, some of them may break off and start a new company across the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wider impact will be felt, literally, for decades.\u201dMr. Delisle agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily scared for New York; there\u2019s phenomenal programs there,\u201d he said. \u201cI am more scared for the broader policies being applied right now.\u201dAccording to the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group, immigration has always been central to the economy of New York. Forty-eight percent of the city\u2019s small-business owners are immigrants, and 45 percent of the work force in the city is foreign-born.\u201cThe No. 1 priority of business today is where they can get the talent they need from the global talent pool,\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the group. \u201cThere\u2019s not much a locality can do to incentivize, but we can try to keep the global pipeline open.\u201dStimulating the city economy was the impetus for New York City\u2019s Economic Development Corporation to create a program called International Innovators Initiative, or IN2NYC. The idea was to provide H-1B visas that were exempt from the government-imposed cap because entrepreneurs would work in partnership with city universities.One company that was initially rejected has appealed \u2014 and set up shop in Canada while it is waiting for a decision.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Fliers Can Relax and U.S. Airlines Can Compete: With Spas", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpas have long been a staple at airports in Europe, Asia and, especially, the Middle East, where airlines are known for over-the-top extravagance. But it has only been in the last few years that airlines in the United States have embraced them.And the spas, in turn, have been embraced by anxious fliers like Emily Lyons, chief executive of Femme Fatale Media Group, based in Toronto. \u201cI am not a good flier, very nervous,\u201d Ms. Lyons said.She took a fear of flying course, where, she said, \u201cTheir advice was to be as relaxed as possible.\u201d But it was not until she mentioned her problem to an American Express concierge that she found out about airport spas.Now, Ms. Lyons said, \u201cI like to plan my trips around any spas or other areas that can help me at all to relax. On top of being a bad flier, I\u2019m normally very busy and wouldn\u2019t get a chance to do my spa treatments.\u201dThe increasing availability of airport spas has been driven by several factors, including credit card relationships with airlines and competition for increasingly elaborate lounges as well as expanded security waiting times and the overall stressful nature of airports.Spas are split into two general types \u2014 those within airport terminal shopping areas and those that offer an air of privilege, within airline lounges and airport clubs, often accessible only to those with specialized credit cards or frequent flier memberships.Masuda Sultan, an American businesswoman based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, who also does philanthropy work with women in the developing world, said she was flying from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to Goa, India, when she discovered Etihad Airways\u2019 Six Senses Spa. \u201cI remember somebody that I was traveling with said, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the spa,\u2019 and it turned out they had free massages,\u201d Ms. Sultan said.\u201cThe fact that it was free just made you want to get it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can get a massage anywhere, but free is a special perk.\u201dShe said the massage was shorter than at a spa outside the airport, but it \u201chelped me sleep on the plane, because it got me into the relaxation mode.\u201d Massages can also help fliers deal with travel\u2019s physical strains, Ms. Sultan said. \u201cYou carry things, your luggage, your bag is heavy, your purse is heavy, your laptop. So it helps with all of that, too.\u201dEtihad has three spas in Abu Dhabi International Airport and one at London Heathrow that offer showers, beauty salons and barbers as well as massages, according to Allix Wright, a former corporate communications officer in North America for the airline. Spa sizes vary, as do treatments.Ms. Wright said first-class passengers and platinum-level frequent flier members receive one complimentary spa treatment. Those booking the Residence, a private first-class area on the A380 that can cost $20,000 for a flight from Sydney, Australia, to Abu Dhabi, receive two complimentary treatments. The sense of exclusivity, though, is easily overcome: business and economy passengers can pay for treatments ranging from $25 to $40. Non-Etihad passengers can also pay for access.Virgin Atlantic of Britain was the leader in bringing spas to American airport airline lounges, opening a spa in 2012 in its Clubhouse lounge in Kennedy International Airport in New York. The airline\u2019s other spas are in Gatwick and Heathrow airports outside London. In an email, Louise Holding, a Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman, said because most of Virgin\u2019s flights out of Kennedy \u201ctake off in the evening and fly overnight, we offer treatments that encourage relaxation, which will help aid sleep onboard.\u201dOnly in the past year have United States airlines begun to open spas. Delta Air Lines opened its first spa, under the Asanda Spa Lounge brand, in the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in late 2016. The carrier has opened a spa at Kennedy Airport and another one is set to open in Atlanta.Brian Condenanza, the founder and chief executive of Fluo shoes, said he stumbled on Delta\u2019s spa at Kennedy as he was about to board an 11-hour flight to Buenos Aires, where he lived at the time. \u201cIt was my first time in a spa, ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI was mostly curious.\u201dMr. Condenanza said he used his American Express Platinum card to get access to Delta\u2019s lounge, one of the card\u2019s perks, and to pay for the services. He said he had long been curious about airport spas to relieve preflight tension but was wary of going to one in the terminal because \u201ceverybody can see you, and I didn\u2019t like that.\u201d The lounge spas \u201cfelt private.\u201dThe idea behind the Asanda spas is to bring a sense of privacy and duplicate the services available in a hotel spa in the limited confines of valuable airport space, said Gene Frisco, director of Asanda Air II, based in New York.Mr. Frisco said lounge spas were part of a high-end flying experience for passengers. \u201cThematically,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are trying to create the idea that they have arrived before they have departed.\u201dWithin a limited footprint, Mr. Frisco said, \u201cwhat we were looking for was a way to use the visual cues that people will respond to in a space that emulates a first-class cabin.\u201d Travelers can book services online or from a connecting flight, giving them access \u201cwithin a relatively short window while they are waiting to get to the gate.\u201d Each Delta spa can serve between 3,000 and 5,000 people a month, Mr. Frisco said, adding that airports like Seattle-Tacoma, where domestic flights often connect to long-haul international flights with a few hours of layover, were ideal spa locations.While membership credit cards, including Delta\u2019s, may allow lounge access, so do certain American Express cards, as Mr. Condenanza discovered.American Express also offers spas, said Heather Norton, the company\u2019s director of corporate affairs and communications. Working with the spa company Exhale, American Express opened spas in its Centurion airport lounges in Miami in 2015 and Dallas-Fort Worth in 2013, each offering free 15-minute spa treatments. At the moment, the company does not plan to open more. Still, Ms. Norton said, American Express\u2019s relationships with various airlines and through the Priority Pass lounge program mean cardholders have access to lounges offering spas across the globe.Not a frequent flier member or a holder of a high-end credit card? Many lounges offer day passes, usually ranging in price from $25 to $50, that allow access to spa treatments for an additional fee. And there are always airport terminal spas, under brands including XpresSpa, Be Relax Spa and others, which also offer haircuts, manicures and other treatments.Passengers with long layovers or staying overnight for connections also have the option of looking for spas in airport hotels.Beyond the few locations he mentioned, Mr. Frisco of Asanda was mum about plans by his company and Delta for any additional lounge spas. \u201cYou have to remember,\u201d he said, \u201cthese are secret weapons that set airlines apart,\u201d when deciding perks for frequent travelers.Ms. Sultan, the philanthropist, said she didn\u2019t understand why there weren\u2019t more airport spas. \u201cI think it really adds a lot of value for a traveler.

{"Headline": "In Brooklyn, a Hare Krishna Reckoning", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a soothing respite for Govinda regulars. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weekly staple,\u201d said Javiel Vazquez, who works for Consolidated Edison nearby.It\u2019s the latest chapter in a series of sweeping changes for the Hare Krishnas in New York, many of whom have divergent views on how to adhere to the rules and tenets of what is now a large, international organization. These days the religion is more popular in India than it is in the United States, the country that nurtured and fueled the movement in the late 1960s and \u201870s. But at its most basic, the conflict also reveals how the real-world notions of financial power and political control can disrupt a religion that is supposed to embrace selflessness.For a humble spiritual movement that was born in an East Village storefront, the Hare Krishna conflict in Brooklyn involves a lot of money, a good amount of litigation, and even, at some point, locked temple doors and private security guards.Swami Prabhupada, known to his followers as Srila Prabhupada, officially founded the Hare Krishna Society that same year. Its first temple was located in a former gift shop at 26 Second Avenue in Manhattan. Early devotees were mostly white Westerners, many of whom were disillusioned with American culture as the Vietnam War bore on.Devotees quit their jobs or dropped out of school; initially, they also gave up drugs and extramarital sex. Buoyed by the positive reaction from New Yorkers, and as donations and book sales started to bring in some money, Swami Prabhupada started to crisscross the nation to spread his teachings.He even made hippie history in San Francisco, when members of the Hare Krishna Society organized the Mantra Rock Dance at the Avalon Ballroom in December 1967, according to the documentary. The Grateful Dead and other bands performed for free to raise money for a new Bay Area temple, with the founder as its special guest.\u201cThe Manhattan location was so central, there were tons of people coming in and out of the building, raising money,\u201d said Lorelee Somershein (Jambavati Devi Dasi), a Springfield Gardens, Queens, resident who used to attend services there. \u201cIt was an exciting place to be.\u201d\u201cWe let prime Manhattan real estate go,\u201d said Mr. Israel.These days, the congregations of many American temples don\u2019t follow the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s tenets strictly, but rather use the temples to gather for cultural reasons, he said.Back in New York, however, the organization is suffering from an identity crisis and a lack of vision.Although there were between 50 and 60 devotees who lived at the Brooklyn temple in the \u201980s, the number of full-time volunteers dwindled over the years. By the \u201990s, many of the congregants were Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants who traveled from Queens and Long Island to the temple, which prompted the idea of building a new temple in Queens, said Heather Britten (Satya Dasi), the temple\u2019s treasurer and the force behind Govinda\u2019s Vegetarian Lunch.The qualities that had once made the 93-year-old building attractive \u2014 large communal rooms and upper-floor dormitory space \u2014 now seemed outdated and unnecessary, Ms. Britten said. The income from donations, book sales and the cafe has not been enough to pay for the much-needed building repairs and utility bills.Ms. Britten said that she believes a more modern space would benefit the community and help attract future members. Even though Downtown Brooklyn is booming, she explained, \u201cThe rent is so high in the area, there\u2019s not a lot of people from our congregation who live around here anymore.\u201d About 100 or so members attend Sunday services on a regular basis, she said.The New York State attorney general\u2019s office, whose approval is required for most sales of religious properties in New York, received 165 sale petitions in 2016. So far this year, it has received 198, according to a spokesman. (In its review, the office, among other things, considers whether the transaction terms are fair and reasonable and if the interests of its members will be promoted by the sale.)The temple\u2019s president, David Britten (Ramabhadra Das), and his board twice asked the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s ecclesiastic directors, known as the Governing Body Commission, for permission to \u201cmove the deities,\u201d which implied a property sale \u2014 once in 1998 and again 2008. Mr. Britten and his board were given approval both times, said Seth Spellman (Sesa Das), a commission member and the head of a group tasked with halting the current sale. But a lack of interest from buyers, and then the financial crisis, held back possible deals.As the economy and the real estate market once again gathered steam, however, it became easier for the board to find a buyer. Two years ago, congregants were shocked to discover that the temple board had signed a sales contract with a developer for $58.8 million.Pragnesh Surti, 39, a member of the Downtown Brooklyn congregation since childhood, recalled Mr. Britten first mentioning a possible sale during a service in 2014: that the property could fetch $60 million and that it was \u201ca sign from Krishna\u201d that it was meant to happen. In 2015, Mr. Britten told the congregation that the New York State attorney general\u2019s office was reviewing a sales petition. Mr. Surti recalled Mr. Britten envisioning details of the new temple with large domes and Swarovski crystals.\u201cMany of us,\u201d Mr. Surti said, \u201cwere like, \u2018Wait, what?\u2019\u201dCongregants said they were worried as questions to the board about a temporary location went unanswered. Financial details and architectural plans were not disclosed. People wondered where in Queens land was available. Discord over the sale increased.Many members say an existing temple, and more important, the deities that live there, cannot be moved unless there\u2019s an urgent need, as stipulated in Swami Prabhupada\u2019s will. It is sacrilegious, said Shakti Assouline, a 36-year-old yoga instructor and former congregant of the Brooklyn temple who said she is no longer welcome there because of her differing opinion (she prefers to raise money to renovate the building rather than sell it).\u201cWe are in an amazing location, which serves our outreach endeavors and is conveniently located for visitors,\u201d Ms. Assouline said.Although the Hare Krishna Society\u2019s Governing Body Commission had previously approved the sale, it had not been informed that a contract was signed in 2014, or that it was revised in 2015. By this time, Downtown Brooklyn was thriving; giving up the property seemed unwise. So the Commission revoked its previous approval, and in March 2016 it told Mr. Britten to stop the sale, said Mr. Spellman.In the year that followed, commission leaders started to suspect that the Brooklyn temple board was defying its order and was continuing to push the property sale through, Mr. Spellman said. Mr. Britten declined to comment for this article.Tensions erupted in late July 2017, when the commission tried to remove Mr. Britten from his post after decades of service. He refused to leave the temple, where he lives, or abdicate his position. Instead, he locked the temple doors for several weeks, shuttering Govinda\u2019s as well. Although Sunday services resumed a few weeks later, congregants noticed private security personnel at the door blocking several members who had been vocally against the sale from entering the building.The commission grew more concerned when the large Hare Krishna Society temple sign was removed from the building\u2019s facade in August, leading some to believe that Mr. Britten was disassociating the temple from the society, said Mr. Spellman.The tension, of course, is over which governing entity \u2014 the local temple board, led by Mr. Britten, or the global Hare Krishna Society, led by the Governing Body Commission \u2014 will have control over the millions of dollars from the property sale, if it is allowed to proceed.As usual, when ideals and money are at odds, things get complicated.If the sale goes forward, the commission is worried that the money will be in the hands of a temple board that no longer seems to be part of the Hare Krishna Society, so it has taken steps to wrestle back control of the temple by forming a new board of trustees, which includes Mr. Surti. But the Brittens, as well as the other board members who are supportive of the sale, continue to exist and operate.The New York State attorney general\u2019s office told the Bharati Center board in September that the multiple proposals it had submitted didn\u2019t meet the legal requirements for approval and that it should find recourse in court. A date has been set for late January at State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.Nikhil Gupta (Nimai Pandit Das), a Hare Krishna follower, said a prolonged court battle should be expected. He would know, since the Hare Krishna Society has been trying to remove him, as well as other leaders of a temple in Freeport, Long Island, for 13 years.In 2004, the commission accused the Long Island leaders, and subsequently Mr. Gupta in 2007, of not following Krishna doctrine. In court filings, the Commission said Mr. Gupta, the current temple president, was deviating from society philosophy and must therefore be removed. Mr. Gupta disputes this claim and said he has many other grievances with the commission\u2019s governance.In October, State Supreme Court in Nassau County ordered Mr. Gupta to vacate the temple premises, but he appealed, and has attained a stay. Mr. Gupta said he will continue his fight to remain as president of the local temple in court.\u201cThe society\u2019s penchant for legal battles takes away from the purity of the founder\u2019s teachings,\u201d Mr. Gupta said.The fractured Brooklyn congregation has led to the formation of many smaller Hare Krishna groups. Mr. Surti said a group in New Rochelle attracts society members from Westchester, the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, while there are several in Queens, including a Bengali and Gujarati group that meets in Long Island City and Jackson Heights.Mr. Bisono surmised that NYC Harinam was more akin to how the society was in the early days. \u201cI felt more spiritually inspired by going outside,\u201d he said of his decision not to join the Brooklyn temple. \u201cThis group was more inviting.\u201dMike Ramlogan (Sunandana Das), the president of the Hare Krishna Society temple in South Richmond Hill, Queens, has been watching the Brooklyn conflict unfold from afar. He said that both sides seem to be more concerned about the money and haven\u2019t come forth with a vision for the future.\u201cWould it be nice to have a big, new temple in Queens? Sure,\u201d Mr. Ramlogan said, noting that the small space he manages can squeeze in only about 100 people during Sunday services.\u201cI hope the good souls, the good swamis, put the place back together again. But I\u2019m not exactly sure who they are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Confessions of a Columnist", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut focusing on Trump again would also reveal the limits of this yearly format, because the Trump era is not even close to over yet, and year-over-year developments are generally the wrong way to assess a presidency\u2019s impact and the predictions that preceded it.I was not the fiercest of deficit hawks, not a hard-money type or an inflation-panicker. But as a non-economist staring at Congressional Budget Office projections and at examples of fiscal crisis from Greece to California, it seemed reasonable to make deficit cutting a near-term priority from 2010 onward, to offset the surge of Great Recession spending with a period of belt-tightening.The best time to make deficit reduction a priority is when the inflation rate and the bond market give you some indication that you are headed for a dangerous inflationary spiral. Such indicators were conspicuously absent eight years ago, but many people I talked to (including people in the Obama White House) argued that it was important to reduce deficits pre-emptively, because the spiraling could happen too quickly for policymakers to effectively respond. At that point I believed them; now I think they had overlearned lessons from the 1970s that did not apply in 2010.There are always real limits on what government spending or tax cuts can accomplish and how far they can go. A society only has so much productive capacity, dumb tax cuts can be hoarded and dumb spending used to enrich special interests or subsidize social pathology, and too much spending can eventually induce inflation.But those limits are not established by an arbitrary deficit target. Instead, a rich and powerful country with a stable government and control over its own currency (which is to say, not a prisoner of the euro) should be willing to live with a loose fiscal policy when wage growth is disappointing and inflation low, and it should debate tax and spending changes on their own terms \u2014 will this money be put to good use? \u2014 rather than pursuing a balanced budget for its own sake.That low-inflation, slow-growth context prevailed under Obama; to a lesser extent it still prevails today. There will doubtless come a time when deficit scolds make essential arguments, but of late they haven\u2019t \u2014 and when I was one of them, I now believe, I was making a mistake.Nicholas Kristof and Maureen Dowd are off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Which Nation Does the World Trust Most? (Hint: Follow the Dollar)", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA provocateur like Mr. Trump will trigger strong opinions, but opinions are flighty. A president\u2019s character is indeed likely to affect America\u2019s soft power \u2014 its cultural and diplomatic influence \u2014 while he is in office. It is less clear, however, that any erosion of soft power under Mr. Trump represents a permanent threat to America\u2019s hard power, including its measurable economic and financial strength.Even before Mr. Trump, the declinists cited data showing China gaining a greater share of the global economy at America\u2019s expense, a trend that is easy to exaggerate. America\u2019s current 24 percent share looks much diminished compared with 30 percent in 2000 but about the same as the 26 percent share in 1980. It\u2019s simple to cherry-pick a start date that makes American decline look bad, but the reality is that China is gaining global economic share at the expense mainly of Europe and Japan.America is a tested economic superpower, having survived 21 recessions and a Great Depression since 1900. China remains untested, having suffered not one outright recession since its modern renaissance began around 1980. It has yet to be seen just how well China will weather such a test, which is inevitable for any large economy.China\u2019s rise has already slowed sharply. When the Chinese economy grew at a double-digit pace last decade and its currency appreciated strongly, many forecasters thought it would match the size of the American economy by now. Instead, following a significant slowdown, China is on pace to catch up to the United States by 2030 \u2014 and then only if it experiences no major disruptions or further slowdown. Both things are highly possible.At a time when finance increasingly dominates the global economy, America\u2019s influence as a financial superpower is as great as ever. Central banks around the world are always looking for a safe place to park their money, and they usually buy United States assets, typically Treasury bills, which show up as dollars in their foreign exchange reserves. Since 1980, the dollar\u2019s share of foreign exchange reserves has held roughly steady at around 66 percent. This is in part the world\u2019s way of saying it not only trusts the United States to pay its debts but also trusts it more than Europe, Japan and especially China.Serious money does not equate America with Mr. Trump, and those obsessed with American decline ignore the state of its rivals. The euro was introduced 19 years ago, ambitious to become a reserve currency, but its youth and the recurring fears of a eurozone breakup have limited the world\u2019s willingness to trust it. Aging Japan\u2019s long stagnation acts as a permanent cap on the yen\u2019s popularity. And outsiders remain even more wary of the renminbi, owing both to China\u2019s debt troubles and the standing threat that Communist rulers pose to free flows of capital.When businesses in two countries \u2014 say, India and Argentina \u2014 want to conduct a deal, they almost always arrange payment not in rupees or pesos but in dollars. Everyone wants to hold the world\u2019s most trusted and liquid currency. Nearly 90 percent of bank-financed international transactions are conducted in dollars, a share that is close to all-time highs.The world is on a dollar standard, and in some ways the reach of the dollar is expanding. When individuals and companies borrow from lenders in another country, they increasingly borrow in dollars, which now account for 75 percent of these global flows, up from 60 percent just before the global financial crisis in 2008. Even though the crisis began that year in the United States, American banks dominate global finance more now than they did before the crisis \u2014 in part because debt troubles have dogged banks in Europe, Japan and China even more persistently.The share of countries that use the dollar as their main \u201canchor\u201d \u2014 the currency against which they measure and stabilize the value of their own currency \u2014 has risen to 60 percent today from about 30 percent in 1950 and 50 percent in 1980. And those countries collectively account for some 70 percent of the global gross domestic product. In other words, most of the world chooses to live in a dollar bloc.Critically, there is no sign that the dollar\u2019s status on any of these measures \u2014 as a reserve, an anchor or the favored currency for cross-border transactions and loans \u2014 has declined since Mr. Trump took office.In a dollar world, most countries are happiest when the dominant currency is cheap and plentiful. A strong dollar raises the cost of borrowing, which slows global economic growth and has often triggered debt crises in the emerging world. A weak dollar has the opposite effect, which is why the weakening of the dollar this year offers more evidence of its dominance: Partly as a result, the world is enjoying an unusually broad recovery encompassing every major economy.Instead, the renminbi has gained no ground as a reserve currency and probably won\u2019t as long as China\u2019s financial markets remain largely closed, underdeveloped and subject to government meddling. One reason foreigners like to hold the dollar is that they know they will never get stuck with it, thanks to the vast, open and highly liquid American stock and bond markets.Many observers nonetheless assume that with China rising as an economic power, financial clout will follow. Perhaps, but the United States surpassed Britain as the world\u2019s largest economy in the late 19th century, and the dollar did not fully displace British sterling as the leading reserve currency until after the world wars, which left British finances shattered. That doesn\u2019t mean it will take World War III to end the dollar\u2019s reign, but it will take time and a shock bigger than one unpredictable president.History also suggests that economic size alone will not be enough to propel China to financial superpower status. From 1450 through the late 1700s, the leading reserve currency was held by smaller countries \u2014 first Portugal, followed by Spain, the Netherlands and France. These nations were all major trading and military powers with credible financial systems, but not one was the world\u2019s largest economy. Throughout those centuries, the leading economy was primarily China. It never gained the advantages of having the leading reserve currency because, then as now, its financial system lacked credibility.No one doubts that China poses a growing military and economic challenge to the United States. But Mr. Trump\u2019s critics may be overstating both the scope and inevitability of American decline and the role one president can play in advancing it.To identify which nation the world really trusts in the long term, follow the money. And money still flows downhill to the dollar \u2014 arguably the vote of confidence in America that matters most.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scattered Protests Erupt in Iran Over Economic Woes", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProtests over the Iranian government\u2019s handling of the economy spread to several cities on Friday, including Tehran, in what appeared to be a sign of unrest.Many of the international sanctions against Iran were lifted under the 2015 accord on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But unilateral American sanctions on doing financial transactions with Iran remain in place, and the cumulative effect of sanctions has been severe. Mr. Rouhani, who heralded the agreement as a fresh start, has faced criticism for not doing enough to jump-start the economy.The Trump administration seized on reports of the protests to denounce Iran. \u201cIran\u2019s leaders have turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement. \u201cAs President Trump has said, the longest-suffering victims of Iran\u2019s leaders are Iran\u2019s own people.\u201d She added that the United States \u201cstrongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protesters.\u201dIt was difficult to judge the size of the demonstrations and whether they were organized, and if so, by whom.Relatively prosperous, Mashhad is dominated by hard-liners, including supporters of Ibrahim Raesi, who lost to Mr. Rouhani in the May elections. Mr. Raesi has pressed the plight of the poor, a cause picked up by hard-liners who say that Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government has failed to address rising inequality.A new budget presented by the government this month was widely debated on Telegram, Iran\u2019s most used social media outlet. Many people were upset over appropriations for religious and revolutionary institutions while other areas of the budget were cut. An unpopular \u201cexit tax\u201d that Iranians pay whenever they travel outside the country was increased, and millions of dollars were cut from a modest but popular subsidy plan for the poor.At the same time, the government has allowed Iran\u2019s currency to depreciate over the past half year, a psychological blow that resulted in inflation of certain products like a 40 percent increase in the price of eggs.Protests over economic conditions are not uncommon in Iran. They usually take place in front of Parliament in Tehran, and in smaller cities it is not uncommon to see protests by people who have lost their savings in bank failures, or retirees who can\u2019t make ends meet. What seems distinctive about the protests this week is how quickly news about them spread on social media and was in turn picked up by foreign-based satellite channels.\u201cA number of them left after being warned by police. A few others, however, remained despite being warned to leave,\u201d the news service quoted him as saying, and \u201ca number of them were detained after arrest warrants were issued.\u201dThe Tasnim news agency quoted Mr. Hamedani as saying that no protest permits had been issued for Tehran and warning that \u201csuch gatherings will be firmly dealt with by the police.\u201dHard-liners, including Mr. Hamedani, castigated the protesters, warning that Iran\u2019s enemies would take advantage of any sign of dissent.One hard-line religious leader, Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, said that a protest in the northeastern city of Sabzevar had been disrupted when \u201call of a sudden, a small group of roughly 50 people among the crowd started to chant norm-braking slogans such as \u2018Forget Palestine\u2019 or \u2018No to Gaza, No to Lebanon, I will give my life for Iran.\u2019\u201d (Government-approved protests routinely invoke the Iranian government\u2019s self-designated role as a defender of Palestinian aspirations and as a foe of the United States.)A reformist ally of Mr. Rouhani, Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, warned that protesters risked setting off unrest that might not be controllable.\u201cThe ones who trigger political moves in the streets may not be the ones who will put an end to it, since others may ride the wave they have started, and they must know that their action will backfire on them,\u201d the semiofficial ISNA news agency quoted Mr. Jahangiri as saying. He added that the government was open to receiving \u201cfair criticism.\u201dAbout 300 people gathered at Freedom Square in the city and carried out a march in which public property was damaged, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is close to the country\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.The protesters shouted antigovernment slogans like \u201cDeath or freedom,\u201d \u201cCare for us and leave Palestine\u201d and \u201cPolitical prisoners must be freed,\u201d according to Fars.Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, said it was possible that hard-line opponents of Mr. Rouhani were behind the protests in Mashhad, capitalizing on anger about the economic belt-tightening and about rising food and gasoline prices.\u201cThe trigger was apparently a protest that the government\u2019s hard-line opponents organized in Mashhad, which got out of control and turned into an anti-regime rally and is now spreading across the country,\u201d he said.\u201cThe system will probably use it as a show of force and in its wake will repress any dissent,\u201d Mr. Vaez said. \u201cThe only meaningful consequence probably is that it will provide ammunition for the Trump administration to further condemn the regime.\u201dBut Nader Karimi Juni, a reformist journalist, was skeptical that hard-liners were behind the protests. \u201cIf the protests continue for a while, which is not certain, it will be dangerous for the regime,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the future is unpredictable and the regime has managed to crack down on more serious protests in the past decades.\u201dFazel Meybodi, a reformist cleric from the holy city of Qom, said he believed the protests had emerged from authentic concerns, as the government\u2019s new budget had \u201cmade people in the provincial towns angry.\u201d\u201cIf the police and government treat people gently, this crisis will wane and tranquillity will prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise they might \u2014 I stress might \u2014 grow in the future. Economic issues are urgent, and the protests have nothing to do with any factions \u2014 neither reformist nor hard-liner. Poor people are protesting, that is it.\u201dThomas Erdbrink reported from Niseko, Japan, and Nilo Tabrizy contributed reporting from Vancouver, Canada.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "North Korea Won\u2019t Stop Its Arms Tests Anytime Soon, South Korea Warns", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea will keep improving its nuclear and long-range ballistic missile capabilities next year to gain leverage to force Washington to make concessions, like the easing of sanctions, government and private analysts in South Korea said on Tuesday.After its last ICBM test, conducted Nov. 29, North Korea claimed to have completed building its nuclear force. But the country has yet to clear a key technological hurdle: proving that its warheads can survive re-entry into the atmosphere after flying through space, according to Western officials and analysts.Forecasting North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program for the new year, the Unification Ministry in South Korea said on Tuesday that the North \u201cwill continue to advance its nuclear and missile capabilities\u201d in 2018 despite its claims about completing its nuclear force.North Korea will conduct at least one more missile test to master the re-entry technology for its warheads, analysts said. But the North also was racing against time to secure full ICBM capabilities before new United Nations sanctions begin squeezing its economy, they said.\u201cRe-entry is a question North Korea must solve to boost its negotiating leverage and for its military and technological purposes,\u201d Shin Beom-chul, a security analyst, said in a report published over the weekend by the government-run Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul. \u201cFor North Korea, there is a big difference between entering negotiations with the United States after acquiring full ICBM capabilities and starting such talks without them.\u201dNorth Korea wants Washington to recognize it as a nuclear weapons state.With that status, analysts said, the North would seek arms-reduction talks in hopes of gaining concessions from Washington, such as easing sanctions and reducing the American military presence around the Korean Peninsula. In return, Pyongyang could offer to freeze or give up its ICBMs while retaining the rest of its nuclear capabilities, analysts said.So far, all the North\u2019s three ICBM tests have taken place in the sea between North Korea and Japan. Though the missiles soared to extremely high altitudes, demonstrating their power, they never flew beyond Japan.Analysts warned that in its next long-range missile test, the North could launch a missile on a full ICBM trajectory and even carry a live nuclear warhead to demonstrate its mastery of warhead re-entry technology.\u201cThe North\u2019s seventh nuclear test could take place not underground but over the Pacific,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst, in a report published by the independent Sejong Institute of South Korea.The United Nations Security Council has slapped North Korea with four rounds of sanctions this year alone, seeking to deprive the country of key sources of hard currency by banning its exports of coal, iron ore and sea products and phasing out the use of North Korean workers abroad. It also tried to squeeze the North\u2019s fuel supplies by demanding that member nations drastically reduce exports of refined oil to North Korea.From January to November, North Korea\u2019s trade with China, its only major remaining trading partner, declined to $4.7 billion, a drop of more than 10 percent, the Unification Ministry said on Tuesday. Its exports to China plummeted nearly 32 percent in the same period, the ministry said.On Tuesday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two senior North Korean officials for their work on the country\u2019s ballistic missile program.One of the officials, Kim Jong-sik, was reportedly crucial to North Korea\u2019s efforts to develop solid fuel rockets, which are more difficult to defend against because they can be launched quickly. Liquid fuel rockets can take hours to fuel. The other official, Ri Pyong-chol, is said to have played a key role in developing North Korea\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program, the Treasury Department reported.The sanctions mean that the Treasury Department could, among other things, seize any assets held by the men in the United States. Although it is unlikely that either official owns property or has bank accounts in the United States or other Western countries, the sanctions are intended to increase pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programs, a campaign that has so far shown no signs of working.American officials say they still favor a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis. But top aides to Mr. Trump, including Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, have indicated that Washington was also considering a military action against the North.Increasingly anxious over possible military conflict, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea proposed this month that his country and the United States postpone their joint military exercises, which were originally expected to start in late February.Mr. Moon said the annual exercises, which North Korea has denounced as rehearsals for an invasion, could be postponed until after South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in February and the Paralympics in March. Whether the allies will eventually delay the drills depends on whether North Korea conducts any weapons tests in the weeks leading up to the Games, South Korean officials said.Mr. Moon hopes to create a lull in the nuclear standoff during the Olympics and use it as momentum to start talks with North Korea. When North Korea said it completed its nuclear force following its ICBM test in November, some analysts said the North might now be open to stopping its program there and to start negotiating.Instead, North Korea might be preparing for a satellite launch, the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo said on Tuesday, citing an anonymous government source.South Korea saw \u201cnothing out of ordinary at this moment\u201d while it and the United States were closely monitoring for possible provocations from the North, Noh Jae-chon, a South Korean military spokesman, said on Tuesday.North Korea launched a rocket to put a satellite into orbit in 2012 and again in February last year. The United Nations bans North Korea from launching satellites, fearing that the country was using the program as a cover for developing long-range ballistic missiles.Gardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Incomes Grew After Past Tax Cuts, but Guess Whose", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneFor all the backslapping over a job well done, however, Republicans are proving notably more reluctant to acknowledge the true impact of the tax changes that Reagan wrought.That\u2019s because Reagan\u2019s cuts didn\u2019t quite work as advertised.Reagan promised to \u201ccontinue to fulfill the obligations that spring from our national conscience,\u201d to help those who legitimately could not help themselves. But even throwing in the impact of taxes and transfers from all government programs, Americans on the bottom half of the income scale did not fare much better. By 1988, they were taking in $21,614, on average, $8 more than in 1980, after inflation.The sliver of America that did get ahead was, you guessed it, the one at the tippy top: the richest Americans, those in the highest 1 percent of the income distribution. Their earnings grew by about 6 percent a year.Whatever gains that Republican tax cuts have bestowed on the economy in the years since Reagan promised voters a city on a hill, they have all shared the same distributional peculiarities. President George W. Bush passed two rounds of tax cuts, in 2001 and 2003, arguing that the United States had a budget surplus \u201cbecause taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs.\u201dAnd yet, during Mr. Bush\u2019s two terms, the average income of the bottom half of Americans slid from $17,827 to $17,473, accounting for inflation. After factoring in taxes and transfers, that sum did increase \u2014 3.5 percent, or about 0.4 percent a year.Over a 34-year stretch starting in 1980, a period during which the nation\u2019s top income tax rate plunged from 70 percent to as low as 28 percent, settling at just under 40 percent today, the grand Republican promise of faster growth has proved to be, if not necessarily false, at least irrelevant for the very segment of the electorate for which it was directed.In 2014, the economy was 2.5 times larger than it was in 1980, but the bottom half of the population made only 21 percent more, on average, even after including government benefits. America\u2019s middle \u2014 families earning more than the bottom 30 percent but less than the top 30 percent \u2014 gained only 50 percent in those 34 years. By contrast, the after-tax incomes of Americans in the top 1 percent \u2014 families like President Trump\u2019s or Senator Bob Corker\u2019s \u2014 tripled.That is less surprising when one realizes that for all the stories about harried workers in the Midwest shouldering an unbearable tax burden, tax relief since Reagan\u2019s fateful State of the Union speech has mostly been aimed at benefiting the well-to-do: The average tax rate for Americans in the bottom half of the income pile was higher in 2014 than it was in 1980. The rate at the top declined.Mr. Ryan offered a single mother named Cindy, an assistant manager at a local restaurant who was created by Republican staff members of the House Ways and Means Committee. She makes $30,000 a year, according to Mr. Ryan, and will be mighty pleased with the extra $700 a year she will get from the Republican tax cuts.The question now is whether the actual harried working-class voters who helped deliver Mr. Trump to office buy the story. The president they voted into power did not campaign on a platform of tax cuts for the rich. His latter-day embrace of Reagan\u2019s tax-cutting agenda might strike them as a betrayal. It has been going on for a very long time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Homage to Mexico: Josef Albers and His Reality-Based Abstraction", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "Art ReviewA radiant Guggenheim exhibition grounds the proto-Minimalist abstract paintings of Josef Albers in the geometric grandeur of Mesoamerican monuments.Supported byThe show grounds this German-born artist\u2019s paintings in his Mexican travels between 1935 and 1967, clarifying his creative debt to the pre-Hispanic world. It reveals an artist from one culture being blown away by the achievements of another culture, and making work that might otherwise not have been possible without a change of scene.Back home, he had some negatives enlarged into single images, and fashioned many tiny contact prints into photocollages that bespeak a slightly crazed obsession. But Albers never exhibited his photoworks and usually hedged questions about the influences behind the \u201cHomage to the Square\u201d series. Many of the photoworks here are being shown for the first time, which is gratifying, if belated.In today\u2019s parlance, Albers might be accused of \u201ccultural appropriation,\u201d a negative buzzword that presumes that culture can be owned and controlled, which it can\u2019t. Passion and openness make opportunists of us all. But sources should be acknowledged. This exhibition, which has been organized by Lauren Hinkson, an associate curator at the Guggenheim, gives Albers\u2019s development a transparency that he could have encouraged, but did not.The values apparent in Mesoamerican objects and structures dovetailed with the Alberses\u2019 most cherished Bauhaus principles, especially economy of means, truth to materials and the pursuit of variation within specific boundaries. Limits were inherent in Anni\u2019s weaving and were imposed by Josef\u2019s nesting squares. Furthermore, he began working exclusively with colors straight from the tube \u2014 smoothed out with a palette knife to the rough side of Masonite, sometimes exploiting the effects of the white gesso ground and canvas-like texture. And yet these strictures seem to have freed him to revel in the full spectrum: hot pinks, crimsons and violets, browns, greens and black, and their impact on one another.Installed to trace the couple\u2019s travels to different pre-Hispanic sites, \u201cJosef Albers in Mexico\u201d has an energetic syncopation generated by the paintings\u2019 singing colors, which alternate with the silvery sepia of the photographs. The paintings range from rarely-seen fledgling works from 1935-40 to a final sweep of seven small \u201cHomage to the Square\u201d paintings from the 1960s and \u201970s in shades of red, orange and yellow. Each has its own inner light, scale and spatial rhythm; together they attest to the instability of color and perception.In his photographs Albers is always on the move. He constantly pulls back to show the lay of the land and the architecture on it. \u201cI once again have phenomenal respect for the spaces between the pyramids,\u201d he wrote to a friend upon returning to Monte Alb\u00e1n in 1936.We see close-ups of the pyramids\u2019 steep stairs and intersecting planes \u2014 especially in tightly framed shots at Tenayuca \u2014 that seem to have initially inspired a pursuit of diagonal lines and planes. Two Tenayuca oil studies from around 1938 might be 3-D renderings of a stark modernist house. A drawing of the same motif flattens it into a single angled line spiraling in on itself. The common source is seen in a nearby photograph: a spectacular coiled serpent sculpture at Tenayuca.Albers\u2019s camera captured extremes of light and shadow and the thickly framed doorways in both pre-Hispanic structures and vernacular adobe dwellings. All of this figures prominently in eight forthrightly titled \u201cVariant/Adobe\u201d paintings from the late 1940s \u2014 the core of the show. Here, horizontal building-like compositions feature pairs of apertures that imply mysterious interiors. The layering of color creates a prismatic, almost hallucinatory wavering of form. Albers is about to segue to the \u201cHomage of the Square\u201d paintings in these works, but their visionary effect also links him to early American modernists like Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Charles Burchfield and Arthur Dove.Filtered through his photographs, Mesoamerican architecture showed Albers the accordion-like nature of pictorial space: it could be rendered as volumetric, flat and something in between at the same time. You see it in an ink drawing at the start of the show, \u201cStudy for Sanctuary\u201d (1941-42), which presents three black rectangles that are pushed in and then out by the concentric lines radiating around them, which also suggest stairs and elaborate doorframes.Frank Stella\u2019s black-stripe paintings or the early reliefs of Donald Judd come to mind.Such spatial mutability is more refined in the \u201cHomage to the Square\u201d paintings, which often read simultaneously as receding, like a sunken walled court; protruding, like a flat-topped pyramid; and holding steady in a single slightly vibrating plane \u2014 a temple gate to another world.These paintings are among the pinnacles of pure abstraction \u2014 if you believe in pure abstraction. But this beautiful exhibition may destabilize that faith. All art is reality-based, derived in part from looking long and hard at whatever chooses you. In Albers case, \u201cHomage to Mexico\u201d might have been a more accurate title.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why France Loved Johnny Hallyday", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn appraisalIf Anglophones always scoffed at him, it was because Mr. Hallyday wasn\u2019t French enough for them. If the French adored him, it is precisely because he represented a fantasy of America: successful, fast, furious and yet vulnerable. In other words, heroic.To Elvis Presley\u2019s compatriots, Johnny the rocker could only be an impostor. To the French, Johnny the chanteur, who turned American rock \u2019n\u2019 roll into French popular music, was a genius.Mr. Hallyday adored America but it never loved him back. When he released his only album in English, it was distributed only in Francophone countries. When he performed at Royal Albert Hall in London in 2012 and toured the United States in 2014, the venues were mostly filled with French expats or fans who had traveled there to see him perform.Like many powerful stories in contemporary France, Mr. Hallyday\u2019s started in occupied Paris, where he was born Jean-Philippe Smet in 1943. Abandoned by his parents, a French mother too busy modeling for high-fashion houses such as Lanvin, and a hard-drinking Belgian father, he was raised by an aunt and her husband, cabaret entertainers who took the young boy with them on tour. It was only later that Jean-Philippe understood the true reason his aunt didn\u2019t want him to go to school: Her husband had been a collaborator with France\u2019s Nazi occupiers during the war and they were afraid of reprisals against their adoptive son.In 1957, the same year that the 14-year-old Jean-Philippe learned about all this, he also discovered Elvis Presley. With an absent father and an adoptive one on the wrong side of history, Jean-Philippe did what many might see as an exercise in the fulfillment of his deepest desire: He invented an American father in Elvis, and Johnny Hallyday was born.In the late 1950s, the effects of the Marshall Plan were kicking in for France and the rest of Western Europe: The French economy, awash with American goods, was in full recovery mode. French society was embracing American-style consumerism and pop culture with the passion of the newly converted.Youth was on the march. Young people in France were intent on turning a page on the war, a calamity brought about by their parents and grandparents. Johnny Hallyday started singing and performing at barely 17. (A few years earlier, a 15-year-old Brigitte Bardot had graced the cover of Elle magazine and a 17-year-old Fran\u00e7oise Sagan\u2019s first novel, \u201cBonjour Tristesse,\u201d made her an instant literary success.) This was a generation who revered American pulp fiction as great literature, viewed Film Noir on par with the human comedy of Balzac, and saw American film directors such as Nicholas Ray and his \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d as auteurs and artists, gods to the budding French New Wave.What are your memories of Johnny Hallyday? Was his music the soundtrack of your youth in France or elsewhere?Johnny Hallyday embraced the triumphant postwar American culture to become France\u2019s very own Elvis. Like \u201cthe King,\u201d or France\u2019s own long-deposed kings, the French quickly called him by his first name only: he was simply Johnny. His resounding success and longevity at the top, a 55-year career, which knew no lull, was a tribute to his dedication to his public and to his m\u00e9tier.He proved, in a country that prizes erudition above almost everything else, that you can have no formal education, no university degree, and yet achieve tremendous success if you work hard enough. Mr. Hallyday was a source of incredible pride for his working-class fan base. He was one of them. In interviews he always remained soft-spoken, simple and true. He loved people and people loved him: There was an invisible and very strong tie.With time, Johnny came to embody \u201cLes Trente Glorieuses,\u201d the 30-year postwar boom regarded with nostalgia by French baby boomers. The way he seemingly refused to age, marrying five times; the way he sang without restraint about love and heartbreak; the way he spoke frankly of his battles with depression and his use of drugs; the way he never hid his vulnerability \u2014 all of this made him even more endearing, not just to his contemporaries, but to subsequent generations as well.A few hours after his death was announced, the French philosopher Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven, tried to explain on French radio the phenomenon that was Johnny Hallyday: \u201cHe was an idol, in other words, blasphemy incarnate. His death is that of a god who was in fact mortal. People say they can\u2019t believe he is dead, simply because their belief in him, their faith in him, will not die. Many people never believed that Elvis died. The same will happen with Johnny.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Country Deserves Your Respect, Not Your Pity", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 Once again, Haiti, a country with deep historical ties to the United States, is in the news. Once again, a negative narrative permeates the public dialogue and Haitian people are compelled to defend our humanity. Once again, the circumstances require us to wage a battle on two fronts: tackling the physical rebuilding of our nation so that future generations can prosper, while simultaneously combating prejudice and stigma that risk being, over time, institutionalized in the American consciousness.It is long past time for such thinking to end. Influential American news outlets and political leaders should lead the way by resisting the reflexive tendency to paint Haiti and its people, whether living at home or abroad, with broad-brushed narratives that lack historical context and oversimplify complex socio-economic realities.Haiti has been a vibrant, steadfast hemispheric partner since its birth. Hundreds of Haitian soldiers fought in the Siege of Savannah alongside American troops to battle British imperialists in the Revolutionary War. Sparked by this nation\u2019s commitment to independence and freedom, Haiti soon followed with its own revolution, throwing off the shackles of slavery and colonialism. Thus, Haiti and the United States represent two of the oldest republics in the hemisphere, bound by dignity and a pursuit of freedom for our peoples.The Haitian-American population has made significant contributions to American culture and the United States\u2019 economy. Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, a Haitian man, founded the city of Chicago in the 18th century. W.E.B. Du Bois, a leader in the American civil rights movement and a man of Haitian heritage, played a key role in creating the intellectual framework for equality for African-Americans.Today, Haitian-Americans serve in the United States armed forces, and they represent their communities in state houses and on City Councils around the country. They are prominent scientists and engineers; they are taxi drivers, doctors, nurses and professional athletes. They are public-school teachers and university professors.As Haiti\u2019s ambassador to the United States, I have witnessed firsthand the Haitian people\u2019s dignity, perseverance and resourcefulness. I have seen my people\u2019s commitment to rebuilding communities and restoring homes after hurricanes. I have seen how young entrepreneurs in Haiti are now making exquisite chocolates to export to the United States. I have seen how engineering students in Haiti are now using technology to work remotely with Haitian-American engineers on disaster prevention.These are examples of the countless positive initiatives underway in Haiti, with the support of the diaspora. Yet these attributes seem to be chronically lost in wider conversations about the Haitian people.The recent controversy over President Trump\u2019s alleged remarks have resurrected painful memories for Haitians. But it is a reminder of the urgent need to change the way our country is discussed in the United States. The narrative about Haiti should reflect our government\u2019s development priorities.We want our country to create wealth and prosperity for its citizens, not be viewed just as a recipient of humanitarian aid. Rather than American businesses donating excess inventory to our country, we are hoping they will invest in our country. Rather than students spending a week of spring break doing volunteer work, we want them to study abroad for a semester at one of our universities. Rather than writing a check to a charitable organization like the Red Cross, take a vacation on our beaches.Given our two countries\u2019 long intertwined history, it is time to we get to know each other on a level of mutual respect and understanding.Paul Altidor is Haiti\u2019s ambassador to the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Republic Will Survive the Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy view of the tax bill in Congress is probably clear to you by now. I think it\u2019s bad for the economy and, in particular, for the middle class and poor. A small number of Republicans can still prevent the bill from becoming law, and I hope they do.But I also think that some of the commentary about the bill is exaggerating its impact. The goal of today\u2019s newsletter is to put the bill in perspective.Here\u2019s my attempt at perspective:As Chait wrote: \u201cIndeed, the passage of the Trump tax cuts will help lay the groundwork for their undoing by increasing the chances Democrats regain control of Congress.\u201d Already, polls show the tax bill to be deeply unpopular, which is why Republican leaders are rushing it through Congress. They know it\u2019s a political loser.The repeal of Obamacare would have haunted any future effort to improve life for middle-class and poor Americans. The passage of a big tax cut for the rich will not.(All of which is a good reminder not to ignore the possibility that Republican leaders will try again to repeal Obamacare.)But damage to Obamacare isn\u2019t the same thing as a slippery slope toward the program\u2019s demise.The two core pieces of Obamacare are the subsidies that help middle-class families afford private insurance and the expansion of Medicaid for working-class families. The tax bill doesn\u2019t get rid of either. Instead, it will likely repeal the individual mandate \u2014 the requirement that people buy health insurance. As a result, health-insurance markets will suffer some turmoil, and costs for some families will rise.Most people who want health insurance will still be able to get it, though. And health care advocates can reduce the impact of the mandate\u2019s repeal through public-information campaigns that encourage people to sign up. The elimination of the insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion would be qualitatively worse.Eventually, the deficit and debt will be a problem, because the federal government still hasn\u2019t figured out how to pay for baby boomer retirement. But the deficit is not our most urgent economic problem. (What is? Stagnant living standards for the majority of the population.) The tax bill is bad because of how it spends its money, not how much it spends.\u201cThat said, to the extent this is a trial balloon, it\u2019s one that should be shot down in an overwhelming show of force by national security professionals in and out of government.\u201dSo far, that hasn\u2019t happened.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Using the Airbnb Model to Protect the Environment", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewAs the world\u2019s population grows, so does demand for land. One upshot is that setting aside big tracts to protect endangered species and carbon-rich forests is increasingly expensive.Enter the Airbnb economic model. While it\u2019s not a panacea, it provides attractive solutions for conservation as well as housing.Much as homeowners can use Airbnb and other services to turn their living space into pop-up hotels when demand warrants it, conservationists are creating \u201cpop-up nature reserves\u201d on idle land.In environments as different as North America and Africa, new programs are preserving land through short- and-long-term deals that pay people to protect nature on their own land. The innovation makes it possible to transform a binary approach to land use \u2014 either devoting it to private development or turning it into a nature reserve \u2014 into something in between.Consider how Airbnb works. Think of Minneapolis during the coming Super Bowl, when hotel rooms are scarce and residents will be enticed to rent their homes to football fans. Something like that happens in the environmental realm, too: There is a surge in demand for protected land when migratory birds are passing through an area or a threatened species is breeding.A team of ecologists and economists figured out how much to compensate the farmers for this change. They ran \u201creverse auctions\u201d in which landowners specified the lowest payment that would entice them to flood their fields for a given four- to eight-week period.This auction system adjusts payments to farmers\u2019 costs. For example, flooding during the end of the spring migration season is trickier to fit into an annual rice-growing schedule, so bids \u2014 and payments \u2014 are higher then. The auction model is also flexible when the weather fluctuates. The early years of the program occurred during California\u2019s prolonged drought, but abundant rainfall in 2017 meant that BirdReturns could dial back the amount of pop-up wetland it procured this year.Climate change and society\u2019s expanding footprint are making this dynamic approach to conservation increasingly useful.\u201cWe think this is a big idea,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said, adding that it \u201ccould really help us with adapting to change.\u201dOffering payment in exchange for conservation efforts and letting people choose whether to participate also has advantages over simply banning deforestation. In the Ugandan setting, a ban would deprive poor people of much-needed income generated by selling timber or using newly cleared land for agriculture.Moreover, a market-based approach can balance conservation goals with critical needs like growing food. If a certain landowner is outstanding at farming \u2014 producing a lot of food for the community \u2014 it could very well make sense for her to continue to farm her land, even if doing so means clearing some forest.Ideally, less productive farmers will participate in the program because food production \u2014 and profit \u2014 sacrificed by keeping their forest intact is small.That\u2019s why proper pricing is important. If you offer an appropriate payment for conservation, the best farmers will decline it because they can earn more by expanding their farms, while the mediocre ones will sign up. Markets can help us find those opportunities.As a host of political and demographic factors make it impractical to meet conservation goals solely through dedicated nature reserves, we are fortunate to have some alternatives. Innovative programs are demonstrating how land can do double duty and competing needs can coexist. With the help of market-based approaches, we can often enlist private land to serve nature\u2019s needs.Advertisement"}

He occupied office too long, accomplished too much, failed too often and was confronted by not only the greatest domestic crisis since the Civil War, but also the greatest foreign crisis since the Revolution.Born to wealth, with a cousin in the White House while he was at Harvard, Roosevelt was a natural politician: physically attractive, intellectually quick and witty, with a fine speaking voice, upright posture, charisma and charm. At 28, he was elected to the New York State Senate; at 31, appointed assistant secretary of the Navy; at 38, nominated by the Democratic Party for the vice presidency. A year later, having contracted polio, he lost the use of his legs, forever. He could not hide his disability, but he could and did shield its severity and effects from the public and, perhaps, from himself. He was elected governor of New York in 1928, re-elected in 1930. He would win election to the presidency in 1932 and re-election in 1936, 1940 and 1944.How to make sense of this life? How does one connect the dots, find the through-line, locate the man beneath the carefully constructed public persona? Several of his greatest biographers set out to tell the full story, but were nearly overcome by the immensity of the task. Frank Freidel completed five volumes, taking the story up to 1933. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. finished three volumes, but only got as far as the 1936 re-election. James MacGregor Burns completed the first of his volumes in 1956, but it took him until 1970 to publish the second. Kenneth Davis died in 1999 with four of his five volumes in print; the last would be published in 2000.Either because publishers demand it or authors prefer it, recent biographers have tried to squeeze the story into one extended volume. Robert Dallek, the author of an earlier book on Roosevelt\u2019s foreign policy and several presidential biographies, is the latest to take this route.There are many strengths to \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life.\u201d Dallek fully incorporates into his narrative Roosevelt\u2019s complicated, conflicted relationship with the several women in his life and is especially good on the role Eleanor played, as goad and political adviser. He also makes it clear, in a way other biographers do not, that almost from the moment he entered office, Roosevelt set out to educate the nation to the fact that the United States was threatened not only by economic depression at home, but also by fascist aggressions abroad. He did not counsel war, but neither did he counsel isolation from the world beyond our shores. \u201cThe maintenance of international peace is a matter in which we are deeply and unselfishly concerned,\u201d he told Congress as early as January 1935, in his State of the Union address.Dallek reminds us that Roosevelt took office knowing full well that while as president he bore ultimate responsibility for the nation, he did so with limited powers. Congress was in control of foreign policy and the Supreme Court could and would overturn domestic policies it considered unconstitutional. Only after his enormous second-term landslide victory in 1936, when he was worried and frightened that constraints on his executive powers would hinder, if not block, his efforts to right the economy and protect international peace, did Roosevelt uncharacteristically, almost perversely, attempt to alter the balance of powers by packing the Supreme Court with his appointees and purging his Democratic majority of incumbents, mostly Southerners, who opposed his policies. Both initiatives failed \u2014 and failed badly, leaving him with a diminished capacity to extend the New Deal or intervene to deter German, Italian and Japanese aggressions.One of the perks of being a reader of history is time travel. Pick up a presidential biography and, for an hour or so, you can leave the present behind and enjoy an almost visceral comfort in visiting another world. The catch is that you remain tethered to the present, incapable of looking at the past without comparing it to the present.Reading a Roosevelt biography today, one is struck head-on by the deadly seriousness, the moral purpose with which Franklin Roosevelt prepared for and assumed the office of president of the United States. His respect for the dignity of the presidency was unwavering through his 12 years and one month in the White House. You can hear it in his fireside addresses and radio talks, read it in his formal speeches to Congress and the nation, watch it in the newsreel clips. He stands near ramrod straight, gripping the podium. He speaks plainly, but never less than eloquently. Every word is carefully chosen, articulated with force and precision, but never snidely, sarcastically or dismissively, and never with rancor or condescension. His purpose was not to stir up his supporters \u2014 though he managed to do so \u2014 but to educate the larger public, friends and foes, to his concerns, which he hoped would become their concerns.Dallek\u2019s is a workmanlike addition to the literature on Roosevelt and covers all the bases. There is, regrettably, little to distinguish it from the many excellent biographies that came before it and on which it draws. The prose is clean, but flat, with little sparkle or literary grace. There are no new analytic thrusts or parries, no new sources or imaginative reinterpretations of old ones. Those who have read other Roosevelt biographies will learn little from this one. Still, this is a story worth telling, again and again. And there is much to be gained, at this moment in our history, from having one more Roosevelt biography in our electronic devices and on our bookstore and library shelves.David Nasaw is the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. professor of history at the CUNY Graduate Center. His most recent book is \u201cThe Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P. Kennedy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Republicans Pass Sweeping Tax Bill", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate passed the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades early Saturday, with Republicans lining up to approve an overhaul that will touch almost every corner of the United States economy, affecting families, small business owners and multinational corporations, with the biggest benefits flowing to the highest-earning Americans.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and Kentucky Republican, called it \u201ca great day for the country.\u201dThe president praised Republican lawmakers on Saturday morning on Twitter, saying, \u201cBiggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!\u201dHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a statement that with Senate approval \u201cwe will move quickly to a conference committee so we can get a final bill to President Trump\u2019s desk.\u201dThe last-minute revisions prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said it was impossible \u2014 and irresponsible \u2014 for lawmakers to read and digest a significant piece of legislation in such a short period of time.Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, called the Republican approach \u201ca process and a product that no one can be proud of and everyone should be ashamed of.\u201dHe went on to warn that changes made to the bill \u201cunder the cover of darkness\u201d would \u201cstuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.\u201dMany of the changes stemmed from a series of last-minute agreements reached to convince a handful of holdout Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, to throw their support behind the legislation. One of those Republican holdouts, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted against the legislation.Early on Saturday morning, Vice President Mike Pence provided a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment offered by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, that would allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts to fund tuition at private and religious K-12 schools or certain educational expenses for home-schooled students. Right now, such accounts can only be used to pay for higher education.The Senate approved the final bill, 51-49. A list of every senator\u2019s vote on the bill and selected amendments.The bill\u2019s approval, coming on the heels of the House passing its own tax bill last month, is the first significant legislative victory for the Republican Party since it assumed control of the House, Senate and White House in 2017. The lightning-fast trajectory of the bill and the ability to overcome \u2014 or ignore \u2014 objections that have bedeviled previous attempts to revamp the tax code, highlights the pressure Republican leaders faced to notch a victory after several failed legislative efforts this year.Republicans have pitched the bill as a middle-class tax cut and the overhaul is intended to immediately cut taxes for about 70 percent of middle-class families. But it would raise them on millions of others, since the Senate plan eliminates some tax breaks like the deduction for state and local income taxes and phases out the individual tax cuts at the end of 2025.Businesses fare far better, with the corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent from 35 percent and made permanent. It also offers a large tax break for the owners of small businesses and other companies that are not organized as traditional corporations, a provision that was sweetened in a last-minute deal to bring two wavering senators on board.Democrats opposed the tax bill as a bloc, saying it was meant to help the wealthy and not the middle class. With the Senate split 52 to 48, Republicans barely had votes to spare. But the bill\u2019s passage was made possible by a near-complete Republican embrace of the idea that about $1.5 trillion of tax cuts will pay for themselves, by producing enough economic growth and additional federal revenue to offset their costs to the Treasury.That belief was contradicted by several studies, including one from Congress\u2019s official economic scorekeeper, which Republicans dismissed as overly pessimistic.Mr. McConnell waved off any deficit concerns. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a revenue producer.\u201dThe House and Senate will now work quickly to resolve the differences between their bills and deliver a plan to President Trump\u2019s desk, with the aim of delivery by Christmas.Congressional leaders raced the bill through the House and the Senate in a month, with a crush of changes coming in the 11th hour as Senate leadership worked to address the concerns of a few lawmakers whose support was critical to passage. Several changes were included to satisfy Ms. Collins, including a provision that will allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes paid and allowing lower-income individuals to claim the medical expense deduction.In the late afternoon, Ms. Collins announced her support for the bill, citing those changes as well as a promise from Mr. McConnell that he would support two bipartisan bills meant to help stabilize individual insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Collins had expressed concern about a provision in the tax bill to repeal the act\u2019s mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty.Lawmakers also included a more generous tax break for companies organized as pass-through entities, a provision needed to win the support of Mr. Johnson and Senator Steve Daines of Montana.And, in a bid to get Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on board, leaders agreed to work on providing \u201cfair and permanent protections\u201d for the beneficiaries of an Obama-era effort that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, Mr. Flake said.\u201cThere are no ironclad commitments \u2014 at this date we\u2019re going to have a bill \u2014 but I am confident,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been convinced on DACA that the president\u2019s instincts are better than the advice he\u2019s getting.\u201dMr. Flake, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, said he had spoken with Mr. Pence about the issue. \u201cWe had a long conversation last night and today, and he committed to start working with me on this,\u201d Mr. Flake said.Mr. Flake also said he had won changes in a provision, which expires after five years, to allow companies to immediately deduct new investment expenses, which he called a \u201cgimmick.\u201dThe bill would also open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, putting environmental activists on the brink of defeat in what has been a decades-long battle. Opening the wildlife refuge to energy exploration has been a goal of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.Several of the changes, most notably the property tax break and the additional deduction for pass-through businesses, combined to add several hundred billion dollars to the cost of the bill. To offset them, party leaders scaled back some planned tax cuts and increased a new tax on assets held overseas by American multinational companies.Most notably, they decided to maintain the alternative minimum tax on corporations and to trim the effects of the alternative minimum tax for high-earning individuals. Originally, the bill would have eliminated both those taxes entirely.None of those changes were likely to improve the fiscal cost of the bill \u2014 in defiance of the concerns that several senators had raised about adding to future deficits.Chief among those worried about the deficit was Mr. Corker, whose fears over the bill\u2019s effect on the federal budget deficit created last-minute complications for Republican leaders on Thursday when he demanded changes to the bill.Mr. Corker had pushed to scale back the tax cuts after a report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that projected the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over a decade, even after accounting for economic growth.Republicans said Mr. Corker had angered colleagues and overplayed his hand in the wake of that analysis. Mr. Corker was alarmed by the projections. But many of his colleagues greeted them with distrust, both because they expected tax cuts to generate more robust economic growth than the forecasters projected and because they felt burned by unflattering analyses of their health care proposals issued this year by the Congressional Budget Office.The joint committee sprinted to complete its analysis of the Senate bill before the vote, having failed to complete one of the House version before it was passed two weeks after its introduction. Still, Republicans wondered why the analysis arrived on Thursday, the day the Senate was originally scheduled to vote, a leadership aide said on Friday.The Senate tax bill has been marketed by Republicans as a tax cut for the middle class. How would people in your income group fare?The timing and the scoring of the analysis generated a lot of suspicion, the aide said.Mr. Corker pointed to the analysis to push for rolling back of some of the tax cuts after several years, to reduce the bill\u2019s cost, but many of his colleagues revolted over that idea. Republican leaders decided on Thursday night to drop efforts to appease Mr. Corker and instead sweeten their offer to Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson, by offering to allow pass-through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income, up from 17.4 percent in the original bill.Previously, the leaders had offered a deduction of 20 percent. The increase to 23 was enough to get both men on board.\u201cAfter weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana\u2019s farmers and ranchers, I\u2019ve decided to support the Senate tax cut bill, which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,\u201d Mr. Daines said in a statement Friday morning.Mr. Johnson followed with his own pledge of support.\u201cI wanted more,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m a reasonable human being.\u201dMr. Johnson had helped give a scare to Republican leaders on Thursday, as he, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake withheld their votes as Republicans were trying to kill a Democratic motion to relegate the bill back to a Senate panel.\u201cSenator Corker called me and said, \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we vote for that one?\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson recalled on Friday.\u201cThere\u2019s always parliamentary maneuvers, right?\u201d he said. \u201cSo we didn\u2019t vote.\u201dRecounting how the vote played out, Mr. Johnson said, \u201cI was just kind of biding my time.\u201d Eventually, he said, a Republican colleague, Rob Portman of Ohio, came over to see what could be done.The deal to sweeten the tax break for pass-through businesses came together later that night, as Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daines and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina met with Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, in his Capitol office to make a case to Senate leadership.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of competing interests,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, likening the bill to a Rubik\u2019s Cube.\u201cI guess they put that Rubik\u2019s Cube together,\u201d he added.While Ms. Collins publicly remained undecided on the bill over the past week, Republican leaders were confident they would bring her on board. She made her demands clear early in the process, and she actively negotiated with the leadership until the day of the vote.Democrats warned on Friday that Republicans were making a political mistake with a bill that would increase taxes on some middle-class families.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a dramatic turning point in a downward spiral for the Republicans,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Tax Bill Passes Senate in 51-48 Vote", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe $1.5 trillion tax bill, which is expected to head to President Trump\u2019s desk in the coming days, will have broad effects on the economy, making deep and lasting cuts to corporate taxes as well as temporarily lowering individual taxes.The endeavor was not without hiccups, however, as three small provisions in the final tax bill agreed to by the House and Senate were found by the Senate parliamentarian to violate the budget rules that Republicans must follow to pass their bill through a process that shields it from a Democratic filibuster. As a result, the bill changed slightly in the Senate, and the House will now need to vote on it again since both chambers must approve identical legislation. Among the items that were deemed out of order was the title of the bill: the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.The approval of the bill in the House and Senate came over the strenuous objections of Democrats, who have accused Republicans of giving a gift to corporations and the wealthy and driving up the federal debt in the process.As the final vote approached in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, gave his closing argument against the bill and scolded his Republican colleagues for talking during his remarks on the floor.The Senate passed the bill 51-48, with every Republican present voting yes.\u201cThis is serious stuff,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cWe believe you\u2019re messing up America. You could pay attention for a couple of minutes.\u201dRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, called the tax bill a scam, saying it \u201cis simply theft \u2014 monumental, brazen theft from the American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it.\u201dThe Senate voted 51 to 48, with no Republican defections and no Democratic support.Under the final tax bill, the corporate tax rate would fall to 21 percent, from the current 35 percent, a move that Republicans are betting will increase economic growth, create jobs and raise wages. Individuals would also see tax cuts, including a top rate of 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent. The size of inheritances shielded from estate taxation would double, to $22 million for married couples, and owners of pass-through businesses, whose profits are taxed through the individual code, would be able to deduct 20 percent of their business income.But the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025, a step that Republicans took to comply with budget rules, which do not allow the package to add to the deficit after a decade.The reach of the bill extends beyond taxes. It strikes at a core component of the Affordable Care Act, eliminating the requirement that most people have health coverage or pay a penalty, a move that the Congressional Budget Office projects will increase premiums for people who buy insurance. It also would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, a defeat for environmentalists who have fought against such action for decades.\u201cToday, we are giving the people of this country their money back,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said before the House vote. When the bill passed the House, a giddy Mr. Ryan smiled broadly and banged the gavel with force as he declared victory.The last-minute parliamentary stumble involved three small components of the bill, according to Senate Democrats, including a provision that would have allowed the use of 529 savings accounts for homeschooling expenses and part of the criteria to be used to determine whether colleges and universities are subject to an excise tax imposed on their investment income. The parliamentarian even ruled against the bill\u2019s name, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, since the provision creating the name did not influence spending or revenue, as each provision must under Senate budget rules.The chief tax writer in the House, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was unruffled.\u201cOur belief is, \u2018So what?\u2019\u201d Mr. Brady said on Fox News. \u201cIf we can get to vote twice on cutting taxes for families and small businesses, glad to do it.\u201dRepublicans in Congress moved with remarkable speed in their bid to enact the biggest tax overhaul since 1986, unveiling legislation to rewrite the tax code, marshaling support for their effort and devising a compromise between the House and Senate in under two months.The success within reach would be a stark contrast with their attempt this year to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a quest that was encumbered by internal divisions among Republicans and ultimately ended in humiliating failure.\u201cPeople wanted to get it done,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said of the tax rewrite. \u201cThat\u2019s the single biggest difference.\u201dShortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged the Senate\u2019s vote in a tweet: \u201cThe United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed.\u201dThis simple calculator describes a range of tax scenarios under the Republican tax plan. Find households like yours in five steps or fewer.The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, pushed back on the notion that Mr. Trump would save money as a result of the tax plan. \u201cI know that there are a number of provisions that would negatively impact the president personally,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.At the Capitol, the mood among Republicans was largely triumphant. But Democrats were already looking ahead with a focus on next year\u2019s midterm elections, when they hope to wrest control of the House and Senate. Polls have shown that the Republican tax overhaul is unpopular with the public, and Democrats hope to turn the biggest Republican legislative achievement into a liability in next year\u2019s races.Mr. Schumer warned that Republicans would come to regret rushing the tax bill through Congress on their own.\u201cThis tax bill will be an anchor around the ankles of every Republican,\u201d he said.Protesters also made themselves heard as both chambers voted. As senators cast their final votes on the bill, protesters rose in the gallery of the chamber and began chanting, \u201cKill the bill, don\u2019t kill us.\u201dOn the floor of the Senate, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, observed the proceedings, as senators mingled. The Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona laughed as they spoke to each other while protesters implored them to change their minds and vote down the legislation.But Republicans predicted that their support of the tax bill would be vindicated as voters see its effects.\u201cI frankly think Democrats have overplayed their hand,\u201d Mr. Brady told reporters, \u201cbecause when people back home and our local businesses see the tax relief, they\u2019re going to know they weren\u2019t really told the truth by the opponents of tax reform.\u201dWhile the effect of the bill on people\u2019s bank accounts and on the broader economy remains to be seen, there was little debate on Tuesday about the magnitude of what Republicans were on the verge of accomplishing.Bob Packwood, the former Republican senator from Oregon who helped lead the 1986 tax effort, said that this year\u2019s bill was at least as sweeping as the one that Ronald Reagan signed into law 31 years ago, even though the bills had different goals.\u201cThey have achieved things that I was unable to achieve,\u201d Mr. Packwood said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Living With the Republican Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst, let me vent. The Republican tax reform, now extremely likely to become law pending certain events next week in Alabama, represents a remarkable missed opportunity for a party struggling through an identity crisis and a country reckoning with a social crisis.After watching Trumpian populism overwhelm the dikes of ideology during the last primary campaign, Republican lawmakers could have learned something from the experience, and made the discontented working class voters who put Donald Trump in the White House the major beneficiaries of their tax reform.So the result leaves a reforming conservatism as the neglected stepchild of the G.O.P., granted table scraps while the donors get the feast. It leaves Republicans with ownership of a bill that is neither populist nor popular, and Trump with ownership of an economic agenda that a reasonable voter should consider a betrayal of his promises. And it wastes an opportunity to turbocharge the recovery, because the bill\u2019s corporate beneficiaries are already sitting on ample cash reserves and it\u2019s the middle-class taxpayers who would have been more likely to spend extra money if they got it.Meanwhile, the thing that the bill\u2019s centrist critics are most incensed about, the fiscal irresponsibility of cutting taxes without offsets, just doesn\u2019t look like that big a deal in the context of continued low interest rates and bond market unconcern. Like many people I accepted the arguments of fiscal hawks in the early Obama years, but few-to-none of their predictions have come to pass. I don\u2019t think Republicans have really learned from this experience and become less alarmist about deficits; they\u2019re mostly just being opportunists and hypocrites. But the experience is still real, and the lesson that the deficit is not, in fact, our major near-term problem seems convincing.Then there are the fixable problems. The bill\u2019s repeal of the individual mandate will create additional challenges for the struggling Obamacare exchanges. But the mandate has never worked as its creators intended, it remains more unpopular than Obamacare as a whole, and it penalizes a narrow class of middle-class individual market buyers instead of spreading the burden of the system\u2019s costs more widely. In the long run any universal health insurance system will be on a firmer political footing if it finds a way to work without requiring people to buy a product they don\u2019t want.The corporate tax cut, meanwhile, is too deep, but a lower corporate rate than the present one remains a good idea, and it\u2019s not implausible to imagine these deep cuts being rolled back to a happy medium. Likewise, the bill\u2019s budgetary legerdemain, which has the individual tax cuts expiring early and threatening a middle-class tax hike, sets up a plausible path to a negotiated settlement, in which Democrats who want to protect the middle class can seek a variation on the Obama-era deal that kept most of the Bush tax cuts in exchange for higher rates on the rich.Or, should they be victorious in 2018 and 2020, Democrats can pursue broader ambitions, relying on this tax reform\u2019s overreach for funding rather than simply engaging in deficit-busting of their own. \u201cRepeal some of the Trump tax cuts to pay for Liberal Ambition X or Y!\u201d will be a natural rallying cry for their party in 2020, and the fact that the Trump tax cuts are so tilted toward corporations and businessmen and wealthy heirs means that the cry will have much more political appeal than it might have otherwise.The problem for the Democrats is that a lot of their activists\u2019 hopes are invested with far inferior ideas, like the lure of free college and the political fantasy of single-payer.But there is room here for liberalism to take advantage of the Trump Republicans\u2019 retreat from populism, and to advance a left-wing version of the politics of work and family that the blinkered G.O.P. should champion but refuses to embrace. In which case this bill\u2019s best elements could survive when the wheel of power turns, and its flaws and missed opportunities could still be good for the country in the end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil President\u2019s Christmas Decree Draws a Firestorm, and a Rebuff", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 From another president, a Christmas decree relaxing eligibility rules for nonviolent criminals seeking pardons might have been viewed as a benevolent act.Yet benevolence is a not a sentiment Brazilians tend to apply to President Michel Temer, who set off a firestorm over the weekend by signing a decree that might one day spare him and several close allies dogged by corruption allegations from spending years in prison.Prosecutors had argued that the president\u2019s decree would make plea bargains \u2014 a relatively new feature of Brazilian criminal law, but one that has been instrumental in the Lava Jato investigation \u2014 far less appealing.The inquiry has exposed institutionalized bribery at large companies, including the state-owned oil giant, Petrobras, and Odebrecht, a construction company that admitted in legal proceedings that it had paid hundreds of millions of dollars to politicians across Latin America to secure contracts.\u201cThis pardon is the most concrete act by President Temer against the mechanism of plea bargains and a clear sign that he wants to weaken the judiciary\u2019s fight against corruption,\u201d Monique Cheker, a federal prosecutor in Rio de Janeiro State, said in an interview Thursday.The administration could seek a review by the full court when it reconvenes in February.In a separate case, Mr. Temer\u2019s administration is seeking to bar the imprisonment of people convicted of crimes until their appeals have been exhausted. In a brief before the Supreme Court, the executive branch has argued that delaying prison sentences safeguards defendants\u2019 rights. Prosecutors counter that such a move would represent a return to an era in which white-collar cases languished for years during appeals.\u201cIt would do great harm to Lava Jato in the best of cases, delaying the execution of sentences for at least a decade,\u201d said Roberson Pozzobon, a prosecutor assigned to a Lava Jato task force in Curitiba, the southern city where the investigation began. \u201cThis setback would mean the institutionalization of impunity and would therefore create a great incentive for criminal practices, notably corruption.\u201dMr. Temer spent much of the year horse-trading with lawmakers, who twice voted to prevent the cases from being referred to the Supreme Court, the only court where senior officials may be prosecuted. Mr. Temer called Mr. Janot a headline-grabbing, overzealous prosecutor and expressed hope that Ms. Dodge would be more measured.The accusations Mr. Temer faces are potentially more scandalous than those that led to the downfall of Ms. Rousseff, who was impeached for tapping into central reserve funds to paper over budget shortfalls.Yet Brazilians, who carried out large demonstrations while Ms. Rousseff\u2019s fate was hanging in the balance, have not responded to the accusations against Mr. Temer with the same level of public outrage.To understand why, Ms. Cheker, the prosecutor, said she looked to her own family. Her father, she said, is among those who see Mr. Temer as capable of mending Brazil\u2019s economy as it emerges from a yearslong recession.\u201cEnough with impeachments,\u201d the prosecutor said her father told her recently. \u201cBrazil needs to move forward, people are going through hard times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Israel and the Art of the Giveaway", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m contemplating writing a book on the first year of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, and I already know the name: \u201cThe Art of the Giveaway.\u201dIn nearly 30 years of covering United States foreign policy, I\u2019ve never seen a president give up so much to so many for so little, starting with China and Israel. In both the Middle Kingdom and in the Land of Israel, Christmas came early this year. The Chinese and the Jews are both whispering to their kids: \u201cThere really is a Santa Claus.\u201dAnd his name is Donald Trump.Who can blame them? Let\u2019s start with Israel. Every Israeli government since its founding has craved United States recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. And every United States government has refrained from doing that, arguing that such a recognition should come only in the wake of an agreed final status peace accord between Israelis and Palestinians \u2014 until now.Today, Trump just gave it away \u2014 for free. Such a deal! Why in the world would you just give this away for free and not even use it as a lever to advance the prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian deal?Trump could have said two things to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. First, he could have said: \u201cBibi, you keep asking me to declare Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. O.K., I will do that. But I want a deal. Here\u2019s what I want from you in return: You will declare an end to all Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, outside of the existing settlement bloc that everyone expects to be part of Israel in any two-state solution.\u201dTrump also could have said, as the former United States ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk suggested, that he\u2019d decided \u201cto begin the process of moving the embassy to western Jerusalem, but at the same time was declaring his willingness to make a parallel announcement that he would establish an embassy to the state of Palestine in East Jerusalem\u201d \u2014 as part of any final status agreement. That would at least have insulated us from looking like we made a one-sided gesture that will only complicate peacemaking and kept the door open to Palestinians.In either case, Trump could then have boasted to Israelis and Palestinians that he got them each something that Barack Obama never did \u2014 something that advanced the peace process and United States credibility and did not embarrass our Arab allies. But Trump is a chump. And he is a chump because he is ignorant and thinks the world started the day he was elected, and so he is easily gamed.Just ask the Chinese. Basically, his first day in office, Trump tore up the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal \u2014 clearly without having read it or asked China for any trade concession in return. Trump simply threw out the window the single most valuable tool America had for shaping the geoeconomic future of the region our way and for pressuring China to open its markets to more United States goods.Trump is now trying to negotiate trade openings with China alone \u2014 bilaterally \u2014 and getting basically nowhere. And yet he could have been negotiating with China as the head of a 12-nation TPP trading bloc that was based on United States values and interests and that controlled 40 percent of the global economy. Think of the leverage we lost.Just to remind: TPP was a free-trade agreement that the Obama team forged with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. It was not only the largest free-trade agreement in history, it was the best ever for United States workers, closing loopholes Nafta had left open. Some 80 percent of the goods from our 11 TPP partners were coming into the United States duty-free already, while our goods and services were still being hit with thousands of tariffs in their countries \u2014 which TPP eliminated.Trump is susceptible to such giveaways, not only because he is ignorant, but because he does not see himself as the president of the United States. He sees himself as the president of his base. And because that\u2019s the only support he has left, he feels the need to keep feeding his base by fulfilling crude, ill-conceived promises he threw out to them during the campaign. Today, again, he put another one of those promises ahead of United States\u2019 national interest.Advertisement"}

I learn from all of you, and I hope you all learn a bit from one another other as well.Both were featured on The New York Times\u2019s Chinese-language website \u2014 which translates about a dozen of our most interesting stories every day, along with special features like Word of the Day \u2014 and as a result, this newsletter now includes several New York Times readers in Australia who prefer to respond in Chinese.So as the year comes to an end (I\u2019ll be on hiatus until early January), I\u2019m turning this week\u2019s installment over to all of you, our insightful readers, the newly arrived and the well established.Thank you. For reading. For contributing. For subscribing.See you next year.______They say it takes two to tango and this is Australia\u2019s dance macabre. Our politicians are blinded by the money the Chinese pump into our economy. In their eagerness to sell the country, from iron ore to real estate, they appear to forget about those of us at home who may not be able to survive in our own country.Then there\u2019s the slight issue of China\u2019s obvious expansionist ambitions.Last but not least, could I write this response in China without disappearing into a government run re-education program?Wake up Australia. We don\u2019t need the Chinese with their communist version of a new age capitalism inspired by a poorly translated novel by Ayn Rand ruining our economy and government. We can do that ourselves.\u2014 Lon EisenwegerIf Americans or Australians approach China with a sense of fear and suspicion, the direction of things will only go one way \u2014 down.Think of how many people you have met and had a great relationship with, by your starting out disliking the person. Probably not many.It is much more productive, healthier, and less stressful to focus on the China relationship as a series of potential +1 moments. Is this a good deal? Is that a good deal? Do the sum of these developments / consequences make sense?\u2014 Peter TsuI am an Asian Australian, migrated to Australia over 35 years ago. Racism especially against non-European migrants remains raw; one does not have to scratch far for it to rear its ugly head.The root cause is our gutless politicians who are unwilling to stand up against the racist right-wing elements in their political establishment, and to completely eradicate this social blight.Every year for the past 30 years, Asian students have topped high school and university results. One wonders, where are these bright students represented in the nations top corporations? Where are the C-Suite Asian executives?Surely, if true meritocracy exists, the numbers would reflect that, but in reality only a pitiful handful are represented in the top companies. The \u201cBamboo Ceiling\u201d exists, similar to the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d for women. It says, if you are Asian you do not have a chance to advance in this country \u2014 it is this country\u2019s hidden apartheid.Racism and its social injustice holds back this great nation\u2019s potential.It\u2019s the Sin that keeps giving. It\u2019s the truth that is too hard to deal with.\u2014 Alvin LongI would like to say what many ordinary hard working tax paying Aussies are thinking and quietly talking about for fear of being branded racist. And public debate on the issue is stifled for the same reason. And that is the suspicion and belief that China is taking over this Country by stealth and that in 50 years we will have been well and truly China-ised and unrecognisable as the Country we are today.And no, I am not a racist, I belong to no political party or far left or right-wing groups; I am a hard-working health professional in my early 60s.\u2014 Carmel O\u2019HeirThis comment has been translated.I am Chinese, living in Australia, and through work I\u2019ve had contact with some people related to bilateral economic and trade associations and chambers of commerce as well as Chinese companies. I believe some of them really are appointed by China to engage in political activities.This is a fact. For the purpose and impact. First, take into account all the economic resources that are nationalized under China\u2019s control (including some so-called private enterprises). Second, in relation to China\u2019s political influence in Australia, whether it is to undermine Australia\u2019s democratic system or not, it is also just to protect themselves or that regime, which also needs to be clear. In my opinion, the main purpose of the Chinese government is self-protection.But in the end, democracy and a totalitarian regime cannot coexist. Australia really should be vigilant.\u2014 Michael ZhangWhen I was in China at the World Women\u2019s Conference in 1995 I asked myself: \u201dHow do you govern billions of people?\u201dI decided that it was not for me to be criticizing plans that have brought so many out of extreme poverty. The population numbers are bewildering. My promise to myself stands, but is more ambivalent.Since then I\u2019ve watched documentaries showing life for workers in giant Chinese factories improving slightly. Contrastingly, I see homes demolished in cities in the name of development and their owners driven back to the countryside.I admire the advance in solar energy and transport. I am saddened by the treatment of artists and lawyers for human rights. I see conflicting approaches to pollution control.I don\u2019t like any Government setting up a military USA-v-China conflict where we in Oz take sides. Both countries are my friends (culturally for China\u2019s rich ancient history; the best of New World for the USA) and both are my enemies (cruel customs and brutal controls in China; Pine Gap and mistaken global interventions by the USA).\u2014 Julanne SweeneyAs a 22-year-old Australian \u201cmillennial,\u201d I consider the question of the Sino-Australian relationship to be one of great import.I worry that a mature debate about legitimate concerns regarding our relationship with China and Chinese influence is being drowned out on the left by cries of xenophobia and racism, and on the right by ignorance and protectionism.At the end of the day, the United States is the guarantor of Australian security and prosperity. Those who would argue otherwise are either ignorant of history, the politics of international relations or willfully blind.Whilst we cannot ignore China, we should not seek investment at any cost, and the domestic Australian-Chinese community is a valuable resource that we should mobilise to help the Chinese government understand our values and our red lines.To simply \u201cstand down\u201d would be a grave error. The government must again convince the Australian public of the importance of the United States to our freedom, and I am sure that the institutional momentum of the US state department and military will respond in kind, no matter who sits in the Oval Office.\u2014 Lachlan BlairFor Australia (as it should be for other countries as well) relations with China are not a simplistic choice of \u201cfriend or foe.\u201d All foreign countries present both threats and opportunities for one\u2019s own country.China, because of its size, culture and generally effective policies \u2014 as well as its menacing hyper-nationalism and belief that might is right \u2014 looms very large on both scores. We cannot neglect either.For Australia (for all other countries as well), bilateral relations with individual countries are important but so is the global international system which is so important in determining our fate.China is every year becoming more important a player in shaping that system.The problem for Australia in coping with this is made much more difficult by the fact that Trump\u2019s America is out to lunch on this topic.Australia (like other counties) does need a good America on this front: the system was badly damaged by Bush Jr.; what we \u2014 and the U.S. itself \u2014 need is a dynamic and sustained effort at reconstruction.\u2014 Ron WalkerThis raises serious issues for me as an Aboriginal woman in Victoria!Why is one immigrant race enabled to increase numbers over all others? Why is this one race enabled to buy up huge tracts of land in Australia? Why such an attachment to Chinese government money in the agriculture industry and real estate?Why are our politicians enabled to travel as part of Chinese junkets that then result in real estate development across our cities?So why is one ethnic group given more status or more rights (is it because of their $$$) than our First Peoples?Our First People need to be help decide who comes who stays and who can leave! As our country is impacted environmentally (my research area) to the extreme to the detriment of our native flora and fauna by immigrants who are not refugees.I hear no concern for how far we are straining our environmental security!\u2014 Janet Turpie-JohnstoneChinese gold miners were active in parts of Australia even before the arrival of the British, who brought their military and several thousand British prisoners to Australia, having overloaded their own country with convicted criminals after the post-Napoleonic wars.Today Australia has thousands of Chinese or part-Chinese still living in this country and they have always maintained friendships with Australians and with refugees of various European birth who arrived in more thousands after World War II.I have lived in Australia all my life. My earlier relations came by sea to Australia in 1850 with my great-great grandfather who arrived with our family when he was only eight years old.I was born here in 1932 and I am 85 years old as I write this. I have known people from many other nations and I can say with absolute certainty that I have enjoyed friendships with people of all races, including Australian Aboriginals and many Chinese people with whom I have always enjoyed very many friendships.The current political concerns about Australians and China is nothing more than a lot of unbelievable tripe.\u2014 Rodney E.

{"Headline": "Can Marriott Keep Starwood\u2019s Culture of Cool, and Its Customers?", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 Consider the conundrum of the modern hotel-room shopper.Oh, O.K., consider my conundrum.There are trips where I\u2019d like to feel younger than I am, which means staying in a hotel that is cooler than I am. There are trips when I just want to be close to the airport because of a 6 a.m. departure. And then there are trips that require accommodation for a toddler, a tween and two parents who would appreciate an interior door or three to separate everyone.Now, consider Marriott. I sure am, and so are untold numbers of loyal Starwood Hotels customers who feel uneasy about big, beige Marriott acquiring their beloved Starwood.In theory, this gives the company the power to drive hard bargains with commission-hungry travel agents and booking websites. The companies\u2019 30 brands ought to provide enough variety to satisfy everyone from picky millennials to finicky retirees, right?Well.For one thing, many of those brands are indistinguishable from one another. Do we really need both Sheraton and Marriott? Can you even tell their rooms apart if you walk into one without seeing the sign outside? And what do the names Element, Four Points, TownePlace and Delta mean to you? They\u2019re among the 30, so they seem to mean a lot to Marriott.And even with all those properties, the newly combined giant is not necessarily everywhere we need it to be. Sure, they are downtown and at the airport and on ring roads that circle big cities, but the company has usually taken too many years to identify and open a property in the up-and-coming neighborhoods where Airbnb listings are legion.Add in the spaghetti-swirl task of having to combine two loyalty programs with dozens of airline and other partners into one that will keep more than 100 million members in the fold. At that point, it starts to seem downright daunting for the new Marriott to answer the following question: Can it give us what we need \u2014 on every kind of trip \u2014 to keep us from straying?Marriott\u2019s aim to get much bigger is a risky one. But the answer to just three questions will probably determine how investors, developers and people like me will react over time.\u25a0 First, will the new Marriott be convenient? The old Starwood often was not, especially for people seeking lower-price properties.\u25a0 Starwood regularly lapped Marriott on matters of coolness, though. Its W, Westin and Aloft brands offered the possibility that your hotel room could look and feel like your bedroom at home. Will Marriott impede Starwood\u2019s culture of innovation, just as the company is facing the enormous new threat from Airbnb and its appeal to fans of quirk, local culture and value?\u25a0 And then, there\u2019s the loyalty programs. Frequent travelers want their hotel stays to count for something. The Starwood Preferred Guest program has drawn particularly passionate, opinionated members. But it\u2019s a rare merger that results in better benefits for all elite-level travelers. Marriott is still several months away from announcing crucial details about the future of the program, but how much will it take away from wary S.P.G. fans like me?For the acquisition to succeed, creative employees need to stick around. Because the company owns only a tiny fraction of its hotels, the real estate developers it partners with must want to raise the various Marriott flags and hire the company to manage the properties.And travelers who could easily stay at a Hilton, the Ace or at an Airbnb must become or remain loyal. \u201cEach of them needs to see material, quick benefits from this transaction in order to be proponents of the deal,\u201d said Arne Sorenson, Marriott\u2019s chief executive.The result for people looking for a place to stay was often a metropolitan area map that looks like the one in Pittsburgh, with a Sheraton and a Westin downtown, or near it, plus a solitary offering out at the airport. Marriott, however, has properties in a near ring around the city, plus several hotels downtown and several more in the Oakland, Shadyside and Bakery Square neighborhoods.Mr. Sorenson, Marriott\u2019s chief executive, said he had never used Airbnb to book lodging, but his daughter has. She told him he had nothing to worry about.But does he really think she\u2019s right? \u201cThey were the toughest competition when they were offering a true sharing-economy product,\u201d he said, describing the company\u2019s origins in renting out an air mattress or a room. \u201cThe more they get to offering dedicated units, which they\u2019ve done as they\u2019ve grown, the more they look like the competition we\u2019ve faced for decades.\u201dAny comparison stretches only so far, said Tina Edmundson, Marriott\u2019s global brand officer. She has sampled Airbnb, twice. How did she like it? \u201cIt was O.K.,\u201d she said, scrunching up her face a little. \u201cIt was fine.\u201dShe acknowledged that her standards might be particularly high. \u201cI like the notion that someone professional has been in and cleaned it,\u201d she said, befitting someone who was once a hotel general manager. \u201cI totally get that I am not the target for Airbnb. Tons of people love that, and I think that\u2019s great.\u201dSo yes, she concluded, it\u2019s an important threat worth keeping an eye on. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there is panic in the city,\u201d she said.Mr. Sternlicht, Starwood\u2019s founder, never asked anybody\u2019s permission. Instead, he bet that people would like their hotel interiors to look more like their home (or the one of their modernist dreams) and less like a gallery of plaid and polyester.The resulting parade of innovation began with the W chain, with sleek in-room furniture and lobbies that felt like nightclubs. Westin introduced the Heavenly Bed (complete with a trademark), and the newly comfortable guests purchased more than $150 million in bedding to use at home.Marriott, meanwhile, suffered not necessarily from bad taste but a sort of baseline blandness. \u201cThere are very few properties in the Marriott spectrum that I might find desirable,\u201d said Kenneth Ballenegger, a longtime Starwood customer who lives in San Francisco.In recent years, Marriott has introduced a number of new brands, including the Autograph collection of luxury properties and Moxy, which is in the same general category as Starwood\u2019s Aloft. \u201cBut Starwood has owned that space for a longer period of time than anyone else,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said. \u201cWe want to make sure to graft that onto new shoots that already exist at Marriott.\u201dThose shoots may bear fruit in Pittsburgh one of these days. A Moxy that was supposed to occupy converted space downtown fell by the wayside, but the Oakland neighborhood will get an Autograph soon.Even before Marriott began trying to define or redefine the brands it had acquired, it listed its incumbent ones in a security filing with all sorts of head-scratching definitions that were supposed to differentiate them. Marriott \u201ctypically\u201d includes \u201cdestination-driven restaurants\u201d (really?), while Courtyard is for an \u201cupscale tier\u201d (wait, isn\u2019t that Ritz and Renaissance and Autograph?) and Fairfield Inn & Suites helps \u201cmaintain balance and momentum.\u201dI scrambled these descriptions and challenged one executive to match them with their correct brand names. She could not.Hotel developers shop among brands \u2014 and they, too, are confused. \u201cI\u2019m a hotel nerd, and it\u2019s blurry for me,\u201d said Deno Yiankes, president and chief executive of investments and development at White Lodging, which owns 16 Marriott-branded properties and is building eight more.The world does not need both Four Points and Fairfield. Affluent travelers would suffer no grievous harm if Marriott forced a death match between Starwood\u2019s St. Regis brand and Ritz-Carlton.But combining brands turns out to be challenging. Franchisees often sign 20-year contracts, and pulling them out of a particular brand mid-deal may be difficult. Plus, there\u2019s the sheer expense of changing every last pen, sign and interior marker.Sheraton is probably the biggest Marriott brand that is in sorry shape. Even some Starwood loyalists have never been sure what it is supposed to stand for. It\u2019s popular (and more upscale) in some parts of the world, but its United States properties often feature various shades of brown, smudged fake brass in the elevators and nicked wooden furniture.\u201cEvery time there\u2019s been a new C.E.O., they\u2019ve tried to fix it,\u201d said Ms. Edmundson, the Marriott executive who once worked at Starwood. \u201cIt requires an unbelievable amount of discipline to do it. I promise you Marriott has that, and Starwood does not.\u201dIndeed, not long after she told me that, the company announced that it had identified the 50 worst Sheratons in the United States. Many are undergoing renovations, but 5,000 Sheraton rooms will soon earn points under some other flag because their owners could not bring them up to standard.If the fixes for Sheraton work, it preserves an additional choice for the travelers (as well as convention planners and corporate travel managers) who will ultimately decide the merger\u2019s fate.Marriott also has to appeal to the large number of people who have no brand loyalty and book their hotel rooms on whatever third-party websites seem to offer the best deal. The company dislikes paying commissions to the Expedias of the world, but it often needs those websites to help fill its properties on any given night. On those sites, Marriott\u2019s 30 brands may offer an advantage.The decisions likely to draw the most attention at Marriott in the next year involve the combination of its Marriott Rewards loyalty program with Starwood Preferred Guest.Frequent travelers are picky, and some of them (O.K., some of us) have occasional entitlement issues. Marriott and Starwood have different rules about what amount of spending earns what amount of points and what those points are worth if you want to trade them in for a night at the Ritz or a week at an Aloft. Frequent travelers want to qualify for elite status quickly so they can earn upgrades and other perks, but the two programs have different rules about this, too. Then, there are the programs\u2019 partnerships, dozens of them, with airlines and others, all of which have to be negotiated or renegotiated.The travelers who spend the most money take all of this minutiae seriously, and Marriott knows it. Moreover, its executives are quick to acknowledge that Starwood\u2019s loyalty program is a big part of what made the chain a worthwhile acquisition.So they professed to be a bit surprised at the negative reaction from many top-level members of Starwood\u2019s loyalty program. \u201cIt was very intense, very possessive,\u201d Mr. Sorenson said.He added that he understood that at least part of it was disappointment, given that most of the program\u2019s elite members like me could have chosen Marriott, but did not. \u201cAnd you convinced yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cthat that was the right choice and that all things Starwood are more appropriate for me, even though I might have stayed at a lousy Sheraton last night.\u201dBut people who travel frequently and have cast their lot with a particular chain come to value \u2014 and then expect \u2014 special or exclusive creature comforts. Travel is often anonymous, inconvenient and uncertain. A good loyalty program offers payback, recognition and at least some predictability.Starwood understood that from the beginning, offering late checkout in most properties, no blackout days for people trying to redeem their points for free hotel rooms and free upgrades (often to enormous suites) for elite members. One popular perk allows members to trade their Starwood points for American Airlines frequent flier miles and get a 25 percent bonus when they do. Redeem those miles for expensive business class seats on ocean-crossing flights, as I\u2019ve done for years, and you\u2019re a big winner.Starwood\u2019s limited footprint also meant that it had to make it easier for members to qualify for elite status. After all, people often had to go out of their way to stay in its properties. Starwood allows people to qualify based on the number of stays in a property in a single year. People like me who take lots of short trips can qualify for Platinum with 25 stays, which I accomplished with just 39 nights away from home this year. Marriott members need 75 nights to achieve the same status.So far, the company has said little about the fate of its airline partnerships. It will probably be another year before it can formally combine the Marriott and Starwood loyalty programs.That silence has not kept travelers from jumping to some logical conclusions though. \u201cThey\u2019ve handled things surprising well, and I believe they have good intentions,\u201d said Mr. Ballenegger, the longtime Starwood fan. \u201cBut the more they touch it, they worse it will probably get, unfortunately.\u201dBut that depends on your perspective. Bruce Schobel is a retired actuary with over 2,400 lifetime nights at Marriott. \u201cOne of the things I like best about getting to Marriott\u2019s highest elite levels is that it\u2019s pretty damn hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThe benefits they are able to provide are fairly generous because the number of people are fairly small.\u201d Given that exclusivity and the likelihood that Marriott will want to maintain it, it seems near certain that Starwood fans like me are going to need to bed down many more nights each year to keep our status.Mr. Sorenson is aware, however, that he would be foolish to take away too much. A hotel company\u2019s most loyal customers generally book directly on its website or phone lines, instead of going to a human travel agent or Expedia and its competitors, where the hotel company has to pay a commission. As long as the Marriott perks do not cost more than what the third parties get in commission, the company is still winning.As Mr. Sorenson presides over it all, he says he senses wariness, cynicism even. But he also draws hope from those strong feelings about the Starwood Preferred Guest program.\u201cWe want you to care intensely about the program, because that shows the value of the program to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst thing would be if people said that they never really cared about S.P.G. anyway.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated which hotel company operates the Homewood Suites brand. It is Hilton Worldwide, not Marriott International.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Hollywood Looks Like From China", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurning PointsA man had a dream in which he was told where he could find fantastic wealth in a remote place. When he awoke, he instantly set off to find it. After a long journey full of danger and hardship, he arrived at the place in his dream. A local man who had heard about the dreamer\u2019s purpose laughed loud and long, saying that he had dreamed three times about a house where great treasure was buried under a fountain. It dawned on the dreamer that the place the local was describing was his very own yard. He returned home and found the treasure.Like the man in this tale, the Chinese movie industry has been on a long journey to find its place in the world. In 1994, \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d became the first major Hollywood film to be released in the country in decades. Audiences were enthralled with the movie\u2019s fast pace and sound effects, and it proved to be a runaway success. Since then, the Chinese film industry has balanced a complex relationship with Hollywood.Many in China\u2019s film industry, from young scriptwriters to senior critics, know Hollywood\u2019s dramatic structure all too well and advocate its tropes and tactics. And many American offerings introduced in the Chinese market, regardless of quality, continue to do well among Chinese audiences, especially with young people, whose tastes and viewing habits have been shaped by Hollywood movies and TV shows. Like audiences in other developing countries, those in China tend to have a worldview filtered by and focused on the United States, even though the United States doesn\u2019t mean the whole world and Hollywood isn\u2019t the world\u2019s only movie industry.Like an ocean that refuses no rivers, China\u2019s movie industry will continue to influence and allow itself to be influenced by its international counterparts. China needs the United States, and the United States needs China. But at the moment, a large discrepancy exists in that very few Chinese movies are able to enter the American market and attract a significant audience. Chinese audiences provide Hollywood with huge profits, but what does China\u2019s film industry gain in return?What\u2019s more, homegrown movies in China sometimes face steep challenges in the shadow of Hollywood blockbusters. We are right to be concerned about the succession and inheritance of China\u2019s film traditions as well as the potential loss of our unique values and aesthetics.Despite these worries, like a boat that sails with the flow, we will continue to work on maintaining our distinctiveness while acknowledging the benefits of this cultural exchange. Just think how corn, tomatoes and sweet potatoes came from other lands but are able to thrive in China and provide nourishment all the same.I have worked with Hollywood before, and my experience has enriched my appreciation of both worlds. Due to the technological and regulatory differences between the American and Chinese film industries, it is not always easy to apply what one has learned in one environment to the other. Sometimes the effort to make improvements ends up causing bigger headaches. But self-reflection and correction is nevertheless vital. Hesitation out of fear of making a mistake will never allow for the growth and change that is necessary for the creation of art.Even though the treasure is hidden in plain sight, we realize that it is the journey that is indispensable. It\u2019s important to keep channels \u2014 and our minds \u2014 open to achieve a mutual understanding of our cultures, policies and economies. Both sides must travel farther than they imagined in order to know each other better and explore the possibilities for a fantastic future.Zhang Yimou is an Oscar-nominated director whose films have included \u201cJu Dou,\u201d \u201cRaise the Red Lantern,\u201d \u201cHero\u201d and \u201cHouse of Flying Daggers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exodus of Foreign Workers Leaves British Employers in the Lurch", "Date": "2017-12-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORDOUN, Scotland \u2014 The first inkling that Ross Mitchell knew something had gone awry was when a busload of Bulgarians he had hired to pick blueberries last month failed to appear.The way he saw it, they had been \u201chijacked.\u201dThe real explanation was rather more prosaic but no more palatable: During a one-night stopover in Birmingham, a city on the way to Mr. Mitchell\u2019s farm in northern Scotland, the 30 Bulgarians were lured by a factory offering more attractive wages. They never made it to their original destination.The diversion of his work force meant that Mr. Mitchell, a fruit supplier for a major supermarket chain in Britain, lost 50 tons of fruit worth half a million pounds ($680,000) in a matter of weeks.In Mr. Mitchell\u2019s case, the signs started appearing in the autumn after the June 2016 referendum on Brexit. This spring, the number of returning laborers started dropping.\u201cThere were no-shows, people started changing their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cGuys who\u2019ve worked five, six years with us started saying, \u2018We\u2019re not returning.\u2019 It all came to a head in late summer and autumn. The workload was getting stretched and we literally could not replace and recruit.\u201d\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d Mr. Mitchell, 36, said stoically, sitting in his kitchen with his arms crossed. He paused to reflect on the coming year, letting out a brief sigh as the sky outside prepared to unleash a downpour. \u201cThe big thing that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind is the labor shortage.\u201dAcross Britain, fruit farmers like Mr. Mitchell are already scrambling to recruit and retain workers ahead of next spring, when the competition for an ever-shrinking pool of labor will be at its fiercest.Farmers are doing everything to persuade workers from the rest of Europe to come work for them: better wages and conditions \u2014 in some cases, as high as \u00a315 ($20) an hour \u2014 English lessons, even access to tennis courts and movie theaters. Still, recruiting has been difficult.Businesses \u201care trying to make it easy and as pleasant as possible for people to come to work in the U.K,\u201d said Jack Ward, chief executive of the British Growers Association. \u201cDespite that, people are staying away.\u201dMarion Regan, a farmer in southern Kent whose strawberries sell out during the Wimbledon tennis tournament, said: \u201cWe have seen fewer people applying and fewer people being able to return, and more people canceling at the last minute. That makes it more uncertain to plan ahead.\u201dThe \u201cBrexodus\u201d has been compounded by a fall in the value of the pound against the euro. For migrants from Bulgaria and Romania, the weaker currency has made the journey to Britain less worthwhile; there are similar jobs closer to home, in Germany and the Netherlands, for example. Given that other European Union countries are also struggling to hire fruit pickers, the competition to hire young, able-bodied workers has become even more intense.The laborers who now come to Britain tend to be older and less skilled, according to farmers, who say hiring British workers is nearly impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that you can\u2019t recruit U.K. nationals,\u201d said Mr. Hardman of Hops, the agency that recruits seasonal laborers. \u201cIt\u2019s not attractive for them. They find it beneath them.\u201dRecruitment of British workers is also difficult, industry officials say, because unemployment is already low in farming regions, particularly in the south, and local residents are unwilling to move across the country for a job that does not offer long-term prospects.The labor shortage is likely to worsen next year if the uncertainty over negotiations with other European Union members continues and no government action is taken to fill in the vacuum, many farmers and industry officials say. Britain typically employs about 80,000 seasonal workers every year, more than 90 percent of them non-British Europeans, according to industry figures.There are worries that the production of fresh produce could eventually shift to major competitors in the Netherlands, Poland and Ireland, or that supermarkets will increasingly turn to imports.Farmers interviewed for this article said that they were already raising wholesale prices as a result of increased labor costs, even though supermarkets have so far managed to keep retail prices unchanged.\u201cIt is a very, very big impact,\u201d Alison Capper, chair of the N.F.U.\u2019s horticulture board, said of the labor shortage. \u201cThe whole industry is like that.\u201dMs. Capper owns an orchard in the Midlands that produces Gala apples.This year, she had 20 percent fewer workers than usual, she said. That translated to at one point about 35 tons of apples going unpicked until they could be used only to make juice, which is less lucrative than apples for consumption.\u201cIf the apple starts to go overripe, the skin starts to get greasy and it\u2019s not salable,\u201d Ms. Capper said. \u201cWe were struggling to stay ahead of the apples\u2019 ripening, so that the last 100 bins ended up being sent\u201d to juice makers. \u201cThis has been the biggest challenge for generations.\u201dThe industry is calling on the government to reintroduce a seasonal workers\u2019 program that was scrapped in 2013 by Theresa May, Britain\u2019s current prime minister who was then leading the Home Office and in charge of immigration. That program, which is run elsewhere in the European Union, allowed non-European migrants to work in Britain on fixed contracts and schedules. Crucially, the pickers were committed to doing the job.But the British government stopped the program around the same time that the European Union accepted Romania and Bulgaria into the regional bloc. The assumption at the time, farmers say, was that workers from those countries would replace the non-European laborers.They did \u2014 until Britain voted for Brexit.Now, because of the bloc\u2019s principle of freedom of movement, the Bulgarians that Mr. Mitchell had recruited were free to choose whichever jobs paid best, even those unrelated to farming.The government has so far rejected calls to reintroduce the seasonal workers program. In a statement, the Home Office said the government did not intend to operate migration schemes for non-European citizens \u201cwhile employers have access to unrestricted access to labor from elsewhere in the European Union.\u201d\u201cWe do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to justify the introduction of a seasonal agricultural workers scheme this year but we will keep this position under careful, ongoing review,\u201d it added.For Mr. Mitchell, the Scottish farmer, the issue is urgent and no longer limited to agriculture but to the entire economy. Everyone, he said, is fighting for the same labor pool.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the survival of the fittest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Quakes and Fires? It\u2019s the Cost of Living That Californians Can\u2019t Stomach", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Russel Lee and his wife spent the past few years going online to do the depressing math of how much less housing costs pretty much everywhere that isn\u2019t California. They looked at Idaho, Arizona, North Carolina and Kentucky, but Mr. Lee, who was born in San Francisco and has lived in the Bay Area his entire life, could never quite make the move. Then the fires came.\u201cIt was like \u2018Welp, it\u2019s time,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like \u2018The Grapes of Wrath\u2019 in reverse.\u201dFor the half-century after World War II, California represented the epitome of middle-class America on the move. As people poured into the state in search of good weather and the lure of single-family homes with backyard orange trees, the state embarked on a vast natural engineering project that redirected northern water southward, creating the modern Southern California and making the state the most populous in the nation.Those days are long gone. For more than three decades, California has seen a net outflow of residents to other states, as less expensive southern cities like Phoenix, Houston and Raleigh supplant those of the Golden State as beacons of opportunity. California still has a hold on the national imagination: It has lots of jobs and great weather, along with the glamour of Hollywood and the inventiveness of Silicon Valley.Still, for many Californians, the question is always sitting there: Is this worth it? Natural disasters are a moment to take stock and rethink the dream. But in the end, the calculation almost always comes down to cost.Last Friday was Saul Weinstein\u2019s last day at work, and the start of his last weekend as a Californian. Mr. Weinstein, a 67-year-old commercial banker, retired and moved to Nevada. He has lived through several fires, and the 1994 earthquake that killed 57 people and shook him and millions of other Southern Californians out of bed at 4:30 in the morning.But what finally sent him packing was money. Mr. Weinstein is selling his 2,000-square-foot house in Baldwin Park, east of Los Angeles, for $570,000. He paid less than half that for a similarly sized place in Pahrump, Nev., about an hour\u2019s drive west of Las Vegas. He moved on Monday.\u201cWhen you retire you have to watch your money,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cThe San Andreas Fault is what they politely call \u2018overdue,\u2019 and I will be much more comfortable when I\u2019m away from that. But if it wasn\u2019t for the cost of living I probably would have stuck around and taken my chances.\u201dNext year, Heather Birdsell is likely to be among them. Ms. Birdsell, a 33-year-old legal assistant, grew up in Orange County and now lives in a two-bedroom condominium in Lake Forest, Calif. After years of watching friends move out of state and listening to them talk about how much easier life was and how much bigger their homes were, Ms. Birdsell and her husband finally put their home on the market. They are in escrow now and plan on moving to Phoenix early next year.\u201cThe money we make in California is more than sufficient to work in any other state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just excited about finally getting what we want and not being strapped to make it happen.\u201dFire is an annual affair, and even as climate change stretches the burning season from summer and early fall clear into December, people here accept that pleasant weather and destructive forces are linked. People who live in Florida and on the Gulf Coast have made a similar peace with hurricanes.\u201cI think you\u2019ll find that even people who lost houses will stay here,\u201d said Tom Sheaffer, 54, who grew up in Ventura. The same warm offshore winds that helped spread the fire are responsible for shaping the nicely curled waves that Mr. Sheaffer surfs on good mornings.Mr. Sheaffer\u2019s wife, Mary Beth, said the image that she holds with her is the one of the iconic cross at Grant Park, which sits on a hillside overlooking the downtown area. The fire burned everything around it at the park and charred the cross itself. But it is still standing, and many Ventura residents are using its image with the hashtag #Venturastrong to indicate a willingness to rebuild, to get their lives back.\u201cThat makes me cry the most,\u201d Ms. Sheaffer said.\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d her husband said.And in the end the state always does. California has 40 million people and has grown through much worse. San Francisco was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire and was rebuilt in time to host the 1915 World\u2019s Fair. The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the worst since 1906, was followed by the 1991 Oakland fires, followed by the 1993 Malibu fires, followed by the 1994 Northridge earthquake.None of this was enough to dissuade Silicon Valley from expanding into the world\u2019s technology capital, or to induce Hollywood to leave Hollywood. \u201cThe wrath of God has failed to deter companies from thinking this is a great place to be, although it is expensive and crowded,\u201d said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy.Living here means accepting the existential threats. Out on the horizon, beyond the periodic fires, floods and landslides, lies the knowledge that at some point the next great earthquake is going to cause a staggering amount of destruction and, if it damages the water system, could render large parts of the state uninhabitable. But shortly in the aftermath of a disaster, after checking the first aid kit and refilling the fresh water bottles, Californians go back to living.\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of episodic mindfulness and then you retreat back to oblivion,\u201d said Jim Newton, a journalist, historian and lecturer at the U.C.L.A. Luskin School of Public Affairs. \u201cPeople talk about traffic; people talk about the price of homes.\u201dCurious as to how this might change Californians\u2019 outlook, Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, recently asked a sample of 900 homeowners if they would consider moving if they could no longer deduct state and local taxes. Some 37 percent of Californians said they would consider it. Californians looking elsewhere are already among the most popular searches on the Redfin website.\u201cWe have real estate agents all over the country who meet their customers in airports,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from California.\u201dMark Storer contributed reporting from Ventura, Calif., and Robert Gebeloff from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Tax Bill May Inspire Cuts Globally, While Fueling Trade Tensions", "Date": "2017-12-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe overhaul is already threatening economic relations, adding to concerns that Mr. Trump is advancing a nationalistic agenda at the expense of other countries.European leaders this week raised the prospect of a trade battle, implying that they may fight the new tax rules before the World Trade Organization. Chinese officials are readying defensive measures to protect the country\u2019s economy and its competitiveness.On Friday, Mr. Trump again emphasized his \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra, saying at a signing ceremony that the tax bill would mean more jobs and investment in the United States. \u201cA lot of things are going to be happening in the U.S.A.,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring back our companies. They\u2019ve already started coming back.\u201dIt all starts with the corporate tax rate.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge incentive to governments around the world who want to see more investment to be part of that,\u201d said Andrew Mackenzie, the chief executive of the mining giant BHP, which has its headquarters in Australia and major operations in North and South America. \u201cThey will have to follow suit.\u201dCorporate rates were already on a downward trajectory. Many countries have used low taxes as an advantage over the United States, which offers a huge domestic market, plentiful venture capital and relatively light workplace regulation.\u201cThere will be pressure for a new round of lowering corporate taxes,\u201d said Stefano Micossi, the director general of Assonime, an Italian association of publicly listed companies.China, a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s over its trade practices, may also be forced to play the tax game.For all of its appeal as a manufacturing hub thanks to its skilled work force, solid infrastructure and other benefits, China charges high taxes. On top of a standard corporate rate of 25 percent, companies are required to make social security contributions and other payments that push their tax burden higher there than it is in many other countries.Last week, China\u2019s vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, pledged to \u201ctake proactive measures\u201d in response to the tax overhaul, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency. \u201cThe external impact of tax policy change in the world\u2019s largest economy cannot be overlooked,\u201d Mr. Zhu said, according to Xinhua.Mr. Zhu did not offer details about the measures China might take, but they could include streamlining regulations that foreign businesses face, or deferring certain taxes if money is reinvested locally, according to Andrew Choy, a tax partner for Greater China at EY.Deep in the tax package\u2019s fine print were provisions that looked like protectionism to Asian and European companies.The European Commission, which manages the European Union, objected to a tax break that companies in the United States would get for so-called foreign-derived intangible income \u2014 money they make from selling property or services abroad.The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the changes affecting them would expire after 2025.The measure is supposed to encourage companies to produce goods in the United States and sell them overseas. But European officials said the provision appeared to violate agreements among countries against subsidizing their exports.\u201cThe commission will reflect on all possible measures that may need to be taken if the bill enters into force as agreed today,\u201d the commission said in a statement. \u201cAll options are on the table.\u201d\u201cAs the world\u2019s largest economy, we would expect the U.S. to ensure that tax reform will be nondiscriminatory and in line with its W.T.O. obligations,\u201d the commission said.The provision is meant to keep companies from shifting income to low-tax countries. But it adds a levy to some transactions between a bank or insurance company\u2019s American operations and its foreign affiliates, which would affect real deals, not just tax maneuvers. The Swiss bank Credit Suisse said on Friday that it would have to cut $2.3 billion from fourth-quarter profit because of the new tax regime.The tax \u201cmay harmfully distort international financial markets,\u201d a group of European finance ministers wrote to officials in the United States last week.In China, officials are preparing to deal with a wrinkle unique to their country: a challenge to tough Chinese laws that keep money from leaving its borders.\u201cCompanies know that when they send money to China, it\u2019s basically a one-way gate,\u201d said Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, China.Some Chinese officials worry that the tax measure will cause more American companies to try to take money out and are mulling new restrictions on capital flows. The newly approved tax incentives could appeal to companies that are frustrated by China\u2019s rising labor costs, ambitious local competitors and tangled legal systems, or that would rather spend their money at home or elsewhere.Companies with big investment plans in China would probably prefer to keep the money there than to bring it home; others may simply want to keep it there on a bet that China\u2019s currency will strengthen in value.Patrick Yip, a tax partner at Deloitte China, estimated that his clients \u2014 large companies with many years of experience in China \u2014 could move $20 million to $30 million on average from the country over the next year. Some clients who have accumulated as much as $80 million or $90 million in recent years could look to bring that money back, he said.\u201cWe have clients who are in the process of thinking about where to deploy their investments,\u201d he said.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.

Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution facilitates digital transformation of government sectors, helping government IT develop with smart societies, today and in the future.Following its debut in 2013 in China's government cloud market, Huawei transformed itself by building up a solid customer base with more than 230 government sectors, including 16 national ministries covering such departments as national information centers, finance departments, customs offices and tax bureaus. Other partners include multiple provincial governments such as Beijing, Jiangxi and Tianjin, as well as more than 200 local governments. Huawei has excelled in government cloud markets in China, enhancing its reputation as one of the industry\u2019s finest.Here are just some of the reasons customers choose Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution:Huawei believes that the government cloud construction cannot be completed overnight but should be planned and built in three steps: First build the government cloud platform, then deploy the government data support platform, and then construct the government application support and Big Data platforms. These three steps can effectively address challenges in government cloud construction and help achieve the goal of the government cloud. In terms of success cases, Huawei has cooperated with Wuhan University GeoStar, a well-known GIS software developer in China, to build a spatiotemporal information cloud platform. As an important part of the Smart Xuzhou e-Government cloud project, the platform brings together historical information, current status, real-time information and future planning information of Xuzhou City to improve essential government affairs, such as social governance, emergency command and major decision-making.In the \"central nervous system\" of the Smart Traffic project in Shenzhen, Huawei and Shenzhen Traffic Police set up a unified data collection, analysis and processing platform to share, integrate and leverage information resources in a Big Data resource pool. The platform is able to carry all data from the traffic grid with full interconnection and complete analysis capabilities. Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution helps deliver high-quality and efficient traffic services for the entire city.Another example is the Jiaxing e-Government cloud project jointly constructed by Huawei, Jiaxing Telecom and Jiaxing municipal government. Since its deployment, this project has had a major influence in daily activities of Jiaxing's citizens in terms of education, healthcare, and local business. In Huawei's opinion, the government cloud solution involves tens of thousands of fields in society, making it impossible for a single enterprise to monopolize the market. Instead, every partner and customer dedicated to a specific field is the expert most familiar with the requirements of the field. Only by leveraging the strength of the ecosystem can Huawei deliver the most practical and comprehensive solution that meets specific industry requirements. Such careful consideration and determination are why Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution has become the top choice for customers.As one of the world's leading data research companies, IDC has a strict set of standards for evaluating vendors in the government cloud market. After considering Huawei, Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, Inspur and other vendors and analyzing each of their current capabilities, future strategies and market performance, IDC rates Huawei top in the leaders quadrant in China's government cloud market.According to IDC, the advantages of Huawei FusionCloud e-Government Solution are as follows:The four aspects revealed by IDC are the distinguishing features of Huawei as an IT and cloud infrastructure supplier.

In the government cloud market, Huawei has good products and comprehensive product lines. Moreover, Huawei is empowered not only with customer recognition and partner support, but also with insights, strategies and implementation measures. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Huawei Cloud becomes a leader in China's e-Government cloud market.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
