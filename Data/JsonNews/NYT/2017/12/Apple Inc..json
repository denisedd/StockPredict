{"Headline": "Fox-Disney Deal Gives Rupert Murdoch His King Lear Moment", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a while, Rupert Murdoch seemed invincible.But even Mr. Murdoch, a self-made billionaire whose range of media assets wield enormous political influence on three continents, was no match for Silicon Valley.Like King Lear confronting his mortality, Mr. Murdoch, 86, is preparing to divide up a lifetime of spoils. And as he moves to sell off wide swaths of his media and entertainment business, he is also throwing into confusion the line of succession and testing the ties that bind the family-run fief.The $52.4 billion deal \u2014 which would not include Fox News, the Fox broadcast network or the FS1 sports cable channel, which will be spun off into a newly listed company \u2014 has come about as part of the consolidation sweeping over traditional media companies as they try to fight off threats from Amazon, Apple and Netflix. It also represents a remarkable shift for Mr. Murdoch, a visionary businessman who has long lived by a single credo: Buy, buy, buy.After all, Mr. Murdoch didn\u2019t grow a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, into a $100 billion media business by selling. \u201cRupert has always been a collector, a builder,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.In 2012, under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, Mr. Murdoch split his entertainment assets into a separate publicly traded company, 21st Century Fox, from News Corporation, the company that includes The Journal, the New York Post and other newspapers. For a time Mr. Murdoch\u2019s enterprise looked like an entertainment company with a newspaper problem, with glitzy Hollywood assets and lucrative Fox News keeping Mr. Murdoch\u2019s true love, printed papers, afloat.But 21st Century Fox soon faced the same economic headwinds affecting other traditional media companies that have been disrupted by the rise of digital: customers cut the cable cord and streamed TV shows and movies on multiple devices. At the same time, Fox News, the highly rated basic cable channel and a big moneymaker, has suffered setbacks after a series of sexual harassment allegations at the network led to high-level departures and costly legal settlements.Mr. Murdoch must have known he needed to get even bigger to survive. But lately his buying prowess has taken a hit. In 2014, investors rebuffed him when he tried to gain scale with an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc., the company that owns HBO and CNN \u2014 and which may end up the property of AT&T, if a deal long in the making survives the scrutiny of a skeptical Justice Department. Regulatory hassles have also thwarted Mr. Murdoch\u2019s efforts to pay $15 billion for the 61 percent stake in Sky not already owned by 21st Century Fox.\u201cHe tried to buy, and when that didn\u2019t work, he doesn\u2019t sulk \u2014 he sells,\u201d Ms. Martin said.Disney\u2019s planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox \u2014 Mr. Murdoch\u2019s confidants call it a merger \u2014 makes economic sense, analysts say, and may be the best way for Mr. Murdoch\u2019s broader empire to thrive. But it also makes the identity of his heir less apparent.Lachlan Murdoch, the elder brother at 46, has been caricatured as the prodigal son. He left the family business in 2005 and was happily living out of the fray in Australia, with a supermodel wife and a trust fund. But as part of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s succession plan, Lachlan returned to the United States in 2015 to serve with his younger brother \u2014 and alongside his father, as co-executive chairman \u2014 at 21st Century Fox. Seen by some insiders as a daddy\u2019s boy, he moved into his father\u2019s former office on the company\u2019s palm-tree-lined lot in Beverly Hills.Questions abound about which son would carry on the family legacy, should the Disney deal go through. (Mr. Murdoch\u2019s older daughters, Prudence and Elisabeth, have stayed mostly out of the business, and his younger daughters, Grace and Chloe, are teenagers.)\u201cYou have this issue with two sons who are seemingly capable of commercial success and, if you\u2019re Rupert, you want to leave them both in a good spot, for lack of a better spot,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.In one possible outcome, James Murdoch would take on an executive position at Disney, and Lachlan Murdoch, who shares his father\u2019s passion for news, would move to News Corporation or oversee the company that absorbs Fox News and the Fox broadcast channel.\u201cThe Disney deal gives Lachlan a clear run to manage the remnants,\u201d said Neil Chenoweth, an Australian financial journalist and author of \u201cRupert Murdoch: The Untold Story of the World\u2019s Greatest Media Wizard.\u201dA company insider who could only discuss ongoing deal negotiations anonymously said it was too early to know what roles the Murdoch sons would take on, and added that James Murdoch could decide to strike out on his own.The Disney deal would leave him without a seat at the Dolby Theater for the Academy Awards \u2014 a string of Fox Searchlight Pictures films including \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and \u201cBirdman\u201d have won best picture Oscars \u2014 but Mr. Murdoch would maintain his seat at the White House. In August, the family patriarch had a private dinner with President Trump; Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser; and the White House chief of staff John F. Kelly.Mr. Murdoch talks regularly with Mr. Kushner, who knows a thing or two about tiptoeing around powerful family business dynamics. People close to Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Kushner described them as friends, but others saw a transactional relationship.\u201cRupert is a guy who doesn\u2019t have friends,\u201d said Mr. Chenoweth, the Murdoch biographer.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s news properties will allow him to maintain the political influence that he has cultivated.\u201cI think he\u2019s keeping his passion projects,\u201d said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.As for his sons, people close to Mr. Murdoch do not envision a scenario in which either James or Lachlan thrives long-term at the top of a company that doesn\u2019t have their father\u2019s stamp on the door.In a joint memo to employees sent last week, James and Lachlan tried to quell concerns about the sale. \u201cUncertainty,\u201d they wrote, \u201calways breeds unease.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Here\u2019s what Disney\u2019s C.F.O., Christine McCarthy, told analysts this morning:We expect to fully realize roughly $2 billion of cost synergies by 2021.As Andrew reminded earlier this week, \u201csynergies\u201d is a code word for \u201clayoffs.\u201d And Disney executives said that the company expects to start realizing synergies within the first year after the deal closes.It isn\u2019t clear yet how many jobs would be cut if the transaction succeeds, but this would be a rare deal if it actually generated new positions on balance.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedFox has a bit of unfinished business before it can go forward with its deal with Disney.It\u2019s in the process of seeking regulatory approval in Britain to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky in a deal worth about $15 billion. The two companies said on Thursday that Fox plans to proceed with the acquisition and hopes to complete the acquisition of the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own by the end of June.Sky would then be wholly owned by Disney, following the closing of the Fox deal.Mr. Murdoch\u2019s company had previously said that its existing stake in Sky was \u201cnot a natural end position.\u201d\u2014 Chad BrayAs part of his company\u2019s $52.4 billion deal for Fox, Bob Iger of Disney agreed to renew his contract through 2021 to help complete the merger and integrate the new businesses.That would seem to mean a 2020 presidential run is off the table for Mr. Iger.The publication added:Iger told THR in June that \u201ca lot of people \u2014 a lot \u2014 have urged me to seek political office\u201d but denied he would consider a run for California governor or senator, positions that historically have served as stepping stones to the White House.

Or Verizon or Comcast?Or could some of them team up to buy the assets and split them among themselves? For example, Comcast has always wanted Fox\u2019s international assets, while any of the digital players would love to own Fox\u2019s content business.The Fox-Disney deal has about a $1.5 billion breakup fee if a higher bid were to emerge. If regulators block the deal, Disney would have to pay about $2.5 billion.The Murdochs\u2019 voting control is worth 39 percent of 21st Century Fox in most situations, except for this: If the company were up for sale, they can only vote their economic stake, which is about 17 percent. And of course, even if the deal is completed as presented today, the next chess piece that will become a point of focus is Hulu given its ownership: Disney would control 60 percent of the service, but Comcast would still own 30 percent and Time Warner owns another 10 percent.It gets complicated quickly.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinAnd, more important, how some of them will split an estimated fee bounty of up to $154 million.For Disney:\u2022 Guggenheim Partners\u2022 JPMorgan Chase\u2022 Cravath Swaine & MooreFor Fox:\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2022 Centerview Partners\u2022 Deutsche Bank\u2022 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom\u2022 Hogan Lovells\u2022 Simpson Thacher & BartlettHere\u2019s how much each set of advisers could collectAccording to estimates from Freeman & Company:\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedHere\u2019s Paul Pendergrass\u2019s take:One is a tech C.E.O. who has publicly espoused socially liberal initiatives.

The San Francisco-based bank also said it would target $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year.\u201dRepublicans are betting it will.\u2022 In being classified as a transport service instead of an online platform, Uber must comply with local rules that govern taxis.\u2022 It doesn\u2019t block Uber from operating in any countries where the company currently operates.\u2022 But it doesn\u2019t let Uber move forward with any so-called peer-to-peer services in which anyone with a driver\u2019s license and a car can use its app to pick up customers.The ruling is expected to set a precedent for how Uber will be allowed to operate across the E.U., including in a separate pending case at Europe\u2019s highest court involving a complaint by a French taxi association against Uber. A decision in that case is expected sometime next year, and it will likely cement demands that the ride-booking company comply with Europe\u2019s transport standards.A service that connects, by means of mobile telephone software, potential passengers with drivers offering individual urban transport on demand, where the provider of the service exerts control over the key conditions governing the supply of transport made within that context, in particular the price, does not constitute an information society service within the meaning of those provisions.Can Uber appeal?No. But here\u2019s what a representative for the company said:This ruling will not change things in most E.U. countries where we already operate under transportation law. However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours.

Uber required a CEO who was more a public face of the company. Khosrowshahi was meeting with regulators in London who had revoked Uber\u2019s license when he had to work with the board of directors over a deal for SoftBank Group Corp. to invest in the company. Later, he visited Brazil to win over lawmakers there.Mr. Harford is the second big hire of Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is putting his stamp on the company. In October, he appointed Tony West as chief legal officer. Mr. West had been general counsel at PepsiCo. Uber still needs to name a chief financial officer.Mr. Harford is someone that Mr. Khosrowshahi is familiar with, having worked and competed with him over the past decade-plus.\u2022 Mr. Harford was an executive at Expedia when Mr. Khosrowshahi became C.E.O. of the company in 2005.\u2022 The pair then competed when Mr. Harford was named C.E.O. at Orbitz, one of Expedia\u2019s main rivals, in 2009.\u2022 In 2015, Mr. Harford sold Orbitz to Expedia for $1.6 billion.\u2022 Mr. Harford has been an adviser at Uber since October.\u201cIf tax reform is enacted, we expect our uses of cash from tax savings would include, optimizing CapEx to capture the benefits of 100% expensing to further grow the business and create even more upward mobility for our team members.\u201cFunding our pension plans beyond our current forecast. Increasing the dividend as our board may approve. Continuing our stock repurchase program at our current modest levels, and investing in M&A where it makes sense.\u201cU.S. GDP could increase materially next year as a result of U.S. tax reform. If this occurs, we would likely increase capital expenditures and hiring to accommodate the additional volumes triggered from this incremental GDP growth.\u201dHis comments break somewhat from the narrative that has developed around the Republican tax overhaul. Proponents of the bill argue that cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent will lead corporate America to invest more in their businesses and hire more workers. Critics counter that companies will spend their cash windfall on share buybacks and dividends, not on growing their businesses.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the other hands up?\u201d Mr. Cohn asked.Shares of the online retailer are down 12 percent premarket after the company\u2019s first earnings as a public company fell short of Wall Street\u2019s hopes.While earnings and sales just slightly surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations, gross margins were hampered by investments into new categories, falling nearly 3 percentage points. In the near term, Stitch Fix said it continues to expect profit margins to decline as those investments ramp up and it invests in new categories.Stitch Fix\u2019s stock had gained 65 percent since its initial public offering last month. Stitch Fix priced its initial public offering at $15 a share, valuing the company at about $1.5 billion.\u2014 Stephen GrocerHere\u2019s what Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary, emailed us about the bill\u2019s passing:The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be a major breakthrough for America\u2019s long-term competitiveness and prosperity. For decades, American workers have been paying the price for our archaic corporate tax system. The reforms in this bill will enable America\u2019s companies, which are our job creators, to be better engines of growth and prosperity, and it will attract job-creating investment in the U.S. by foreign companies.The tax flyaroundWithin the past day alone, the digital currency has plummeted from $18,385 to $16,626. It\u2019s a timely reminder that when one chooses to jump in on an investing trend/fad, nerves of steel are required.\u201cA short-term correction was definitely on the cards,\u201d said Thomas Glucksmann, Hong Kong-based head of marketing at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin Ltd. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see some recovery by the end of the week.

Namely, that one of its portfolio companies now counts a major activist investor among its shareholders.Elliott was able to get hold of the stock because HNA recently took out a so-called \u201cequity collar\u201d facility, under which it lent a stake in the Swiss company to a bank in exchange for funding. This collar facility allows the Chinese company to remain a shareholder on paper even though it no longer directly holds the shares.

But not only did this study, run by Stanford University, use a smartphone to recruit consumers, it was financed by Apple. And it involved using an app on the Apple Watch to try to identify irregular heart rhythms.\u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable, by the time I graduate from medical school,\u201d Mr. Poston said, \u201cthat the entire practice of medicine can be revolutionized by technology.\u201dThe companies are accelerating their efforts to remake health care by developing or collaborating on new tools for consumers, patients, doctors, insurers and medical researchers. And they are increasingly investing in health start-ups.In the first 11 months of this year, 10 of the largest tech companies in the United States were involved in health care equity deals worth $2.7 billion, up from just $277 million for all of 2012, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups.Each tech company is taking its own approach, betting that its core business strengths could ultimately improve people\u2019s health \u2014 or at least make health care more efficient. Apple, for example, has focused on its consumer products, Microsoft on online storage and analytics services, and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, on data.Physicians and researchers caution that it is too soon to tell whether novel continuous-monitoring tools, like apps for watches and smartphones, will help reduce disease and prolong lives \u2014 or just send more people to doctors for unnecessary tests.But now they, and other companies, are more visibly focused on creating, or investing in, new kinds of technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cWe are creating devices that collect information, new molecular assays \u2014 and all of that is just to try to understand health at a deeper level,\u201d said Dr. Jessica L. Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer.Apple is taking a different approach \u2014 using its popular iPhone and Apple Watch to help consumers better track and manage their health.\u201cApple is trying to drag medicine from where it currently takes place \u2014 in hospitals and clinics \u2014 and move it to the consumer side, to your phone,\u201d said Malay Gandhi, an executive in residence at Greylock Partners, a venture capital firm.In 2015, Apple introduced new software, called Apple ResearchKit, for health researchers. Stanford used it to develop an app to enroll volunteers in a heart study and track their physical activities, sleeping hours and fitness.Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, said the app enabled researchers to smoothly enroll more than 54,000 patients \u2014 a large number for a study conducted by one medical center \u2014 and collect much more data than they could have otherwise.\u201cFor us, it was an eye-opener,\u201d he said.Stanford is also conducting the Apple Heart Study. It is intended to determine whether an app for the Apple Watch can accurately detect irregular heart rhythms \u2014 particularly those associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition that can lead to blood clots and strokes.If the app detects irregular heart rhythms, it will send participants a notification and offer them a free video consultation with a doctor. The study is not designed to assess whether people who used the watch app had a reduced incidence of stroke and cardiac death compared with people who did not use the app.Microsoft, already a major supplier of software and cloud services to medical centers, is also ramping up its health business.This year, the company announced an initiative, Healthcare NeXT, to create products for medical providers and patients using artificial intelligence and cloud services like speech recognition.\u201cWe\u2019re really focusing on what people in the health care world are doing today and how we can make it better,\u201d said Peter Lee, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president for artificial intelligence and research.Facebook, too, has been expanding its business and research efforts in the health sector.And this year, Oculus, the virtual reality gear maker owned by Facebook, teamed up with Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles to develop V.R. simulations for doctors and medical students to practice handling high-risk pediatric medical emergencies.Dr. Topol of Scripps said tech companies had an opportunity to remake longstanding, cumbersome systems \u2014 like hospital alarms at a patient\u2019s bedside that go off dozens of times every day \u2014 and re-envision how health care is delivered.\u201cThere\u2019s not one tech company that isn\u2019t involved one way or another,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cMany of the companies see this as somewhere between rescue and a great business opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Tax Bill Fails to Address: Technology\u2019s Tsunami", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLet\u2019s pretend you have just been picked to run a small island nation. Congratulations!But don\u2019t settle in to your throne quite yet. A potential catastrophe looms on the horizon. A huge tsunami is coming your way.Fortunately, there\u2019s hope. Yours is a wealthy island. You can\u2019t prevent the tsunami, but you can prepare your people for the onslaught, and perhaps even mitigate its worst effects. So you make an executive decision \u2014 the island will use a huge share of future income to equip each resident with the best-known defense against tsunamis: Every islander gets a parachute.Wait, how would that work?The above situation exactly describes the puzzlement among some people in Silicon Valley at the $1.5 trillion Republican tax bill that was approved by the House and Senate this week.To those who study how tech is altering society and the economy, the bill looks like the wrong fix for the wrong problem. The bill (the parachute) does little to address the tech-abetted wave of economic displacement (the tsunami) that may be looming just off the horizon. And it also seems to intensify some of the structural problems in the tech business, including its increasing domination by five giants \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 which own some of the world\u2019s most important economic platforms.But Gabriel Zucman, who studies taxes and inequality at the University of California, Berkeley, pointed out that the 10.5 percent rate would still be much lower than the rate paid by potential start-up rivals that mostly make their money in the United States (the corporate tax rate on domestic earnings in the new bill is 21 percent). This difference, Mr. Zucman said, \u201ccreates an uneven playing field, where big monopolies will pay lower taxes than new entrants, which could reduce innovation.\u201dApple, Google and Microsoft declined to discuss the effects of the bill.But some in Silicon Valley think the giants misplayed their hand in the legislation. In pursuing short-term tax advantages, they missed a chance to advocate policies that might have more broadly benefited many of their customers \u2014 and improved their images, too.\u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s failure to engage in the tax reform debate was a serious failing of long-term strategy,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a writer and researcher who studies economic and social issues related to the tech business. \u201cThey had a real opportunity to use tax reform as a way to address inequality \u2014 and as a result of this bill, inequality may increase, and public backlash against the tech industry may increase.\u201dThis gets back to that looming tsunami. Though many of the economy\u2019s structural problems predate the last decade\u2019s rise of the tech behemoths, the innovations that Silicon Valley has been working on \u2014 things like e-commerce, cloud storage, artificial intelligence and the general digitization of everything and everyone around you \u2014 are some of the central protagonists in the economic story of our age.Among other economic concerns, these innovations are implicated in the rise of inequality; the expanding premium on education and skills; the decimation and dislocation of retail jobs; the rising urban-rural divide, and spiking housing costs in cities; and the rise of the \u201cgig\u201d economy of contract workers who drive Ubers and rent out their spare bedrooms on Airbnb.In the long run, there\u2019s also the question of whether there will be enough work for everyone \u2014 or whether, as some have speculated, automation may replace large numbers of workers altogether.It\u2019s true that many of the policy ideas to address the economic effects brought about by tech would be expensive. Mr. Khanna\u2019s plan, for instance, is projected to cost $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion over a decade.In other words, it would cost as much as much as the Republican tax bill. But unlike that one, this plan might actually address the tsunami.An earlier version of this article misstated that Apple, Google and Microsoft had expanded their lobbying efforts to push for tax reform. The companies increased spending on their overall lobbying work, not only on tax issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Freed From the iPhone, the Apple Watch Finds a Medical Purpose", "Date": "2017-12-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the last months of Steve Jobs\u2019s life, the Apple co-founder fought cancer while managing diabetes.Because he hated pricking his finger to draw blood, Mr. Jobs authorized an Apple research team to develop a noninvasive glucose reader with technology that could potentially be incorporated into a wristwatch, according to people familiar with the events, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.Now, the Apple Watch is finding a medical purpose after all.What\u2019s happening with the Apple Watch is one of the first signs of a leap forward in the utility of wearable devices. Many people had wondered why they would need a smart watch at all when most already carried more powerful smartphones with them. But as the Apple Watch becomes capable of handling more medical tasks on its own, they may now have an answer.\u201cThis is an important step in the evolution of wearables,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, an advisory and research firm. \u201cThe Apple Watch can now be on you all the time doing this type of medical monitoring.\u201dThe Apple Watch has dominated competitors in the nascent smart watch market, but it has not taken a place alongside the iPod, iPhone and iPad as the next breakthrough Apple product. Apple does not disclose specific sales numbers for the watch, but the company has said its sales have risen 50 percent compared with a year earlier for three straight quarters. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment further.A digital health revolution has been predicted for years, of course, and so far has been more hype than progress. But the hope is that artificial intelligence systems will sift through the vast amounts of data that medical accessories will collect from the Apple Watch and find patterns that can lead to changes in treatment and detection, enabling people to take more control of how they manage their conditions instead of relying solely on doctors.Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, a start-up that makes portable electrocardiograms, said this would put patients on a more equal footing with doctors because they would have more information on their own conditions.\u201cIt\u2019s changing the nature of the relationship between patient and doctor,\u201d he said, adding that doctors will no longer be \u201chigh priests.\u201dThe band, known as the KardiaBand, was the first Apple Watch accessory approved by the Food and Drug Administration. When a thumb is placed on the band\u2019s sensor, EKG readings are taken in 30 seconds and sent wirelessly to the patient\u2019s cardiologist. That helps resolve one of the biggest headaches in detecting atrial fibrillation \u2014 catching it during an episode so a cardiologist can properly assess it.Elena Remus, 36, a digital marketing consultant from Alameda, Calif., has experienced what the KardiaBand can do. She had suffered heart palpitations on and off for the last five years, but there was little her doctors could do because they were never able to catch the incidents in real time.Shortly after buying a KardiaBand for her Apple Watch a few weeks ago, Ms. Remus felt the onset of palpitations as she was making morning coffee. She looked down at her watch and saw that her normal heart rate of around 75 beats a minute had surged to 205 beats a minute. She started taking an EKG reading on her wrist and was finally able to record the activity, allowing her doctor to diagnose her condition as atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia \u2014 or in nonmedical speak, an abnormally fast heart rhythm \u2014 and plan a course of treatment.\u201cNow, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to pass out at home alone,\u201d Ms. Remus said.Separately, Apple is continuing research on a noninvasive continuous glucose reader, according to two people with knowledge of the project. The technology is still considered to be years away, industry experts said.The current solution used by many diabetics is also coming to the Apple Watch. Dexcom, a maker of devices measuring blood sugar levels for diabetics, said it was awaiting F.D.A. approval for a continuous glucose monitor to work directly with the Apple Watch. Continuous glucose monitors use small sensors to pierce the skin to track blood sugar levels and relay those readings through a wireless transmitter.Kevin Sayer, Dexcom\u2019s chief executive, said that patients could opt for a monitor to communicate directly with the watch for convenience, but that the big payoff could come with combining sleep or activity data from the watch with glucose readings from its device to find correlations.\u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to unlock the potential of that data,\u201d Mr. Sayer said.Health care professionals said there was a risk of too much information. Dr. Khaldoun Tarakji, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Cleveland Clinic, said doctors needed to guide patients about who would benefit from more information and how much data was the right amount.\u201cWe need to think about when too much information becomes just noise,\u201d said Dr. Tarakji, who has worked with AliveCor to test KardiaMobile, a portable electrocardiogram that works with iPhones.A flood of information, albeit potentially useful, may overwhelm doctors instead of assisting them. Initially, KardiaMobile patients sent their doctors an email each time they took an EKG reading. The flood of emails became confusing and raised questions about where the doctor should store that information. In response, AliveCor introduced a software platform for doctors that could populate the readings from patients and help detect early signs of atrial fibrillation.\u201cA wearable device does not equal a wearable physician,\u201d Dr. Tarakji said. \u201cAs a medical community, we have to be intelligent about how to use these new technologies.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Protests Move Online, Yet Big Tech Is Quiet", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back so-called net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201dDuring the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201dAmazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.Advertisement"}

His decision to step down ended a standstill arrangement between the company and the Icahn Group.\u201cThe CEO is the most important person in the company. We believe Xerox still has potential, but it will go the way of Kodak if there aren\u2019t major changes. The times have changed but not the old guard that controls the board,\u201d Mr. Icahn said.\u201cCorporate actions taken by Xerox, though commendable, are no match for the ravages of the digital world. Selling the company may be the logical next move.\u201dIn 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content. Siri should be able to extract valuable information for the user from what it hears and what it sees. It could also then let you add that song to your Apple Music playlist, watch the trailer, or even buy the movie on iTunes, and so on. That\u2019s much easier to achieve once Siri has swallowed Shazam.In arguing that NXP Semiconductors is worth $135 per share \u2014 on an independent basis, and therefore leaving aside Qualcomm\u2019s takeover bid \u2014 the activist hedge fund is threatening to add more to Broadcom\u2019s hostile acquisition campaign for Qualcomm.\u201cWhile NXP\u2019s operating performance has fully bounced back over the past year, its stock price has not \u2013 again, likely due to, in our view, the ceiling created by Qualcomm\u2019s low priced offer.\u201dThe Qualcomm responseFor now, the chip maker said that it disagrees with Elliott\u2019s analysis. Its statement:\u201cElliott\u2019s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda.

Two officials \u2014 Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis \u2014 voted against Wednesday\u2019s rate hike. The reason? Concerns about inflation.Fed officials predicted that inflation would stay below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target next year, and then stay at 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Those were unchanged from September.Here\u2019s how Wall Street economists reacted:\u2022 Republicans will have a harder time passing legislation \u2014 from infrastructure spending to potential cuts to programs like Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 with a Senate majority of just one seat.\u2022 The Republican Party may split further between establishment figures like Mitch McConnell and dissidents in the vein of Mr. Moore whose allegiance aligns more closely alongside President Trump and shaking up the status quo.\u2022 Democrats now have a more plausible, though still difficult, path to regaining a majority in the Senate.The likely changes\u2022 A corporate tax rate of 21 percent, slightly higher than what lawmakers had originally proposed\u2022 A slight lowering of the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent\u2022 Limiting the mortgage deduction to loans of up to $750,000, a compromise on levels set in the House and in the Senate proposalsWhat still needs work\u2022 Whether to scrap the corporate alternative minimum tax\u2022 A resolution on the estate tax\u2022 How to treat state and local tax deductions.The tax flyaround\u201cThis is a massive, out-of-the-blue idea with enormous ramifications,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, a longtime media analyst. \u201cDirect-to-consumer services like Netflix will face more challenges for market share.

But Facebook, Google and their peers have been noticeably quiet. Why? They\u2019re already on the defensive on other issues.\u201cWith the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations.\u201dAndrew writes:If that\u2019s true, it means that employee cuts would be even more severe than I had anticipated. About 12,000 people would lose their jobs, more than the number of people Qualcomm employs at its headquarters.Why did the SEC call up Munchee and cause it to shut down? \u201cBecause Munchee was making reckless and unsupported claims about incredible returns that deceived investors and separated little old ladies from their hard-earned retirement ether,\u201d you might assume, but you\u2019d be wrong.Critics\u2019 corner Lumped together, the representation of African-Americans, Latinos, Asians and others in lower-, mid- and senior-level management positions in the financial sector increased from 17 percent to 21 percent in the period.Before diversity advocates cheer, they should read on.

Here are some resolutions for living a safer digital life this new year.If 2017 taught you anything about personal technology, it\u2019s that the onus is on you to protect your personal data and devices.Amid Uber\u2019s laundry list of scandals, which included sexual harassment accusations and an undisclosed security breach, there was an important revelation that everyone can learn from. It involved Unroll.me, a free service that unsubscribes you from junk mail.The Unroll.me episode also raised awareness of the sheer number of third-party apps that may be leeching off your personal information. There are probably apps and web services you don\u2019t remember downloading or subscribing to, and they could still have access to your data.At least once a year, it\u2019s worthwhile to do an audit on your third-party apps. On your smartphone, delete apps that you have not touched in several months. For a clean break, in some cases you will also have to visit the company\u2019s website and request that your account be deleted entirely.Also check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps.

Every device you use has an identifier consisting of a string of numbers, also known as an IP address. When you are on the internet, a service provider can see which devices you use and which sites you visit.VPNs help cloak your browsing information from your internet provider. When you use VPN software, your device connects to a VPN provider\u2019s servers. That way, all your web traffic passes through the VPN provider\u2019s internet connection. So if your internet provider was trying to listen in on your web traffic, all it would see is the VPN server\u2019s IP address connected to the VPN service.The trend with these fancy new smartphones is to make the display take up as much of the face as possible. That means that a larger part of the body is composed of glass, which is susceptible to shattering. (The iPhone X even has a glass back so it can be charged wirelessly.) This trend is likely to continue, because people love having more screen.Advertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000. Companies like Intel, Cisco and Oracle appear on the all-time list, too.When you adjust for inflation, the ranking changes.Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAK1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.AppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Highest market capitalization adjustedfor inflation, as of Nov. 30PEAKAppleMicrosoftG.E.Cisco SystemsIntelAlphabet (Google)Exxon MobilAmazonBerkshire HathawayWalmartPfizerFacebookCitigroupAT&T (old)Johnson & JohnsonLucent TechnologiesOracleIBMJPMorgan ChaseA.I.G.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.$903901848755716688623576478454440437402389385378371370365340billionNov. 2017Dec. 1999Aug. 2000March 2000Aug. 2000Nov. 2017July 2007Nov. 2017Nov. 2017Dec. 1999July 2000Nov. 2017Feb. 2001March 2000Oct. 2017Dec. 1999Sept. 2000July 1999Nov. 2017Dec. 2000Apple\u2019s margin in first place is dramatically reduced.In December 1999, Microsoft\u2019s market cap was $647 billion. That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.Notes: All data as of Nov. 30, 2017.

{"Headline": "When Picking Apples on a Farm With 5,000 Rules, Watch Out for the Ladders", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "Trump RulesProduce growers represent a textbook example of what businesses describe as regulatory fatigue. President Trump is tapping into the discontent.Supported byALTAMONT, N.Y. \u2014 For eight weeks every fall, Indian Ladder Farms, a fifth-generation family operation near Albany, kicks into peak season.The farm sells homemade apple pies, fresh cider and warm doughnuts. Schoolchildren arrive by the busload to learn about growing apples. And as customers pick fruit from trees, workers fill bins with apples, destined for the farm\u2019s shop and grocery stores.This fall, amid the rush of commerce \u2014 the apple harvest season accounts for about half of Indian Ladder\u2019s annual revenue \u2014 federal investigators showed up. They wanted to check the farm\u2019s compliance with migrant labor rules and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets pay and other requirements for workers.Suddenly, the small office staff turned its focus away from making money to placating a government regulator.The investigators arrived on a Friday in late September and interviewed the farm\u2019s management and a group of laborers from Jamaica, who have special work visas. The investigators hand delivered a notice and said they would be back the following week, when they asked to have 22 types of records available. The request included vehicle registrations, insurance documents and time sheets \u2014 reams of paper in all.Over the next several days, the Ten Eyck family, which owns the farm, along with the staff devoted about 40 hours to serving the investigators, who visited three times before closing the books.\u201cIt is terribly disruptive,\u201d said Peter G. Ten Eyck II, 79, who runs the farm along with a daughter and son. \u201cAnd the dimension that doesn\u2019t get mentioned is the psychological hit: They are there to find something wrong with you. And then they are going to fine you.\u201dThis is life on the farm \u2014 and at businesses of all sorts. With thick rule books laying out food safety procedures, compliance costs in the tens of thousands of dollars and ever-changing standards from the government and industry groups, local produce growers are a textbook example of what many business owners describe as regulatory fatigue.Over the past five decades, Mr. Ten Eyck said, there has been an unending layering of new rules and regulations on his farm of over 300 acres, as more government agencies have taken an interest in nearly every aspect of growing food, and those agencies already involved have become even more so.Now, a new rule is going into effect that will significantly expand the oversight of one regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, at the farm. And aside from the government, major retailers like Costco and Walmart mandate extensive food-safety planning and audits for their suppliers, all at a cost.\u201cIf it isn\u2019t pest poisons and pesticides, then it is food safety,\u201d said Mr. Ten Eyck, suggesting that one rule maker seemingly tries to outdo the last. \u201cAnd they come in waves.\u201dOn a back wall in the apple packinghouse, there are 13 clipboards with various logs \u2014 first-aid monitoring, pest control, visitor sign-in sheets and more \u2014 required for food safety audits. There are about another dozen thick binders and manuals in the farm office for navigating rules and regulations on such things as migrant and seasonal worker protections.Many of those rules apply to other businesses as well, and some restrict the actions of government regulators, not the orchard owners. Using the Mercatus Center data, and screening for such exceptions, The New York Times identified at least 17 federal regulations with about 5,000 restrictions and rules that were relevant to orchards.Industry by industry, small businesses have been lobbying governments \u2014 from town health departments to federal cabinet agencies \u2014 to simplify rules and eradicate redundancy.The grievances relate largely to the sheer amount of time and money that it takes to comply, and what farmers see as a disconnect between them \u2014 the rule followers \u2014 and the rule makers, who Mr. Ten Eyck describes as \u201cpeople looking at a computer screen dreaming up stuff.\u201d\u201cThe intentions are not bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just that one layer after another gets to be \u2014 trying to top the people before them.\u201dThe rollback has not been felt on farms like Indian Ladder, which lies at the foot of the Helderberg escarpment, between the Adirondacks and the Catskills. But there is a need, farmers say.\u201cSo many of the farmers I\u2019ve spoken with tell me that stricter and stricter regulations have put many of their neighbors and friends out of business, and in doing so cost them their homes, land and livelihoods,\u201d said Baylen Linnekin, a libertarian-leaning expert in food law and policy, in an email. \u201cFor many farmers, rolling back regulations is the only way they can survive.\u201dAfter a lifetime of navigating his family\u2019s agricultural business, Mr. Ten Eyck has a firm appreciation for the rules and regulations that are good and helpful, as well as those that are excessive and ill-advised.He fluently speaks the language of government compliance, rattling off acronyms that consume his time and resources, including E.P.A. (Environmental Protection Agency), OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), U.S.D.A. (United States Department of Agriculture) and state and local offices, too, like A.C.D.O.H. (Albany County Department of Health).During the Obama administration, food and worker safety were particular priorities among regulators, Mr. Ten Eyck said. OSHA, pairing with its New York State counterpart, took an interest in a range of workplace issues. Even apart from OSHA regulations, one persistent concern on the farm is the use of ladders. \u201cThe number of rules on ladders alone!\u201d said Mr. Ten Eyck, explaining there is an assortment of rules, guidances, standards and training requirements associated with ladders, including how to achieve proper angling and how to prevent falling when filling produce bags.Ladders fall toward the excessive end of Mr. Ten Eyck\u2019s sliding scale of regulatory cumbrance; on the more helpful end are procedures required to track produce when there is a disease or illness outbreak. Most rules fall somewhere in between.After finishing college (during which he traveled to Sweden aboard the Stockholm, which then struck and sank the Andrea Doria in 1956), Mr. Ten Eyck, who graduated from Cornell in 1960, helped transform Indian Ladder from its roots as a dairy farm 101 years ago to the direct-to-consumer apple-focused operation it is today. Through the years, he saw chemicals used in agriculture become \u201cgreener and greener\u201d and farming safety practices greatly improve. At the same time, he watched in bewilderment as consumers became ever more suspicious of food safety, an inspiration for the waves of new rules on growing produce.\u201cMy least favorite words? Laced or tainted,\u201d said Mr. Ten Eyck, referring to terms regulators use to identify food safety problems. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is grow so that my grandchild can pick an apple off a tree and take a bite out of it and be O.K. That\u2019s where I want to be.\u201dBeyond food quality concerns, there is considerable regulation around managing a work force on the farm. During peak season, Indian Ladder employs about 100, including pickers in the field, servers in the cafe and cider pressers.Inspections typically take place during harvest because, despite the inconvenience, the business is fully staffed. Inspectors say they are aware of the disruption, but they expect full and immediate cooperation.\u201cEvery effort will be made to conduct this investigation expeditiously and with a minimum of inconvenience to you and your employees,\u201d one of the investigators from the United States Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division wrote to Indian Ladder Farms in September. \u201cHowever, please note that the above is not intended to be an exhaustive or final list of records to be examined.\u201dOne of Mr. Ten Eyck\u2019s daughters, Laura Ten Eyck, said that there were good reasons for work force oversight and that the labor investigators were \u201cprofessional and fair\u201d \u2014 but their surprise visit amounted to \u201coverkill.\u201d Ultimately, she said, the investigators identified a couple of minor infractions, including a farmworker performing a task related more to retail than agriculture. They waived fines and required corrective steps. (As Mr. Ten Eyck transitions into retirement, two of his children, Ms. Ten Eyck and Peter G. Ten Eyck III, are assuming leadership of the farm. Ms. Ten Eyck, along with her husband, recently opened a brewery at the farm, which comes with its own set of rules.)One of the objectives of the investigator was to verify compliance with the H2A visa program, which farmers use to hire foreign workers. Farmers complain that compliance is onerous because the program is especially complicated to administer. Many farms have faced labor shortages and have resorted to hiring illegal workers to fill gaps, though Mr. Ten Eyck said Indian Ladder has not experienced those problems.To keep up with the panoply of changing rules, farmers are left with little choice but to seek schooling. \u201cYou can\u2019t just hunker down in the bushes and look out to see what\u2019s going,\u201d said Mr. Ten Eyck, who has served on many agricultural boards and commissions, including on the New York Farm Bureau Foundation. \u201cYou have to go to meetings and attend workshops. You are responsible to know what the hell is going on. It\u2019s a business.\u201dBill Hlubik, the director of the Rutgers Cooperative Extension office in Middlesex County New Jersey, puts on programs for farmers and meets with them to talk over challenges. \u201cRegulatory issues seem to get more complex as time goes on,\u201d he said.A photo of Mr. Ten Eyck, smiling and wearing a cap on his farm, until recently was on display in the produce section at the Whole Foods market in Columbus Circle in Manhattan.A placard proclaims, \u201cEAT REAL FOOD,\u201d and promotes Indian Ladder Farms as a participant in a certification program that is good for the environment \u201cwhile producing absolutely delicious apples.\u201dJust don\u2019t expect to find apples from Indian Ladder for sale.Since 2014, Mr. Ten Eyck has \u201cjumped through all the hoops\u201d required by Whole Foods to bring his apples to market, he said, but only a small number ever made it to shelves. Those were delivered to an Albany store three years ago. He blamed Whole Foods\u2019 red tape \u2014 the private grocer\u2019s equivalent of regulatory excess.\u201cThey love us dearly,\u201d joked Mr. Ten Eyck, who recalled being photographed but did not know his picture was hanging in Manhattan. \u201cWe meet all of their standards and everything they want.\u201d But he added, \u201cThey can\u2019t get out of their own way.\u201dRetailers like Whole Foods, Walmart and Costco serve as some of the most demanding regulators of produce growers. The widest-reaching requirement is that their suppliers have detailed food safety and handling plans, which are customized by the farms, usually with the help of consultants. The plans are based on F.D.A. guidelines, but are entirely voluntary.A spokeswoman for Whole Foods said that the company worked closely with its suppliers and was proud of its high-quality standards. The retailer declined to comment on Indian Ladder Farms.Farmers to some extent have gotten used to the requirements and see the benefit for their businesses of creating a culture of food safety. But they complain that the rules are onerous, particularly the tediousness of documenting virtually anything that happens on the farm. Much of that documentation at Indian Ladder goes in the 13 logs kept in the packinghouse.If something is not logged, the saying on the farm goes, it did not happen.Mr. Ten Eyck says some of the requirements are impractical. The safety plan at Indian Ladder, for example, calls for someone to check the orchard each morning for mouse and deer droppings and address the problem before picking begins. The worry is that the droppings could get attached to a worker\u2019s shoe, get tracked onto a rung of a ladder, end up on a worker\u2019s hands and then on the apples.Mr. Ten Eyck says the requirement was \u201cridiculous\u201d in practice \u2014 the equivalent of finding an earring in the orchard \u2014 so Indian Farms came up with an alternative to scouring the orchard every morning. \u201cWe have trained the guys only to grab the rails of the ladder,\u201d he said.The safety planning comes with accountability: The farms are audited, usually twice a year \u2014 once planned and again as a surprise. The audits are in-depth, as the inspector examines the entire farm operation, including employee hygiene, labor laws and fertilizer application. The auditor also checks if everyone on the farm has received proper training. And they check the logs, too.The rules can be pretty specific, banning fake eyelashes (they can drop into food) and specifying certain types of wedding bands that can be worn (they can get caught in equipment). The distance between vehicles and crops is closely monitored (exhaust fumes are harmful). And chewing gum is prohibited because it could contaminate the produce.The food safety plans, and the audits, are costly and absorbed by the farm, though occasionally, a retailer will offer to chip in. The audits are usually conducted by private firms or through government programs.In the end, the Ten Eycks sell most of their apples directly to customers who come to pick them at the farm, sidestepping the hurdles imposed by Whole Foods. The rest are stored in a huge refrigerator and sold in the store or locally to retailers near Albany.\u201cI put apples on the shelf that aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d Mr. Ten Eyck said. \u201cDon\u2019t put me in the corner where I have to spray for cosmetic reasons. In a supermarket, everything has to be perfect.\u201dWhole Foods may not be selling apples from Indian Farms, but the grocery chain\u2019s rigorous oversight is acting as a dry run for the next big thing coming in government farm regulation: the produce safety rule.The F.D.A.\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Stephen Ostroff, said the agency gained extensive input from farmers and it planned to continue working with them. \u201cOur goal is not to add to their burden,\u201d Dr. Ostroff said. \u201cOur goal is to help them produce safe food.\u201dThe Trump administration has proposed to delay parts of the rule, but compliance is required for some small farms by early 2019. Compliance is expected to be monitored by the F.D.A., along with its state government partners.Farmers have been wary of the new rule because it takes many voluntary elements of food safety planning and codifies them. Under the voluntary programs, farmers have been able to lose points in safety audits, but still pass. An F.D.A. inspector, under the new rule, could levy fines or impose other penalties when a farm comes up short.Dr. Ostroff said the agency\u2019s approach was likely to be corrective and nurturing, rather than punitive. \u201cWe are not going to reap the public health benefits of these regulations unless we achieve a high rate of compliance,\u201d he said.For many farmers who are familiar with food safety and have plans in place, the new rule is unlikely to bring surprises, though it will likely lead to additional requirements and costs, especially for things like extra water testing, said Chris Gunter, an associate professor of horticultural science who works with farmers at North Carolina State University\u2019s agricultural extension.\u201cFarmers do not like regulation any more than anyone else, but everyone\u2019s goal is to produce food in the safest possible way,\u201d Mr. Gunter said.Mr. Linnekin, the food lawyer and author of \u201cBiting the Hands That Feed Us: How Fewer, Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable,\u201d predicted the new requirements would not lead to significant improvements in food safety.\u201cInstead, the result will likely be more of what we\u2019ve experienced over the past few decades as regulations have ratcheted up,\u201d he said. \u201cMore of our fruits and vegetables will be grown by large domestic producers who can afford to comply with the regulations \u2014 at the expense of smaller competitors \u2014 and by produce farmers abroad.\u201dDr. Ostroff disputed that assessment. \u201cWe really want to work with farmers and point out areas they could improve,\u201d he said.Sitting behind her desk in the office in the attic above the Indian Ladder Farms\u2019 cafe and store, Laura Ten Eyck said she longed for a clearinghouse that would simplify the regulatory labyrinth for farmers. She said a farming representative working with government officials could sort through the various regulations at all levels of government and eliminate the overlap and conflicts.\u201cI\u2019m not necessarily in favor of rolling back a lot of federal regulations,\u201d said Ms. Ten Eyck, a Democrat who serves on her local town board. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of applying them intelligently.\u201dRobert Gebeloff contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Says It\u2019s Open for Business. Foreign Firms Find It\u2019s Not That Simple.", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUANGZHOU, China \u2014 The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on Wednesday welcomed dozens of corporate leaders and foreign dignitaries with one overriding message: China is open for business.The reality on the ground was more complex.That message was echoed at the Guangzhou conference, which was attended by the leaders of companies like Apple, Ford Motor, Philips and Walmart and foreign leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.\u201cChina\u2019s door will not close to the world but open wider,\u201d Mr. Xi said in a letter addressed to the gathering, which was organized by Fortune magazine. China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.But the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.Others were more blunt in their assessments.\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201dNot everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "That Game on Your Phone May Be Tracking What You\u2019re Watching on TV", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first glance, the gaming apps \u2014 with names like \u201cPool 3D,\u201d \u201cBeer Pong: Trickshot\u201d and \u201cReal Bowling Strike 10 Pin\u201d \u2014 seem innocuous. One called \u201cHoney Quest\u201d features Jumbo, an animated bear.Yet these apps, once downloaded onto a smartphone, have the ability to keep tabs on the viewing habits of their users \u2014 some of whom may be children \u2014 even when the games aren\u2019t being played.It is yet another example of how companies, using devices that many people feel they can\u2019t do without, are documenting how audiences in a rapidly changing entertainment landscape are viewing television and commercials.The apps use software from Alphonso, a start-up that collects TV-viewing data for advertisers. Using a smartphone\u2019s microphone, Alphonso\u2019s software can detail what people watch by identifying audio signals in TV ads and shows, sometimes even matching that information with the places people visit and the movies they see. The information can then be used to target ads more precisely and to try to analyze things like which ads prompted a person to go to a car dealership.Some of the tracking is taking place through gaming apps that do not otherwise involve a smartphone\u2019s microphone, including some apps that are geared toward children. The software can also detect sounds even when a phone is in a pocket if the apps are running in the background.The spread of these technologies, combined with the proliferation of internet-connected TVs and tools that can identify video content through pixels and audio snippets, has resulted in some questionable practices.Companies gathering such data, especially through games, need to make their business practices clear to consumers \u201cbecause it\u2019s so inherently unexpected and surprising,\u201d said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union, and a former policy director at the trade commission who worked on the Silverpush case.\u201cWhen you see \u2018permission for microphone access for ads,\u2019 it may not be clear to a user that, Oh, this means it\u2019s going to be listening to what I do all the time to see if I\u2019m watching \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cThey need to go above and beyond and be careful to make sure consumers know what\u2019s going on.\u201dThrough its software, Alphonso can follow the ads that people see in friends\u2019 homes and elsewhere. The company has also worked with movie studios to figure out theater-viewing habits, Mr. Chordia, Alphonso\u2019s chief executive, said. Smartphone apps that are running Alphonso\u2019s software, even if they are not actively in use, can detect movies based on film snippets provided by the studios ahead of time.\u201cA lot of the folks will go and turn off their phone, but a small portion of people don\u2019t and put it in their pocket,\u201d Mr. Chordia said. \u201cIn those cases, we are able to pick up in a small sample who is watching the show or the movie.\u201d Mr. Chordia said that Alphonso has a deal with the music-listening app Shazam, which has microphone access on many phones. Alphonso is able to provide the snippets it picks up to Shazam, he said, which can use its own content-recognition technology to identify users and then sell that information to Alphonso.Founded in 2013, Alphonso initially focused on working with apps to capitalize on ads through so-called second-screen viewing, as people increasingly turned their attention to smartphones and tablets during TV breaks. Now, the company has broadened its focus to gathering troves of viewing data from companies like TiVo and directly from TVs and streaming devices through deals with manufacturers.The disparate viewing information is tied to IP addresses, which can be matched to characteristics like age, gender, income and more through big data brokers like Experian without using personally identifiable information like names and addresses.\u201cWe have to be really careful as we have more devices capturing more information in living rooms and bedrooms and on the street and in other people\u2019s homes that the public is not blindsided and surprised by things,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s legal. It is what\u2019s not creepy.\u201dOn the other hand, many people have had issues recognizing audio through apps like Shazam if there is too much background noise, so it\u2019s not clear how much information Alphonso\u2019s apps can pick up on a daily basis.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s not normally, I don\u2019t think, going to be expected that an application is going to be listening for what you\u2019re watching,\u201d Mr. Brookman said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not necessarily expecting your TV to be watching what you\u2019re doing either.\u201dNiraj Chokshi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Provides Hedge Against Tech Backlash", "Date": "2017-12-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAuthorities worldwide are growing worried that Facebook, Google and Amazon are eroding privacy, using data to push rivals out of business and even affecting elections. This is one tech battle Apple can sit out. As a security-minded purveyor of hardware, it\u2019s likely to avoid the worst of the blowback.Europe will be the eye of the tech storm in 2018. The European Commission has already fined Google $2.8 billion for favoring its own services and burying rivals in search results. Regulators are deciding whether the Alphabet\u2019s Android mobile operating system gives it another means of unfairly promoting its businesses. A bigger fine and reduced mobile revenue from Google search could result.Fining Google for favoring its own products sets an unwelcome precedent for other tech firms. European Union authorities could forbid Amazon\u2019s listing of own-label products ahead of competitors\u2019 offerings.The biggest danger comes in May when companies must comply with Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. It requires that they seek explicit consent before using personal data. It\u2019s probable many customers will not agree, which means Google could find it harder to customize Gmail ads and Facebook might not be able to use WhatsApp information to sell ads on other sites and apps. Customers also have the right to delete their data or port it elsewhere \u2014 reducing the ability of Amazon and Google to lock in cloud customers.Parts of Europe\u2019s agenda may be adopted elsewhere. And lawmakers in the United States are mulling putting big internet firms under the oversight of the strict Federal Communications Commission, rather than the lax Federal Trade Commission.Apple is the biggest tech giant, worth nearly $900 billion, yet it stands curiously apart. The company sells lots of expensive phones, but it\u2019s no monopolist. The iPhone\u2019s combined share of the five biggest European markets is under 20 percent, says Kantar Worldpanel. The company also uses privacy as a selling point. It does not gather personal information to sell to advertisers, places similar restrictions on app developers and fights government attempts to unlock suspects\u2019 phones. Apple\u2019s inability to master social media means its business does not affect elections either.Apple is not carefree. The company\u2019s attempts to slither out of paying taxes make it a target in its own right. At worst, though, the result is probably a fine. Its rivals are looking at major, forced changes in their business models.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 2017 Became a Turning Point for Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThis was a terrible year for the tech industry.Yet underneath this apparent success was a momentous shift in how the tech business deals with the world. Five or 10 years from now, we will come to regard 2017 as a turning point.Why? Because this year, for the first time, tech giants began to grudgingly accept that they have some responsibility to the offline world. The scope of that responsibility, though, is another matter entirely.Let me explain how this is all playing out.Think of these platforms as the roads, railroads and waterways of the information economy \u2014 an essentially inescapable part of life for any business or regular person who doesn\u2019t live in a secluded cabin in the woods.For years, despite their growing power, tech platforms rarely garnered much scrutiny, and they were often loath to accept how much their systems affected the real world. Indeed, the online ethos has been that platforms aren\u2019t really responsible for how people use them. It might as well be the slogan of Silicon Valley: We just make the tech, how people use it is another story.In 2017, that changed. At first grudgingly and then with apparent enthusiasm, platform companies like Facebook began accepting some responsibility for how they are affecting the real world. They did not go as far as some critics would have liked \u2014 but in many significant ways they offered a shift in tone and tactics that suggested they were rethinking their positions.Many tech titans were obviously unprepared for the serious questions that began coming their way a year ago. When the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his site\u2019s role in the 2016 election just days after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, he responded with a line from tech\u2019s old playbook: It was a \u201cpretty crazy idea,\u201d he said, that misinformation on Facebook had \u201cinfluenced the election in any way.\u201dNow that tone is gone. Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized for his glibness. And during Facebook\u2019s last earnings report to investors, he put the company\u2019s social mission at the top of his agenda. \u201cProtecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\u201d he said.Sure, all this could just be marketing. But I\u2019m inclined to believe the shift represents a new way of navigating the world, for a few reasons.First, employees are demanding a new way. The highly paid workers of Silicon Valley were lured on the promise of changing the world, and in the past year many became demoralized about their companies\u2019 apparent impact. In some cases they\u2019re pushing their bosses to change.Not this time.If the big shift of 2017 is that tech companies now accept some responsibility for how their platforms impact the world, the big mystery of 2018 and beyond is what, exactly, that responsibility will look like.Mr. Zuckerberg said he was willing to risk the company\u2019s profitability to improve its community. Facebook has been testing new ideas for making its News Feed less divisive and less prone to misinformation, and for promoting what the company calls \u201cmeaningful\u201d social connections. Facebook is also testing systems that it said would more stringently police advertising, in the hope of preventing foreign actors from using its ad network to influence an election.But what if these early efforts don\u2019t mitigate the problems? What if Facebook finds that offering people a less polarized News Feed dramatically reduces engagement on its site, affecting its bottom line? Or what if the changes disproportionately affect one political ideology over another \u2014 would Facebook stick with a kind of responsibility that risks calling into question its impartiality?I don\u2019t mean to offer a barrage of hypotheticals just for the fun of it. My point is that these issues would probably be pretty hard to solve.\u201cJust as the packaged food industry did in the 1950s, Facebook and Google have lured users with convenience, while feeding them a diet certain to cause lasting harm,\u201d Roger McNamee, the musician and venture capitalist, told me. \u201cThe problem cannot be addressed by hiring; it can only be fixed by changing the algorithms in ways that will materially reduce profitability.\u201d\u201cI would give tech a C grade,\u201d Ms. Pao, who is now the chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact, wrote in an email. \u201cLeaders are doing the bare minimum to address problems and are far from doing all that is necessary to solve the problem.\u201dShe said she hoped for a far more vigorous effort that ushered in a complete overhaul of the culture of tech companies, and that held leaders accountable.\u201cIt means firing all the people involved in the failures, from the C.E.O. to the H.R. leaders to the board members in some cases,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Pao\u2019s and Mr. McNamee\u2019s comments underline the real problem for the industry. Once you accept that you\u2019re on the hook for fixing problems caused by the thing you built, people will start to expect that you really will fix them \u2014 even if the solutions are expensive or otherwise conflict with your business interests.So, yeah, 2017 was a terrible year for the tech industry. If the fixing does not actually happen, 2018 might well be worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Streaming Landscape After Disney\u2019s Deal", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming wars are about to get a lot more interesting.It has been roughly five years since services like Netflix and Hulu started making original programming. So far, Netflix has been the clear winner. It spends billions of dollars a year and has seen subscriptions soar, especially internationally, with the critical and popular success of shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201dHere\u2019s a look at some of the leading streaming services.And it still has the rights to old episodes of big TV shows, including some from 21st Century Fox. The first season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d about the O. J. Simpson murder trial that was a ratings smash for FX and a big award winner? Netflix will continue to hold onto that.On the other hand, Hulu remains a relatively small business that bleeds money. The last time it disclosed the number of people who subscribe to the service (a year and a half ago) it was a relatively teeny 12 million. As a comparison, Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. And there are plenty of indications that Hulu\u2019s growth has only inched a bit in the time since.Still, Disney will assume Fox\u2019s stake in Hulu, and will now own more than 50 percent of the streaming service. Whether that means Disney can simply merge Hulu\u2019s enormous array of content into its forthcoming service is unclear. Some analysts are skeptical that NBC Universal\u2019s parent company, Comcast, will allow Disney to simply buy it out.\u201cWe see no reason why Comcast would want to enable Disney to have a more successful streaming service that hampers the legacy bundle that is vital to Comcast,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, at analyst at BTIG.Plus, even with leadership changes, Amazon sits on a mountain of cash. That has many Hollywood executives convinced that Amazon could become a real rival to Netflix if it deploys its resources in the right way.Facebook and YouTube are still looking for a signature hit.Meanwhile, there are live TV services for people who are just looking to shed an expensive cable package. Hulu and YouTube have offerings with a suite of cable channels, and so do services like Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and DirecTV Now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadcom Puts Qualcomm on the Clock", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAs Qualcomm notes, the bid from Broadcom is nonbinding. Although banks have expressed confidence in raising the funds and private equity outfit Silver Lake is injecting $5 billion, lenders aren\u2019t yet actually on the hook. Even if they were, the deal would still leave Hock Tan, the acquisitive Broadcom chief executive, running a company saddled with huge debts. With $10 of the $70-a-share offer price coming in stock, that\u2019s relevant to Qualcomm\u2019s owners, too.Broadcom promotes the qualifications of its nominee slate, which includes an ex-Nokia executive and the former chairman of Dialog Semiconductor. For its part, Qualcomm defends its own directors, noting the independence of nine of them and the relatively recent arrival of four.Most independent directors would probably support holding discussions with a suitor when, as in this case, a roughly 28 percent premium is on the table. Qualcomm\u2019s refusal to engage \u2014 even with, according to Broadcom, \u201cmany\u201d shareholders wanting it do so \u2014 suggests its board thinks the timing is meaningfully disadvantageous.That\u2019s true. Qualcomm is still awaiting antitrust approvals for its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors more than a year after the $38 billion deal was struck. In addition, the company is waging a legal fight with Apple, among others, over royalty payments. Resolving either or both of these uncertainties should raise investor confidence in Qualcomm\u2019s stand-alone value, potentially forcing Broadcom to offer more \u2014 or abandon its pursuit.Be that as it may, Broadcom\u2019s move sets the clock ticking on solving Qualcomm\u2019s problems. This week is the deadline for board nominations for consideration at the company\u2019s annual meeting, set for March 6. If shareholders are impatient now, they\u2019ll be hopping by then.A lot can happen in three months, from approvals for the NXP deal or a settlement with Apple on the one hand, to an increased or full-on hostile offer from Broadcom on the other. Waiting for some of those would give Qualcomm boss Steven Mollenkopf a stronger negotiating position.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Apple Slowing Down Old iPhones? Questions and Answers", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, some consumers have suspected Apple of a nefarious plot: The company, they said, was slowing down their older iPhones to get them to buy new ones. Now, many of them feel vindicated.Some users saw the announcement as proof that the company had engaged in \u201cplanned obsolescence,\u201d a scheme to degrade the old devices to force users to upgrade. Others felt betrayed. And still others were simply confused.Here is a Q. and A. with Brian X. Chen, the lead consumer technology writer for The New York Times, about what the announcement really means.Can you translate? Is Apple saying that it intentionally slows down older iPhones as new ones are released?In other words, if your iPhone is beginning to run out of battery capacity, these slowdowns might kick in to keep it running for longer or prevent it from shutting down unexpectedly.Apple is not admitting to planned obsolescence. If Apple explicitly said that they injected code into older iPhones to slow them down because new ones came out, that would be admission. All it is admitting to now is trying to keep the old iPhones running for longer.How many users does this affect?Apple has said the power management technique works on iPhone 6, 6S, SE and 7.What else could be slowing the older phones down?Often, a buggy operating system upgrade can cause glitches when running apps. Another common cause is having little available device storage. Smartphones rely on flash storage, which keeps data in the cells of semiconductor chips. When stored, that data is scattered across the drive. So when you call it up by opening an app or a document, you are retrieving it from multiple parts of the drive. If lots of space is occupied, the data gets crowded and the device may feel sluggish.Some users say that installing bigger batteries seems to fix the problem. Does that make sense? What else can users do to, short of buying new phones?I would recommend paying a third-party repair shop to replace the aged battery with a fresh one. This will cost between $20 and $70, depending on where you live and which iPhone you own. Repair shops will probably recommend against installing a battery that has a larger capacity than the original, as there can be risks of damage.The other solutions I wrote about in my last column included doing a clean install of the operating system and freeing up storage on the device. There is a scenario where you absolutely can\u2019t get around buying a new phone: App and game makers design their software to work better on newer, faster devices. So if you have an older smartphone and you want a brand-new game with heavy graphics to work as well as it possibly could, you\u2019ll want a new phone.Is this unusual? Do other smartphone makers \u2014 or, more broadly, electronics companies \u2014 do this, too?I don\u2019t find the power management technique that surprising or unusual. You have probably noticed that when your smartphone (iPhone or Android) is running out of battery, like when there is less than 10 percent, the device begins to run more slowly. That is partly to keep it running for longer.Could Apple have avoided this by, say, using a different type of battery?Apple is known for its masterful marketing. Do you think it has handled this controversy well?No, it could have avoided controversy by being more transparent to begin with. It could have notified people that a power management mode was kicking in to keep their iPhones running for longer because their batteries are running out of juice. That would also inform people that they should be getting their batteries replaced. Because Apple was not transparent, it\u2019s natural for people to suspect it of deliberately crippling their devices to get them to buy new ones.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re following today:\u2022 What\u2019s at stake in Alabama\u2022 Will Republicans enact their tax plan by year\u2019s end?\u2022 What does Apple spend its cash on? Not acquisitions.\u2022 Is Broadcom making a jobs promise it can\u2019t fulfill?\u2022 Republicans have a two-seat majority in the Senate. Alabama hasn\u2019t had a Democratic senator in 25 years, but the controversy around Roy Moore has made a once-safe seat potentially up for grabs.\u2022 Even if the tax legislation is signed into law this year \u2014 we\u2019ll get to the state of play in a moment, though there\u2019s a chance things don\u2019t get wrapped up before the holidays \u2014 Republicans still have plenty of other issues, from health care to infrastructure spending, that will have to get through the Senate.Having Doug Jones, Mr. Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, in the Senate would make that effort more difficult. (So could having a Republican senator who feuds with Mitch McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders.)That point was one of six observations that Goldman\u2019s economic team put out Tuesday. Here are a few others:The answer? Not very, especially for a company with more than $250 billion in cash on its balance sheet and a market value within spitting distance of $1 trillion.Apple has disclosed only 11 acquisitions valued at $4.5 billion in its history, according to Thomson Reuters.To put that into perspective, we asked Thomson Reuters to pull some numbers. (One note on the data below, deal values include completed acquisitions and ones that are currently pending.)\u2022 The most acquisitive company? General Electric, which has made 1,206 acquisitions valued at $311 billion. Of course, G.E. has been around for more than a century, while Apple went public in 1980. So how does Apple compare with other tech companies?\u2022 Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, HP and Intel each have made acquisitions valued at more than $50 billion.\u2022 Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, which was founded in 1998, has done 223 deals valued at $29 billion. Facebook? The social media giant, which has been around since 2004, has pulled the trigger on 65 deals with a value of $23 billion.\u2022 Apple, in fact, doesn\u2019t even rank in the top 100 most acquisitive tech companies.More from Andrew\u2019s column:Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.Qualcomm has its own headacheWhile some analysts and investors think Qualcomm might raise its bid for NXP as a way to deter Broadcom \u2014 which doesn\u2019t want the NXP deal to become any more expensive \u2014 Qualcomm says that for now it\u2019s sticking by its $110-a-share offer.Under the terms, Interstate will become the exclusive supplier of car batteries to Advance, one of the biggest auto parts sellers in the United States starting this spring.Interstate believes that the partnership could bolster its sales significantly, while Advance is hoping that a product alliance with a well-regarded parts maker would help stanch a 43 percent drop in its stock price over the past year.From a statement by Scott Miller, Interstate\u2019s C.E.O.:This alliance places us where our professional and retail customers are making purchasing decisions, allowing Advance Auto Parts and independent Carquest stores to serve as convenient, one-stop shops to meet our customers\u2019 needs.The department\u2019s long-awaited study of the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposed overhaul runs to about 489 words in length (including the title and footnotes) and, in the reckoning of even conservative commentators, does not actually detail the legislation\u2019s economic effects.The reaction from analysts\u2022 It\u2019s \u201can odd way to analyze a tax bill,\u201d said Scott Greenberg at the Tax Foundation.\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in magic,\u201d said David Brockway, a staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation during the Reagan administration.The tax flyaroundThat clears the path for Disney to buy the Fox television and movie studios, stakes in the international broadcasters Sky and Star and other significant divisions. As we said yesterday, a deal could be struck this week, though it\u2019s unclear whether an announcement would specify a role at Disney for James Murdoch. (If he does get one, it probably would involve overseeing the international broadcast businesses.)A lighter takeThe short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse. No cooperation. Misinformation. Mistruth. And it\u2019s not an American problem. This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. So we are in a really bad state of affairs right now, in my opinion.Regulators have already tightened the reins on at least one digital currency matter: The food review app Munchee canceled its initial coin offering yesterday after the S.E.C. issued a warning about the forthcoming deal.The Bitcoin flyaround\u201cThose who bought bonds in the hopes of windfall profits should not be protected at the expense of the island, its economy and its future.

And the biggest loser from all of this was you.It\u2019s easy to count the ways that tech did you wrong, especially when it came to information security. On the other hand, there was also plenty of good technology this year that worked well and offered benefits for your money. So here\u2019s a review of the tech in 2017 that needed the most fixing, and the tech that was actually fixed.Epic failures this year exposed your personal data to hackers, wasted your money on unnecessary or ethically dubious products and fed you misinformation.Hackers exploited a weak point in website software to gain access to sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers for as many as 145 million Americans. What\u2019s worse is that nobody opted in to Equifax \u2014 if you have any credit, you are probably part of the breach and vulnerable to identity theft.Equifax\u2019s top executives resigned after the scandal, but the company has yet to disclose what it will do to prevent another breach.Juicero, a Silicon Valley start-up that raised about $120 million from investors, went belly up this year. It makes the list of this year\u2019s tech failures because it created a kind of product that most of us never needed in the first place.Juicero\u2019s product? It sold a $700 juicer with a twist: The fresh produce came packaged in proprietary bags, which the juicer could press with four tons of pressure to create the juice. Because the produce came in neat packages, it could be easily discarded, sparing enthusiasts the cleanup of a typical juicer (a chore that you can easily handle with a dishwashing machine).Remember all those hate tweets that you saw about Hillary Clinton? Many of them may have been fake. Facebook and Twitter have said they are stepping up efforts to disable fake accounts. But the damage has been done. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and the social media sites did very little to prevent fake accounts from being created in the first place.On the bright side, there were high-quality products that improved your mobile life and mobile security, your gaming experiences, and your home automation.When Apple Watch debuted in 2015, it wasn\u2019t a practical product for you to buy. The smart watch was sluggish, it required an iPhone to operate, battery life was dismal and the $10,000 price tag of the 18-karat gold model was outrageous. An initial glitch caused the watch to occasionally lose cellular connection, but Apple quickly fixed the problem with a software update. More important, the new smart watch has exceptional battery life; in my tests, I had about 40 percent of battery life left, on average, after a full day of use. In addition, apps and features like the stopwatch and Siri work quickly. This is the first smart watch that feels like a mature, well-executed product that you can buy with confidence.For the last few years, your living room game console probably wasn\u2019t a Nintendo. The Japanese game company\u2019s previous console, the Wii U, was a flop. People are loving it. Nintendo has sold 10 million Switch consoles since March. In comparison, the company sold 3.9 million Wii U systems in that console\u2019s first 10 months.Year after year at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, start-ups have prophesied that everything in your home will be connected to the internet and automated with magical algorithms.

Real estate developers and technology companies could see big tax cuts, while low-income households and people buying health insurance could lose out.With the bill finally headed to a vote this coming week, taxpayers are scrambling to determine whether the legislation renders them winners or losers.Under current law, that income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Under the bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent, subject to some limitations. Real estate also avoided new limits on interest deductions and retained its ability to defer taxes on the exchange of similar kinds of properties. The benefits of lower rates on pass-through income will extend to Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner\u2019s partners at real estate investment trusts as well. At the last minute, lawmakers added language to make it easier for real estate owners to avoid some of the pass-through provision\u2019s restrictions and maximize the tax benefits even more.Want to know how the tax bill will affect you? Answer these questions to find out.Plus, American companies will no longer owe full corporate taxes on future profits they say they earn abroad, providing more incentive to push income into tax haven subsidiaries.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention.

Here are some of the firms:Joele FrankBrunswick GroupAbernathy MacGregorSard VerbinnenGladstone Place PartnersRubensteinAnd it seems they got it.Mr. Rubio, in a tweet on Friday, called it \u201ca solid step\u201d and suggested he would now vote for the bill.Here are the details from The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.The change intended to shore up Mr. Rubio\u2019s support would allow 70 percent of the $2,000 per-child tax credit to be refundable, up from 55 percent in the original draft of the bill, according to lawmakers and those briefed on the change. The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren. For that reason, the index has been particularly sensitive to the likelihood the tax bill will pass.With Disney\u2019s bid for a large portion of 21st Century Fox, four of the five biggest deals have been announced in the past three years. The pursuit of scale has driven the deal making. Telecom, cable and media companies all want to get bigger to better compete with the likes of Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix.That dynamic got us to wondering: How has the competitive landscape of media change during the past decade? To help answer that question, at least partially, we asked Thomson Reuters for the 100 biggest companies by market value at the start of 2007 and today.

{"Headline": "New Facebook App for Children Ignites Debate Among Families", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Few big technology companies have dared to create online products for boys and girls ages 13 and under.In doing so, Facebook immediately reignited a furious debate about how young is too young for children to use mobile apps and how parents should deal with the steady creep of technology into family life, especially as some fight to reduce the amount of time their sons and daughters spend in front of screens. On one side are parents like Matt Quirion of Washington, who said Facebook\u2019s snaking its way into his children\u2019s lives at an early age would most likely do more harm than good.\u201cI\u2019m an avid social media user, but I don\u2019t feel my kids need more social interaction,\u201d said Mr. Quirion, 39, whose three children are between ages 3 and 9. \u201cThey need their personal time to process all the social interaction and learn to grow into mature people.\u201dJust as vocal are parents like Parker Thompson of Alameda, Calif., who said children\u2019s adoption of technology is an inevitability and who appreciated Facebook\u2019s approach with the new app.\u201cToday, much of the time our options come down to giving kids devices and trusting things will work out, watching them closely at all times, or banning technology,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, 38, a father of three children between 6 months to 8 years old. \u201cTech is going to be something kids adopt. The question is how this will happen.\u201d\u201cRight now for kids, the time they spend on devices is very passive,\u201d said David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a device that helps you connect with others close to them.\u201dMessenger Kids is built so that children do not sign up for new Facebook accounts themselves; Facebook\u2019s terms of service require that users be 13 or older. The app requires an adult with a Facebook account to set up the app for his or her child. After adults enter their Facebook account information into the app, they are asked to create the child\u2019s profile and which friends or relatives he or she will be allowed to connect with on Messenger. Every additional friend request requires approval by the parent.The app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos. As with Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, children can add filters or playful drawings to the photos they send.Loren Cheng, product director for Messenger Kids, said Facebook would not use for marketing purposes the details it collected from children. He also said the company would not automatically convert children\u2019s accounts to adult accounts when they turned 13.The app, which will be in a preview release on Apple\u2019s iOS devices before rolling out to a wider audience in the coming months, is Facebook\u2019s latest effort to increase the number of people who rely on its service to connect with one another regularly. More than two billion people use Facebook every month, while its other apps, like Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, also have billions of users.If Messenger Kids proves popular, Facebook may reap many benefits. The company could see increased messaging activity and more engaged, regularly returning users, not to mention insights and data on how families interact on Messenger.Some children\u2019s and privacy groups commended Facebook for saying that Messenger Kids would give parents control over children\u2019s messaging and not show ads to children. But they also described Messenger Kids as a marketing effort to increase consumer loyalty.Others cautioned that the app raised concerns about children\u2019s privacy.The privacy policy also says that \u201cMessenger Kids is part of Facebook\u201d and that the company may share information collected in the app with other Facebook services. While parents can delete their children\u2019s Messenger Kids accounts, the policy says, the messages and content that a child sent to and received from others \u201cmay remain visible to those users.\u201d\u201cWhy should parents simply trust that Facebook is acting in the best interest of children?\u201d Mr. Steyer asked.Still, the company said that issue was largely separate from Messenger. Facebook said its overall mission remained centered on bringing the world closer together.\u201cWe can\u2019t let the current state of things prevent us from doing our jobs, which is to solve real problems in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Marcus, the head of Messenger at Facebook, said.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More American Jobs? Broadcom Deal Might Mean the Opposite", "Date": "2017-12-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookLast month, President Trump stood in the Oval Office under a portrait of Andrew Jackson and announced that Broadcom, a semiconductor company based in Singapore, would be moving its headquarters back to the United States.\u201cI want to thank you very much for choosing us,\u201d Mr. Trump said, boasting that Broadcom already had 7,500 workers in the United States and noting that some of those workers, from a plant in Pennsylvania, were standing behind him. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing that number grow very substantially, which it is now anticipated to do.\u201dHe added that he was thrilled to see Broadcom\u2019s $20 billion in revenues \u201ccome back to our cities, towns and American workers.\u201dBroadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, then took the podium and declared: \u201cThanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved.\u201d He praised the president\u2019s proposed tax overhaul as a policy that would \u201clevel the global playing field\u2019\u2019 and make a move to the United States more advantageous.It was an impressive story line. The president was able to get a big headline for bringing a foreign company back to the United States and Broadcom was able to capture the loyalty of an important ally, all with the Oval Office as a backdrop.Yet it was only theater.The reason for Broadcom\u2019s sudden move back to the United States was clear: Given President Trump\u2019s aversion to foreign companies, there was no way that Broadcom would ever receive regulatory approval for a takeover of one of the crown jewels of Silicon Valley if it were based anywhere but here. After all, Qualcomm\u2019s chips are inside virtually every major American device, starting with Apple\u2019s iPhone.So Broadcom played to Mr. Trump\u2019s soft spot \u2014 bringing companies back home. But the result may not be what Mr. Trump is envisioning \u2014 a Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm would most likely cost thousands of jobs, doing the very opposite of what the president said would happen.Some of those workers who stood behind Mr. Trump in the Oval Office could very well end up on the chopping block.If there is any question about Broadcom\u2019s job killing ambitions, look no further than its own news release, which said \u201cthe combination of our two companies and associated synergies will be accretive to Broadcom\u2019s earnings.\u201dNotice the word \u201csynergies\u201d? That word, a throwback to the 1990s merger days, has returned, but no one has forgotten what it is a euphemism for: cost-saving layoffs. Analysts have estimated that the savings from such synergy in Broadcom\u2019s case would most likely be about $1.5 billion.Qualcomm has about 33,000 employees worldwide; about 10,000 of which are based in San Diego. Broadcom has nearly 16,000 employees worldwide, nearly half of them in the United States.By that math, considering Broadcom said it could achieve twice those savings in a deal with Qualcomm, some 5,400 people could lose their jobs \u2014 a good portion of the entire domestic head count at Broadcom.Broadcom has made a business model of acquiring other companies, and their technology, and laying off employees. Some analysts describe the company as a \u201croll-up\u201d \u2014 a company that keeps rolling-up more companies.Qualcomm has been one of technology\u2019s great innovators, helping to establish many of the mobile telephone standards like LTE and the coming 5G. It has one of the largest research and development budgets in the world, spending $5 billion last year alone. Over the past decade, it has spent nearly $40 billion.Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion \u201cin research and engineering.\u201d Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.And while the sound bite about Broadcom\u2019s bringing its $20 billion in revenues back to the United States sounds great, it isn\u2019t so clear it will happen immediately \u2014 or ever. About half of the company\u2019s revenues come from its Chinese partners. It is impossible to think the company won\u2019t have to continue to invest there given that\u2019s where much of the growth in the world is taking place.So far, Qualcomm has rejected Broadcom\u2019s overtures, calling the bid an opportunistic effort to buy the company on the cheap. Qualcomm\u2019s stock has been under pressure because it has been engaged in a patent lawsuit with Apple, which has argued that Qualcomm is trying to gouge it for using its chips in its phones and has threatened to use Intel chips instead. Broadcom, in turn, has hinted that if it were to succeed in its bid for Qualcomm, it would reach a settlement with Apple.Even if Broadcom doesn\u2019t end up merging with Qualcomm, it is unimaginable that it won\u2019t try to acquire other American companies, which may make its decision to redomicile ultimately make more sense.If Broadcom was not intending to repatriate to the United States, you can only imagine the early morning tweetstorms we would have read from Mr. Trump denouncing the hostile bid.But at least for now, he hasn\u2019t said a word.An earlier version of this article misstated where Broadcom was based at the time of its bid to acquire Qualcomm. Although the company had announced its intention to move to the United States, it was still based in Singapore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Broadcom Proposes Unseating Qualcomm Board as Takeover Fight Escalates", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQualcomm on Monday criticized Broadcom\u2019s latest move, calling it a \u201cblatant attempt\u201d to seize control of the board to advance an acquisition offer Qualcomm said drastically undervalued the company.Besides the huge potential price tag of a transaction, the contest has implications for a business model in the chip industry that has been both lucrative and controversial. Qualcomm had built itself into a mobile-chip giant by charging patent royalties to smartphone makers, in addition to selling them chips, under terms that have prompted opposition from customers like Apple and some regulators.Hock E. Tan, Broadcom\u2019s chief executive, is likely to argue that it is time to change Qualcomm\u2019s patent-licensing practices. He has won many fans on Wall Street already by wringing profits from a series of companies he has acquired, a strategy that has strengthened Broadcom\u2019s market value.\u201cWhat Broadcom is saying to Qualcomm is, \u2018Your old way of doing business is done,\u2019\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.Qualcomm has set March 6 as the date for an annual shareholders meeting, which will include the election of directors. Proxy materials associated with the slates of candidates from Qualcomm and Broadcom are likely to be distributed in January.In seeking to oust Qualcomm\u2019s entire board, Broadcom is using one of the few means at its disposal to force a start to negotiations. Broadcom had hoped to strike friendly negotiations, but the company said Qualcomm\u2019s management and board had shown little interest in deal talks.\u201cWe have repeatedly attempted to engage with Qualcomm, and despite stockholder and customer support for the transaction, Qualcomm has ignored those opportunities,\u201d Mr. Tan said in a statement.The 11 nominees include executives with either operating or board experience with companies that sell semiconductors or other high-tech products. They include John Kispert, former chief executive of Spansion; Gregorio Reyes, a former chairman at LSI and Dialog Semiconductor; Samih Elhage, who held several senior positions at Nokia; Thomas Volpe, a former director at Linear Technology who is managing member of Volpe Investments; and Harry L. You, a former executive at EMC and Oracle.Broadcom also offered to expand the Qualcomm board by retaining the three existing directors who were named by Jana.Qualcomm called Broadcom\u2019s board nominees \u201cinherently conflicted given Broadcom\u2019s desire to acquire Qualcomm in a manner that dramatically undervalues Qualcomm to Broadcom\u2019s benefit.\u201d It stressed its directors were willing to objectively evaluate \u201cthe full range of opportunities available to maximize value for all Qualcomm stockholders.\u201dThe two chip makers had talked earlier. Mr. Tan disclosed in a letter to Qualcomm\u2019s board that he had discussed a combination in August 2016 with Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive.People familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential, said Mr. Mollenkopf met with Mr. Tan more than once and Qualcomm hired external advisers to review a possible transaction. Because Broadcom\u2019s market value was considerably smaller than it is now, any deal might have been a merger or acquisition by Qualcomm, these people said.Broadcom has offered $70 a share, a price it said represented a 28 percent premium over the closing price of Qualcomm\u2019s common stock before reports of a potential bid. Qualcomm has argued that the current bid was too low even as a starting point for negotiations, but Broadcom contends its offer was the most significant catalyst for Qualcomm\u2019s stock price in nearly a year. Its shares had traded below $60 a share for most of the year before Broadcom announced its offer.How much support Broadcom has from Qualcomm investors remains unclear. Shares in the chip maker declined less than 2 percent on Monday, an indication that shareholders are not confident a deal will take place. Broadcom could try to initiate deal negotiations by raising its bid, but it is unclear if it would try to do so before the March 6 shareholders meeting.Broadcom is scheduled to announce quarterly earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and it may discuss its plans regarding Qualcomm during a scheduled conference call.Any purchase of Qualcomm would almost certainly face a lengthy regulatory review. Besides antitrust concerns, the possibility of sensitive American technology falling into foreign hands would be examined closely by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an agency known as Cfius.Broadcom, although managed from San Jose, Calif., has its headquarters in Singapore. Mr. Tan pledged before announcing the Qualcomm bid to shift Broadcom\u2019s home base to the United States \u2014 a move that might help it evade a Cfius review \u2014 but no further action to move its headquarters has been announced.People with knowledge of Broadcom\u2019s deliberations said that the company had met with several regulators and felt comfortable that a deal would win approval.Don Clark reported from San Francisco and Michael de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}
