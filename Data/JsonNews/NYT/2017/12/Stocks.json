{"Headline": "How the Security Council Failed the Syria Chemical Weapons Investigators and Victims", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorPresident Barack Obama had warned that the United States would take military action if President Bashar al-Assad of Syria used chemical weapons. The attack on Ghouta crossed Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cred line,\u201d but he chose coercive diplomacy instead of military action.Syria acknowledged that it had chemical weapons. The United States and Russia reached a deal in mid-September 2013 under which Syria had to destroy its chemical weapons program.Yet the Syrian government has continued using chemical weapons in Syria. Between December 2015 and last November, the organization recorded 121 alleged incidents. In 2016, it confirmed 23 uses of chemicals as weapons between April 2014 and August 2015; its investigations continue.The Security Council responded by creating in August 2015 a Joint Investigative Mechanism between the United Nations and the chemical weapons organization to identify perpetrators of these atrocious crimes.From August 2015 to October 2016, a team of investigators looked into eight cases of the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon and one case involving the use of sulfur mustard. Three attacks were attributed to the Syrian government and one to the Islamic State. The Security Council failed to reach agreement on any consequences for these crimes.A few weeks after an April 4 sarin gas attack on Khan Sheikhoun, Syria, which killed approximately 100 and injured at least 200, I accepted the job to lead the investigative team.Identifying perpetrators of mass atrocities in an active conflict, against a complex political backdrop, especially in cases involving banned chemical weapons, is incredibly difficult.Sarin, a colorless, odorless liquid nerve agent with extreme potency, had been used in Khan Sheikhoun. Its production and use require advanced technical expertise. Exposure to sarin kills within minutes.Forensics and chemistry were instrumental in the investigations. A Syrian government aircraft was flying over Khan Sheikhoun at the time of the attack, an aerial chemical bomb was launched over the town, and its residents began dying within minutes.Investigators collected medical and environmental samples provided by the Syrian government and local groups. It was rigorous work in a laboratory that proved that a sarin precursor known as DF that was used in Khan Sheikhoun was identical to the sarin component produced and stored by the Syrian government. The Syrian government had not declared any stocks missing or stolen.In another incident, in September 2016, Islamic State militants fired a mortar containing sulfur mustard blistering agent from one of their positions. Two women in the village of Umm Hawsh were seriously sickened when they tried to clean the chemical off their homes. The incident showed that the Islamic State retained the ability to produce and use sulfur mustard.Most members of the Security Council voiced strong support for the investigations. Bolivia, China, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Russia questioned the team\u2019s methodology and the outcome of the investigations. Russia and Syria accused me of making political judgments and criticized us as conducting remote investigations.On Nov. 16, Russia and Bolivia voted against a United States proposal that supported our findings and would have extended the investigators\u2019 mandate for a year. A Russian proposal that would have renewed the mandate for six months but required reopening the investigations did not receive sufficient support to be voted on formally.The next day Japan proposed a compromise extension of 30 days to buy time to find a way to ensure continuity of our work. Japan\u2019s proposal also asked the United Nations secretary general for ideas on the structure and methodology of my team.Despite their differences, members of the Security Council agreed that what we were was doing was important and should be continued. Yet again, Russia and Bolivia rejected the Japanese proposal, effectively ending our work.Security Council action is equally important to deter any use of chemical weapons in the future. We owe this to the victims, who have yet to see justice and assistance as they cope with the consequences of these prohibited weapons. The international community has a moral responsibility to act and ensure that their use is stopped forever.Edmond Mulet is the former head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism.Advertisement"}

Some of us will get nice gifts, while others will get lumps of coal.But the rules have changed a bit this time, at least as far as the federal government is concerned. The St. Nick you knew is on vacation, possibly permanently. In his place we have Republican Tax-Cut Santa, who has different priorities.You see, the new guy doesn\u2019t care whether you\u2019re naughty or nice. In fact, he\u2019ll actually reward you if you\u2019re naughty in the right ways. But mainly he cares whether you\u2019re rich, especially if your wealth comes from property (preferably inherited property), not hard work. In that case, you get a really big gift. If you\u2019re an ordinary working family, not so much \u2014 and eventually you get that lump.So let\u2019s talk about whose stockings will be stuffed by the tax bill Republicans just rammed through without a single hearing or a single Democratic vote.Now comes the fun part \u2014 the part where it pays to be naughty.You see, the second most important piece of this tax bill, after the corporate tax giveaway, is a drastic tax cut for business owners, who will end up paying much less in taxes than people with the same income who work as someone else\u2019s employee.And it will also open the door to a lot of tax-system gaming.Or suppose some of my colleagues form an economics consulting firm. Such a firm won\u2019t qualify for tax breaks. But suppose they also start selling nerdy T-shirts (\u201cEconomists do it with models\u201d). With a little hocus-pocus, as I understand it, they can basically define themselves as a T-shirt business, and pay much less in taxes.The point is that there will be hundreds of tax-avoidance games like these, costing taxpayers billions if not hundreds of billions in lost revenue. But only those who are both affluent and sneaky will be able to play these games. As I said, Tax-Cut Santa actually rewards you if you\u2019re naughty, as long as you\u2019re naughty in the right way.And what about those promises that rich people wouldn\u2019t get a tax cut, that the tax system would get simpler, that you\u2019d be able to file on a postcard, and all that?

{"Headline": "The Giant, Under Attack", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "One of America\u2019s biggest rehab companies built an empire. But after a patient named Gary Benefield died, its enemies \u2014 investors and business rivals alike \u2014 struck hard.On the last day of his life, Gary Benefield expressed hope for the future. He was finally about to \u201cget right,\u201d he said.A Harley-riding tough guy and retired utility worker, Mr. Benefield had let addiction get the better of him. He was downing a dozen Budweisers a day and smoking nonstop, despite needing an oxygen tank to breathe. But that July day in 2010, he was headed to A Better Tomorrow, a California treatment center promising 24-hour care while he got sober.Mr. Benefield was about to join the millions of Americans who have placed their fate in the hands of the nation\u2019s sprawling, haphazardly regulated addiction-treatment industry. It is a wildly profitable business, thanks in large part to addicts like Gary.He kissed his wife, Kelly, goodbye at the tiny airport in Show Low, Ariz., a town named for the lucky turn of a playing card more than a century earlier. \u201cHe told me he loved me,\u201d she said later. That evening, he checked in at the treatment center.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018The next morning, as dawn broke over A Better Tomorrow\u2019s postage-stamp lawn and stucco walls, two new voice mail messages awaited an employee there.One came from Kelly Benefield, asking: Could someone help her bring Gary a cake that day? It was his 53rd birthday.The other came from a manager: Gary Benefield was dead.America is convulsed by an addiction crisis \u2014 painkillers, heroin, alcoholism, meth \u2014 and its victims die with tragic regularity. But Mr. Benefield\u2019s case is extraordinary.His death in July 2010 kicked off a six-year battle that very nearly brought down one of the biggest addiction-treatment companies in the country, an epic clash between an addiction-treatment multimillionaire and a college kid and budding financial wizard.On one side was Michael Cartwright, a former addict pursuing his dream of building a nationwide empire of trustworthy drug-treatment clinics \u2014 a kind of Mayo Clinic for addiction. His Nashville, Tenn., company owned the clinic where Mr. Benefield had died.On the other was Chris Drose, who, uninspired by his class work at Furman University, became fascinated with short selling \u2014 a risky investment strategy of trying to make money by betting that a company\u2019s stock will fall.In Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, the college junior saw a very big \u201cshort.\u201d And he attacked.Addiction treatment is one of the most lucrative health care industries to emerge in a generation, a massive business fed by a national addiction crisis that, by most measures, is out of control. Drug overdoses kill more Americans than car accidents, but only a fraction of the country\u2019s 23 million addicts go into rehab, creating an untapped market \u2014 and an enormous business opportunity.Yet the industry focused on curing addiction has its shortcomings. One of the most significant: There is little consensus on the most effective ways to treat patients.Should patients travel far from home, as Mr. Benefield did, to isolate them from temptation? Or should they stay close to their support networks of family and friends? Should they be treated with medications that reduce the appetite for opioids? Or should they be coached to conquer their illness through willpower?The field is also covered by a patchwork of regulations that haven\u2019t kept pace with its growth. That has created room for opportunistic small operators to spring up, some with questionable track records.The industry started taking off when President George W. Bush in 2008 signed a law requiring insurers to pay for rehab. The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded coverage further. Suddenly just about anyone with insurance could get help.Today, private insurance covers treatment for millions of working and middle-class Americans. Annual spending by private insurers on opiate addiction alone rose more than 1,000 percent in the five-year period ending in 2015, to roughly $721 million, according to Fair Health, an independent nonprofit that keeps a database of private insurance claims.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company, American Addiction Centers, operates treatment centers in eight states around the country. That was how Mr. Benefield ended up in a treatment facility in California: Eager to get sober, he and his wife searched online from their home in Arizona for a clinic, found A Better Tomorrow \u2014 which eventually became part of Mr. Cartwright\u2019s business \u2014 and then called up to book a spot.This account of Mr. Benefield\u2019s final days, and the battle over American Addiction Centers, draws on interviews with executives, front-line employees, addicts, police and investors, as well as thousands of court documents.On October 3, 2014 \u2014 four years after Mr. Benefield\u2019s death \u2014 Michael Cartwright and his business partner, Jerrod Menz, rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange to announce the first of day trading in their company\u2019s shares. Mr. Cartwright, standing next to his teenage daughter, clapped. Mr. Menz gave the thumbs up.At the close of trading that day, shares in American Addiction Centers held by the two men \u2014 the two largest shareholders \u2014 were worth a combined $202 million.It was a crowning achievement for both men, but particularly for Mr. Cartwright, who had started his career running a rehab center for mentally ill addicts in inner city Nashville.In 2012, Mr. Cartwright started buying up smaller providers, including one that had been started by Mr. Menz, his longtime friend, in Southern California, and assembling them into a national chain.Mr. Cartwright himself had abused drugs as a younger man, \u201canything I could get my hands on,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Cartwright also spent time in a psychiatric hospital after a breakdown, an experience that helped to shape his belief that anyone can overcome addiction as long as they have the right mind-set.He credited his grandmother\u2019s tough love with helping him turn his life around. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t about to let me wallow in my own poop,\u201d he wrote in his book, \u201cBelievable Hope.\u201dAddiction should be overcome by willpower and hard work in therapy, Mr. Cartwright said. Other treatment providers put more emphasis on medicines to help addicts \u2014 particularly opiate addicts \u2014 function in the long term.The treatment world is split by methodology and motivation \u2014 inpatient and outpatient, religious and secular, nonprofit and moneymaking. Such a Balkanized industry seemed ripe for consolidation by a businessman like Mr. Cartwright.With aggressive internet marketing and a central call center, Mr. Cartwright pulled in patients from around the country. Patients stay for weeks at a time in a treatment house, undergoing therapy paid for by private insurance.\u201cIf you can create a great brand, which I think Michael can,\u201d said Lucius Burch III, an early investor in American Addiction Centers and a former chairman of a Nashville company that runs private prisons, \u201cyou have an opportunity to build a huge company.\u201dBut there were people who believed they saw big vulnerabilities in that emerging brand, including a college student in South Carolina.With bushy eyebrows and a boyish face, Mr. Drose comes from a family of skeptics and crusaders. His grandfather helped plot the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, a dictator in his native Dominican Republic, in the 1960s.He remembered the day, in late 2014, that he discovered the investment idea that would launch his career. He was 19, sitting on a purple armchair in his dorm room at Furman, where he liked to spend his spare time scanning financial filings in search of stocks to \u201cshort,\u201d or bet against.\u201cIt\u2019s like a big Easter egg hunt,\u201d Mr. Drose said recently. \u201cExcept, for something bad.\u201dThat day, one company stood out to him \u2014 American Addiction Centers. In just a few months in existence as a publicly traded stock, its shares had risen a blistering 60 percent.Any time a stock rises that quickly, short sellers like Mr. Drose sense an opportunity. But there was something else that piqued his interest.A business that profited from people\u2019s desperation seemed like \u201can industry that might have something weird going on,\u201d Mr. Drose said.But weird wouldn\u2019t begin to describe the world he was about to enter.Culling through American Addiction Centers\u2019 public filings, he noticed that a health insurer had sued one of the company\u2019s subsidiaries, claiming that it had conducted unnecessary drug tests on patients\u2019 urine. Posing as a prospective patient, Mr. Drose called the company and asked how often it conducted drug tests, and came to believe that American Addiction Centers was testing much more frequently than other providers.He wrote an article about his findings on a website called Seeking Alpha, which short sellers frequent for investment tips. The company\u2019s stock promptly dropped 10 percent.That was a big win for anyone short-selling the stock. Short sellers borrow shares in a company, then sell them hoping that the price falls. Their goal is to buy back the shares later, at a cheaper price, and return them to the lender. The price decline is their profit.In Nashville, Mr. Cartwright watched his stock fall, and was stunned. \u201cWe found no substantiation for any one of his claims,\u201d he said in an interview, referring to Mr. Drose\u2019s article.Battle lines were being drawn and Mr. Drose\u2019s work was attracting attention elsewhere. Kingsford Capital, a hedge fund based outside of San Francisco, hired him as a consultant and told him to keep digging into the treatment business.And another interested party had noticed Mr. Drose\u2019s work, too: a man named Charles Hill, who ran a treatment center in Temecula, Calif., the town where Mr. Benefield had died.Mr. Hill told Mr. Drose that he knew a great deal about American Addiction Centers. He congratulated him on his article about the urine testing, and suggested he start searching for lawsuits brought by families of patients who had died in California. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking in the wrong place,\u201d he told Mr. Drose.Following Mr. Hill\u2019s advice, Mr. Drose flew to California in the spring of 2015. He may have been working for a major hedge fund, but he was so young \u2014 still only 20 \u2014 that he had to pay extra to rent a car.The two men met at Mr. Hill\u2019s rehab center in Temecula, a maze of cul-de-sacs and shopping plazas book-ended by the velvet green Santa Rosa mountains and the snowcapped peaks of the San Bernardino range.Mr. Hill thought the college kid was an investigative reporter. So he was thrilled to have someone to listen to his concerns about the treatment business.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what short selling was,\u201d Mr. Hill recalled.Standing five feet seven inches in scuffed leather boots and faded jeans, Mr. Hill is a former painkiller addict and a natural storyteller. The story that perhaps best defines his life involved a football injury back in the 1990s. It shaped his personal philosophy of drug treatment, one that puts its trust in modern medications \u2014 and is at odds with people like Mr. Cartwright, who want patients to ultimately lead a truly drug-free life.Mr. Hill was injured at the age of 42, too old to be playing tackle football. But eager to relive his high school glory days, Mr. Hill \u2014 his nickname is Rocky \u2014 had joined some friends to start a full-contact football league, The Over the Hill Pigskin Shootout. They used old pads donated by the Los Angeles Rams.One fateful tackle, though, ended the fun. He tore the rotator cuff in each of his shoulders. His doctor prescribed a powerful painkiller, Norco.And Mr. Hill \u2014 who was already in the addiction treatment business \u2014 became an opiate addict himself.When he tried to stop taking the Norco, his life unraveled. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He subsisted on Ensure, the nutrition drink, because eating made him vomit. He considered suicide.A doctor specializing in pain management told Mr. Hill that the opiates had permanently altered his brain. Therapy and group meetings couldn\u2019t fix that.The doctor prescribed Mr. Hill a different drug, buprenorphine, which satisfies the craving for opiates but does not result in a high. Minutes after the first dose dissolved under Mr. Hill\u2019s tongue, the world righted itself.\u201cBefore, it felt like someone had put a vacuum in me and sucked out all the joy,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cAnd then, it was like someone had suddenly reversed it.\u201dMr. Hill\u2019s successful treatment with buprenorphine was for him a revelation. Today, he sends the opiate addicts he treats to a local doctor for a prescription for the same drug he still takes every morning.For many addicts, that prescription is all they need to get on with their lives, Mr. Hill said. Mr. Cartwright, by contrast, believes that ultimately \u201cabstinence has to be the goal,\u201d he said in an interview.That is only the start of their differences.Mr. Cartwright\u2019s company specializes in enrolling addicts in intensive inpatient programs, often far from their families \u2014 where they stay full-time in a sober living center with other recovering addicts.Mr. Hill prefers an outpatient approach that is close to the patient\u2019s support network. During the day, addicts come to Mr. Hill\u2019s two-story building, where they meet with therapists. At night, they go home.Mr. Hill believes the inpatient model is motivated more by greed than doing good. Inpatient providers can bill insurers up to $10,000 for 28 days of services; Mr. Hill charges $1,400 a month for his outpatient treatments.There is great debate about which treatment approaches work best, and even how to measure their efficacy.\u201cA lot of organizations say they have the cure, but they have no incentive to try to prove it through the data,\u201d said Robert Poznanovich, executive director of Business Development at Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, one of the best-known addiction-treatment providers in the United States.Hazelden offers a mix of outpatient and inpatient treatment. Modern addiction treatment grew directly from Hazelden and its secluded farm in Minnesota. In 1949, a group of businessmen and a Catholic priest pioneered the idea of bringing alcoholics to a rural location, where the men (they were all men back then) could focus on the 12-step principles without the distractions and temptations of everyday life.The approach became known as the Minnesota Model and was copied by other nonprofits for decades. Then, the new insurance laws in 2008 and 2010 transformed what had largely been a government-funded and charitable-minded field into an enticing for-profit business. In just a few years, that gave rise to a $35 billion industry of inpatient programs such as the one offered by American Addiction Centers.Mr. Hill\u2019s concerns about American Addiction Centers were not just about the debate between inpatient vs. outpatient philosophies of treatment. He told Mr. Drose about patients who had died in rehab homes around Temecula and nearby Murrieta that Mr. Cartwright later acquired.The deaths, Mr. Hill contended, showed how the company was unequipped to deal with medically fragile addicts. Yet, Mr. Hill claimed that for years the company kept taking those patients, assuring them that they would receive adequate care.As far back as 2008, Mr. Hill had told the California agency that oversees drug-treatment programs that he believed some patients at Mr. Menz\u2019s facilities (ones that later became part of American Addiction Centers) were in danger. When some of the dead patients\u2019 families later filed lawsuits against those companies, he followed every twist and turn of the cases.He had also spent a good part of 2011 and 2012 working with Hardy Gold, a prosecutor in the state attorney general\u2019s office who was interested in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. The two began trading emails discussing aspects of the investigation \u2014 emails that would later cause headaches for the prosecutor. At one point, Mr. Gold visited Mr. Hill\u2019s office to get a tutorial on the addiction-treatment industry.During that time, American Addiction Centers sued Mr. Hill for defamation, saying he had made false statements about its patient care. A judge dismissed the suit.Mr. Hill kept up his attacks on American Addiction Centers. And in Mr. Drose, he believed that he had found a new way to take on the company.Mr. Drose spent hours talking to Mr. Hill that day in Temecula. When he returned home, his backpack was stuffed with lawsuits, depositions and autopsy reports. \u201cDamn,\u201d Mr. Drose said he thought at the time. \u201cI left there thinking I had stumbled across a gold mine.\u201dMr. Drose returned to Kingsford\u2019s offices in Atlanta, took over a glass-enclosed conference room, and made piles of documents related to each death.None of the deaths had been disclosed to investors when the stock of American Addiction Centers began trading publicly.The dead included Shaun Reyna, an alcoholic, who killed himself with a shaving razor in one of the company\u2019s treatment houses. Mr. Reyna\u2019s widow said in a 2014 lawsuit that the staff had ignored signs that her husband was suffering withdrawal symptoms that required urgent medical care. The case is expected to go to trial early in 2018.There was also Gregory Thomas, who hanged himself from a bridge one block from the company\u2019s main office in Temecula in November 2010. He had been brought to the office by a company employee, but never went through with the treatment.Mr. Thomas\u2019s body hung from a bridge for several days before anyone noticed. A judge ruled that the company wasn\u2019t liable because Mr. Thomas had not been admitted.But the circumstances of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, as detailed in a lawsuit his wife brought in 2011, stood out.The treatment house that he ended up traveling to, A Better Tomorrow, was founded by Mr. Menz, Mr. Cartwright\u2019s partner in American Addiction Centers. It would become a core part of the publicly traded company.When Mr. Benefield called A Better Tomorrow in late July 2010, he was about to help the company solve a problem: a patient shortage.There were too many empty beds, Mr. Menz had told his staff members at a monthly meeting, and they needed to fill them. The employees \u2014 who referred to signing up new patients as \u201cclosing a sale\u201d \u2014 understood the risk of failure.\u201cIf you\u2019re not closing,\u201d Jody Brueske, the former sales representative who enrolled Mr. Benefield would later testify in a separate case involving his death, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be the next one walking out the door.\u201dFrom their kitchen in Springersville, Ariz., the Benefields did not know any of that. All they knew was that A Better Tomorrow had come up in an internet search. A former snowboarder, Mr. Benefield was so excited he even packed his gym clothes, thrilled at the prospect of getting healthy again, according to court records. Ms. Benefield declined to be interviewed; her statements primarily come from court documents.From his first phone call to his death, Mr. Benefield\u2019s relationship with A Better Tomorrow lasted a mere two days. Compressed into those 48 hours is a case study in how financial pressures and business motivations can collide with the needs and expectations of the fragile patients who represent the industry\u2019s bread and butter.Just days after the staff meeting led by Mr. Menz, Ms. Brueske took the call from Mr. Benefield and his wife, Kelly. His case was pretty typical \u2014 an out-of-control drinking problem that was hurting someone\u2019s marriage. But one thing set it apart: Mr. Benefield had chronic lung disease that forced him to use an oxygen tank.Ms. Brueske had never dealt with a patient who used oxygen. But she felt that she couldn\u2019t turn anyone away, because much of her pay came from commissions, she later testified.According to a court transcript, a lawyer grilled Ms. Brueske on that point, asking her: \u201cDid you feel personally pressured to get more clients in because of that sales meeting?\u201dMs. Brueske responded, \u201cYes.\u201dUltimately, Ms. Brueske assured the Benefields that A Better Tomorrow could provide the oxygen he needed.In an interview, Mr. Cartwright disputed the sales rep\u2019s testimony. He said that her perception of the pressures to fill beds \u201cdid not match reality.\u201d He said the company would never promise to provide oxygen to a patient, because it would require a prescription. \u201cIf she promised that, she was out there on an island,\u201d he said.But from the moment Mr. Benefield stepped off the plane in California, there were signs the company wasn\u2019t equipped to handle his care.A Better Tomorrow sent a driver to pick him up at the San Diego airport. When that driver, a recovering meth addict with no medical training, got to the airport, he found that Mr. Benefield was having trouble breathing. His oxygen tank was empty.The driver\u2019s supervisor instructed him to give Mr. Benefield a sedative called Serax, even though Mr. Benefield had not been prescribed that drug. According to a transcript of court testimony, the Serax pills were leftovers from previous patients that were simply kept in the car in case the driver needed to administer a sedative on the spot.Mr. Menz, in an interview, said it had never been company policy to dispense drugs without a prescription, nor did the company keep leftover medicine.The driver and other employees also testified that staff members were discouraged from taking patients to a hospital emergency room \u2014 even when they appeared to be in distress \u2014 because A Better Tomorrow might risk losing a paying customer. The feeling was, \u201cthey are taking our clients,\u201d the driver said of the hospital.The treatment house where Mr. Benefield was taken was not a medical facility but a five-bedroom home with a two-car garage and a hot tub in the back. And the employees there did not know what to make of Mr. Benefield\u2019s behavior \u2014 they were familiar with addiction symptoms, not respiratory ailments.The afternoon of Mr. Benefield\u2019s arrival, as he grew more distressed, the house\u2019s employees called their managers at home for guidance. One supervisor they phoned \u2014 a licensed massage therapist and marriage counselor, not a doctor \u2014 told them to administer more sedatives.Mr. Benefield\u2019s oxygen tank remained unfilled.That night, the employees found that Mr. Benefield had slid out of bed and was sitting on the floor. They hoisted him back into bed. When they went to check on him again in the morning, he was dead.As part of the testimony by Ms. Brueske, the sales rep who worked with the Benefields, she described her boss\u2019s advice after she learned of the death of her client. \u201cYou need to get thicker skin,\u201d she recalled her saying. \u201cPeople die in rehab all of the time.\u201dMr. Drose said that he wasn\u2019t sure what to think after he reviewed the testimony and other documents. \u201cI\u2019ve seen companies screw over shareholders,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cThis company seemed like it was hurting people.\u201dBut despite piles of documents detailing tragic deaths, it wasn\u2019t clear to him that he had enough useful material to move the stock price down, which remained his ultimate goal. After all, addiction patients die with tragic regularity.Mr. Drose\u2019s boss at Kingsford Capital, the hedge fund where he was working, also wasn\u2019t sure what all the material added up to.\u201cThis seems like a lot of stuff,\u201d Mr. Drose said his boss had told him as he stood among his piles of documents in the summer of 2015. \u201cBut what is really in here?\u201dA spokesman for Kingsford said the \u201cfirm does not comment on its investments.\u201dBit by bit, Mr. Drose struggled to piece together the meaning of the deaths at American Addiction Centers.He determined \u2014 after filtering through the reams of legal filings and other documents he had collected \u2014 that the prosecutor, Mr. Gold, had taken an interest in Mr. Benefield\u2019s case. After speaking with a former police detective about what the possible charges against the company could be, he came up with a startling theory: The company could face a murder charge.It was a wild idea. No other public company in California history had been charged with murder.In California, second-degree murder involves someone acting with \u201cimplied\u201d malice that reflects an \u201cabandoned or malignant heart.\u201d While that might sound like a legal concept straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, the theory was that the employees who gave Mr. Benefield sedatives, instead of taking him to the hospital, may have acted with implied malice.Mr. Drose liked the sound of that. \u201cSecond-degree murder is what will destroy this company,\u201d Mr. Drose wrote in an email to Mr. Hill. \u201cI am sure of it.\u201dOn and off in the years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, a cast of characters \u2014 the empire builder Mr. Cartwright, the budding short-seller Mr. Drose, the crosstown rival Mr. Hill \u2014 had made A Better Tomorrow and American Addiction Centers a focus of their lives. Some hoped to build it up. Others dreamed of tearing it down.Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Drose, in particular, saw fortunes to be made.But in Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, would a company \u2014 and by extension, an industry \u2014 be held to account? Would future patients benefit from the lessons learned from his death?On July 21, 2015, a prosecutor charged a subsidiary of American Addiction Centers and four employees with second-degree murder in the Benefield case.The company\u2019s stock price fell 53 percent, erasing more than half its value in just one day.Mr. Cartwright, vacationing in Italy, didn\u2019t know what hit him. He called his board of directors to ask for help figuring out what to do.One board member, the Nashville investor Mr. Burch, recently recalled his advice to Mr. Cartwright. \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from it,\u201d Mr. Burch told him. \u201cThere is not much you can do if someone calls you a son of a bitch, other than deny it and prove you are not. You get all the bullets you can, and fire at the enemy as quickly as you can.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly what Mr. Cartwright did.First his company lawyers argued, among other things, that the official coroner\u2019s report said Mr. Benefield had died of natural causes, but the prosecutor had relied on paid testimony from a different coroner to make a case for homicide. The lawyers got the murder charge reduced to abuse.That was a big win. But Mr. Cartwright was just getting started.\u201cHow do you bring a murder charge on a five-year-old, natural-cause death?\u201d Mr. Cartwright said recently. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201dLooking for answers, two private investigators were sent to interview Mr. Drose in Atlanta. Only then did Mr. Cartwright discover how all his enemies fit together.Mr. Drose said that he had guessed that a murder charge might be coming \u2014 well before the actual charge was made public.This gave Mr. Cartwright powerful new ammunition in his court battle: He didn\u2019t believe Mr. Drose had merely guessed. He suspected someone had leaked confidential grand jury information to an investor in a position to make a financial killing.\u201cI think the charge was brought to make money,\u201d Mr. Cartwright said in the interview earlier this year. \u201cCan I prove it? No.\u201dPresented with that argument, the judge said that Mr. Gold, the prosecutor, appeared to have a conflict because of his relationship with Mr. Hill, but that it was not enough to unfairly influence the case. But by then, it was June 2016, almost six years since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death. Two key witnesses had died and the case was running out of steam. Ultimately, American Addiction Centers agreed to pay a $200,000 fine and allow a monitor to oversee its operations in California.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general\u2019s office emphasized that \u201cthe judge concluded that any connection between Mr. Gold and Mr. Hill did not create a likelihood of unfairness to the defendants in the case.\u201dThe unprecedented murder case against a company, which would have sent a message to American Addiction Centers \u2014 and, by extension a desperately needed but poorly understood industry \u2014 had fizzled out.Today, Mr. Cartwright is still angry that his company had to fight off what he considers an unfair attack. The stock price is hovering around a quarter of its peak value, diminishing his personal wealth.But American Addiction Centers is growing again. In September, it bought a treatment company with a 114-bed hospital in Massachusetts. As part of the deal, it also acquired several toll-free numbers to generate referrals, including 1-800-ALCOHOL.And he points out that while the care at American Addiction Centers has evolved since Mr. Benefield\u2019s death, the resulting court fight did not prompt him to alter his treatment practices. \u201cWhy would I change policies and procedure because of someone dying of a heart attack at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d he said.His persistent critic, Mr. Hill, worries about what he considers the industry\u2019s sorry state and the quality of addiction treatment. \u201cIt is going to take turning the field upside down,\u201d he said. But he has also moved on, buying a place in Mexico where he enjoys swimming with dolphins. One day he hopes to retire there.Christopher Drose\u2019s work earned him a spot on Forbes magazine\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list of up-and-coming young investors. Today he works for a new hedge fund in New York doing what he loves: digging up dirt on companies, and betting against them.\u201cSome part of me likes to see people who are not telling the truth come face to face with it,\u201d Mr. Drose said. \u201cI\u2019ve found a way to express that with stocks.\u201dAmerican Addiction Centers has estimated that short sellers walked away with $250 million because of Mr. Benefield\u2019s death and the murder charge against the company. Mr. Drose called that number overstated but declined to say how much money he made.In 2015, Kingsford Capital sent out a holiday letter detailing its investment successes, which mentioned the murder charge involving American Addiction Centers. In the letter, the firm summed up its strategy that year as finding \u201cgifts from garbage.\u201d\u201cOne man\u2019s trash,\u201d Kingsford Capital wrote, \u201cis our treasure.\u201dToday in America, overdoses claim more lives than guns. Yet as the addiction crisis deepens, patients and their families are still struggling to sort out the most effective forms of treatment offered by the sprawling industry.Mr. Benefield, a bear of a man with a big drinking problem, had pursued his hope of getting well. His wife, Kelly, was left to settle a civil wrongful-death lawsuit against the company that they had hoped would help him.On Facebook, years after he died, Ms. Benefield wrote, \u201cI miss him so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of years since Gary Benefield\u2019s death. Mr. Benefield died seven years ago, not 11.Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Feb. 15, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Changes Are Coming Next Year, but You Can Plan for Them Now", "Date": "2017-12-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThe Senate and House may spend most of the month ironing out the differences in their tax bills. Or they may be delayed by other legislation and not enact a new tax code until the new year.Either way, high-earning taxpayers cannot afford to wait and see what happens; they need to act this month before certain opportunities go away. And betting on a delay in a final vote is not wise planning: Accountants predict that the new code will take effect on Jan. 1 even if it has to be made retroactive at some point next year.The two tax bills have differences for sure \u2014 the most obvious being the Senate\u2019s seven tax brackets to the House\u2019s four. They also have more nuanced discrepancies, like how they treat mortgage interest deductions and small businesses whose owners pay their company\u2019s taxes on their own returns.But even if accountants have not perfected the Excel formulas that will allow them to make exact comparisons, they are already talking to their wealthier clients, particularly those in high-tax states, about what they should do now before deductions go away or are decreased.For some high earners, lower tax rates could be offset by the end of deductions they have counted on for decades, namely those for state and local taxes, and reduced deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes.But the higher standard deduction \u2014 at least $24,000 per couple, up from $13,000 \u2014 and the absence or limitation of these other deductions could also lessen the tax benefits of charitable deductions. A more arcane provision in the Senate bill \u2014 regarding blocks of stocks bought at different times \u2014 could make the benefits of harvesting tax losses, a staple of basic financial planning, harder to accomplish.\u201cThe loss of some of the deductions will go a long way toward tax simplification but not necessarily toward tax savings,\u201d said Timothy M. Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird, a wealth management firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be easier to figure out how much more you\u2019re going to have to pay.\u201dFor those who would like to take advantage of tax benefits now, here are strategies they can follow.Pay property taxes early. Both the House and Senate bills allow for $10,000 in real estate tax deductions, which is high enough for taxpayers in many states.There are 32 additional counties \u2014 in Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts \u2014 where the average property tax is $7,000 or more, meaning people who own larger homes in those areas will feel the bite.Most municipalities set property tax rates in the middle of the year. Homeowners either pay them as part of their mortgage or directly to their town semiannually.If the latter is the case, advisers say to pay the installment due in early 2018 now. And if the taxes are paid as part of the mortgage payment, they advise checking with the bank to make sure the tax is paid this month and not in January.Prepay state taxes. Joseph J. Perry, the tax and business services leader at Marcum, a national accounting firm, said his firm was exploring a novel strategy for clients to prepay New York State tax for the first, second and third quarters of 2018. He said it appeared to be allowed under a mechanism in the state tax code.But early payment strategies work only if you do not qualify for the alternative minimum tax. Once taxpayers set off the A.M.T., their income is taxed at 28 percent, but they lose these deductions.High earners with savvy accountants could, however, work the math to accelerate income while qualifying for the A.M.T. this year to pay less in taxes than they might next year, Mr. Perry said.\u201cIf you\u2019re at a higher rate next year, you\u2019re not going to have that state deduction to bring you down,\u201d he said. Therefore, if high earners could receive a bonus this month instead of early next year, they could potentially have that money taxed at the lower rate. (Like all tax strategies, though, this requires running various calculations with an accountant.)Make large charitable donations. Calculating the tax value of charitable donations is a little trickier.The wealthiest will still get a benefit under certain circumstances. For example, if a married couple had a $1 million mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate, it could deduct $40,000 for its mortgage interest plus $10,000 for real estate taxes under the Senate version of the tax bill. This would give the couple $50,000 in deductions, which is above the standard deduction of $24,000, allowing them to claim charitable donations as a deduction.Under the House proposal, which caps the mortgage that can be used for the deduction at $500,000, they would have $20,000 in mortgage interest and $10,000 for real estate taxes. At $30,000 in deductions, their charitable gifts would still count.But if that same couple rents instead of owns, it would not have those other deductions to get above the standard amount. So any benefit it gets today from itemizing charitable deductions would be subsumed under the standard deduction.If the tax math works \u2014 and given that the income tax rates are likely to be higher this year than next year \u2014 people who can make large charitable deductions this year are likely to get more benefit.Those who do not want to give outright to a charity can make a donation to a donor-advised fund. In doing so, they get the deduction this year but can make the grants to charities later.Harvest stock losses. The Senate bill has a seemingly arcane provision that addresses the adequate identification rule, which has to do with selling blocks of stock. As the rule stands, people who bought blocks of stock at different times can choose which blocks to sell or give away for tax purposes.Under the proposed changes, an investor would have to sell the oldest stock first \u2014 under the premise of first in first out, said Gary M. DuBoff, principal in the tax and accounting department at MBAF, an accounting firm.The shares with the highest embedded taxes are the ones that people usually donate to charity, but Mr. DuBoff pointed out that this change would have an effect on tax-loss harvesting, a strategy in which an investor sells stocks that have performed poorly to take a capital loss. This still works if someone is selling the entire position, but not if the investor wants to sell more recently purchased blocks, which may have gone down in value while earlier blocks are still up, Mr. DuBoff said.So this is a good time to make sure your adviser is harvesting losses on blocks within large stock holdings, particularly if earlier blocks have appreciated.Don\u2019t act hastily. As the year was nearing an end, a swath of wealthy taxpayers rushed to make taxable gifts, thinking that Mr. Obama would reduce what had been a generous estate and gift tax exemption of $5 million a person.Planners say the risk this year is lower, and they predict that any changes to the bills are going to be on the margins.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to get blindsided here,\u201d said Jay Messing, senior director of planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cMost itemized deductions are going away. If there\u2019s a change and it didn\u2019t make sense to donate this year, maybe you just gave money to your favorite charity a little early.\u201dIt\u2019s smart to act now on some strategies, but others should wait until 2018. Thinking through those will be the focus of next week\u2019s column.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Cost of Devaluing Women", "Date": "2017-12-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionMy first job out of college in the late 1980s was at Salomon Brothers, a trading house of cigar-smoking, expletive-spewing strivers. One day, I leaned over a colleague\u2019s desk to work on a spreadsheet, and heard loud laughter from behind me; one of the guys was pretending to perform a sex act on me. Almost every day, I found a Xerox copy of male genitalia on my desk.In the 1990s, I changed firms and was now a midlevel professional. The harassment shifted: Instead I had to rebuff a client, a chief executive, who asked me to join him \u2014 \u201cJust you, no need to bring the rest of the team\u201d \u2014 in his hotel room at 11 p.m. to go over some numbers. One company rescinded a job offer upon learning I had a baby at home.I changed firms again and moved another rung up the corporate ladder, and it felt a little less fraught to deal with the inevitable. I was able to say no to the senior government official who said, \u201cHow about we go up to my hotel room?\u201d before obscenely wagging his tongue at me in front of my colleagues. I could knock the portfolio manager\u2019s hands off my leg without too much fear of retribution.These are stories I have not often revisited. Maybe I\u2019ve shared them over drinks with female friends or with younger women in the industry, to let them know what it used to be like. But in the dizzying past few weeks, as this crucial moment of reckoning on sexual harassment continues, it\u2019s clear that the harassment I was subjected to is not in the past. Worse, I know that being a white woman afforded me a privilege in dealing with these issues that unfortunately not everyone has.What we are only beginning to recognize is that demeaning and devaluing women is an insidious, expensive problem. It\u2019s not just the eye-popping settlements in some cases, like the $32 million paid by Bill O\u2019Reilly to settle a harassment claim. Nor is it just the high salaries network stars have been making while allegedly assaulting subordinates, like the $20 million, or more, for Matt Lauer. It only starts there.The bigger cost derives from how women\u2019s ideas are discounted and their talent ignored. I have seen it up close in the two worlds I know best: Wall Street, where I was chief executive of Smith Barney and of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and in Silicon Valley, where I\u2019ve raised money to run my start-up, Ellevest. These places are perhaps the purest microcosms of capitalism, and their lessons are instructive for all of us.Both Wall Street and venture capital are industries whose product is money: Wall Street directs trillions of dollars to the sectors or businesses that it believes will deliver the highest returns. Likewise, Silicon Valley invests hundreds of billions of dollars in start-ups that it believes will deliver the best returns. Both pick economic winners and losers.Homogeneity has led Wall Street firms to travel in packs, going after the same opportunities at the same time: junk bonds in the 1980s, tech stocks in the late 1990s and subprime lending in the run-up to the crash 10 years ago. In particular, when the subprime bet proved wrong, the big banks went essentially bankrupt and were bailed out by the United States government because officials worried that the economic cost of their failure would have been catastrophic.Thus one can draw a line from the gender discrimination on Wall Street through to the lack of women \u2014 and lack of diversity of thought \u2014 in the industry to increased risk and to the financial crisis.One might argue that start-ups run by men just happen to deliver the highest possible returns. The mythology around the industry bolsters this, with venture capitalists boasting of investing in Facebook practically out of the dorm room.Venture capital and Wall Street are both funded by \u201cother people\u2019s money.\u201d Pension funds, endowments, mutual funds and individual investors provide the fuel that enables this sexist, exclusionary behavior. The irony is that so many of these endowments and foundations exist to make the world a fairer place, not to exclude vast segments of the population. Yet because their money is tied up in industries where women\u2019s perspectives, and diversity of viewpoints, aren\u2019t valued on the whole, their causes \u2014 and their bottom lines \u2014 lose out.This moment of ferreting out sexual harassers is a step forward. It also reveals how much work we have to do on the biases that allowed such behavior to flourish.This summer, I was in Silicon Valley, pitching for a round of funding for my company. I was the only woman in a room of 18 venture capitalists. A few of the men were engaged, a few were typing on their iPhones, and the lead investor was alternating between peppering me with questions and leaning back in his chair with his arms folded. He challenged my knowledge on digital acquisition, on acquisition costs.Fair enough, even if he was being a little prickly. Finally, I noted that our business was planning to hire a few financial advisers. He proceeded to give me chapter and verse on how financial advisers are hard to manage and instructed me on the economics of the financial advisory business.I was astonished, because I have managed more financial advisers in my career than probably anyone in the country. And though it\u2019s been years since I have been sexually harassed the way I was at Salomon, I realized in that moment how deep our gender views run, how men are still seen as leaders and women as more junior.This man naturally assumed that he knew more about it than I did. It was his ingrained view of women \u2014 a view that\u2019s costing all of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup Fined for Showing Customers Wrong Stock Ratings", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCitigroup for years gave small investors inaccurate information about whether the bank\u2019s research analysts recommended buying or selling certain stocks, a Wall Street regulator said Thursday.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees brokers and money managers, said Citigroup agreed to pay $11.5 million in fines and compensatory damages to resolve claims that it gave mom-and-pop investors wrong or outdated information about its analysts\u2019 recommendations, even after some officials in the business were told of the problem.The industry watchdog said Citigroup misrepresented its analysts\u2019 views of more than 1,800 stocks, telling small investors some had \u201cbuy\u201d ratings when in fact they were rated \u201csell,\u201d and vice versa. In other cases, individual investors got ratings information for stocks that Citigroup analysts had stopped covering altogether.The problem, which began in 2011, persisted until the end of 2015, according to the financial authority, when a broker reported being unable to reconcile ratings displayed on a Citigroup portal with those printed in its research reports. Some Citigroup employees knew as early as fall 2011 that customers were receiving incorrect ratings information on activity statements, but they did not understand why, according to the authority.\u201cWe are pleased to have the matter resolved,\u201d said Citigroup spokeswoman, Laura London.The problem affected individual investors, but not Citigroup\u2019s institutional investors, like pension funds and other big asset managers, which also sometimes rely on the bank\u2019s research to devise their investment strategies. As a result, the bank\u2019s retail customers appear to have been put at a disadvantage relative to the institutional clients.\u201cThe inaccuracies in the research ratings feed had widespread, adverse consequences,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement, adding that Citigroup\u2019s brokers \u201csolicited thousands of transactions inconsistent with the firm\u2019s actual ratings and negligently made inaccurate statements to customers about those ratings.\u201dThere is no indication Citigroup intended to give its institutional clients an advantage over smaller investors.

{"Headline": "Steven Cohen Plans a New Hedge Fund. Investors Are Wary.", "Date": "2017-12-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteven A. Cohen, the billionaire investor whose career was nearly derailed by a government crackdown on insider trading, is days away from once again being able to manage other people\u2019s money.Whether investors will hand over their money is another question.Mr. Cohen was a singular figure on Wall Street. His estimated $13 billion net worth, love of big homes and lavish spending on modern art, combined with his firm\u2019s envelope-pushing tactics, all shaped a public image of a highflying hedge fund manager.But his highly anticipated comeback is looking underwhelming so far.The firm that is marketing his hedge-fund-in-waiting has received $2 billion to $4 billion in commitments from investors, said three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. That is a far cry from the $11 billion Mr. Cohen ran at his family office the past two years.And according to several industry consultants, some pension funds and institutional investors are wary about putting their money with Mr. Cohen, who remains tainted by the insider-trading scandal that engulfed him and his former hedge fund.There is also anxiety, these consultants say, that Mr. Cohen\u2019s new firm plans to charge higher-than-average fees and will not let some investors withdraw their money for at least three years. Others wonder if the trader\u2019s best days are behind him.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise and high fees,\u201d said Richard C. Wilson, founder of Family Office Club, a professional association for family offices, which manage money for wealthy individuals. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t invested with him before, I don\u2019t think a lot of them will be clamoring to go in.\u201dWhen Mr. Wilson held a conference for about 300 investors in Miami in December, he said, Mr. Cohen and his new fund were barely discussed.Powerful Wall Street institutions are taking a cautious approach, too.JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which will handle trades for the new firm, have not yet committed to offering their wealthy customers a chance to invest with Mr. Cohen\u2019s new fund, according to two people familiar with each bank. Banks that serve as prime brokers to a hedge fund often give their best customers a chance to invest in that fund.A number of past investors in SAC, including the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, declined to comment about whether they would give money to Mr. Cohen\u2019s new firm.Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.During his two-year ban from the securities industry, Mr. Cohen hardly vanished.He converted SAC into an $11 billion family office called Point72 Asset Management, which managed and traded much of his personal fortune. In many ways, Point72 resembled SAC, employing more than 1,000 people and using the same Stamford, Conn., offices.Under the terms of his 2016 settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Cohen will need to hire an independent consultant for Stamford Harbor once it begins accepting money from outside investors and if Mr. Cohen works there in a supervisory capacity. The consultant will have to stay in place for at least two years.The settlement with the S.E.C. also required Mr. Cohen to keep an independent consultant at Point72 during the period he was banned. The consultant, Michael Considine, a lawyer with Seward & Kissel, did not respond to requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Considine will work with Stamford Harbor.The timing of Mr. Cohen\u2019s hedge fund reboot is inauspicious; many longtime managers have closed their hedge funds to run family offices instead.Jesse Schraft, who advises three family offices on alternative investments, said his main concern with investing in new hedge funds was paying high fees at a time when performances across the industry have been uneven at best. He is also wary of investing with managers who focus on stocks at a time when stock market indexes keep hitting record highs.For many people, Mr. Cohen\u2019s performance will be evaluated against the high bars set by two of his former SAC associates who have outpaced many of their competitors.Gabriel Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital hedge fund is up just over 41 percent this year. Mr. Plotkin was one of the top portfolio managers at SAC before he left to open his own fund in 2014. Mr. Plotkin invests mainly in consumer stocks, and Mr. Cohen invested $200 million of his own money with his former trader.Suvretta Capital Management, led by Aaron Cowen, another ex-SAC trader, is up 26 percent for the year.Kate Kelly contributed to this article.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tax Plan Crowns a Big Winner: Trump\u2019s Industry", "Date": "2017-12-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe real estate industry ended up with an even more generous depreciation timetable, allowing owners to shelter more income.And in a break from previous practice, rental and mortgage-interest income qualifies for a lower tax rate, the kind of special treatment traditionally reserved for long-term capital gains and certain qualified dividends.Real estate investment trusts, known as REITs, have extra cause for celebration. They are companies that make money by owning, financing and operating real estate. Both the Trump Organization and Kushner Companies, the family real estate firm partly owned by Mr. Kushner, have important deals with such trusts.A REIT functions like a mutual fund, but instead of assembling a portfolio of stocks, it allows people to invest in a bundle of real estate assets, both buildings and mortgages. More important is the way they are taxed. They pay no separate business tax and instead are required to pass along virtually all of their taxable income to shareholders, who pay the tax when they file individual returns.That\u2019s a big savings, and a big advantage. Those receiving mortgage-interest income outside a REIT would have to pay taxes based on ordinary rates.Kushner Companies has teamed up with another New York-based REIT, SL Green Realty Corporation, in several deals. They are collaborating on a development in Brooklyn, and SL Green lent Mr. Kushner\u2019s firm $85 million in 2016 to refinance its slice of the former headquarters of The New York Times in Manhattan.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said the firm had not done any lobbying on the tax bill.Kurt Koegl, a partner at the national accounting firm Marcum, noted that a lower corporate tax rate would enable other kinds of companies to better compete with REITs.But REITs are favored in other ways. Individuals who borrow money to invest in a REIT will be able to deduct the interest they pay on the loan at the top individual rate. When it comes to paying taxes on the interest income they earn from that REIT investment, however, the new, lower pass-through rate would apply.\u201cThat\u2019s a great deal, and it\u2019s going to create giant new tax shelters,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The tax code generally tries to prohibit this kind of tax rate arbitrage, he added.The REIT advantage is one example of a broader issue: different tax treatment for similar activities.Writers of the congressional bills promised that their overhaul would simplify the tax code, but the intricacies of the changes create countless opportunities for gamesmanship.\u201cSuddenly, there are a dozen different tax rates that apply to different businesses, in different industries, and to different investments,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. That means opportunities to come out ahead by making deals between these different groups or structuring businesses to take advantage of various provisions.That could lead to a flurry of restructuring and asset shifting that has no purpose other than lowering the tax rate. One business might borrow money to invest in another, or buy equipment and treat it as an expense and then lease it to another company.Ideally, the tax code is meant to encourage businesses to make sound economic decisions, and forgo activities whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes. But the proliferation of different business rates rewards loophole hunting and earnings shifting.\u201cThe speed with which they\u2019re doing this creates a level of ambiguity that will keep tax lawyers and tax professionals busy for 20 years,\u201d said Scott D. Michel, a tax lawyer with Caplin & Drysdale.For some industries, such accounting acrobatics may not be necessary. A Senate provision that is being marketed as an aid to small craft breweries would save money even for the largest beer, wine and liquor producers, whether they are in the United States or abroad.Foreign cruise lines that operate in the United States got a last-minute reprieve from a new tax that was in an earlier version of the Senate bill.Whistle-blowers and their attorneys are happy about a provision specifying that they can collect rewards based on criminal fines.Car dealers escaped the cap on interest deductions that apply to most other businesses. Private equity firms were not able to sidestep that cap, but they held on to most of the carried-interest benefit that allows private equity managers, hedge fund managers and real estate investors to pay a lower rate on much of their income. Firms will have to hold an asset for three years instead of one, but the average hold time is already more than five years.The energy industry also did well. Coal and natural gas would potentially benefit from provisions that undercut their renewable-energy competitors. In a reversal of more than four decades of national policy, the Senate bill would open a pristine 1.5-million-acre expanse of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.House and Senate Republicans are still wrangling over the final version, and every comma is subject to change. But to some tax experts, an unlevel playing field that gives certain types of business and structures advantages over others is a bigger concern than a tax break for real estate or any other industry.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look at the deals that are explicitly in the bill \u2014 like the special treatment of auto-dealer financing or whistle-blowers \u2014 and call out \u2018loophole,\u2019\u201d Mr. Looney of Brookings said. \u201cBut the big problems are the things that aren\u2019t specifically noted in the bill, but will arise because of tax planning.\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Took Office. Stocks Rose. Investors Are Still Worried.", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersSome of President Trump\u2019s least controversial tweets involve him boasting about the stock market. It has certainly done well since he was elected a year ago, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 30 percent in that time.Few would have predicted a year ago that the market would do so well. Investors who had the fortitude to stay in have benefited mightily by the increase. But the wary ones put their money in more secure assets.Michael Sonnenfeldt, a New Yorker who made his fortune in real estate, is the chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for very wealthy people. When I talked to him last year, he revealed the uncertainty investors were facing.\u201cThe combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we\u2019ve had in our lifetime \u2014 it all adds up to many generic concerns,\u201d he said at the time.So how did the market rocket past expectations, and how should investors plan for 2018?Mr. Trump is not unique among presidents for taking credit for a strong stock market and the broader economy. Most do it, if they can \u2014 just as surely as they try to skirt responsibility when there is a slump.But the last 12 months of great returns lack the euphoria a person might expect after an increase in the Dow of nearly 30 percent.Advisers say that is because many individual investors remain afraid that the eight-year bull market is going to collapse, while others struggle to separate Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh political language from the strong fundamentals of American companies.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a year of record-low volatility, strong returns and strong macroeconomic indicators,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Sullivan, chief investment officer for international wealth management at Credit Suisse. \u201cBut politically \u2014 we\u2019re in a political recession. People have difficulty squaring the two.\u201dThe firm\u2019s global wealth report, released in November, showed that the world had grown wealthier in the last 12 months and not just at the top of the economic pyramid.\u201cThe markets are focused very much on the business cycle, which is picking up,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a positive surprise, given how badly many people would have said the economy would have fared.\u201dIn other words, the stock market is rising not because of Mr. Trump but in spite of him.\u201cOur view continues to be that politicians are not as important to investing as they would like investors to believe,\u201d said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm. \u201cThat\u2019s always been our working model.\u201dMr. Bernstein said corporate fundamentals remained strong. \u201cCorporate profits remain healthy, liquidity remains abundant, and investors generally remain scared of stocks,\u201d he said.If presidential tweeting has not been driving the stock market, what should individual investors look for in equities? Analysts said investors should start by separating the political noise from the signals companies were sending out.For one, any corporate tax cut is not necessarily a short-term gain for the stock market. Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer with Eaton Vance, said a tax cut could actually result in a short-term drop in stock prices. And the companies that have been driving the stock market\u2019s growth, like health care and technology firms, will not benefit as much from a tax cut as smaller domestic companies that had not been able to take advantage of the loopholes and deductions under the current tax system.Other analysts argue that the prospect of tax cuts ceased being a factor in this rally a few months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, when he and the Republican Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cCorporate tax cuts are not priced into the market, because there is still skepticism toward the legislative process,\u201d said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.For 2018, analysts are predicting that the stock market will continue to do well but with greater swings.\u201cI always love corporate profits,\u201d Mr. Lynch said. \u201cWe can all get really geeky with these valuation measurements, but if you think about it, we have record profits growing slightly above historical rates. The Fed is tightening policy, and we\u2019re still growing. That\u2019s a pretty good recipe for equity investors.\u201dAnthony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said one difference in his strategy was a plan to use more active managers who pick stocks and to cut passively managed index funds. He said Wilmington Trust\u2019s research showed that active managers were outperforming the market as a whole.Or put another way: The skill that an active manager has is valuable in an environment when tweets about politics and people rattle less sophisticated investors.Today, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, he and the 580 members of Tiger 21, who have an average net worth of about $100 million, have nearly three-quarters of their money in private equity, real estate and publicly traded stocks.Over the last year, he said, the group\u2019s concern has not been with the political environment but with interest rates and wondering how long they will stay as low at they are. The group remains bullish on the advantages that American businesses have, like lower energy and transportation costs, over competitors in other countries.So what could end the stock market\u2019s run?CTBC Bank USA put that question to affluent investors in California, New Jersey and New York, all blue states that would be affected by a loss of deductions for state and property taxes. The poll found that they remained confident about the economic and investment landscape, but that they feared a political threat like a conflict with North Korea or a large terrorist attack in the United States.\u201cThe only thing we worry about is this geopolitical risk,\u201d said Noor Menai, president and chief executive of CTBC Bank USA. \u201cNothing gets amplified. Markets take it in stride.\u201dYet Mr. Menai said seasoned financial services professionals and institutional investors had a distinct advantage over individual investors.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through three crises over the past 25 years, and each time the market has reconstructed itself,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, the insiders such as me have come to understand what the hype is versus what can happen.\u201dBut individual investors do not have that knowledge. They still get scared about investing in a rising stock market because they fear it\u2019s going to collapse. When that happens, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, she asks clients to focus on what they can control.For example, if they are near retirement and cannot weather a 20 or 30 percent drop in their assets, she said, they should invest more conservatively.\u201cThere is anxiety and uncertainty about the political climate, but my sense is people are looking at their personal situation and asking how is all of this going to impact them,\u201d she said. And that, she said, can be summed up in one question: \u201cHow long can this bull market last?\u201dI\u2019ll bet you won\u2019t find that answer in a tweet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Central Bank, Lagging Behind Counterparts, Faces Eventful 2018", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A lot is happening in the world of central banks.It could be a watershed. The central bank\u2019s own economists substantially raised their estimates for eurozone growth, portending an end to the crisis measures that have been in place in the 19-nation common currency area since 2008. That would usher in a new era, with monetary policy returning to normal and the central bank beginning to gently push up interest rates.Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference on Thursday revolved around how soon the stimulus measures might end. While he said there has been \u201ca significant improvement in the growth outlook,\u201d he steadfastly avoided any statements that would change investor expectations. Still, Mr. Draghi offered a few clues about the central bank\u2019s evolving views.Here are some of the key takeaways.The Governing Council did not change its stance on Thursday, repeating that it can step up the stimulus measures at any time if the eurozone economy starts to flag. That\u2019s a sign that interest rate increases are still far in the future.But some members of the Governing Council have been suggesting that the bank should move more quickly. Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, said last month that he hoped the need for central bank bond buying would have run its course by September.Mr. Draghi declined to make any similar statements Thursday. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any change in the language or intentions,\u201d he said.The eurozone economy is humming. In new estimates published Thursday, the European Central Bank\u2019s economists said economic growth would accelerate to 2.3 percent in 2018. That compares to their estimate in September of 1.8 percent.At the same time, the central bank economists predict that inflation \u2014 the figure that influences central bank policy the most \u2014 will remain well below the official target of 2 percent through 2020. That is yet another sign the bank is in no hurry to begin raising interest rates.Mr. Draghi betrayed some concern Thursday about what will happen when the central bank is no longer flooding the eurozone with cash. He acknowledged that very low interest rates can lead to asset bubbles.\u201cThe ground is fertile for these risks,\u201d he said. But he added that evidence of overexuberant prices for real estate or other assets seem to be limited to a few local areas which are not a threat to the eurozone as a whole. \u201cWe are not seeing systemically important financial stability risks,\u201d he said.The European Central Bank exercises strong influence over interest rates in the eurozone but it is also at the mercy of financial markets, which react to a host of forces \u2014 not the least of which is what the Fed is doing.In effect, the European Central Bank is moving at a speed different from that of its two most important counterparts, even though their economies are closely intertwined. Currency exchange rates, for example, react strongly to central bank policy and have far-reaching economic consequences, determining how much people must pay for imported goods and also how cheaply companies can sell their products abroad.In fact, the euro spiked briefly as Mr. Draghi spoke Thursday but then retreated.Mr. Draghi said, in essence, that each central bank has to do its own thing depending on where its economy is. He said he hasn\u2019t detected any sign that the Fed\u2019s rate increases are hurting Europe. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any effect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Rejects Reports That His Top Diplomat Is Departing", "Date": "2017-12-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday rejected reports that he would soon fire Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson as \u201cfake news,\u201d but declared that \u201cI call the final shots\u201d as he acknowledged his disagreements with his top diplomat.The president\u2019s tweet was posted a few hours after Mr. Tillerson described reports this week that the White House wanted him to resign as \u201claughable.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a midafternoon tweet defending Mr. Tillerson.It marked an operatic turn in Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure after months of reports that he would soon leave the Trump administration. The latest round was fueled by a plan to force out Mr. Tillerson that was conceived by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and unveiled by senior administration officials on Thursday.The State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, denied on Thursday that Mr. Tillerson was leaving. But the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, notably did not, saying only that \u201cthere are no personnel announcements at this time\u201d when asked whether Mr. Tillerson was on his way out.Mr. Trump had also sidestepped questions on Thursday about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s future. \u201cHe\u2019s here. Rex is here,\u201d Mr. Trump said then, in an underwhelming display of support that did not challenge the reports of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s pending departure.By Friday morning, Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department during a brief appearance with Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of Libya that the reports were \u201claughable.\u201d He then headed to the White House for two meetings with Mr. Trump, including a lunch with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis \u2014 one of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s allies. The president tweeted after those meetings.Despite his years as a reality-TV star who routinely issued the line, \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d Mr. Trump has struggled with ousting his staff, even after he has chosen to do so. Two White House advisers said the president ultimately decided on Friday to bolster Mr. Tillerson with the tweet to avoid undermining his chief diplomat right before he heads overseas to work on a host of global crises.The two White House advisers insisted, however, that Mr. Tillerson is expected to leave sometime in January.In the plan revealed on Thursday, Mr. Tillerson would be succeeded by Mike Pompeo, currently the C.I.A. director, who is more closely aligned with Mr. Trump on a series of important foreign policy matters. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s refusal to resign despite his disagreements with Mr. Trump \u2014 and the president\u2019s reported dislike for the diplomat \u2014 may have been the reason senior administration officials leaked Mr. Kelly\u2019s plan this week to replace him.The debate over Mr. Tillerson\u2019s status is the latest outgrowth of a White House that has been beset by internal battles, high-level departures, indictments of two top former campaign officials and guilty pleas from a former national security adviser and a campaign adviser. All have contributed to a generalized sense of chaos that shows few signs of abating, even as the administration nears the completion of its first year in power.Mr. Tillerson is a phlegmatic former chief executive of Exxon Mobil whose personal net worth is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. His continued service to a White House that so obviously wants him gone has led to something of a cottage industry of speculation in Washington about his reasons for remaining.One theory, frequently repeated at the State Department, is that an early departure would cost Mr. Tillerson millions of dollars in taxes for assets he sold to take the diplomatic post. Tax experts have dismissed this notion.After being nominated, Mr. Tillerson was granted a so-called Certificate of Divestiture that allowed him to sell off Exxon stock without having to immediately pay capital gains taxes on those holdings. Two lawyers involved in issuing these documents said that the federal law creating this process \u2014 which is intended to eliminate a disincentive to qualified individuals joining the government \u2014 has no provision to withdraw this benefit, assuming that Mr. Tillerson completed the sale of his stocks before he left his government job.It is also believed that Mr. Tillerson has become so wedded to a State Department reorganization that he launched earlier this year that he will not leave until it is in place. That is expected to occur early next year.Mr. Tillerson has said the reorganization is his highest priority. He intends to slash the State Department\u2019s personnel by 8 percent and its budget by 31 percent. The cuts are needed, he has said many times, because many of the world\u2019s conflicts will soon be resolved. This view is dismissed as na\u00efve both within the State Department and the broader foreign policy community.Mr. Tillerson has made clear he has little use for much of the day-to-day diplomacy conducted by his work force. Diplomats across the State Department spent much of Thursday and Friday checking their phones for news announcing Mr. Tillerson\u2019s departure.His personal press aide, R.C. Hammond, is expected to leave his post this month, according to three people in the department with direct knowledge of the situation and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues.Mr. Hammond denied he would be leaving soon.\u201cYou are not so lucky,\u201d Mr. Hammond wrote in an email. \u201cYou still get to work with me.\u201dEric Lipton and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Food Do We Waste? Probably More Than You Think", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat\u2019s important for at least two reasons. The less the world wastes, the easier it will be to meet the food needs of the global population in coming years. Second, cutting back on waste could go a long way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.How do we manage to waste so much?Food waste is a glaring measure of inequality. In poor countries, most of the food waste is on the farm or on its way to market. In South Asia, for instance, half of all the cauliflower that\u2019s grown is lost because there\u2019s not enough refrigeration, according to Rosa Rolle, an expert on food waste and loss at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Tomatoes get squished if they are packed into big sacks. In Southeast Asia, lettuce spoils on the way from farms to city supermarkets. Very little food in poor countries is thrown out by consumers. It\u2019s too precious.\u201cAs you get higher and higher income, you get more and more profligacy in food waste,\u201d Paul A. Behrens, an assistant professor of energy and environmental sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\u201cIn the developed world, food is more abundant but it costs much less,\u201d Ms. Rolle said. \u201cIn a sense people don\u2019t value food for what it represents.\u201d\u201cFood waste \u2014 it\u2019s kind of the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Jason Clay, a senior vice president in charge of food policy at the World Wildlife Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s the most obvious place to start.\u201dMs. Rolle of the Food and Agriculture Organization said some of the most basic fixes are at the bottom end of the supply chain: Metal grain silos have helped against fungus ruining grain stocks in countries in Africa. In India, the F.A.O. is encouraging farmers to collect tomatoes in plastic crates instead of big sacks; they squish and rot less.Higher up the food chain, supermarkets are trying to make a dent by changing the way best-before labels are used \u2014 making them specific to various food categories to discourage consumers from throwing out food that is safe to eat \u2014 or trying to sell misshapen fruits and vegetables rather than discarding them.Some countries are trying to regulate food waste. France requires retailers to donate food that is at risk of being thrown out but is still safe to eat. European Union lawmakers are pushing for binding targets to curb food waste by 50 percent by 2030, echoing a United Nations development goal; negotiations have been underway since June. Some countries pushing back on the idea of continentwide targets.What if we just ate less?That would make a difference, but not as much as one might think. Dr. Behrens of Leiden University addressed the issue in a recent study: An earlier version of this article misidentified the group that Jason Clay works for. His is a senior vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, not the World Wildlife Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019ll Be Cheerful if It Kills Us", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHey, there are a lot of big movies opening up this month. One is a \u201cStar Wars\u201d installment and another involves Matt Damon becoming five inches tall.I am mentioning this just to prepare you for a short discussion of gun laws. There\u2019s been another big vote in Congress, and attention must be paid. But I promise to break up the story with totally unrelated cheerful information whenever possible.First, the news: On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would make it impossible for states to do anything about people who carry in guns from other states.We have seen this idea, known as \u201cconcealed carry reciprocity,\u201d before. It basically says gun owners only have to follow the laws of the state they hail from. Some states will give a permit to carry a concealed weapon to an 18-year-old. Some don\u2019t care about a record of stalking. Some don\u2019t have any rules at all \u2014 you\u2019re O.K. to pack a pistol if you can breathe.\u201cThe Republicans yell states\u2019 rights all the time, but they\u2019re hypocrites,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York. He claimed, in a phone interview, that the last time Congress passed a bill to impose the laws of one state on a different state \u201cit was the Fugitive Slave Act.\u201d We can look forward to more of this discussion since Nadler is now the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. It used to be John Conyers, but then there was that sexual harassment matter. Did you know \u201cTop Chef\u201d is coming back to TV this week? Perhaps you\u2019re tired of reality cooking contests. But imagine how relaxing it could be to spend an entire hour in a world where the worst possible thing that could happen involves under-seasoning. The gun bill\u2019s Republican handlers refused to permit an amendment banning bump stocks. Those are the devices that were used by the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas. But you knew that, right? We now live in a country where average people know what\u2019s required if you want to make an assault rifle work like a machine gun.The concealed-carry bill is also now chained to another measure aimed at making background checks more efficient. This modest, bipartisan plan came up after the Texas church shooting, when it turned out the gunman had a criminal background that should have precluded him from buying firearms.The Senate, which really likes the background check bill, is going to have to take the two of them up together. \u201cA cynical ploy,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of the co-sponsors. This year a Brussels griffon named Newton won the National Dog Show. His handler said he likes ice cream and is \u201chappy all the time.\u201dBlumenthal thinks the Senate Democrats can separate the two ideas, kill the concealed-carry bill and send the good background check plan back to the House for passage. This sounds promising, except for the part where it depends on the House Republican leadership taking a principled stand.On Wednesday, those leaders had everything well under control. So there was no suspense whatsoever and the gun debate took place in a near-empty House, with a half-dozen people hanging around waiting for their turn to say something \u2026 inevitable. Democrats decried the fact that the Republicans didn\u2019t want to work together. Republicans said carrying a gun made you safer.Liz Cheney of Wyoming declared the right to carry a concealed weapon is \u201cGod given.\u201d We will not pursue the question of What Would Jesus Pack. American Airlines, which accidentally gave its pilots Christmas vacation, has worked out a deal so there will actually be people available to fly the planes.Representative Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican who was in charge of getting the gun bill through the House, expressed dismay at the tenor of the debate, such as it was. \u201cShame on us,\u201d he said.Collins seemed particularly offended when a Democrat called him a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the National Rifle Association. Which seems a little impolite, if reasonably accurate. However, Collins did refer to the opposition as \u201ca group who enjoys killing babies.\u201d A family in Florida says a cat saved their kids from a rattlesnake. The cat\u2019s name is Oreo and he is recovering from a nasty bite.The Democrats complained that there were much better ways for the House to spend its time. Representative Alcee Hastings of Florida \u2014 home of Oreo! \u2014 suggested that instead of trying to mess with the states\u2019 right to do their own gun regulations, the members should be working on preventing a government shutdown. Which is right around the corner.Actually, it could come on Saturday. Followed by the deportation of 800,000 Dreamers, who were brought to the country illegally as children.And did you know the queen of England has invited Prince Harry\u2019s new fianc\u00e9e to Christmas dinner? This is highly unusual, but that Meghan Markle is so nice.Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s HNA Keeps Striking Foreign Deals as Banks Wince and Investors Flee", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With some investors in its bonds running for the exits and foreign banks increasingly skeptical about its prospects, HNA Group tried this week to reassure markets that it has access to the money it needs.At the same time, HNA, a vast but troubled Chinese conglomerate, is continuing the drive that helped cause its difficulties in the first place: completing billions of dollars in foreign deals.The competing efforts by a company that has symbolized China\u2019s growing wealth and global ambitions are a problem for the country\u2019s leaders. They want to end wasteful overseas spending by debt-laden Chinese companies, which in the case of HNA and some others have drawn growing regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe.China has yet to let one of its big conglomerates fail, and HNA is unlikely to be an exception. But it is testing how effectively China can curb such behavior, and how the country may deal with some companies that have gone too far.HNA said late Wednesday that it had talked to eight Chinese banks, including powerful and politically connected lenders like China Development Bank and China Construction Bank, about extending the conglomerate\u2019s credit lines next year. HNA said several of the banks planned to increase the amount of money it could borrow if needed.HNA made the disclosure as its problems continued to mount.The company\u2019s publicly traded bonds have fallen in recent days as worries grew among global investors about the challenges it faces. The bonds\u2019 declining value makes it more expensive for HNA to borrow, which analysts say the company must do to meet its obligations. It owes at least $21 billion to bondholders overseas and $16 billion in so-called syndicated loans from banks, according to data from the data provider Dealogic.\u201cThe situation is a lot worse now,\u201d said Chung Yuh Ang, a senior fixed-income analyst at iFast Corporation, an online investment platform. \u201cHNA is only able to pay its old debts by taking new ones.\u201dAfter a buying spree that began two years ago, HNA now has operations in countries from Germany to Australia, and in cities like Hong Kong, London and New York. People around the world take money from a financial institution it partially owns, fly on its planes and sleep in its hotels.In many instances, HNA has paid dearly for its acquisitions.\u201cHNA has bought things at clearly high prices,\u201d said Gordon Orr, the former Asia chairman at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. \u201cThe auctions they won haven\u2019t been by a dollar but by miles.\u201dAt a news media event in Beijing on Nov. 28, HNA\u2019s chief executive, Adam Tan, discussed the possibility that the company would sell some assets, like those related to real estate, which do not fall under the most strategically important investments recently outlined by President Xi Jinping.\u201cWe will not invest in anything the government does not support,\u201d Mr. Tan said at the event, which was hosted by Caijing Magazine.HNA is nonetheless pressing to complete its pending deals, even as regulators from Washington to Brussels to Switzerland grow increasingly skeptical.A lawsuit filed last week in a New York state court by Ness Technologies, a company that HNA tried to acquire, accused the Chinese company of dooming the deal by not trying hard enough to address questions from officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group that scrutinizes foreign purchases of domestic companies. HNA\u2019s ownership structure attracted a number of questions from committee officials, the suit says, but the company\u2019s answers undermined its credibility.In a statement, HNA said it \u201cbelieves this lawsuit is baseless and without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201dGuang Yang, the chief executive of HNA Capital, the subsidiary that has agreed to buy SkyBridge, said the firm was \u201ccommitted to closing the transaction with SkyBridge as soon as possible.\u201dIn Germany, HNA\u2019s proposed acquisition of shares in Deutsche Bank, a major global lender, has drawn questions. The European Central Bank is considering opening an inquiry into whether HNA is a qualified owner of its 10 percent stake in Deutsche Bank, according to a person with knowledge of the procedure who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The central bank has the authority to examine an investor if it appears that the investor could exert significant influence over management.Germany\u2019s financial markets watchdog, BaFin, is also examining whether HNA fulfilled its reporting requirements as it increased its stake in the bank, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank, the European Central Bank and BaFin declined to comment.A Swiss regulator has gone a step further than its counterparts in Germany and the United States.Last month, the Swiss Takeover Board cited HNA for providing false information about its complicated share structure when it acquired Gategroup Holding, a Swiss airline catering and logistics company.Although the Swiss takeover board has no enforcement powers, it asked Ernst & Young to conduct a further inquiry, which could lead to litigation in the future.\u201cWe cooperated fully with the Swiss Takeover Board\u2019s inquiry,\u201d HNA said in a statement, adding that it would \u201crespect its authority in this matter.\u201dJack Ewing in Frankfurt contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "The Bitcoin Boom: In Code We Trust", "Date": "2017-12-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet as Bitcoin continues to grow, there\u2019s reason to think something deeper and more important is going on. Bitcoin\u2019s rise may reflect, for better or worse, a monumental transfer of social trust: away from human institutions backed by government and to systems reliant on well-tested computer code. It is a trend that transcends finance: In our fear of human error, we are putting an increasingly deep faith in technology.What gives the Bitcoin bubble significance is that, like \u201990s tech, it is part of something much larger than itself. More and more we are losing faith in humans and depending instead on machines. The transformation is more obvious outside of finance. We trust in computers to fly airplanes, help surgeons cut into our bodies and simplify daily tasks, like finding our way home. In this respect, finance is actually behind: Where we no longer feel we can trust people, we let computer code take over.Bitcoin is part of this trend. It was, after all, a carnival of human errors and misfeasance that inspired the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, namely, the financial crisis. Banks backed by economically powerful nations had been the symbol of financial trustworthiness, the gold standard in the post-gold era. But they revealed themselves as reckless, drunk on other people\u2019s money, holding extraordinarily complex assets premised on a web of promises that were often mutually incompatible. To a computer programmer, the financial system still looks a lot like untested code with weak debugging that puts way too much faith in the idea that humans will behave properly. As with any bad software, it can be expected to crash when conditions change.We might add that major governments \u2014 the issuers of currency, the guarantors of banks and enforcers of contracts \u2014 do not always inspire confidence. Governments can be tempted to print money recklessly or seize wealth brazenly from their citizens \u2014 Venezuelan hyperinflation and Indian demonetization are recent examples. But even the most trusted governments can be dubious. Europe, riddled by internal struggles among states, is still in shock about the planned departure of Britain from the European Union. China is a secretive authoritarian state that can lash out against its citizens and rivals when it feels insecure. The United States, perhaps the main guarantor of world solvency, is some $20 trillion in debt, constantly on the verge of default and headed by a serial bankruptee who prizes unpredictability. It is little wonder that the world\u2019s citizens might be looking for alternatives.This all helps explain the popularity of Bitcoin as an asset independent of government, mainstream banks and their various shenanigans. But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a \u201cblockchain,\u201d a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn\u2019t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested.This isn\u2019t to idealize Bitcoin. Despite its virtual nature, it is still a human institution, facing its own misdeeds and governance problems. Odds are that Bitcoin may never function well as a general medium of exchange (something you can buy things with) because of its wild fluctuations, but might work fine as a store of value that you can sell. It may, like Netscape circa 1995, be portending changes to come. But Bitcoin has captured something. As much as we may love other humans, it is now in code we trust.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

His decision to step down ended a standstill arrangement between the company and the Icahn Group.\u201cThe CEO is the most important person in the company. We believe Xerox still has potential, but it will go the way of Kodak if there aren\u2019t major changes. The times have changed but not the old guard that controls the board,\u201d Mr. Icahn said.\u201cCorporate actions taken by Xerox, though commendable, are no match for the ravages of the digital world. Selling the company may be the logical next move.\u201dIn 2016, Shazam had about $54 million in revenue and $4.9 million in net losses, according to public filings in Britain, where the company is based. That performance was an improvement over 2015, when the company reported $47 million in revenue and $22 million in losses.Apple likely wants Siri to do what both Amazon and Google are working on: help the user figure out the world around them, and also sell them content.

Its statement:\u201cElliott\u2019s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda.

{"Headline": "Is Trump Driving the Stock Market Rally?", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "Advertisement\n\u201cHighest stock market ever!\u201d President Trump boasted last week. By his own reckoning, Wall Street\u2019s rally since his election is proof of the economic potency of his presidency.But is Mr. Trump really delivering what investors expected? To answer that question, we assembled a set of Trump Policy Indexes. They offer a measure of Wall Street investors\u2019 beliefs about the impact of his policies on businesses.Until late November, the date of the last available data, the index showed that Mr. Trump had been largely frustrated in helping the firms and industries he was expected to \u2014 in short, he may not have had as big an impact on the market as he claims for himself. The Bulls were, on average, not far ahead of the Bears \u2014 perhaps investors had unrealistic ideas of how easy it would be for Mr. Trump to push his agenda and how effective he would be at doing it.But in the final days of November, with Mr. Trump and Republicans on the verge of a tax cut bill, the index rallied \u2014 not to the optimistic levels seen early in Mr. Trump\u2019s term, but back above its pre-election level.In our policy graphs, which measure whether markets expect Mr. Trump to follow up on his campaign talking points, important events are noted, like the Senate's rejection of health care repeal. Sometimes these move markets, but at least as often they do not \u2014 many political events are well anticipated by investors and their effects factored in well ahead of any politician\u2019s announcement or bill\u2019s passage.To be clear, these indexes do not measure whether what Mr. Trump is doing is good or bad for the economy as a whole, but rather his effect on corporate profits.All charts are drawn at the same scale.Trump speech to joint session of CongressFEB. 28Comey firedMAY 9Comey testimonyJUNE 7Manafort indictmentOCT. 30Stocks that went upwith Trump\u2019s election+10%DEC. 1:+3%0\u20133%Stocks that went downwith Trump\u2019s election\u201310%THAN STOCKS OVERALLNov. 8,2016Jan.2017Feb.Mar.AprilMayJuneJulyAug.Sept.Oct.Nov.Dec.1The market expects Mr. Trump, whose saber rattling on trade continues, to help firms in import-exposed industries, presumably by disrupting free-trade agreements.The America First Index has often moved in the opposite direction from other components of the Trump Bulls index.

{"Headline": "When Forecasters Get It Wrong: Always", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts \u2014 global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers \u2014 the experts got the year wrong.They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump\u2019s promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher.Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade.The forecasting misses of 2017 reflect mistakes humans have been making since we started thinking about the future. Every forecaster knows that economies rise and fall constantly, oscillating around a long-term trend line. Yet forecasts typically extrapolate current trends on a straight line, so the vision of tomorrow closely resembles today, often implausibly so. A year ago forecasters thought 2017 would look like 2016; instead the world economy had its best year since the financial crisis of 2008.The weakness of straight-line forecasts explains why the consensus of leading economists has consistently missed big turns. They have not predicted a single United States recession since the Federal Reserve began keeping such records a half-century ago, and missed many revivals, including the unusually broad global expansion of 2017.Few dare predict big shifts, so they tinker at the margins. And once an economy gets labeled \u201cmiraculous\u201d or \u201chopeless,\u201d the stereotype sticks. Japan had gone cold for so long few experts could imagine it warming up in 2017, but it did. After long slumps, \u201cOld Man Europe,\u201d Russia and Brazil also recovered much faster than expected. In part, these economies were just rebounding toward their long-term average or, as economists say, \u201creverting to the mean.\u201dEconomic stereotypes are reinforced by political biases, like Europe\u2019s ingrained fear of extreme nationalism. In early 2017, forecasters took rising poll numbers for nationalists, extrapolated them into the future and imagined formerly fringe right-wingers gaining influence and setting off a eurozone crisis. Instead, the center held, and sheer relief helped propel the surprise economic recovery.Forecasters are prone to focus on a single story line, particularly one as compelling as angry populism. The consensus view figured Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans would increase growth in the United States, while his protectionist threats would undercut the rest of the world. Most forecasters share the establishment disdain for Mr. Trump, yet few paused to consider whether a leader they see as inept and divisive could deliver all this as fast as he promised.He didn\u2019t, and the widely hyped \u201cTrump Bump\u201d barely surfaced in 2017. Yes, the United States economy grew around 2 percent and generated jobs at a healthy pace. But both trends date to well before Mr. Trump. Liberals who thought Mr. Trump would induce a global recession proved even farther off the mark.If one were to avoid the straight-line projections, political biases and single factors that so often distort forecasts, what would a 2018 forecast look like? Not like the consensus, which is euphoric over the current combo of high growth and low inflation. Usually staid Wall Street economists are giving their 2018 forecasts headlines like \u201cBoom Shaka-laka-laka\u201d and \u201cAs Good as It Gets.\u201d Inspired by a cocksure consensus, investors are holding less money in cash than they ever have before \u2014 meaning they are all-in on risky investments.Confidence this solid is a warning sign of complacency. For one, gross domestic product growth is at the top end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade, so it is more likely to slip than accelerate. That should be sobering for every major power, including Trump\u2019s America. But please, it\u2019s not all about him. For better or worse, Mr. Trump had less impact on the global economy than most experts expected in 2017. The lesson \u2014 the inevitable rarely happens, the unexpected often does \u2014 applies as well to forecasting 2018.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Despite Internal Review, Justice Department Officials Say Congress Needs to Act on Bump Stocks", "Date": "2017-12-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Department officials have indicated they do not believe the department can regulate the sale of gun bump stocks without congressional action, underscoring concern that an ongoing administrative review into that question is little more than an effort to slow-roll a politically divisive issue.But private and public comments from Justice Department officials following the October shooting suggest there is little appetite within the agency to regulate bump stocks, regardless of pressure from the Trump administration. Critics worry that whatever energy there is will fade over the holiday season.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and co-author of a bill to ban the devices, noted that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said \u201cthat current law does not allow the agency to ban or regulate bump-fire stocks.\u201d The A.T.F. is the lead enforcement agency on the issue within the Justice Department.\u201cThe A.T.F. director recently said the same thing to local police chiefs,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for another review. It\u2019s hard to believe this is anything other than another way for Republicans to stall congressional action.\u201dWyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, said \u201cthe attorney general has stated clearly that we will go through the regulatory process that is required by law to determine whether or not certain bump stock devices are covered by the prohibition on the possession of firearm parts used exclusively in converting a weapon into a machine gun.\u201d\u201cWe are committed to a deliberate and thorough review,\u201d he added.The A.T.F. referred all questions regarding the bump stock review to the Justice Department.Thomas Brandon, the acting director of the A.T.F., told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month that it was a \u201cpossibility\u201d that bump stocks could be considered as a restricted device under standing regulations that ban machine guns, and that the A.T.F. could regulate them without action from Congress.\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t a possibility at the end, we wouldn\u2019t initiate this process,\u201d Mr. Brandon said of the review.But since the Las Vegas shooting, Mr. Brandon and other A.T.F. officials have indicated repeatedly \u2014 both publicly and in private \u2014 that they do not believe that possibility exists. Instead, they say, legislation from Congress will be required.In the week following the shooting, Justice Department officials \u2014 including the head of the department\u2019s Firearms and Ammunition Technology division \u2014 met behind closed doors with Senate Judiciary Committee staff to discuss bump stock devices. According to some who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it, the Justice Department officials said they would not be able to take devices off shelves without new legislation from Congress.Later in October, speaking to police chiefs at a law enforcement conference in Philadelphia, Mr. Brandon of the A.T.F. said his agency did not currently have the regulatory power to control sales of bump stocks. According to a letter sent to Congress by Art Acevedo, the Houston police chief, Mr. Brandon told the conference that new legislation would be required to allow them to regulate the device.\u201cI was seated next to the A.T.F. director at a recent meeting of Major Cities Chiefs when he advised the chiefs that new legislation will be required,\u201d Mr. Acevedo wrote.Despite the misgivings of its own officials, the Justice Department is still opting to work the bump stocks issue through the A.T.F. That route avoids the messier politics of seeking legislation in Congress, which could pit the administration against the powerful gun lobby.The National Rifle Association has said it believes the bump stock question should be handled through the A.T.F., prompting once-amenable Republican lawmakers to back off legislative fixes.The A.T.F. announced on Dec. 5 that it had sent a notice to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget about the policy review. Once posted in the federal registry, it will be open for comment from the public and gun industry for 30 days. It is expected to be posted next week.Advertisement"}

Microsoft\u2019s highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today\u2019s dollars, was roughly $901 billion.Apple\u2019s value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.But Apple\u2019s dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric \u2014 Apple\u2019s weight in the current stock market \u2014 IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000.

That would have been enough to place it in third place, without taking inflation into account.But over extended periods, the compounding effects of inflation are powerful. That $647 billion translates into a nearly 40 percent increase in value in November 2017 dollars. It has probably gained slightly more since November, because inflation has remained positive.General Electric has been shrinking lately as it restructures. But in inflation-adjusted terms, its August 2000 market cap is still growing and it moved up one spot on the list, to third place. Cisco and Intel moved into fourth and fifth place, based on their soaring shares during the dot-com boom.Even more than the first list, the inflation-adjusted ranking provides a reminder of the stock market highs during these two exuberant periods \u2014 the dot-com era in 1999 and 2000, and the bull market that is still underway.Seven of the all-time biggest companies reached their peaks in October or November, the most current data in this ranking, and 12 of the companies did so from late 1999 to early 2001.Exxon Mobil is the only company to have achieved a top-20 market cap unaided by the momentum of one of these rising stock market eras. In inflation-adjusted terms, Exxon\u2019s peak occurred in July 2007, several months before its pinnacle in nominal 2007 dollars.Share of the total market since 1980 NO.

Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.In fact, although Apple\u2019s market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.In December 1985, IBM\u2019s shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)In November, Apple\u2019s shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more.  Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.Share of the total market since 1925NO.

In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM\u2019s market cap was far larger than any other company\u2019s, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation:  Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor\u2019s excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index \u201cbecause S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index,\u201d as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, \u201cStocks for the Long Run.\u201dConsidered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendent of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt\u2019s administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records.

The decision suggested that change would not be immediate, or happen across the board.Mr. Shin\u2019s father, Shin Kyuk-ho, 95, who founded Lotte, was sentenced to four years in prison in the case, according to Yonhap. But the court, taking his age into consideration, did not order his imprisonment. Other relatives of the chairman were acquitted or given lighter sentences than those sought by prosecutors.The country\u2019s authorities have long been accused of using special treatment with business titans who break laws. Critics say officials shy away from harsher punishments to avoid threatening economic growth.Mr. Lee, the Samsung heir and de facto head of its lucrative electronics unit, and top aides were convicted in August of using bribes to cement the Lee family\u2019s control over Samsung\u2019s businesses.

{"Headline": "Golden State Warriors\u2019 Go-to Guy Doesn\u2019t Play a Minute", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Late in the fourth quarter of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday night, Eric Housen sensed that something was amiss as he sorted through gear in the visiting locker room at the Smoothie King Center.The Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant and the Pelicans\u2019 DeMarcus Cousins had just been ejected for saying some tough things to each other, and Housen heard a commotion coming from the hallway outside the locker room. He went to investigate.He plans the players\u2019 meals and manages their schedules and troubleshoots their problems and tries hard to limit himself to two energy drinks a day.\u201cCaffeine is probably my biggest thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe training staff is always trying to find me healthy alternatives.\u201d\u201cShut the door! Shut the door!\u201d the officers shouted at one another up and down the hallway.Housen, meanwhile, ran ahead of Cousins and stood in his path. Cousins, who is 6 feet 11 and 270 pounds but somehow seems even more enormous when angry, was eventually persuaded by security to return to his own locker room, and Housen (5-10, 185) resumed the far more pedestrian chore of packing equipment.He reflected on his act of valor/lunacy.\u201cI figure if they see little old me out there, maybe they won\u2019t do something,\u201d he said.Housen, 44, whom everyone calls E, is a behind-the-scenes force for the Warriors, who have employed him \u2014 with the exception of one season, when he followed Chris Mullin to the Indiana Pacers \u2014 since 1985, when he started as a ball boy. He was in seventh grade.\u201cMost important guy in the organization,\u201d the assistant coach Bruce Fraser said.Housen said he had not missed a game since becoming a full-time staffer in 1999. For three of those seasons, back when his title was equipment manager, he lived in the team\u2019s practice facility and slept on a cot. He has taken three days off since the start of last season. He describes his wife, Codi, who is expecting their first child, as an understanding spouse. (He has a home now.) He still cannot grasp the twin concepts of weekends and vacations.\u201cOh, I don\u2019t pay attention to that stuff,\u201d he said.During his playing days with the Warriors, Mullin would recruit Housen to help him organize off-season workouts and pickup games. Housen would show up at some high school in the middle of July with nets, mops, towels and, after investigating their sizes, sneakers for Mullin\u2019s friends. He could not help but treat it like a playoff game.The day before the Warriors played the Pelicans, they were in Miami to face the Heat in the first of back-to-back games \u2014 and Housen was in hyperkinetic form two hours ahead of the tipoff.\u201cWhere\u2019s the weight room, E?\u201d he asked Housen.Housen returned to the loading dock to double-check that the team\u2019s luggage \u2014 all 127 pieces \u2014 was on a truck and ready to go to the airport for the team\u2019s flight to New Orleans later that night. Armed with a flashlight, he inspected each bag with the help of the driver. Only one appeared to be missing: a suitcase that belonged to David West.\u201cHe always takes a late bus, so I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not back here toward the end of the truck,\u201d Housen said as he rummaged around in the dark. \u201cHere it is!\u201dOnce the game began, Housen sat on the floor in front of the Warriors\u2019 bench. He collected warm-up jerseys and towels. After one possession, a ball boy for the Heat mopped up a wet spot \u2014 except that it still looked wet to Housen. So he scampered onto the court and used a towel to wipe it up by hand.\u201cYou just try to anticipate whatever the guys need,\u201d he said.Housen spent the second half in the locker room, where he supervised the caterers who were assembling dinner. He called the hotel in New Orleans with the team\u2019s estimated arrival. He double-checked \u201cout of my own fear and paranoia,\u201d he said, that the team\u2019s breakfast spread would be available until 1 p.m. And he called ahead to the driver of another equipment truck that was set to meet them at the airport in New Orleans.At 10:56 p.m., about an hour after the Warriors finished off their victory against the Heat, their private plane was rumbling down the runway in Miami. Housen took a seat and sent his daily group text, complete with bus and airplane emojis, that detailed the team\u2019s schedule for the next day. He glanced at his watch and checked his stats: He had walked 13.2 miles and taken 25,347 steps. He was bummed that he had not managed to squeeze in a workout.When the plane landed in New Orleans, Housen was the first one off. He met an equipment truck that had pulled up to the belly of the plane and began pulling luggage off a conveyor belt.\u201cCan\u2019t this thing go faster?\u201d he said. \u201cSpeed it up!\u201dAfter a pair of buses delivered the players and staff to their downtown hotel (12:37 a.m.), Housen headed to the arena, where he spent the next three hours unloading equipment in the visiting locker room. He considered spending what remained of the night on a training table.\u201cYou can make a little bed with some towels,\u201d he said.But Housen wanted to be back at the hotel so he could check in with the chef before any of the players arrived for breakfast. He was still nervous about breakfast.\u201cA lot of my job happens,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen people aren\u2019t there.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, before the game against the Pelicans, Housen went grocery shopping, which is something he does each day that the Warriors are on the road.\u201cThey\u2019re not drinking Keystone,\u201d Housen said.Housen knows his players\u2019 habits and daily rhythms. He knows, for example, that Thompson will wear the same socks until he puts holes in them, so Housen will preemptively swap them out. He knows that Nick Young wants the insoles removed from his sneakers. He knows that JaVale McGee has the largest feet on the team (size 19). He knows that Curry has a shoe calendar \u2014 yes, a shoe calendar, to tell him what sneakers to wear for which game \u2014 and Housen knows that because Under Armour sends it straight to him.He knows that some of the players have discriminating taste when it comes to bottled water, so he stocks the refrigerator in the visiting locker room with three or four brands. He knows that if Ron Adams, the longtime assistant, indulges in an occasional beer on the plane, he likes Peroni. But Housen also knows that Coach Steve Kerr prefers Modelo Especial.He knows which players want hotel rooms away from the elevators. He knows that McGee is a vegetarian and that Curry avoids gluten. He knows that Zaza Pachulia likes to change into a fresh jersey at halftime. And he knows that Pachulia does not like to leave the arena with damp hair.\u201cHe\u2019s the only guy I\u2019ve ever had who uses a blow dryer,\u201d Housen said.So Housen tucks one into Pachulia\u2019s locker before every game \u2014 and keeps a spare on hand in case the first one breaks.\u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t make me high maintenance,\u201d Pachulia, the team\u2019s starting center, said, \u201cbut I do like to dry my hair.\u201d\u201cI wish I could get them a bucket or a rebound or draw up a play,\u201d Housen said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do any of that, so I try to work as hard as I can for them from here.\u201dIt is not a stretch, Kerr said, to suggest that Housen affects team performance. He eliminates stress, and the players benefit from more rest because everything is on time.\u201cIt seems like he spends his entire life setting stuff up for everyone else,\u201d Kerr said.When Pachulia\u2019s two young sons joined the team as ball boys on a recent road trip, he was glad they were around \u2014 in part so they could offer Housen some help.\u201cAt least E could take a break and not have to get up during timeouts so much,\u201d Pachulia said.Against the Pelicans, the Warriors won again, albeit it with some drama. Cousins and Durant had their confrontation, and Curry left the game with a sprained ankle.But Housen was already planning for another late-night flight, this one to Charlotte for a game against the Hornets on Wednesday. More schedules to keep. More problems to solve. And another day for the busiest man in the N.B.A.Sam Hodgson contributed reporting from Miami and New Orleans.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Bot Stole Christmas: Toys Like Fingerlings Are Snapped Up and Resold", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFingerlings, those colorful chirping monkeys (and sloths and unicorns) that wrap around your finger, have become one of the most desired toys on holiday shopping lists.\u201cIf it\u2019s popular, it\u2019s going to be taken by bots and resold,\u201d said Omri Iluz, the co-founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm PerimeterX, in a phone interview.The bots work by constantly pinging retail websites, searching for sales and analyzing URLs.The moment an item is in stock, the software runs through the checkout process at a speed that is \u201ccompletely inhuman,\u201d said Mr. Iluz, whose company protects large retailers and other organizations from bot attacks.The bots are drawn to scarce items \u201clike sharks to blood\u201d and use web-scraping techniques to guess the ID of an unreleased product, PerimeterX explains on its website. That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses.It was an all-consuming job.\u201cI have had dreams about Fingerlings,\u201d she said.On Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25 minutes, Ms. Oliver said.\u201cThey are the only one that if I throw it up on social media I feel like my people have a chance to get it before it disappears,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had readers comment that they\u2019ve put the Fingerlings in their cart on the Walmart website and when they go to check out, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWalmart did not respond to a request for comment.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us says on its website that Fingerlings are available in its brick-and-mortar stores. When asked about the cyber bots, the retailer declined to comment, referring instead to a statement from Christin Fernandez, vice president for communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association that said retailers and suppliers \u201care working around the clock to make sure American families have access to the season\u2019s hottest items\u201d and are \u201ccommitted to taking precautions to mitigate fraud and illegal transactions.\u201dAmazon said Tuesday that it monitors bot buying activity, and attempts to limit the purchase of high-demand products.Target has also taken measures to deter resellers, said a company spokesman, Eddie Baeb, \u201cincluding quantity limits for purchases and technologies designed to help us monitor and prevent reseller activity.\u201dOther hot toys, like the Barbie Hello Dreamhouse, the L.O.L. Surprise! Doll and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition have also sold out, but are appearing on Amazon and eBay advertised at prices several times higher than retail.\u201cThe entire ecosystem breaks down,\u201d Mr. Iluz said. Bots are making legal purchases, but they don\u2019t become loyal customers, and they won\u2019t leave positive reviews.And customers get frustrated.\u201cWhen an advertised item is unavailable because of out-of-stocks, customers don\u2019t blame bots, they blame the retailer,\u201d Roger Beahm, a professor of marketing at the Wake Forest University School of Business, said in an email.On Sunday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, asked retail trade associations to take action.\u201cWhen it comes to purchasing products online, major retailers should put forth policies that will help prevent future Grinch bots from stealing the season\u2019s hottest toys,\u201d he said in a statement.Unusual purchases ought to raise a red flag said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.\u201cSay there\u2019s a suspicious order placed \u2014 for example a massive quantity at extreme speed \u2014 they should be able to have some human intervention in that transaction and potentially block the sale,\u201d Mr. Roefaro said in an email.David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Monday that the federation shares Mr. Schumer\u2019s concerns, \u201cand we look forward to working with him and all interested parties to strengthen enforcement against bad actors and take away the tools being used against innocent consumers, particularly during the holiday season.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who also co-sponsored the BOTS Act, said in a phone interview Tuesday that he aimed to introduce new legislation to combat the \u201cplague\u201d of bots that buy up toys, sneakers and other popular retail items.\u201cI think if there was a specific law it would encourage and empower the Federal Trade Commission or criminal investigators to go after them, and we might learn more about them and identify some of the specific culprits,\u201d he said.The yearly rush to buy the hottest toy is often guided by emotions, Mr. Beahm said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CNN Corrects a Trump Story, Fueling Claims of \u2018Fake News\u2019", "Date": "2017-12-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCNN on Friday corrected an erroneous report that Donald Trump Jr. had received advance notice from the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks about a trove of hacked documents that it planned to release during last year\u2019s presidential campaign.In fact, the email to Mr. Trump was sent a day after the documents, stolen from the Democratic National Committee, were made available to the general public. The correction undercut the main thrust of CNN\u2019s story, which had been seized on by critics of President Trump as evidence of coordination between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign.It was also yet another prominent reporting error at a time when news organizations are confronting a skeptical public, and a president who delights in attacking the media as \u201cfake news.\u201dThe report fueled theories about coordination between the Trump campaign and a foreign power, and stocks dropped after the news. In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s instruction to Mr. Flynn came after he was president-elect.Several news outlets, including Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, also inaccurately reported this week that Deutsche Bank had received a subpoena from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for President Trump\u2019s financial records.The president and his circle have not been shy about pointing out the errors.CNN\u2019s erroneous scoop, about the email to Donald Trump Jr., rocketed around cable news and social media on Friday morning. But it fell apart after The Washington Post reported that the email \u2014 which included a decryption key to access hacked documents \u2014 was dated Sept. 14, not Sept. 4, as CNN initially reported. WikiLeaks publicized links to the documents in question on Sept. 13.CNN said that its report had been based on information from two sources and vetted by the network\u2019s in-house fact-checking team. But both sources were apparently incorrect about the date of the message.\u201cThe new information indicates that the communication is less significant than CNN initially reported,\u201d CNN wrote in an updated article.There were lamentations on social media in the wake of CNN\u2019s error, as some press advocates worried that it could further erode trust in the media and gird the president\u2019s attacks.In June, CNN severed ties with three journalists after a botched report about ties between Russia and a Trump confidant, Anthony Scaramucci, who went on to briefly serve as the White House communications director.On Friday, the network said it would take no disciplinary action in this latest case, because the reporters, Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb, followed its editorial guidelines.

Inter Ikea, through a Dutch subsidiary, receives franchise fees equal to 3 percent of the revenue from Ikea stores worldwide, according to regulators. Although Ikea was founded in Sweden in 1943, the parent company is based in the Netherlands.European regulators are concerned in particular about a 2006 Dutch ruling that allowed Inter Ikea to send a significant part of its franchise profits, in the form of an annual license fee, to a company in Luxembourg, where it was not taxed.Over the years, Ikea has argued that its business structure was perfectly legal.\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedIncreasing optimism that the Republican tax overhaul will be signed into law this week has pushed shares of bank stocks to levels not hit since before the financial crisis.Goldman Sachs in a note Monday said lowering the corporate tax rate to 21 percent could lead to a 14 percent increase in earnings per share on average for banks.

{"Headline": "The Las Vegas Gunman Was Rich. Will His Wealth Go to the Victims?", "Date": "2017-12-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock stands out among American mass killers because of his wealth. He became a millionaire, according to his family, through the buying and selling of real estate and through skillful high-stakes gambling.His fortune is not big enough \u2014 perhaps $5 million, according to some estimates \u2014 to make a significant dent in the likely payouts from lawsuits and claims against Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate. But it is enough to prompt an unusual legal strategy by lawyers for some of Mr. Paddock\u2019s victims, who want to make sure the money is not depleted by legal expenses.The lawyers have asked a Nevada court to set up the estate so that the money can be distributed, without lawsuits, to families of the dead and those who were wounded in the attack. One idea being discussed is folding Mr. Paddock\u2019s assets into a fund already set up for victims, which has raised about $22 million. More than 500 people were injured and 58 others died after Mr. Paddock opened fire from an upper floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino at an outdoor country music festival in October.The lawyers also want the court to ensure that Mr. Paddock\u2019s heirs do not benefit from the estate and that they have no role in how it is managed. No will has been discovered and relatives do not believe he prepared one.Under Nevada law, the mother, Irene Hudson, 89, is entitled to the estate. But one of Mr. Paddock\u2019s three brothers, Eric Paddock, who lives in Orlando, said in an interview that the family supported the idea of disbursing the assets to victims.So far, several hundred victims have filed more than two dozen lawsuits, and a $45 million creditor\u2019s claim, against Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate; MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay; and Live Nation, the promoter of the festival. Should plaintiffs agree not to pursue their lawsuits against the Paddock estate, a complicated and potentially contentious issue will involve establishing criteria for who is eligible for payouts from the estate and how much.While payouts to victims of mass shootings have become standard practice, turning a dead perpetrator\u2019s estate into a fund for such a large number of victims is new territory.\u201cThere is no precedent here,\u201d said Alice Denton, a Nevada lawyer who is leading the effort to have Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate apportioned among victims to help cover expenses like medical bills.Ms. Denton, who represents five victims, added, \u201cMost mass killers have been indigent or had modest assets or none to speak of.\u201dThat was the case, for instance, with Omar Mateen, who fatally shot 49 people and wounded dozens of others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in June of last year. A victims fund for that shooting handed out $32 million.In 2011, the federal government auctioned off some of the belongings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, to provide some restitution to his victims and their families. He killed three people and wounded 28 others in a mail-bomb campaign that spanned 17 years before he was arrested in 1996.Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate is being sued for assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, personal financial losses, and medical bills, among other things. Part of the difficulty for lawyers when it comes to Mr. Paddock\u2019s case is assessing exactly how much his estate is worth. Law enforcement authorities most likely have an idea of the figure, but they have not publicly disclosed it since their investigation is still open.Victims\u2019 lawyers estimate that it could be worth more than $5 million. They acknowledge, though, that the figure is rough and based on news reports, and that a detailed accounting will be needed for a precise value.Eric Paddock said his older brother was a multimillionaire, but he doubts that the estate will end up being worth $5 million. He suspects his brother may have sold his stocks, emptied his bank accounts and disposed of the money somewhere before the attack.\u201cHe probably cashed out and threw it all in a Dumpster because it was his and that was Stephen,\u201d Eric Paddock said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t care.\u201dEric Paddock said that what would be left of his brother\u2019s assets \u2014 which includes two homes in Nevada \u2014 would perhaps total $500,000 to $1 million.A little more than two weeks before the shooting, Mr. Paddock had bought his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, an airplane ticket so she could visit her relatives in the Philippines. While she was there, he wired her thousands of dollars and told her to purchase a house for her and her family. Ms. Danley\u2019s lawyer did not respond to an email or phone call concerning what Ms. Danley might know about Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate.Eric Paddock said that he had told investigators that his brother became bothered that the gambling industry was no longer lavishing him with the same perks he had become accustomed to, and that he had complained to him about this. Eric said that he also informed authorities that Stephen had been despondent about no longer being able to fly planes after his medical certificate expired a number of years ago.Aaron C. Rouse, the top F.B.I. agent in Nevada, said that he expected the agency to release a report on the shooting before the tragedy\u2019s first anniversary. So far, no motive has surfaced.Despite the willingness of the family to help the victims, getting someone to oversee the estate has been fraught with complications.Five days after the shooting, lawyers for the son of a California man killed in the attack filed a petition asking that the public administrator of Clark County, Nev., John J. Cahill, be appointed to oversee the assets. In his county job, Mr. Cahill handles estates when there is no qualified person willing or able to do so.A week later, Mr. Cahill turned down the job, saying in court papers one reason was that his small staff would be overwhelmed.Two days before Mr. Cahill declined the post, a Nevada lawyer, Jonathan W. Barlow, asked the court to be named as an administrator to help victims making claims against the estate. Mr. Barlow was acting on behalf of Mr. Paddock\u2019s mother, who was entitled to the position but opted not to take it. A day later, though, after a falling-out with Eric Paddock, Mr. Barlow withdrew.Mr. Cahill has since said he would be willing to oversee the estate if the court decided he was the best choice.\u201cThere has been confusion and things remain in limbo,\u201d said Craig Eiland, a Texas lawyer who has been one of the main voices pushing for the estate to basically become a victims fund. He and the other lawyers behind the initiative have asked the court to appoint \u201can independent, neutral third party\u201d as an administrator.Mr. Eiland said that one of the primary goals was to protect the estate from the costs of defending against a multitude of wrongful death claims.This month, the husband and three children of a California woman, Keri Galvan, who was killed in the shooting, filed a creditor\u2019s claim against Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate. They are seeking a total of $45 million.In California, where many of the concertgoers had traveled from, at least nine additional lawsuits were filed for people injured in the shooting, those who witnessed the rampage and families of those killed.This month, Judge Gloria Sturman of Clark County District Court told lawyers during a hearing to devise a plan for dealing with the claims so that the estate could be preserved. The judge, who is expected to name an administrator at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 15, instructed the lawyers to present the plan to her by the end of January.Ms. Denton said that she hoped the lawyers would also discuss other possibilities for the estate, like whether to fold the assets into a victims fund that has raised about $22 million.Jeff Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, which is helping to administer the fund, said that he had not had any discussions with the lawyers about Mr. Paddock\u2019s estate. Mr. Dion said that adding the estate to the victims fund could have mixed results.\u201cThe good thing is that it is a way to distribute those funds outside of litigation so there would not be legal fees,\u201d he said. \u201cThe drawbacks and reasons that might make it incompatible is that those not eligible under our protocols would be shut out.\u201dThose who are eligible are families of the deceased, those who were physically injured and required hospitalization for one or more nights, and those whose physical injuries were treated in an emergency room or on an outpatient basis no later than Oct. 11.Rachel Sheppard, 26, who came close to death after being shot three times by Mr. Paddock, said that money from his estate would help to ease the burden of what will be huge medical bills.One of the bullets is still in her body. She has had four surgeries and was in intensive care for almost two weeks. Although Ms. Sheppard, who lives near Bakersfield, Calif., has health insurance, it does not cover many things. Her doctors have told her she cannot work for another year.\u201cThey don\u2019t know what the future looks like for me,\u201d she said, \u201cand whether I will need additional surgeries.\u201dAdam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Fall of ISIS, Iraq\u2019s Second-Largest City Picks Up the Pieces", "Date": "2017-12-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMosul JournalMOSUL, Iraq \u2014 In the heat of the late summer sun, weeks after the end of one of the largest urban battles since World War II, a high school principal trekked from his home in east Mosul to the west bank of the Tigris River to confront the ruins of his life\u2019s work.Bordering Mosul\u2019s Old City, his stately Ottoman-era school, where generations of Iraqi political and military leaders studied, lay in ruin. Two campus buildings had been leveled by American coalition airstrikes during the battle against the Islamic State. Century-old stone walls were scarred from shrapnel. The once-gleaming computer lab, library and theater, which in 2014 presented a student production of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d were burned by retreating Islamic State fighters.The scale of devastation at the place he hoped to mold Iraq\u2019s next generation of leaders drew a flutter of despair from the principal, Muthana Saleh. But then he harnessed the traits that residents of Mosul are famous for: ingenuity and industriousness. This month, thanks in part of volunteers and an Iraqi donor, he is planning to restart classes for 450 students.\u201cWe solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe find resources. We find a way. It\u2019s the spirit of Mosul.\u201dBut the battle for Mosul lasted nearly nine months, killing thousands of people, displacing nearly a million and leaving entire districts in smoldering heaps of rubble.Around 600,000 people remain displaced, and approximately 60,000 homes are uninhabitable. The city\u2019s business and government sectors are crippled, with at least 20,000 commercial and government buildings destroyed, according to aerial images commissioned by the United Nations.The west side in particular sustained apocalyptic damage. It took six months of grinding street-by-street battles and aerial bombardment to free the area, including the labyrinthine Old City, where the militants made their last stand.\u201cMosul is a tale of two cities,\u201d said Lise Grande, the humanitarian coordinator in Iraq and head of the United Nations Development Program. \u201cIn east Mosul, more than 95 percent of people are home. On the west side, it\u2019s a completely different picture. Yet people are rolling up their sleeves and determined to get their lives back.\u201dSince the summer, the international community has spent about $400 million to help restore electricity, water and medical services, and donor countries, along with the Iraqi government, are struggling to create and finance a comprehensive multibillion-dollar redevelopment plan.In the interim, Muslawis \u2014 as Mosul residents are called \u2014 have mustered their own resources and philanthropic spirit to breathe new life into the city.The highways leading to Mosul are clogged with flatbed trucks bringing in commercial goods and construction materials. On both sides of the river, gleaming rows of washing machines, space heaters and children\u2019s bikes are for sale. Restaurants, especially those with family sections, are doing a roaring business.On Nov. 30, a Mosul nonprofit organized a marathon and shorter foot races for children, an event that drew around 4,000 people.\u201cWe are excited to change the atmosphere of Mosul,\u201d said Feras Khalil, an engineer supervising the reconstruction of Fountain Square, a park along a main commercial street on Mosul\u2019s east side. \u201cWe want to give the opportunity for our neighbors to breathe fresh air after defeating Daesh,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.On the east side, the sprawling Mosul University campus hums with activity from the 30,000 students \u2014 men and women \u2014 who are attending classes this fall. Hundreds of students from other parts of Iraq have also re-enrolled, a testament, they say, to their parents\u2019 confidence about security.For centuries, Mosul has been a center of learning. In the Middle Ages, scholars here pioneered surgical techniques and medical instruments still used by contemporary doctors. The university remains highly regarded for its medical and science graduates.During Islamic State rule, however, most classes ground to a halt, both because the group forbade the teaching of what it considered sinful or irrelevant subjects, like art and philosophy, and because professors and students were afraid to venture out of their homes.The campus, like most areas of Mosul, shows scars of conflict. United States coalition airstrikes destroyed four science buildings that the Islamic State had been using as weapons research labs. University administrators say they have no idea how to replace the millions of books from their library, a repository for old manuscripts and research materials, that were burned by the Islamic State, or hundreds of thousands of dollars in science equipment.Yet staff and students have tackled smaller tasks on their own.Professor Intisar Abdel Rada, who has taught accounting for 18 years, helped supervise a group of professors and students who raised money to repair ceilings and electrical wiring in her department\u2019s classrooms, and cleaned and painted lecture halls, work that enabled classes to resume last month. \u201cIt\u2019s like we were dead but have been resuscitated,\u201d she said while rushing between her lectures.A few miles away, at Al Khansaa Pediatric and Maternity Hospital, the director, Dr. Jamal Younis, worked throughout the summer with international aid organizations such as Doctors Without Borders to solve critical needs, like installing generators and incubators to keep the city\u2019s only maternity ward and pediatric surgery theaters operational.He still faces frequent gaps in the daily operating budget \u2014 in October an average of four babies were born at Al Khansaa each day \u2014 but the staff struggled to maintain stocks like surgical gloves and food for patients.For now, his problem solver is Dr. Saad Salih, a surgeon who counts members of Mosul\u2019s wealthiest families as friends.When medicine earmarked for the hospital was stuck in Erbil about 60 miles away, a phone call to a local businessman raised the $500 needed to rent two flatbed trucks to transport the drugs to Mosul. Calls to pharmacy owners have brought in donations of bandages and surgical supplies.Prominent Iraqis outside Mosul have also pitched in. Dr. Salih said a group of British Iraqis had sent funds for hospital supplies. Last week, a man delivered an envelope with $1,200 from a Baghdad-based surgeon who was born in Mosul and wanted to help her hometown.\u201cWe lived through decades where people did not trust each other in Iraq,\u201d Dr. Salih said. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth and a big challenge facing us now. But somehow, now it\u2019s different. People really are motivated to help one another.\u201dAcross the river, in the Old City, the few residents lucky enough to have their homes still standing say they also are invigorated by community spirit.Talal Muhammad, a father of four, has run a small shop in the Old City\u2019s Bab al Bedh district selling dairy goods for 30 years. A Muslawi philanthropist gave him the equivalent of $850 last month to help repair his refrigerators. Those funds helped kick-start a flickering commercial renaissance. Now, amid the rubble, nine shops have reopened.Intisar Mehdi, the matriarch of her 20-member family, said she was the last person to leave the during the fighting this summer and the first to return. She immediately put her four children and 10 grandchildren to work cleaning the ashes and rubble from their house and fix piping to their well.A month ago, she says, her winding lane was quiet and isolated. Now, it\u2019s filled with noise from an army of toddlers and the chatter of housewives exchanging information about developments in the city.About a mile away, at the Sharqiya Secondary School, Mr. Saleh, the principal, is using the challenge of rebuilding as a teachable moment, reflecting the motto that hangs on one of the school\u2019s old stone walls: \u201cThe misfortunes of some can be turned into an advantage for others.\u201dSince August, Mr. Saleh has been fielding calls from dozens of teachers and hundreds of parents pleading to resume classes.He persuaded the police commander responsible for his area to secure the school grounds from bombs and other dangerous material.In October, he organized teachers and administrators in shifts to clear rubble and burned equipment from several buildings. The police commander then put him in touch with a Baghdad-based charity that wanted to donate building equipment.Now, Mr. Saleh says, he will transform his 450 waiting students into a volunteer work force. This week, they plan to install doors and windows in 10 classrooms, enough space to start classes by the end of the year, he says.\u201cNone of us want to lose any more time,\u201d said Ahmed Jassim, 20, who had to delay his senior year of high school during the Islamic State\u2019s occupation. \u201cOur city has major problems that are too huge for us to solve. But this part, we can manage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Russian Ploy: Competing Extradition Requests", "Date": "2017-12-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian spam kingpin had long been in the cross hairs of the F.B.I., and agents finally got their shot when the man scheduled a vacation in Spain. At the agency\u2019s request, Spanish security officers in April arrested the man, Pyotr Y. Levashov, who is accused of stuffing untold millions of inboxes with ads for pornography, pills and penny stocks.But then the Russian authorities sprang a trap of their own, filing an extradition request with the Spanish authorities for a crime they said Mr. Levashov had committed in Russia years ago. Currently, he is languishing in a Spanish jail, but soon the authorities will have to decide which extradition request to honor: the United States\u2019 or Russia\u2019s.This was by no means the first time that Russia had filed a competing extradition request. Far-fetched as it may seem, the Russians\u2019 tactic has in several instances prevented Russians suspected of being computer criminals from being deported to the United States while detained in Europe.The tactic has raised suspicions that the Russian authorities are more interested in derailing American investigations and possibly protecting criminals they find useful than they are in fighting cybercrime.\u201cPeople always ask me about this,\u201d Timofey S. Musatov, a Moscow lawyer whose Russian client is the subject of competing extradition requests. \u201cIt\u2019s the most common question.\u201dThree similar cases are pending in courts in Greece, Spain and the Czech Republic. In two of the three, either the defendants\u2019 lawyers or relatives have said that their cases have some bearing on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States. While that may be true, they have not provided any proof.Their theory is that with the politically charged atmosphere in the United States over the election meddling, the accused could not possibly get a fair trial there, so they should be returned to Russia.In accordance with extradition treaties in all three countries, Russian lawyers say, the decision about where to send the accused resides with a government minister. That opens the prospect of the United States\u2019 being powerless to stop the return to Russia of a suspect who may be able to offer valuable information on Russian meddling in the election.The Russian case, Mr. Musatov said, surfaced soon after Mr. Vinnik\u2019s detention in Athens, possibly because the Russian police had read about his client in news reports and decided to investigate him.\u201cI\u2019m a procedural lawyer who works with documents and law,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t work in the category of conspiracy theories.\u201d Mr. Vinnik has no known links to election hacking, he said.\u201cThis norm is in effect everywhere,\u201d said Vladimir V. Makeyev, a lawyer for another Russian cybercrime suspect, Yevgeny A. Nikulin, who was detained in Prague while on vacation with his girlfriend.Mr. Makeyev argues that the United States is seeking Mr. Nikulin\u2019s cooperation in the election-hacking investigation and that an F.B.I. agent from the San Francisco field office, Jeffrey Miller, traveled to Prague to offer asylum in exchange for testimony. The F.B.I. has said the agent was there only to read Mr. Nikulin his rights, and it remains unclear how he may have been connected to election hacking.One theory for the travel, he said, is the \u201cgirlfriend effect\u201d: \u201cYou are a little hacking nerd and now you have a good-looking girlfriend, and it gets cold in Russia, and she says, \u2018It\u2019s cold; I hate it here,\u2019 and it wears him down, so he goes somewhere sunny, and that\u2019s it.\u201dThe American indictment asserts that Mr. Levashov, using the nickname Peter Severa, or Peter of the North, ran a spam operation powered by a sophisticated, evolving family of computer viruses called Waledac, and later Kelihos. Mr. Levashov\u2019s nickname may be derived from his northern hometown, St. Petersburg, or the name of a porn movie star, referring to the pornography promoted by spam email.Mr. Levashov told a Spanish court that the case should be viewed politically because he had worked for United Russia, a political party that backs President Vladimir V. Putin, and he is an army officer with access to Russian classified information.In an online chat room for hackers years earlier, using the nickname Peter Severa, Mr. Levashov had gone further, suggesting that he had enlisted in a broad recruitment effort by the Russian government, begun about four years ago, to engage students, computer professionals and criminals in government hacking teams, sometimes called science squadrons.\u201cGood day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy name is Peter Severa. Many people know me for my service distributing email.\u201d But \u201ceverything is in flux, everything changes, and the time has come for me to change the direction of my work.\u201dHe said he had a new role: The Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., had appointed him to lead a group of hackers who would work for the security service, which he called a \u201cspecial battalion for information security.\u201dMichael Schwirtz contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Russia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Experiencing Injustice, and Now Prosecuting It, From the Top", "Date": "2017-12-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough the portraits are from decades ago, Mr. Grewal sees alarming parallels to the current political environment, where patriotism is sometimes measured by race, faith or political affiliation. The notion to combat this type of injustice has helped inspire Mr. Grewal, a Sikh, throughout his career, an arc that has seen him rise through the ranks of the federal justice system and now has him poised to become New Jersey\u2019s top law enforcement official.If, as expected, the Democratic-controlled State Legislature approves his appointment by the governor-elect, Philip D. Murphy, Mr. Grewal, 44, would become the first Sikh in the United States to hold the position of statewide attorney general.\u201cIt\u2019s important for someone like me to do this job that\u2019s front-line law enforcement, to show people that you don\u2019t have to look a particular way to love this country,\u201d he said in an interview.But in today\u2019s political climate, attorneys general in Democratic states are increasingly being viewed as checks on Trump administration policies.While Mr. Murphy promised to not pressure or interfere with Mr. Grewal, partisan entrenchments have largely transformed the position of statewide attorney general, ostensibly an apolitical position, into an inherently political one.Mr. Grewal, the current Bergen County prosecutor, said he wasn\u2019t concerned about politics.\u201cYeah, I mean, but so what?\u201d Mr. Grewal said when asked about whether taking action contrary to Washington could be construed as political. \u201cBecause you\u2019re seeing people today, it\u2019s just unconscionable, that their loyalty and their patriotism is being questioned because of what they look like, where they come from, what they believe. And, you know, that\u2019s the same thing we did in 1942. That\u2019s why I have those pictures on the wall.\u201dFor Mr. Grewal, the appointment, which would place him in charge of the state police force and the state\u2019s prosecutors, also fulfills a local-boy-makes-good tale: He is a New Jersey native, born and raised in Essex County.He understands the state\u2019s problems, aside from the policies coming out of Washington; Mr. Grewal has laid out key areas that he wants to focus the might of New Jersey\u2019s authority on: addiction, violent crime, police-community relations and social justice issues.He plans to put in place methods he honed in Bergen County, such as partnering with high schools to address hate crimes and addiction. Concerned about a surge in bias and hate crimes among teenagers, especially racist bullying on social media apps like Snapchat, his office has tried to work with children and teenagers.He noted that the training and partnering with schools and programs for youth was a bit unconventional for a prosecutor\u2019s office, but he pointed to its preventive intention.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone outside of our lane as a law enforcement agency to address that because we know where that leads,\u201d he said of hate and bias. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to lead to some sort of criminal conduct, as we\u2019ve seen that in this county \u2014 we\u2019ve seen attacks on synagogues, arsons and things of that nature and so we\u2019re trying to get in there early.\u201dMr. Grewal was hired by Paul J. Fishman, then the United States attorney in New Jersey, as an assistant United States attorney in 2010. He had previously spent about four years in a similar position in Brooklyn. While he began in New Jersey in the smaller general crimes unit, he quickly progressed to take on some high-profile cases.He prosecuted a first-of-its-kind case against Aleksandr Milrud, who was accused of manipulating stocks through high-speed trading, and he helped secure the conviction of Eliyahu Weinstein, who led a $200 million real estate fraud.In 2016, Mr. Grewal, a Democrat, was appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to officially take over the prosecutor\u2019s office in Bergen County, the most populous in New Jersey.His rise to the state attorney general\u2019s office also reflects the growing Asian Indian population in New Jersey. The state has the highest percentage of people with Asian Indian backgrounds in the country, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s 2015 American Community Survey.Nonetheless, despite the expanding population, national Sikh groups were surprised by the sudden representation in public offices in New Jersey.Mr. Grewal said he had also been on the receiving end of prejudice and injustice. \u201cGrowing up, I was called so many variations of the N-word that it just confused me,\u201d he said.His ethnicity does not define him, he said, but he is acutely aware that his presence in the courtroom \u2014 suit and tie, turban and beard \u2014 is freighted with meaning in a world where emerging acceptance still vies with underlying racism.It was just after the Sept. 11 attacks when Mr. Grewal, then a lawyer in private practice, was constantly harassed by a man who would wait outside the office to shout, \u201cI\u2019ve found him, I\u2019ve found bin Laden!\u201dEnraged but also embarrassed, he said he began to develop creative ways to leave the office, slinking out back doors and leaving at odd hours. But this eventually grew both tiresome and unacceptable. He decided it was time to do something.\u201cAs a lawyer, you know, the options in front of me at that point were to become a prosecutor,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I made it my sort of goal to get into U.S. attorney\u2019s office just so I can get up in front of a jury looking the way I do and say, \u2018I represent the United States.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia, U.S. and Other Nations Restrict Fishing in Thawing Arctic", "Date": "2017-11-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Relations between Russia and the United States are in a deep freeze, but they share a looming common problem north of their Arctic coastlines \u2014 the prospect that commercial trawling fleets might overfish the thawing Arctic Ocean.Out on the sea, the polar ice cap has been melting so quickly as global temperatures rise that once improbable ideas for commercial activities, including fishing near the North Pole, are becoming realistic.While Russia, the United States and three other countries with Arctic coastline control the exclusive economic zones near their shores, overfishing in the international waters at the central Arctic Ocean could collapse fish stocks.Whatever their disagreements elsewhere, the countries have a shared interest in protecting the high Arctic from such unregulated fishing, which could affect coastal stocks as well, conservationists say.To address the problem, five nations with Arctic shorelines completed negotiations on Thursday with countries farther south that operate major trawling fleets. The agreement imposes a moratorium on fishing in newly ice-free areas in the high Arctic, at least until scientists can study the ecology of the quickly thawing ocean.The agreement was a step forward for conservation in the Arctic, and was reached despite tensions between the United States and Russia that had delayed an earlier, more limited moratorium, and in spite of President Trump\u2019s skepticism about global warming. Mr. Trump has said he intends to work with Russia to solve common problems.The deal prohibits trawling in the international zone of the Arctic Ocean that is newly free of ice for 16 years, or until a plan for sustainable fishing is in place.The deal is an example of what some diplomats call \u201cArctic exceptionalism,\u201d referring to a willingness of Russia and the United States to set aside other geopolitical differences for their common interests in the far north.\u201cIt\u2019s an example where the United States and Russia have very similar interests as coastal states fronting the Arctic Ocean,\u201d said Scott Highleyman, vice president of conservation policy and programs at Ocean Conservancy, said in a telephone interview. \u201cCan the Arctic remain an area of cooperation? Yes, it can, and that is a good thing.\u201dTo take effect, the agreement on a high-latitude fishing ban must be signed by all the countries involved: the United States, Norway, Denmark, Canada and Russia, which all have Arctic shorelines; and South Korea, China, Japan, the European Union and Iceland, which operate ocean trawling fleets.The coastline states had already agreed in 2015 to a voluntary moratorium on trawling in Arctic waters. But the agreement had little meaning if nations to the south did not also join in.That the center of the Arctic Ocean was unregulated was hardly a concern when it was an icebound backwater. That is changing. Today, about 40 percent of the central Arctic Ocean melts in the summertime. Though nobody fishes there now, the ice-free water could have lured in industrial fleets.\u201cThis is a landmark agreement,\u201d said David A. Balton, the deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries at the State Department, who negotiated the agreement for the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare case of governments doing something in advance, to prevent a problem from arising.\u201dThe accord regulates commercial harvests in an area far offshore \u2014 in the so-called doughnut hole of the Arctic Ocean, a Texas-size area of international water that includes the North Pole and is encircled by the exclusive economic zones of the coastal countries.The part of the doughnut hole that is thawing most quickly lies above Alaska and the Russian region of Chukotka, meaning Russia and the United States have the most at stake. This area is also well within the range of Asian industrial fishing fleets.The intention of the accord is to eventually manage for commercial exploitation any stocks of fish that already inhabit the ocean but used to live under the ice, like Arctic cod, as well as fish that may migrate into the new ice-free zone from farther south.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2017: The Year in Charts", "Date": "2017-12-29", "News": "Advertisement\nThe overbearing persona of President Trump dominated 2017. From his angry early morning tweets to the stain of corruption bleeding into his administration to the sharp rightward tilt in his governing philosophy, Mr. Trump in his first year in office could not stand in starker contrast to his predecessor, Barack Obama. Meanwhile, strong economic performance in 2017 \u2014 a legacy for which Mr. Trump should thank Mr. Obama \u2014 masked the reality that the new president failed to propose or carry out any significant policies that would help the white working-class Americans who helped elect him.The divisive campaign waged by Mr. Trump and his harsh inaugural address put him in office with the poorest approval ratings of any recent president. From that inauspicious beginning, his ratings continued to tumble, as a result of his numerous false and sometimes racially charged statements, his often unpopular policy initiatives and allegations regarding Russian meddling in the election. Of course, many new presidents see their approval ratings fall in their first year as the postelection glow begins to fade. But because of his poor start, Mr. Trump is distinguished as being the only president to finish his first year with more Americans disapproving of his performance than approving of it.Here are net ratings \u2014 the gap, in percentage points, between those who approve and disapprove \u2014 for six presidents in the months after their first inauguration.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.Dec.Jan.Dec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.+80+76ReaganBush IClintonBush IIObama+60+51+40+14+20+8+80\u20137\u201320Trump\u201326Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Jan.JuneDec.Surprisingly, Mr. Trump chose to pitch his young presidency toward his base, in contrast to most new presidents who try to reach out to those who did not vote for them, particularly moderates. As a result, Mr. Trump has remained as popular within his own party as his predecessors but more unpopular among the opposition party than previous presidents. The fear of a Trump counterpunch or worse, a primary challenge, as well as a strong desire to pass at least some Republican legislative priorities such as tax cuts, has helped keep Republican senators and representatives from criticizing him. And for all his unpopularity, most observers (including me) believe that the president will complete his first term, as the prediction markets indicate.Party affiliation governs presidential approval ratings.

The number of bills signed by Mr. Trump in his first 337 days was lower than any president since at least Dwight Eisenhower.  And most of those bills were minor, except, of course, for the tax bill, passed just before the Christmas holiday. Apart from the legislative front, Mr. Trump was also slow to staff his administration, while many of his campaign promises \u2014 from a $1 trillion infrastructure program to the famed border wall \u2014 remain unfulfilled.Bills signed into law during the first 337 days of each presidency.Nixon213Carter241Reagan109Bush I242Clinton209Bush II102Obama12196TrumpBillsrelated to to space,science4Reversing Obama regs.16Ceremonial, bureaucraticand routine laws621Bills related to veterans13Richard M.

It was rushed to a vote after extraordinarily little debate. It will vastly reward corporate America, largely by adding at least $1.4 trillion \u2014 and likely, much more \u2014 to the national debt. It will confer embarrassingly modest benefits on middle- and working-class Americans relative to what will be received by the wealthy. While America\u2019s corporate tax code was in desperate need of revamping, the lack of any meaningful effort to eliminate corporate loopholes suggested that far from draining the swamp, Mr. Trump embraced it. So far, the American people aren\u2019t fooled; this appalling piece of legislation has the lowest approval rating of any major bill passed since 1990.In both dollar and percentage terms, the 2018 tax cuts skew to the richest American households (and will continue to do so for many years).

The improvement in sentiment in the private sector shouldn\u2019t be shocking: If you had been told that you would receive a huge tax cut and be freed from thousands of government regulations, wouldn\u2019t you feel better about your business? As for consumers, their improved mood since the election represents a continuation of a trend that began in 2009 as the floodwaters of the financial crisis were starting to recede.

For one thing, at long last, the world economy is firing on all cylinders \u2014 perhaps not as strongly as we would like in the United States and Europe, but moving upward nonetheless. In fact, only six countries are expected to be in recession in 2018, the smallest number on record. Growing economies have helped propel corporate profits and thus  stock markets upward worldwide. So while Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on business-friendly policies has helped turbocharge the American stock market, we are hardly alone in enjoying rising share prices. And let\u2019s not forget that markets rose more during President Obama\u2019s first 11 months in office (37 percent for the S.&.P. 500 versus 18 percent for Mr. Trump).942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators Global stock markets+21%U.S. stock market+20%Global corporate profits+8%942009: 80Number of countries in recession604062018: 20\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201918\u201921PROJECTIONS2017 in three indicators +21%Global stock markets+20%U.S. stock market+8%Global corporate profitsWhat\u2019s clear is that Mr. Trump deserves little or no credit for the continuing economic and job growth in the United States, despite his frequent claims to the contrary. On Sept. 19, he declared that \u201ccompanies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.\u201d Not true. The rate of job increases has actually slowed since Mr. Trump was inaugurated, by about 44,000 jobs a month. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the current 3.3 percent rate of growth in the gross domestic product \u201cis the largest increase in many years,\u201d that is false as well; President Obama achieved similar or higher increases in six quarters of his administration.Job creation is down.

(The brief period of seemingly rising wages in 2009 was a function of declining prices, not higher incomes.) In late 2014, as labor markets began to tighten, employers trying to hire were compelled to increase pay by more than inflation. But since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, this improvement has ebbed and real incomes again have been barely edging upward faster than prices.Year-over-year percentage change in average hourly wages.+5%Aftermath of recessionTrumpelected+4+3+0.2%+2+10\u20131\u20132Mar. \u201907\u201908\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917+5%+4Trump electedAftermath of recession+3+2+0.2%+10\u20131\u20132Mar. \u201907\u201908\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917While the Republicans failed in their frontal attack on the Affordable Care Act, they managed a flanking victory by wedging a provision into the new tax bill repealing the requirement that all Americans purchase or otherwise obtain health insurance. That requirement was a key component of Obamacare because it ensured that insurance companies had a supply of healthy customers along with those in greater need of medical care. As a consequence, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, 13 million fewer Americans than previously projected will likely have coverage in 2025. To put that in perspective, before its disfiguration, the A.C.A. was projected to add 34 million to the insurance rolls by 2025. And the news gets worse: The new provision is expected to increase premiums quickly by 10 percent, a jump that will come on top of the premium increases resulting from the Trump administration\u2019s cancellation of payments to reduce insurance costs.In less than a decade, the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate is estimated to add 13 million more nonelderly Americans to the ranks of the uninsured \u2014 equivalent to the population of Pennsylvania.Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate471212121213Totaluninsured,2025:2830313144million\u201917\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925Additional uninsured after repeal:Uninsured, in millions, before repeal of mandate:Totaluninsured,2025:4712121212134428303131million2017\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925While the new administration has struggled to advance its legislative priorities, it has (unfortunately) excelled at another of its responsibilities: appointing judges. While it has a poor record in filling executive branch positions, the Trump team has outshone the Obama administration in both putting forth candidates for the bench and getting them confirmed. The latter accomplishment got a big assist from a procedural change put in place by the Senate Democrats during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term that reduced the number of votes required from 60 to a simple majority. Not surprisingly, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees are more likely to be white than those of any president since Ronald Reagan. He has also nominated a startling four candidates for the judiciary rated \u201cunqualified\u201d by the American Bar Association, and three of his nominees have already had to be withdrawn. Finally, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to these lifetime positions are relatively young, effectively tilting the ideological balance of the federal courts for decades to come.First-year nominations for two presidents, and race and gender of nominees for the last seven presidents.Supreme CourtCONFIRMEDDistrictcourtsCircuitcourtsPENDINGObama139911Trump1127643White nominees as percent of totalReagan94%Trump91Bush I89Bush II83Carter79Clinton75Obama64Male nomineesReagan92%Carter84Bush I81Trump81Bush II78Clinton71Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58SupremeCourtCircuitcourtsDistrictcourtsObama139911CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGTrump1127643CONFIRMEDPENDINGCONFIRMEDPENDINGWhite nominees as percent of totalMale nomineesReagan94%Reagan92%91Carter84TrumpBush I89Bush I81Bush II83Trump81Carter79Bush II7875ClintonClinton71Obama64Obama58Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In South Korea, the Virtual Currency Boom Hits Home", "Date": "2017-12-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Choi Whal-soo has been through the wringer of speculative bubbles.After selling his real estate agency near Seoul, he invested in South Korean stocks and then watched them plummet in value after the Asian financial crisis of 1997. He tried to recover, continuing to play the stock market and lotteries, but lost yet more money.Last week, Mr. Choi visited the physical location of one of South Korea\u2019s many new virtual currency exchanges, with a plan to put about a quarter of his remaining $18,000 in savings into virtual currencies.\u201cI may have missed the Bitcoin boat but new boats are coming and I want to hop on those,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that some might be scams but even with those, the prices will rise at least in the middle of their life cycles so that there will be a chance to make money from trading them.\u201dAround the world, ordinary people, with no prior experience in virtual currencies, have been lured into the virtual currency markets in recent weeks by the soaring prices of Bitcoin and its competitors.In Japan, small-time speculators have swarmed to Bitcoin since the government there essentially legalized the virtual currency earlier this year and gave licenses to several exchanges.But nowhere has the public frenzy been more feverish than in South Korea. It was on South Korean exchanges that the price of Bitcoin first hit $10,000 last Monday, hours before traders in the United States reached the same level of exuberance.These volumes are all the more remarkable because just a year ago virtual currency markets barely existed in Korea, unlike in the United States and China, where virtual currency trading has grown over a number of years.\u201cThis can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed,\u201d he said in a statement after a cabinet meeting.Mr. Lee called on the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to take a closer look. South Korean regulators have already announced a ban on so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies.But the exchanges where existing virtual currencies are traded come under essentially no regulatory oversight in South Korea, unlike in the United States and Japan.Mr. Lee said he was particularly worried about young people who have gotten caught up in the markets.\u201cThere are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multilevel marketing for frauds,\u201d he said.Virtual currencies are not the first speculative markets to take off among ordinary investors in South Korea. The country has some of the most active foreign currency markets for small-time investors, allowing people to trade between the won, dollar, euro and smaller currencies.Ha Tae-hyeong, a professor of economics at the University of Suwon, said that South Koreans have been drawn to speculative trading because of the lack of other high-yield investment options.\u201cPeople were looking for anything that would bring them higher return on investment,\u201d Mr. Ha said.Chung Gong-jin, a 16-year-old high school student, said he had been drawn to Bitcoin because it has gone up so quickly, and doesn\u2019t require the same amount of knowledge as stock investing.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have to study so much to invest in Bitcoin \u2014 about the market or the economy, for example \u2014 that I need to do to invest in stocks,\u201d said Mr. Chung, who lives in a suburb of Seoul.Mr. Chung is part of a 100-person group that meets to talk about investments and attend virtual currency conferences.Even virtual currency enthusiasts in South Korea are concerned about the sudden rush into Bitcoin and Ether. They say investors are often getting in with little grasp of how virtual currencies work, like the decentralized network where all the transaction records are kept, or why they may be valuable over the long term.\u201cI do feel sorry to see so many people being shortsighted about Bitcoin, just trying to predict its price changes over short term to make quick money,\u201d said Kim Joon-young, a 28-year-old who runs a popular virtual currency Facebook group, Plan B.For now, the South Korean Bitcoin exchanges that have sprung up over the past year have done their best to stoke the excitement.Unlike in the United States and Japan, where exchanges are entirely online, a number of South Korean operations have set up store fronts where investors can come to buy in and learn more.Coinone, the second largest exchange in the country, opened a location in September in the financial district of Seoul, Yeouido, with an area for meetings, a help desk and virtual currency ATMs.One day last week, around lunch time, a group of about 35 students from Konyang University were visiting the Coinone office for an introductory class on virtual currency investing.Lee Jeong-min, a 39-year old social worker and author, was there to buy Ripple, a virtual currency that has been popular for cross-border bank transfers.Ms. Lee said she saw some of her conservative friends, including teachers and pharmacists, getting rich on Bitcoin and she didn\u2019t want to miss the next wave.\u201cI realized that I missed a bus, the Bitcoin bus, so that I can\u2019t hop on that bus anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t miss the next bus coming, can I?\u201dMs. Lee said she spent around 300,000 won, or around $275, on 900 Ripple.Mr. Choi, the 77-year-old former real estate agent, was also at Coinone, getting advice from the help desk on how to log in and invest from his home computer. He didn\u2019t trust his cellphone with the transactions.Like Ms. Lee, Mr. Choi felt it was too late to get in on Bitcoin. He is placing his big bet on the Ethereum network, and its Ether currency, which was designed to allow for a wider variety of transactions than Bitcoin.He said he knows he might lose money, but he was holding out hope.\u201cI might die tomorrow. I am an old man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that hope keeps people going. Without dreams, there is nothing for a man. Hoping that things would get at least a little better is important.\u201dSu-hyun Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea and Nathaniel Popper reported in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Disney Deal Should Erase the Murdoch Discount", "Date": "2017-12-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsIt is, as Mr. Murdoch put it, a \u201cmomentous\u201d moment for the media conglomerate he spent decades building. He is more often the aggressor than the target, recently alongside his sons, Lachlan and James. Controlling some 40 percent of Fox voting shares has allowed him to prowl for deals without much interference. However, that\u2019s also why Fox has traded at a discount to its peers \u2014 roughly 30 percent, give or take, by various calculations over the years.Other Fox assets that will go to the $160 billion Disney include regional sports networks, the FX cable channel and Star India. The rest of the Fox properties, including Fox News, will be spun off into a new company before the sale to Disney is consummated.The numbers are complicated, but including the Sky stake and a 30 percent share of Hulu, Breakingviews calculates that the assets going to Disney could be worth about $58 billion in enterprise value. It\u2019s paying $66.1 billion including assumed debt, more than the entire Fox was worth, including net debt, in early November before deal talks were first reported.The new Fox spinoff, using similar calculations that draw on analysis by MoffettNathanson and Bernstein, should be worth around $31 billion in enterprise value \u2014 assuming that Mr. Murdoch\u2019s continuing role doesn\u2019t perpetuate a discount there. Add the two, and subtract total net debt of around $15 billion and the $8.5 billion that Disney suggests will go out in taxes, and today\u2019s Fox shareholders may end up with Disney and \u201cNew Fox\u201d stock worth an estimated $74 billion.At some $40 a share, that would be a 60 percent uplift from the value of Fox stock early last month. Even with less generous assumptions, the likely outcome easily wipes out the Murdoch discount.Robert A. Iger, meanwhile, has found a way to extend his tenure as Disney\u2019s chief executive again. He\u2019ll now stay until 2021. Among other things, he is promising $2 billion of cost savings. Before that, the deal may face antitrust questions. And by the time he does quit, it\u2019s possible James Murdoch will be a candidate to succeed him. Along with \u201cNew Fox\u201d and the newspaper-heavy News Corporation, that would be a new kind of Murdoch legacy.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rainmaker Seeks to Grow His Firm at a Time of Big Media and Tech Deals", "Date": "2017-12-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFive years ago, the investment banker Aryeh B. Bourkoff, on his own after having left UBS, hitched a ride on the private plane of the billionaire John C. Malone and pitched a deal: Now was the time for the mogul to get back into the telecommunications business.The vehicle was a small cable company named Charter Communications that had emerged from bankruptcy a few years earlier.Mr. Malone was intrigued by the possibility. And what started with a $2.6 billion investment into Charter has become a national cable empire that includes the former Time Warner Cable \u2014 and the promise of yet more deal-making, led in part by Mr. Bourkoff and his boutique bank, LionTree.But the question Mr. Bourkoff faces is whether he can transform his schmoozing into a business that can outlast him.\u201cAryeh is going to be involved or peripherally involved in everything that\u2019s going on,\u201d said Les Moonves, the chief of CBS.Mr. Bourkoff said he was ready to turn the moment to his advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s a fortunate thing that we happen to be at the right place at the right time,\u201d Mr. Bourkoff said in an interview in his Midtown Manhattan office. He added, \u201cThe entire firm today, based on what we see coming into the future, is keenly structured to play into that.\u201dStanding out among independent investment banks, many started in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, is difficult. Mr. Bourkoff and his team at LionTree are hoping that their focus on tech, media and telecom \u2014 as well as some untraditional features, including a publicly traded investment vehicle, a weekly newsletter and podcast \u2014 will lead to success.\u201cThe pitch was, \u2018help me build something fun and exciting,\u2019\u201d Mr. Donavan said in an interview. Referring to how Wall Street refers to tech, media and telecom, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a unique time in the T.M.T. ecosystem.\u201dLionTree remains a relative minnow in the world of deal making. The 60-person firm has cracked the top 25 advisers on worldwide tech, media and telecom takeovers three times since its founding, according to Thomson Reuters. Its advisory business\u2019s best year to date was in 2015, when it ranked eighth, outpacing every other independent bank. Last year, it ranked 24th, behind firms like Evercore and Raine Group. (LionTree did not have a role in the Disney deal, even though other boutique banks were involved.)But the company, whose offices reflect a sort of sleekly modernized \u201cMad Men\u201d d\u00e9cor, match Mr. Bourkoff\u2019s vision for what his bank should look like.Few in the firm have formal titles, in what is meant to create a \u201cflat\u201d organization in which young bankers can feel free to propose transaction ideas. Much effort has been spent on data analysis and reaching out to young tech start-ups run by millennial founders.Yet at the center of LionTree remains Mr. Bourkoff. Mr. Malone \u2014 who controls the Liberty constellation of companies \u2014 called him the \u201choneybee\u201d of the T.M.T. world, flying from flower to flower cross-pollinating ideas.\u201cThe streets are littered with research analysts who tried to make the transition to investment banking, who thought they could leverage their relationships,\u201d Rob Wiesenthal, once the chief financial officer of Sony Music and now the chief of Blade, the helicopter-ride start-up, said. \u201cAryeh is one of the only ones who has successfully done that.\u201dKen Lerer, a co-founder of HuffPost and now a Viacom board member, credited Mr. Bourkoff with helping to resolve an impasse over the makeup of Viacom\u2019s board involving Shari Redstone, the daughter of its chairman.\u201cIt was a deal that wasn\u2019t getting done otherwise,\u201d Mr. Lerer said.Among LionTree\u2019s most prized clients is Liberty and Mr. Malone, who have retained the firm on numerous assignments.\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Who should I use,\u2019 he\u2019s sort of the top of my list as an adviser,\u201d Mr. Malone said in an interview.But changing the perception that LionTree centers solely around Mr. Bourkoff may be difficult. \u201cThis is the Aryeh show,\u201d Mr. Wiesenthal said. \u201cThis is not the LionTree show.\u201dMr. Bourkoff is working to alter that view. He argued that his Rolodex belongs to the firm, because he cannot meet every client, come up with every idea and execute every deal. \u201cIt\u2019s less important to have a branded banker than it is to have a system,\u201d he said.Young bankers are encouraged to pass along their business ideas to senior executives and to speak more to clients like Mr. Lerer and Charter\u2019s management team. It is, in Mr. Bourkoff\u2019s view, an extension of the networking that he himself practices constantly.The challenge now is to grow the firm while not losing sight of what is happening in the tech, media and telecom worlds now, according to Mr. Bourkoff.\u201cWe expect a frenetic year ahead,\u201d he wrote in a letter to clients this weekend.Advertisement"}

More commonly, they have talked about unemployment numbers, housing starts and other indicators that are less sensitive to market forces.Mr. Trump has ignored those conventions, with relish.\u201cI think that in some sense, he might be responsible for the show he is putting on for some of the increase in stock prices, but I don\u2019t think it is rational,\u201d said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate.Mr. Shiller said the president has \u201clegitimized\u201d the mood that \u201cthe market might continue to go up and up.\u201dThe peril for Mr. Trump is that market cycles invariably have downturns, too, sometimes significant ones, and claiming credit for the rise could also mean owning the fall.\u201cI liken him to Calvin Coolidge, a pro-business president who kept constantly trying to boost the stock market,\u201d Mr. Shiller said. \u201cHe was president until 1929 and then it started to crumble.\u201dStock markets have been rising essentially since March 2009, when the global financial crisis was near its worst. The stock markets are now in the second-longest bull run in history, trailing only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.\u201cThere is no doubt that the promise of a big corporate tax cut and rampant deregulation have had some effect on the markets,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s also a fake measure of the rooster taking credit for the dawn, as the economy here and globally were steadily improving when he arrived.\u201dConsumer confidence is also on the rise, which helps to add to an overall pro-market investment psychology.\u201cThe market is not the economy,\u201d said Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. \u201cThe market is a measure of future profitability.\u201dThat is a compelling statement \u2014 as long as the market climbs. But even the longest bull markets have eventually come to an end.\u201cIf you want to say everything on a market going up is to your credit, it would seem to follow that if it goes down, it is to your blame,\u201d Mr. Baker said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on that in this case.\u201dPresident Bill Clinton also benefited from a stock market surge in the late 1990s, but within the White House, there was concern about aligning too closely with the gains.Paul Begala, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton, said that the Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, \u201cused to tell me that the thing about stocks is that they go down as well as up, so he never wanted President Clinton to associate himself too closely to the stock market.\u201d\u201cWe felt like jobs and wages were what we should focus on, as well as the deficit,\u201d he said.The president\u2019s rating hit that level \u201cwith a roaring stock market,\u201d Mr. Begala said. \u201cWhere do you think he will be when there\u2019s a correction?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Austria Gas Explosion Leaves One Dead and 18 Injured", "Date": "2017-12-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn enormous explosion rocked a major natural gas hub in Austria on Tuesday, killing an employee, injuring at least 18 people and raising concerns about tightening supplies across Europe.Firefighters and emergency workers rushed to the natural gas hub in Baumgarten an der March, about 25 miles east of Vienna, after the blast occurred just before 9 a.m., ordering an evacuation of the site. The fire was brought under control within hours, the state police in Lower Austria said.Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the governor of Lower Austria, which includes Baumgarten, ordered the local authorities to investigate the cause of the explosion. Gas Connect Austria, which operates the facility, said the cause appeared to be technical.The Baumgarten station, Austria\u2019s largest entry point for natural gas, receives the product from Russia and Norway for inspection and compression, and then sends it to Austrian and other pipelines. Baumgarten operations were suspended after the explosion.Natural gas flows to Austria remain secure, Gas Connect Austria said after the blast, but the company warned that flows to other countries could be disrupted.\u201cThe biggest implications are for the Italian market,\u201d said Trevor Sikorski, who leads natural gas research at Energy Aspects in London.While Italy has large amounts of gas in storage, he said, a prolonged outage would reduce stocks and set the stage for higher prices this winter.As is customary in such cases, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to guarantee gas supplies, adding that it was monitoring the situation.\u201cThe supply of gas to Italian consumers is assured because the shortage is covered by a greater supply of gas from the national underground gas reserves,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.The Italian energy company Eni said in a statement on Tuesday that the Baumgarten gas hub provided 30 percent of Italian gas. The state of emergency seeks to facilitate gas imports, particularly from northern Europe, Libya and Algeria.Natural gas prices were volatile on Tuesday, rising about 6 percent on the TTF hub in the Netherlands.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the natural gas hub rocked by an explosion. The hub is in Baumgarten an der March, roughly 25 miles east of Vienna, not in Baumgarten, about 45 miles south of Vienna.Stanley Reed, Elisabetta Povoledo and Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Peltz Gets His Seat on Procter & Gamble\u2019s Board", "Date": "2017-12-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How the media landscape has changed.Procter & Gamble has appointed the activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board following a certified recount of shareholder votes cast at its annual meeting in October, Reuters reported.At its annual shareholder meeting two months ago, Procter & Gamble said its preliminary count of proxy votes showed that it had fended off an effort by Mr. Peltz to win a seat on its board. But last month, Trian Fund Management, the investment firm controlled by Mr. Peltz, announced that a vote count by the independent inspector of elections showed that he had, in fact, been elected.Procter & Gamble waited to make Mr. Peltz a director while it looked into the election results from the independent election inspector IVS Associates.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said Friday he would vote yes after winning a more generous child tax credit in the final bill and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who voted against the initial Senate bill over deficit concerns, said he would support the legislation despite the cost of the tax cuts.The markets, which have risen and fallen with the fate of the tax bill in recent weeks, rose Friday as passage looked more certain.\u2022 The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq closed at records.\u2022 The Russell 2000 jumped 1.6 percent, its best day since Nov. 16, according to Bloomberg.\u2022 The dollar rose for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Jared Kushner\u2019s legal team is looking for a crisis public relations firm.In a statement to the Post, Mr. Lowell \u201cconfirmed he was looking for a firm that would handle media for all high-profile clients that receive attention from the press.\u201d\u201cMy law firm and I are considering hiring an outside consultant to handle the time-consuming incoming inquiries on the cases in which I am working that receive media attention. This inquiry from you about whether I am doing this is a good example of why we need one.\u201dThe question is whether any of usual suspects among Wall Street\u2019s crisis management world will take this on? Here are some of the firms:Joele FrankBrunswick GroupAbernathy MacGregorSard VerbinnenGladstone Place PartnersRubensteinAnd it seems they got it.Mr. Rubio, in a tweet on Friday, called it \u201ca solid step\u201d and suggested he would now vote for the bill.Here are the details from The New York Times\u2019s Jim Tankersley and Thomas Kaplan report.The change intended to shore up Mr. Rubio\u2019s support would allow 70 percent of the $2,000 per-child tax credit to be refundable, up from 55 percent in the original draft of the bill, according to lawmakers and those briefed on the change. The change would allow families with no tax liability to claim up to $1,400 in tax refunds per child, up from $1,100 in the version that passed the Senate earlier this month.The news pushed stocks higher Friday on optimism the tax legislation would be enacted. Stocks have risen and fallen in recent weeks on the prospects for the tax bill.On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index were up 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000 index is up 1.5 percent in recent trading. The index is made up of small-cap stocks, which typically have a higher effective tax rate than their larger brethren. For that reason, the index has been particularly sensitive to the likelihood the tax bill will pass.With Disney\u2019s bid for a large portion of 21st Century Fox, four of the five biggest deals have been announced in the past three years. The pursuit of scale has driven the deal making. Telecom, cable and media companies all want to get bigger to better compete with the likes of Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix.That dynamic got us to wondering: How has the competitive landscape of media change during the past decade? To help answer that question, at least partially, we asked Thomson Reuters for the 100 biggest companies by market value at the start of 2007 and today. Here\u2019s a look at the biggest telecom, cable, and media companies then and now as well as the tech firms they are up against.Here\u2019s what Mr. Murdoch told analysts on a call yesterday:I know a lot of you are wondering, \u201cWhy did the Murdochs come to such a momentous decision?\u201d Are we retreating?

{"Headline": "Why Are Mutual Fund Fees So High? This Billionaire Knows", "Date": "2017-12-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe billionaire investor Ronald S. Baron flashed the grin of a proud father at his annual investor jamboree in November, as the chief executives of his favorite companies explained how slashing prices stoked their bottom lines.That is, until a shareholder in one of his mutual funds drew an awkward parallel.\u201cExcuse me \u2014 Schwab is charging a very low fee,\u201d a woman pointed out, after a presentation by Walter W. Bettinger II, the chief executive of the discount broker Charles Schwab. \u201cGod bless him, but no one ever said Baron\u2019s fees are little.\u201dYou can say that again.Mr. Baron\u2019s mutual funds charge some of the higher investment fees around, and the fees have held steady despite a $1 trillion exodus out of old-school mutual funds into cheaper, better performing rivals that track a variety of indexes and investment styles.In a global economy where competition and Amazonian price destruction have forced companies to cater to cost-wary customers, the mutual fund industry is a rare outlier. Fees on most actively managed mutual funds, which house the retirement savings and other assets of millions of Americans, have barely budged.The reasons for that \u2014 quiescent mutual fund boards, complacent investors and a general unwillingness to call a halt to one of the great gravy trains in financial history \u2014 are all visible inside Mr. Baron\u2019s fund family.The Baron Funds group manages $26.4 billion in assets on behalf of hundreds of thousands of small and large investors. An old-fashioned stock picker, Mr. Baron achieved renown in the 1990s and the 2000s for successfully betting on small companies.But his performance has suffered in recent years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, his flagship fund, Baron Growth, trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index by an average of seven percentage points.This year, the results have been better: He is up 27 percent, compared with 20 percent for the S. & P.The 13 Baron funds impose fees that were 54 percent higher than last year\u2019s industry average \u2014 and vastly higher than what a comparable exchange-traded fund would charge.In November, Baron reduced fees on three of its smaller funds. But the largest, Baron Growth, with $6.3 billion in assets, still charges 1.3 percent of assets. That is a third higher than the median level for similar funds, according to Morningstar.Since 2010, investors have withdrawn, in net terms, just over $5 billion from the growth fund, according to Morningstar. But many have stuck around.Mr. Baron, 74, is perhaps best known for his annual investment conference, now held at the Metropolitan Opera House at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center and in its 26th year. Mixing rock stars, pop entertainment (Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney have performed in the past), patriotism (this year celebrated the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth) and triumphant chief executives, the gala is a giddy ode to American capitalism.Few fund companies offer a comparable perk, and some 5,000 Baron fund holders travel to New York to attend.At the conference in November, with markets hitting new highs each day, investors were exultant. But there was a lingering concern.\u201cThe fees are very high,\u201d one man said to a friend as they exited the Chris Rock comedy show. \u201cYou really have to have the market go up to do well.\u201dEven longtime fans acknowledge they are paying up.\u201cI won\u2019t say performance warrants the fees they charge,\u201d said Barry Edelman, a Las Vegas retiree and a 20-year Baron shareholder. \u201cBut I appreciate how they differentiate themselves from the competition.\u201dWhen the shareholder asked Mr. Baron why his rates were so much higher than Schwab\u2019s, the audience response was telling: The opera hall erupted in sympathetic laughter \u2014 and applause.Mr. Baron has been getting flak for his funds\u2019 high costs for years.Mr. Baron is unapologetic about the high fees. He argues that his skills and experience \u2014 and the arduous task of researching small growth companies \u2014 justify the fees.\u201cSince inception, 98 percent of our funds have beaten their benchmark,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you want the lowest fee, you should not invest with us.\u201dBut if you want to bet on American growth stocks, \u201cyou can double your money in 10 years,\u201d he said. He frequently sticks with his top picks for decades.While this year has been stellar, over a longer stretch his performance is less robust.Mr. Baron believes that the true measure of his success is performance since his fund\u2019s launch in 1994. A $10,000 investment in his main fund then would be worth $163,207 today, according to Baron data. That compares with $57,889 for the Russell growth index and $84,904 for the S. & P. 500, per Baron.Mr. Baron\u2019s funds are not the only ones refusing to budge on fees. In fact, the average fee for 2,000 actively managed mutual funds has remained 0.84 percent of total assets for the past three years, according to Morningstar.Some, like the Capital Group and Fidelity, have gotten the message and have reduced their fees over this period.Industry experts say there are several reasons that active mutual fund fees have not succumbed to broader pricing trends in the economy.The first is their power. While more than $1 trillion has left higher-fee funds in favor of passive competitors, that still leaves some $10 trillion. That generates about $100 billion in fees for fund companies. And it suggests they don\u2019t need to cut fees to retain assets.It\u2019s dizzyingly complicated for investors to figure out what fees they\u2019re paying. With funds\u2019 multiple share classes, varying structures and oceans of boilerplate, even sophisticated investors may not realize they are paying up for a laggard.Another reason for elevated fees, experts say, is lax oversight.Every mutual fund is overseen by a board of trustees \u2014 a mix of executives from the fund company and mostly independent officers that must, by law, look out for investors\u2019 interests.But are these boards truly effective advocates for investors?A number of lawsuits brought against major investment companies, including Axa, BlackRock and Pimco, allege that trustees are not pushing hard enough for lower fees. The judge overseeing the BlackRock case in 2015 declined to dismiss the suit, saying the allegations raised questions about \u201crubber stamping\u201d by boards.BlackRock has said the suit lacks merit.At the Baron fund family, the fee oversight is complicated by the fact that Mr. Baron, the largest shareholder in the investment company and the manager of its largest fund, has a financial incentive to keep fees high. In addition to his salary and bonus, tied to performance among other measures, he gets a reward based on a percentage of the fees his funds bring in, according to regulatory filings.That is unusual. At most fund companies, compensation packages reward managers for beating their benchmarks \u2014 not collecting fees.While the average age for independent mutual fund directors is 66, some directors stay on boards into their 80s and even 90s. Such long tenures often make directors weak voices for investors, he said.Baron funds are overseen by nine directors. Seven are listed as independent. Four of those seven have served as trustees since Mr. Baron established his first funds 30 years ago.One of them, David A. Silverman, has zero financial experience: He is a doctor with an expertise in infectious diseases.The lead independent trustee, Raymond Noveck, worked as a managing director at Baron from 1985 to 1987.\u201cTrustees have very little incentive to fight managers,\u201d Mr. Birdthistle said. \u201cKicking and scratching is unlikely to lower fees but certainly will antagonize the manager, which is the one institution that can arrange for the trustees\u2019 dismissal. Besides, trustees will tell themselves, if a fund\u2019s fees really are too high, the market will sort things out and investors simply won\u2019t invest in the fund.\u201dThe board has taken steps to recruit trustees with bulkier backgrounds, most recently Tom Folliard, a former chief executive of CarMax.In a statement, Baron Funds said that it regularly assessed its board\u2019s effectiveness and that the long tenure of some members was a sign of the board\u2019s experience and expertise. It said fees were approved via data and analysis from an outside party. The board also said it was represented by an independent lawyer.One clear winner of this arrangement is Mr. Baron. \u201cIn 1970, my net worth was minus $15,000,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cNow my children and I have over $670 million invested in our funds.\u201dForbes pegs his wealth at just over $2 billion \u2014 and he is not shy about showing it off.His office in Manhattan\u2019s General Motors Building is a museum of trophies and curiosities, from paintings by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein to Kennedy\u2019s rocking chair. He has invested about $150 million in a 59-acre beachfront estate in East Hampton, N.Y., that he bought in 2007.Mr. Baron\u2019s investment philosophy \u2014 that over the long term the stocks that he picks will keep doubling \u2014 is fired by a relentless optimism that he attributes to his life\u2019s good fortune.A grandchild of immigrants from Poland and Russia, Mr. Baron grew up scraping for extra cash in Asbury Park, N.J. He worked his way through college and law school, which he left without getting a degree.In 1982, after a stint as a Wall Street analyst, he founded his investment firm.His timing was perfect. It was the start of a bull market, and he developed an expertise in picking small companies that would grow into big ones such as Charles Schwab, Vail Management Company and Tesla.It was the heyday of the individual stock picker. Peter Lynch at Fidelity and Bill Miller at Legg Mason gained cultlike followings, accumulating billions of dollars in assets and gracing the covers of the personal finance magazines that lionized them.Mr. Baron\u2019s star power was of a lesser variety, but it was not insubstantial. He became a regular television commentator and won a reputation as the longest of long-term investors, holding positions for decades. His assets peaked at $28 billion in 2015.\u201cWe have made $23.6 billion for our clients,\u201d Mr. Baron said.But it is his annual investor gala, which he pays for himself, that defines him. Onstage, he cultivates a grandfatherly mien, bragging about how much money the chief executives of his portfolio companies made for Baron shareholders. His chief maxim is \u201cWe invest in people,\u201d and he treats management as family.There are warm bear hugs onstage for some. Others get personal advice.Spotting a top executive from the data firm FactSet, another portfolio holding, he offered to connect her with his longtime tax lawyer. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what he has done,\u201d Mr. Baron said.A surprise raffle is part of the atmospherics, and this time a Model 3 from Tesla was the grand prize. Tim McGraw and Faith Hill performed.As the event ended, attendees streamed out of Lincoln Center into a freezing evening. Mr. Baron, without a coat, greeted them on the plaza. He hugged and kissed old friends and posed for selfies with new ones.Nobody complained about the fees.An earlier version of this article misstated how the iShares Russell 2000 Growth fund performed over a five-year period. It is up 15 percent, not 96 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The booming stock market of the 1920s had the New York Stock Exchange. The tech bubble of the 1990s had Nasdaq and E-Trade. And the virtual currency market of the last year has had Coinbase. The company faces challenges that are a reminder of the early days of now-mainstream online brokerages, which suffered through untimely outages and harsh criticism from traditional finance companies and government regulators. And Coinbase\u2019s missteps make it clear that the virtual currency industry is still young, with little of the battle testing that other financial markets have faced.Recently, every last inch of space has been pressed into action. The day after Bitcoin hit $10,000 last week, a training session for Coinbase managers was moved to the game room because the engineering team needed to set up an emergency war room in the regular conference room. The engineering team was trying to get Coinbase back up after the company\u2019s site was knocked offline, overwhelmed by a wave of incoming traffic. The number of visitors was double what it had been during the previous peak \u2014 two days earlier \u2014 and eight times what it had been in June, the peak until recently. All of the big Bitcoin exchanges went down for at least part of the day, and Coinbase got back online faster than most. Still, any sort of downtime like that would be unacceptable in more traditional exchanges where stocks and commodities are traded. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit too focused on the price or people trying to make money,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said last week. \u201cThe thing I\u2019m passionate about with digital currency is the world having an open financial system.\u201d In addition to the brokerage service for small investors, Coinbase also runs an exchange, called GDAX, tailored to larger investors. GDAX is overseen by Adam White, a former Air Force officer and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The day Bitcoin hit $10,000, he was in New York speaking with big financial institutions that are looking into Bitcoin. Some companies are getting ready to begin trading Bitcoin futures contracts in December, when that activity becomes available on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A year ago, his Wall Street outreach was difficult, but \u201cit\u2019s all inbound now,\u201d Mr. White said. Not surprisingly, Coinbase is on a building spree. It recently leased office space in New York that will handle the Wall Street business and a new service that holds virtual currencies for large customers. In San Francisco, the company is adding two new floors in the building where it now has one. Coinbase is trying to be more responsive. At the beginning of the year, the company had 24 employees providing customer support. It now has around 180, with most of them outsourced from a call center in Texas and an email response team in the Philippines. The cafeteria is often turned into a \u201cCrypto Club\u201d where new employees are taught the ins and outs of virtual currency. Daniel Romero, the general manager of Coinbase, said he wanted to have 400 customer support employees by the first quarter of next year to provide phone support around the clock. But in the meantime, there is a 10-day backlog of service requests.\u201cWhen your customer support issues are that publicly bad, and you have your site go down when people want to be trading,\u201d it\u2019s a very humbling experience, Mr. Romero said. A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified where Coinbase employees were gathered for lunch. It was the company's gaming room, not the cafeteria.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Votes to Sharply Expand Concealed-Carry Gun Rights", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Wednesday easily passed a sweeping expansion of the right to carry concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country, putting the fate of the National Rifle Association\u2019s top legislative priority in the hands of a divided Senate.Together, the measures were the first gun-related bill to pass through the chamber since two of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States, in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Tex., in the fall.But the background check measure was not enough to win over most Democrats, nor did it persuade law enforcement officials in some of the largest cities, including New York, who say the legislation would force locales with strict gun laws to bow to places with few or no gun restrictions.The final House vote was 231 to 198, with six Democrats in favor of and 14 Republicans against the bill.Passage in the Senate would almost certainly require 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster, and although several Democrats have expressed support in the past, the climb for the N.R.A. will be steep.On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee debated its own response to the shootings in Texas and Nevada and appeared willing to move forward with a background check bill. But Senate leaders seemed disinclined to take up the concealed-carry measure anytime soon.Regardless, House Republicans and gun rights activists celebrated the concealed-carry vote, hailing it as an important step toward victory in a decades-long fight to extend concealed carry and simplify the rules for gun owners.Chris W. Cox, the N.R.A.\u2019s executive director, praised the vote as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for Second Amendment rights.\u201cThis bill ensures that all law-abiding citizens in our great country can protect themselves in the manner they see fit without accidentally running afoul of the law,\u201d he said.Democrats said the measure would jeopardize public safety and set a dangerous precedent for overriding states\u2019 rights to determine their own laws.\u201cThe answer to our national problem of gun violence is not that we need more people carrying concealed firearms on our streets,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.Laws regulating the carrying of concealed weapons have traditionally been left up to the states, creating a patchwork of varying standards and expectations. Some states, including New York and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia require that permit applicants have live-fire experience and safety training, along with a clean criminal history. Others are more lenient, and a dozen states do not even require a permit.The House bill would not force states to change their own laws, but it would treat a concealed-carry permit like a driver\u2019s license, letting individuals allowed by one state to carry a concealed weapon with them into another state.It would also allow visitors to national parks, wildlife refuges and other federally administered lands to legally carry concealed guns. And it carves out a provision that would let qualified permit holders carry concealed guns in school zones.Law enforcement officials from major cities like New York and Los Angeles, where strict gun control laws are aimed at handguns, warned that the bill would usurp states\u2019 authority to set their own laws and effectively impose the lax laws of Southern and rural states on densely populated cities.Several Democrats who voted for the 2013 measure, including Senators Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Mark Warner of Virginia and Tom Udall of New Mexico, said this week they would not do so this time around. Even Democrats perceived to be the most in favor of gun rights, including Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, were cautious about staking out a position before they needed to.Republican leaders, wary of seeing the measure once again fail on the floor of the Senate floor, were not rushing the concealed-weapon bill to that chamber. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican and a co-sponsor of both the concealed-carry and background check bills in the Senate, said on Tuesday that he was \u201crealistic enough\u201d to realize that following the House\u2019s lead by combining the bills would also be pointless in his chamber.\u201cIf you put them together, it makes it harder to do what we can do and can do now and need to do,\u201d he said.Democrats in the House denounced the decision by Republicans to combine the two bills and fretted that they could force shut a rare window of bipartisanship over guns. Mark Kelly, the retired astronaut and the husband of former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was badly wounded in a 2011 shooting in Tucson, called the move \u201creprehensible.\u201d\u201cThe concealed-carry reciprocity is bad in a worse way than the fixing of the N.I.C.S. system is a good thing,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, who helps lead a gun control group bearing Ms. Giffords\u2019s name. \u201cThey don\u2019t cancel each other out.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the vote of Senator Claire McCaskill on a measure in 2013 that would have expanded concealed-carry gun rights.
