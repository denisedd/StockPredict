{"Headline": "How the Fingerling Caught On (Robot Grip and All) as 2017\u2019s Hot Toy", "Date": "2017-12-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout two years ago, Sydney Wiseman had a challenging assignment for an engineer at her family toy company.Sure, the engineer told her. What do you want the little monkey to do?Thus was born the Fingerling, a five-inch monkey that grips your finger with its legs and arms, as it babbles, blows kisses and blinks its eyes. Cradle a Fingerling in your hand and it drifts off to sleep. Press the Fingerling\u2019s head and it passes gas.Created by the Canadian company WowWee, the Fingerling has been anointed one of this year\u2019s hot toys for the holidays, a designation that most toymakers only dream of achieving.For decades, there has always been a must-have holiday toy \u2014 Cabbage Patch Kids, Beanie Babies, a Tickle Me Elmo doll. Parents drive long distances to scour stores for the one item in short supply at exactly the moment when everyone wants it. Scalpers sell the toys at ridiculous markups, while counterfeiters dupe desperate families into buying knockoffs.At stake are the tears \u2014 of joy or misery \u2014 of the children whose dearest wishes are fulfilled, or dashed.How the Fingerling reached this tipping point \u2014 when suddenly millions of children cannot do without a $15 farting monkey \u2014 is the story of a promising idea\u2019s going viral on social media, a large retailer\u2019s savvy pricing strategy and the science of managing scarcity.The monkey\u2019s journey from Ms. Wiseman\u2019s imagination to holiday sensation also shows how the making of a hot toy has evolved through the generations.The $84 billion global toy industry is struggling for the attention of children obsessed with smartphones and tablets. Global toy sales have been growing each year, but at a slower pace than video games.The average life span of a toy fad is about eight months from its launch until it\u2019s marked down, said Richard Gottlieb, an analyst and publisher of Global Toy News.\u201cThe life of an item is a little rockier\u201d than it used to be, said Anne Marie Kehoe, the Walmart vice president who runs the retailer\u2019s toy division in the United States. \u201cWe move as a country faster from one thing to the next.\u201dWowWee says it did not intentionally create the shortage. But whether by design or happenstance, there is no question that scarcity fuels a toy\u2019s mystique.\u201cThe reality is that you are better off having some disappointed children this year in order to excite them next year,\u201d said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at Panjiva, a supply-chain analytics firm.But extended shortages can be perilous. Empty shelves can tantalize for only so long before would-be buyers might give up.This fall, WowWee increased the number of Chinese factories producing Fingerlings to three, from two. Fingerlings started arriving by plane because it was taking too long for the toys to reach the United States from Asia on container ships.\u201cIt\u2019s like coming up with a hit movie or a hit song,\u201d Richard Yanofsky, one of WowWee\u2019s founders, said in an interview last month. \u201cIf you see signs of success, you pour gas on it.\u201dOne bitter cold morning last month, Ms. Wiseman scrolled through her phone in the WowWee offices in a former industrial building on Rue Saint-Patrick in Montreal.She pulled up the picture of a wild pygmy marmoset that launched the idea for the Fingerlings.\u201cBringing animals to life is something that is in our DNA,\u201d said Ms. Wiseman, who, ebullient and energetic, sounds as if she is about to burst into joyous laughter at any moment.WowWee is owned by Ms. Wiseman\u2019s uncles, Richard and Peter Yanofsky, with Richard living and working in Montreal and Peter in California. Her mother, a former veterinarian, also works at the company, as do two cousins. Ms. Wiseman is a brand manager at WowWee.But pricey robots are more difficult to sell these days. The challenge for WowWee\u2019s designers was developing a monkey with just enough sounds and movements to entertain children, but not so many sensors and circuitry that it would be prohibitively expensive to make.Ms. Wiseman worked with Davin Sufer, the company\u2019s 38-year-old chief technology officer, on the design.The first prototype looked like a primordial creature that had crawled out of the jungle. \u201cIt was a little scary,\u201d recalled Mr. Sufer, who has three daughters, an 8-year-old, a 6-year-old and a 4-month-old.Over time, the monkey\u2019s face softened into something cuter. It developed a curly tail and plump arms and legs. Ms. Wiseman reviewed dozens of monkey sounds until she settled on the right voice.A Fingerling can snore, say hello and babble in monkey gibberish. If one Fingerling starts singing, it triggers sensors in nearby Fingerling monkeys \u2014 the company hopes you\u2019ll buy several \u2014 that get them to join in.Ms. Wiseman and her team came up with the name Fingerling \u2014 not Finger monkey \u2014 so the brand could produce other miniature animals. (One of them, a sloth, moves, sings and, yes, farts about 10 percent slower than the monkeys.)\u201cYou know you can trust a toy company if its toys fart,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cIt knows what kids want.\u201dWowWee\u2019s offices look like a hip playroom for grown-up kids. Techno music is piped into the design lab, while Japanese anime plays on a screen mounted on the wall above a row of 3-D printers.Every shelf in the conference room was filled with robots that WowWee has produced over the decades: Robosapien, a guard dog, a panda, a Minion on wheels.The company, with about 100 employees, also has the intensity of a Wall Street trading floor, where everyone is in constant motion and new ideas are flying. Its executives travel to Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Bentonville, Ark., site of Walmart\u2019s headquarters.Whenever possible, staff engineers, designers and executives sit down and have lunch together, often at an old-style deli known for its smoked meat sandwiches and matzo ball soup.\u201cWhen the toy business is good, it is really fun,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky, 59, after parking his Tesla outside the deli one afternoon. \u201cWhen it is bad, it is really bad.\u201dMr. Yanofsky got his start as a trader. He used to buy items from wholesalers in the old part of Montreal and resell them out of the trunk of his car to retailers at a markup.\u201cIf I thought I could sell it, I would buy it,\u201d he said.The Yanofsky brothers started developing toys in the 1980s. After some early success, Hasbro bought their business in 1999, and the brothers were incorporated into Hasbro. The marriage was short lived. Mr. Yanofsky said that the toy giant hadn\u2019t been willing to take the risks he wanted, but that they had parted amicably.The brothers eventually bought back their business, then sold it to another public company and then took it private again.Over the decades, Mr. Yanofsky has watched as the industry consolidated and retailers struggled. (Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed for bankruptcy in September.) The rise of social media \u2014 where toys can be instantly validated or just as quickly panned \u2014 has raised the stakes for companies like WowWee.\u201cThere are less shades of gray,\u201d Mr. Yanofsky said. \u201cYou either fail or you succeed.\u201dAnne Marie Kehoe, the high-ranking toy executive, is Walmart\u2019s real-life Santa Claus. She plays a big role in determining what millions of children will get for Christmas.Ms. Kehoe knew right away that the Fingerling would be a hit.\u201cThis monkey creates an emotional connection right in front of your face,\u201d Ms. Kehoe said in an interview this month. But it is sales potential, not emotion, that drives her decisions. Ms. Kehoe views even a wacky toy like the Fingerling through the lens of a retailer with troves of data on what customers are willing to buy, and at what price.\u201cIt\u2019s such an art and a science,\u2019\u2019 she said.WowWee\u2019s wooing of Walmart began in June 2016 when Ms. Wiseman flew to Bentonville to pitch the Fingerlings.Walmart was sold almost instantly on the toy\u2019s appeal, but the price was a problem. WowWee had originally planned on selling the Fingerling for $20, but the giant retailer was insistent: About $15 was the magic number. Drop $5 from the price and Walmart would buy as many as 10 times more Fingerlings.Walmart had been doing this for decades \u2014 pushing down the price of paper towels, toothbrushes, avocados and now robotic monkeys in order to sell as many as possible.Back in Montreal, the WowWee executives debated the price cut; it would mean sacrificing significant profit on each monkey.\u201cIt was pure margin,\u201d Mr. Sufer recalled.Ms. Wiseman pleaded with the team. In the past, WowWee had stood firm on keeping a higher price, only to mark down the toys later when they didn\u2019t sell.\u201cI said, \u2018I am telling you, I don\u2019t want to fight this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman recalled. \u201cThey are saying it for a reason. They know.\u201dThe price was set at roughly $15.In July, Walmart invited hundreds of children to a convention center to play with a range of new toys, including the Fingerling.Based on the children\u2019s feedback, the retailer named the Fingerling one of its 25 top-rated toys for the holidays and purchased more monkeys.When Fingerlings hit stores across the United States in August, Maya Vallee-Wagner, 7, was overcome with emotion.\u201cFingerlings,\u201d Maya said, through sobs. \u201cThey\u2019re in stores. I am so happy.\u201d\u201cThis made my life,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said of the video.The video was a marketing coup, just as WowWee was launching its social media push \u2014 an effort that in many ways resembled the rollout of a Hollywood movie.Gone are the days when a toy company could simply blitz Saturday morning cartoons with ads.WowWee focused much of its effort on YouTube, where children go to watch other children play with toys in a phenomenon called \u201cunboxing\u201dThe toy company sent Fingerlings to key \u201cinfluencers\u201d on YouTube \u2014 two preschool \u201cbesties\u201d who make videos about their trips to a playground and a skinny girl with faded fingernail polish who publishes daily posts about toys. Some influencers were paid to promote the monkeys; others did it for fun.Mackenzie Ziegler, a dancer with more 1.7 million YouTube subscribers, and her friend Lauren wrapped multiple monkeys around their fingers and mugged for the camera.Not long after the social media push in August, the monkeys were basically sold out everywhere, and WowWee was able to pull back on its marketing.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful problem when your demand outstrips supply,\u201d said Mr. Gottlieb, the toy analyst.But managing supply can be a delicate balancing act. If WowWee fails to deliver enough Fingerlings by Christmas, it could miss the moment when the fad reaches its peak, or alienate desperate parents who feel manipulated by the hype.\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair,\u201d one woman posted on Facebook. \u201cPeople work and no one has time to stalk\u201d toy stores.Last year, there was a run on Hatchimals, furry birds that hatch from an egg, causing shortages. Parents complained that when they did manage to get their hands on the birds, some failed to hatch on Christmas morning. \u201cMy four-year-old is gutted,\u201d a father wrote on Twitter.WowWee ramped up shipments of Fingerlings in October and November \u2014 way ahead of the number of Hatchimals that were shipped to the United States at this time last year, according to data supplied by Panjiva. Retailers say Fingerlings are being bought up as quickly as they can be stocked.WowWee executives are confident the Fingerling\u2019s popularity will live on past Christmas, but the company\u2019s designers are already pitching their next big toy for 2018.\u201cOur lives are at the whim of 5- to 9-year olds,\u201d said Richard Yanofsky\u2019s son Michael, vice president of sales at WowWee. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Republicans were planning to increase the deduction to 20 percent to address the concerns over how pass-through owners were being treated by the bill.Now, the deduction is to be raised to 23 percent, an aide to Mr. Daines said.The remaining holdouts include Susan Collins of Maine and several senators concerned about the bill\u2019s effect on the deficit.How Republican leaders are proposing to find at least $400 billion in new revenue\u2022 Slowly raising corporate rates above 20 percentThe big problemAides say they still hope to bring all 52 Republicans to yes.

What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job?Quick disclaimer: I might be the wrong person to be doing this. I\u2019m the Frugal Traveler, which means it\u2019s literally my job to be cheap. That means I\u2019m not plunking down lots of money on the latest and greatest tech toy.I do, however, use a lot of different online tools to do my job. Travel writing involves regular travel, just a little quicker than normal, like hitting a fast-forward button. You can\u2019t linger at that gorgeous beach or perfect cafe, because you typically have limited time and a long list of places to visit.Therefore, I\u2019m reliant on maps a good deal of the time, as I\u2019m frequently in transit. Google Maps is essential for saving locations, jotting quick notes and navigating. It\u2019s also worth noting that it still has basic functionality even when in airplane mode \u2014 a useful feature when you\u2019re in a different country. I wish I could tell you there was some secret maps app nobody knows about that\u2019s way better than Google Maps. There isn\u2019t.My experience is that there isn\u2019t a ton of difference between the various online travel agencies as far as finding hotels and flights. It happens sometimes, but it\u2019s rare to look up a flight on Priceline and then find the price is wildly different on Expedia. For hotels, pick one site \u2014 one that allows you to collect points or status, ideally, and stick with it.In my travels, I often find that the aphorism \u201cless is more\u201d holds true as it relates to technology. I don\u2019t have a super nice camera; I use an old Canon 20D. I have a newish laptop that I enjoy using at home, but when I travel for an extended period of time, I bring an older MacBook from 2010.What could be better?One thing I\u2019d like is more accurate reporting on flight status and delays. That has more to do with the airlines than the tools, but I find that aspect of travel tools to be woefully inadequate.Planning a trip itinerary can be challenging, especially in a country you\u2019ve never visited. What\u2019s your process? No one source of information is perfect. Firsthand information is best \u2014 personal experience, or friends or family \u2014 but that\u2019s not always possible. The internet becomes the well you draw from pretty frequently, but there are risks to taking reviews written by strangers (or paid shills) as gospel.What that means, ironically, is that you end up having to spend even more time online \u2014 to get an aggregate sense of what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. I\u2019ll use TripAdvisor, Twitter, Lonely Planet forums, FlyerTalk, Reddit \u2014 you name it, I\u2019ll read it. The trick then becomes discerning which intel is solid.What tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily nonwork life?What are the most important gadgets that everyone should pack when traveling?The last essential is \u2014 ready? A paper clip. I don\u2019t leave the country without one. If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ll need it to swap out SIM cards.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Australian Debut Brings Excitement, Dread and Defiance", "Date": "2017-12-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut people who posted on social media about Amazon\u2019s debut were generally underwhelmed, with prospective Australian customers playfully pointing out lackluster product offerings and uncompetitive pricing.One New York Times reporter spotted a pair of shoes listed in the website\u2019s cookware section, a sign of the site\u2019s growing pains.Some compared Amazon\u2019s unremarkable Australian debut with that of another digital giant: Netflix. When that service arrived in Australia in 2015, it offered a notably leaner offering of its streaming-on-demand product, especially in comparison with its American lineup.However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles.\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s early days \u2014 it\u2019s Day 1,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. \u201cAs you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you\u2019ll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there.\u201dMr. O\u2019Leary pointed out that at Amazon\u2019s debut, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers \u2014 or third-party vendors \u2014 who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon\u2019s formula of providing large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices.As the number of sellers increases \u2014 and the company\u2019s pricing algorithm takes hold \u2014 its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said.Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon\u2019s entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions.\u201cWe haven\u2019t got to adjust to anything,\u201d said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in business now for 56 years. I\u2019ve always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I\u2019ll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don\u2019t follow them.\u201dAustralians spend less on the internet than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market.Mr. O\u2019Leary, who has studied Amazon\u2019s impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company\u2019s product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle.\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to out-Amazon Amazon \u2014 well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering. Additionally, store-based retailers can take advantage of their retail presence.\u201dBut for some small business owners, the disruption has created opportunity.\u201cWe\u2019ve been following it very closely,\u201d Tristan Swanwick, the co-founder of Swanwick Sleep, an Australian company that sells sleep-aiding glasses, said of Amazon\u2019s debut in Australia.\u201cAs soon as Amazon officially announced they were coming to Australia, we started sending emails and making phone calls\u201d to ensure they would be among the first to team up with Amazon in Australia, he added.Mr. Swanwick said his company initially started its business in the United States through Fulfilled by Amazon, a program that allows small businesses to have Amazon handle things like warehousing, delivery and customer service.\u201cIt really lowers the barrier for entry for small businesses getting started in e-commerce,\u201d he said.Swanwick Sleep was among the first batch of merchants included in Amazon\u2019s Australian offering, easing its efforts to penetrate the Australian market.\u201cOur mother used her spare bedroom to store inventory for us,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would go down to the post office, maybe two or three times a day, depending on demand, to send off orders to Australian customers.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s one of the happiest people in Australia that Amazon is here \u2014 she gets her spare bedroom back,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}

Everyone lived close to the ground in a setting renowned for its natural beauty.Now the things being shipped are virtual, and vast amounts of office space are needed to design, build and market them. Salesforce, a company that did not exist 20 years ago, will take up residence on Jan. 8 in the new Salesforce Tower, which at 1,070 feet is the tallest office building west of the Mississippi.Skyscrapers tell a different story. They are the pyramids of our civilization, permanent monuments of our existence. They show who is in charge and what they think about themselves. Salesforce Tower is breaking a San Francisco height record that stood for nearly half a century.\u201cA ceiling has been breached,\u201d said Alison Isenberg, a professor of urban history at Princeton University. \u201cNow the discussion becomes is this just a building that is taller than the ones we already had, or does it raise new questions about the nature of the city?\u201dSalesforce Tower is visible from just about everywhere. Go to the farthest edges of the city and its 61 stories of tapered steel and glass stick up like a forceful thumb. On the drive north from the airport, the tower is the one building discernible over Potrero Hill. From the distant North Bay, it is the first thing you notice as San Francisco sheds its customary morning fog. The building catches the morning sun, dazzling the way none of its lesser neighbors do.The tower is not beautiful but is impossible to ignore. The top floors are set off from the rest, and the crown is flat rather than a spire. It looks as if a rocket were stowed up there, an escape vehicle for the tech overlords when the city is consumed by disaster.\u201cSan Francisco has gone from being driven by multitudes of industries in 2007 to being now focused largely on tech,\u201d said Colin Yasukochi, a CBRE analyst. \u201cThe growth feeds on itself. Tech workers are attracted to the great opportunities in the city, and the supply of workers means more tech companies come here.\u201dSan Francisco has always been like this. There were so few skyscrapers in the city\u2019s first century that the ones that were built tell a tale of rampant egos and unrestrained power. At the end of the 19th century, the city\u2019s newspapers had hubris and wealth to rival today\u2019s internet companies. In 1890, the owner of the San Francisco Chronicle, M. H. de Young, erected a 10-story building worthy of his publication. It was the tallest building on the West Coast.That irked the new owners of the Call newspaper, the Spreckels family, who in 1895 commissioned a tower of their own mere feet from the Chronicle building. It would be more than half again as tall \u2014 18 stories \u2014 and would be, they promised, \u201cthe finest building ever erected for a newspaper office.\u201d It had a 60-foot terra cotta Baroque dome, four corner cupolas and spectacular flourishes.That was just the beginning. Today\u2019s inhabitants of Silicon Valley are no slouches at self-promotion, but even they could learn something from The Call, which published a report calling its new headquarters \u201cthe crowning achievement of mankind in the Western world.\u201dSalesforce, co-founded and run by Marc Benioff, is wisely saying no such thing. It makes software that lets companies handle their relationships with customers better, and so passes unnoticed by the general public. Next year, it will most likely surpass Wells Fargo as the largest private employer in the city.San Francisco has always had conflicting feelings about growth and wealth. It was a gold rush boomtown but in the 1960s was home to the Diggers, a hippie offshoot that dreamed of a society without money. That notion lingered in a thousand communes.\u201cThe mid-1960s and early 1970s in San Francisco simultaneously saw a downtown building boom and by far the nation\u2019s strongest anti-skyscraper movement,\u201d said Ms. Isenberg, author of \u201cDesigning San Francisco: Art, Land and Urban Renewal in the City by the Bay.\u201d \u201cThey went hand in hand.\u201dThe leader of the opposition was Alvin Duskin, a dress manufacturer \u2014 he is said to be the first to use the peace sign in fashion \u2014 and local agitator. \u201cStop them from burying our city under a skyline of tombstones,\u201d one ad urged, while another proclaimed: \u201cNew studies have shown that the more we build high-rise, the more expensive it becomes to live here.\u201dThe protests had an effect. The Transamerica Pyramid was shaved down from 1,040 feet to 853 feet. A proposition in 1971 to limit buildings to six stories did not pass, but it was one of those defeats that is also a bit of a victory. The Transamerica Pyramid remained the tallest in the city until this year.\u201cA set of compromises was struck over heights and growth and redevelopment that held,\u201d Ms. Isenberg said. \u201cNow they will need to be renegotiated.\u201dThe Transamerica Pyramid became a beloved local landmark and universally recognized symbol of the city. Salesforce, if it is smart and lucky, might see its headquarters become the same. The company\u2019s offices are concentrated on the lower floors, but it is also leasing the 60th and 61st, the latter of which is a 17,000-square-foot event space that nonprofits can use for free. That\u2019s one way to build good will. Already 55 groups have inquired.If Salesforce executives ever get too full of themselves, and become convinced they are the crowning achievement of the Western world, they can seek out the Call building.In 1938, the dome was removed, and the remains were stripped of all architectural splendor. The building \u2014 whose high-tech tenants include a venture capitalist and a DNA sequencing start-up \u2014 is currently getting a face-lift, but its past glory is gone for good.As for The Call itself, the paper disappeared many decades ago, leaving no trace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why You Should Love Secondhand Fashion Now", "Date": "2017-12-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritical ShopperThe following is a real story about the RealReal, a luxury consignment start-up that now has a brick-and-mortar store in SoHo. A few months ago, a friend walked into an intimate gathering wearing a daisy print C\u00e9line skirt. One of our mutual friends said to her, \u201cI saw that on the RealReal.\u201d Another said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy you were the one who got it.\u201d This is perhaps how billionaires chat after a Sotheby\u2019s auction, which is not the camaraderie and pride one would expect to hear about secondhand shopping.The huge success (the RealReal has raised $173 million since its founding) of various consignment sites feels opposed to the foundering retail business. There is Grailed, which focuses on street wear, and Heroine, a women\u2019s wear counterpart, along with Vestiaire Collective and 1stdibs. They have consumed the middle market, taking customers for whom actual luxury pricing is too real \u2026 real.Shopping consignment is also a beautiful distraction. It is fashion Candy Crush; finding and scoring certain pieces can feel like a personal victory. Women I know who are familiar with the RealReal said they\u2019ve started looking at it daily; the rest of the world is just too real \u2026 real.Founded in 2011 by Julie Wainwright, a dot-com boom-and-bust dynamo who began working in tech in the 1990s, most notably as chief executive of Pets.com (if you recall, its commercials featured a dog sock puppet whose personality was \u201cbro Lambchop\u201d), the RealReal offers consignment with the promise of authentication by one of the company\u2019s expert staff members.All items on display in the store are simultaneously available to shop online. Sales associates can scan items for customers in person, temporarily removing them from the site while they\u2019re being considered on the floor. Even while shopping in the store, there is the same it-could-disappear-at-any-moment feeling you get online.In the store which was designed by Courtney Applebaum, the interior designer for the Row (a label represented on almost every rack), you can wait on gorgeous textural couches while your pieces are appraised. There is a flower stall at the front where you can buy stems by Fox Fodder Farm, a coffee bar downstairs and weekly events and workshops, like Faux Fridays, which instruct attendees on how to spot fake Louis Vuitton, Chanel and designer sneakers.In the middle of the floor is a collaborator-curated space, and this month the selection was chosen by Vanessa Traina and Allee Goldstein of the Line. Nearby, one can slide racks of clothing out from a large console of hidden cabinets. They swoosh out deliciously, packed with treasures. A friend described the sensation of unveiling these clothes as incredibly erotic.Upon entering, the first two things I checked out were the same price: a Frank Stella copper lithograph and a Balenciaga leather jacket with a shearling collar ($2,500). A saleswoman approached and struck up a conversation that bopped its way to the question \u201cSo what do you do with your art history degree?\u201dIn a charming scene in Greta Gerwig\u2019s film \u201cLady Bird,\u201d the titular character and her mother bicker at a rack in an expansive thrift store. Their combative parlance hits a wall when the mother pulls out a peachy vintage dress, cooing, \u201cDo you love it?\u201dLady Bird replies, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d The two shift instantly to loving, fawning friends. It\u2019s delightful.My youthful experiences in thrift stores with my mother followed the opposite emotional structure. We would have some of our nicest conversations among the racks, until I found something I wanted; then the (low stakes) conflict would begin, almost always over the size of a garment I was holding.My mother would see a women\u2019s 3X or girls 14 tag and, probably exhausted because I was known to idle in the store\u2019s fluorescent-lit dust for up to five hours a weekend, protest. \u201cThat\u2019s not your size,\u201d she would say.I would argue, \u201cSize doesn\u2019t exist in this space!\u201d And I still believe that to thrift or shop consignment, a little of this philosophy is required.A size 8 on one tag in the RealReal may be the same measurements as a size zero on another. At the store, clothes are arranged on Extra-Small/Small racks and Medium/Large racks. But really, the size of the clothes depends on how you want them to fit, and it\u2019s a game of eyeing and trying. Unlike the website, clothes here are arranged only by size, not by type or color or designer (apart from one Gucci rack, where there was a leather bag for $2,850 with \u201cREAL\u201d painted in yellow above the logo).Size is abstract to me even in a store with a single brand, but a friend I was with said she didn\u2019t like her position in the space to be about her size. Fair enough. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible to encounter a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t click on on the site.Online, the pieces are photographed beautifully, masking (not in a deceptive way) wear in the fabric. When you can hold them, it\u2019s a different experience. A Chanel tweed blazer with a loose button is $1,295. There were little threads, fabric that\u2019s not worn out but was definitely sighing, and tiny snags on many items. Wool Proenza pants ($225), a cotton Tome dress ($295) and a suede Acne skirt ($245) are all worth it if one longed for them on the runway.Many pieces seem to be under $300, or else above $1,200. I found a few exceptions, but when you see $1,395 consistently, a sudden $295 feels like a precious mistake to be grabbed immediately.In other consignment shops in the city, I let my mind wonder if the clothes belong to someone recently deceased. Here it\u2019s possible to mostly dissociate from their former lives and think only about the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Bot Stole Christmas: Toys Like Fingerlings Are Snapped Up and Resold", "Date": "2017-12-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFingerlings, those colorful chirping monkeys (and sloths and unicorns) that wrap around your finger, have become one of the most desired toys on holiday shopping lists.\u201cIf it\u2019s popular, it\u2019s going to be taken by bots and resold,\u201d said Omri Iluz, the co-founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm PerimeterX, in a phone interview.The bots work by constantly pinging retail websites, searching for sales and analyzing URLs.The moment an item is in stock, the software runs through the checkout process at a speed that is \u201ccompletely inhuman,\u201d said Mr. Iluz, whose company protects large retailers and other organizations from bot attacks.The bots are drawn to scarce items \u201clike sharks to blood\u201d and use web-scraping techniques to guess the ID of an unreleased product, PerimeterX explains on its website. That allows scalpers to buy products before an official sale becomes public. Bots can also subscribe to online notifications of sales and bypass purchasing limits set by retailers by using multiple internet addresses.It was an all-consuming job.\u201cI have had dreams about Fingerlings,\u201d she said.On Amazon, Fingerlings priced at $15 will sometimes last as long as 25 minutes, Ms. Oliver said.\u201cThey are the only one that if I throw it up on social media I feel like my people have a chance to get it before it disappears,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had readers comment that they\u2019ve put the Fingerlings in their cart on the Walmart website and when they go to check out, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWalmart did not respond to a request for comment.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us says on its website that Fingerlings are available in its brick-and-mortar stores. When asked about the cyber bots, the retailer declined to comment, referring instead to a statement from Christin Fernandez, vice president for communications for the Retail Industry Leaders Association that said retailers and suppliers \u201care working around the clock to make sure American families have access to the season\u2019s hottest items\u201d and are \u201ccommitted to taking precautions to mitigate fraud and illegal transactions.\u201dAmazon said Tuesday that it monitors bot buying activity, and attempts to limit the purchase of high-demand products.Target has also taken measures to deter resellers, said a company spokesman, Eddie Baeb, \u201cincluding quantity limits for purchases and technologies designed to help us monitor and prevent reseller activity.\u201dOther hot toys, like the Barbie Hello Dreamhouse, the L.O.L. Surprise! Doll and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System NES Classic Edition have also sold out, but are appearing on Amazon and eBay advertised at prices several times higher than retail.\u201cThe entire ecosystem breaks down,\u201d Mr. Iluz said. Bots are making legal purchases, but they don\u2019t become loyal customers, and they won\u2019t leave positive reviews.And customers get frustrated.\u201cWhen an advertised item is unavailable because of out-of-stocks, customers don\u2019t blame bots, they blame the retailer,\u201d Roger Beahm, a professor of marketing at the Wake Forest University School of Business, said in an email.On Sunday, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, asked retail trade associations to take action.\u201cWhen it comes to purchasing products online, major retailers should put forth policies that will help prevent future Grinch bots from stealing the season\u2019s hottest toys,\u201d he said in a statement.Unusual purchases ought to raise a red flag said Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.\u201cSay there\u2019s a suspicious order placed \u2014 for example a massive quantity at extreme speed \u2014 they should be able to have some human intervention in that transaction and potentially block the sale,\u201d Mr. Roefaro said in an email.David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said in a statement Monday that the federation shares Mr. Schumer\u2019s concerns, \u201cand we look forward to working with him and all interested parties to strengthen enforcement against bad actors and take away the tools being used against innocent consumers, particularly during the holiday season.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who also co-sponsored the BOTS Act, said in a phone interview Tuesday that he aimed to introduce new legislation to combat the \u201cplague\u201d of bots that buy up toys, sneakers and other popular retail items.\u201cI think if there was a specific law it would encourage and empower the Federal Trade Commission or criminal investigators to go after them, and we might learn more about them and identify some of the specific culprits,\u201d he said.The yearly rush to buy the hottest toy is often guided by emotions, Mr. Beahm said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Mother\u2019s Maiden Name Is Not a Secret", "Date": "2017-12-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionResolutions to shake laziness, get organized and gain control of finances are ritually adopted each January and abandoned soon after. But there\u2019s one common bad habit that consumers and billion-dollar businesses alike should have quit long ago and can\u2019t afford to carry into 2018: the use of weak website security questions.Security questions are astonishingly insecure: The answers to many of them are easily researched or guessed, yet they can be the sole barrier to someone gaining access to your account. The cryptology and security expert Bruce Schneier once described them as an \u201ceasier-to-guess low-security backup password that sites want you to have in case you forget your harder-to-remember higher-security password.\u201dStill, this technology has persisted despite the availability of two-factor authentication, and on sites that we use frequently and that contain important, sensitive data \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, eBay, PayPal and many banks and airlines.There has been no shortage of incidents demonstrating these questions\u2019 vulnerabilities. In 2005, Paris Hilton\u2019s T-Mobile account was hacked by a teenager who, like anyone who searched \u201cParis Hilton Chihuahua\u201d on the internet, knew the answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite pet\u2019s name?\u201d In 2008, Sarah Palin\u2019s Yahoo account was hacked by a college student who reset her password using her birth date, ZIP code and the place where she met her spouse. In 2014, after nude photos of several Hollywood actresses were leaked, Apple reported that their iCloud accounts had been hacked through \u201ca very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions.\u201dIf you aren\u2019t famous enough to be a target, you may still be a victim of a mass data breach. Whereas passwords are usually stored in hashed or encrypted form, answers to security questions are often stored \u2014 and therefore stolen \u2014 in plain text, as users entered them. This was the case in the 2015 breach of the extramarital encounters site Ashley Madison, which affected 32 million users, and in some of the Yahoo breaches, disclosed over the past year and a half, which affected all of its three billion accounts.The Equifax breach this year may have revealed some users\u2019 security questions and answers outright, and it certainly gave thieves enough personal information to answer common questions. TransUnion evidently did not heed this warning: Users wishing to freeze their credit files in the wake of the Equifax breach have to create an account, and to do so they must choose a security question, such as \u201cWhat city were you born in?\u201dAccording to Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, organizations continue to use security questions because they are easy to set up technically, and easy for users. \u201cIf you ask someone their favorite color, that\u2019s not a drama,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to give you a straight answer. If you say, \u2018Hey, please download this authenticator app and point the camera at a QR code on the screen,\u2019 you\u2019re starting to lose people.\u201d Some organizations have made a risk-based decision to retain this relatively weak security measure, often letting users opt for it over two-factor authentication, in the interest of getting people signed up.Security questions ask for something you know about yourself, and to be even moderately secure, they should ask for something only you know. It\u2019s exceedingly difficult to design questions that do this. Many security questions ask for biographical information that is publicly available, whether in open records or via social media: where you were married, your first phone number, your paternal grandfather\u2019s middle name.Aside from these questions\u2019 vulnerability to a little research (to say nothing of nosy parents or malicious exes), none of them are relevant to all adults. How many of us can answer the premillennial \u201cWhat city were you in to celebrate the year 2000?\u201d or \u201cWhat year did you take out your first mortgage?\u201d And how many Indian- or Brazilian-born users went to a high school without a mascot, or grew up on a street with no name? How many of our mothers never changed their names?The other main type of security question asks for a subjective answer. Such questions imagine lives punctuated by distinct firsts and bests and filled with enduring favorites, but favorites and bests and even firsts can change when people maintain accounts for decades. At some point, both factual and subjective security questions become archaeological. \u201cIn what month did you meet your significant other?\u201d requires a framing question: Whom were you with when you set up this account?A 2015 study by Google engineers found that only 47 percent of people could remember what they put down as their favorite food a year earlier \u2014 and that hackers were able to guess the food nearly 20 percent of the time, with Americans\u2019 most common answer being pizza. (Google has been phasing out security questions in recent years.) Even when people remember their answers, they sometimes forget their precise form. This hazard has prompted some websites to offer a fixed set of answers. To \u201cWhat is your favorite type of reading?\u201d United Airlines offers a pull-down menu with 19 options, including blogs, cookbooks, professional development and self-help, but nothing like literary fiction (the death of the novel?).As long as security questions are going to be used, professional consensus holds, they should have many possible answers, and each of those possible answers should be simple, stable, memorable and not easily researched or guessed. But questions that are sufficiently general to apply to most people almost never fulfill these requirements: \u201cWhat is your favorite season?\u201d \u201cWhat is your favorite fabric?\u201d \u201cWho is your favorite person in history?\u201dEven exceptions that look good at first fall short. \u201cWhat is the last name of the teacher who gave you your first failing grade?\u201d includes an assumption about academic records; strangely, it appears on the LSAT registration website, whose users\u2019 transcripts are likely to be too unblemished to furnish an answer. \u201cWhat was the name of the boy/girl you had your second kiss with?\u201d is impossible in its Proustian hyperspecificity. Then there\u2019s the State Bank of India\u2019s vertiginous \u201cWhat is the website that you rarely visit?\u201d which reads like a Zen koan whose purpose is to make you reflect on the unknowability of the answer.What would a truly powerful security question be? The ideal is a science-fiction scenario where your future self calls your past self, and your past self asks your future self to prove it\u2019s you. When given the chance to write their own questions, though, most people choose not an intimate secret but something more like \u201c1+1=?\u201dThe temporary solution, Mr. Hunt says, is to create false answers and to keep them somewhere safe, whether in a password manager (which can generate and store a random string for each answer field) or even on a piece of paper. Security questions pit \u201cusability against security,\u201d said Mr. Schneier, the cryptology and security expert, and the former usually wins.Security questions are premised on a paradox: Our experiences are at once universal and particular to us. Yet it seems we are all lazy in exactly the same way.Anne Diebel is a senior investigator at the private investigations firm QRI.Advertisement"}
