{"Headline": "How North Korea Managed to Defy Years of Sanctions", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byDANDONG, China \u2014 As the end of the fashion season approached, and the suits and dresses arrived in her company\u2019s warehouses here in the Chinese border town of Dandong, the accountant crammed about $100,000 into a backpack, then boarded a rickety train with several co-workers.After a six-hour journey, she recalled, they arrived at a factory where hundreds of women using high-end European machines sewed clothes with \u201cMade in China\u201d labels. Her boss handed the money to the North Korean manager, all of it in American bills as required.Fraudulent labeling helps support its garment industry, which generated more than $500 million for the isolated nation last year, according to Chinese trade data.But China has a long record of shielding North Korea from more painful sanctions, because it is afraid of a regime collapse that could send refugees streaming across the border and leave it with a more hostile neighbor.Foreign trade, primarily with China, has surged, too, more than doubling since 2000, though it has slipped in the past three years.In theory, North Korea\u2019s greater openness to trade makes it more vulnerable to sanctions, with new potential targets and pressure points. But it also highlights the limits of an approach to sanctions \u2014 defined largely by China at the United Nations \u2014 that aims to punish North Korea\u2019s military and ruling elite while sparing its people. As trade expands, the lines have blurred.Positioned near the mouth of the Yalu River, Dandong is China\u2019s largest border town, and much of North Korea\u2019s trade with the world flows across its old bridges or through its deepwater port.Ms. Lang, 33, moved here more than a decade ago to study environmental protection. She ended up like many with ambition in this city of more than three million: doing business with North Korea.She wears exquisite makeup and carries a Louis Vuitton handbag, and she said her role in the garment trade was straightforward: Orders come in from Japan, Europe and other parts of China, and she gets the clothes made.For those with quick deadlines or detailed specifications, she turns to Chinese factories in Dandong, where quality control is better. Yet even these factories employ North Korean laborers, she said.For decades, North Korea has been accused of sending workers abroad and confiscating most of their wages, an arrangement that activists liken to slave labor. Researchers say the practice has expanded since Mr. Kim took power, with more than 50,000 workers now toiling in up to 40 countries.In Dandong, the local government boasts that 10,000 North Koreans are employed in its apparel factories, working 12- to 14-hour shifts, with just two to four days off each month and a monthly wage of no more than $260.Ms. Lang sends more-flexible orders to North Korea, where costs are lower but it is impossible to guarantee delivery dates because of power failures and a shortage of trucks.Her company ships fabric, buttons and zippers to factories there, she said, because the North lacks the materials, and they put \u201cMade in China\u201d labels in garments to make them easier to sell overseas. That would most likely be considered fraud and a violation of place-of-origin rules in countries that import the clothes, experts said.Paul Tjia, managing director of GPI Consultancy, a Dutch company that offers advice on doing business in North Korea, said that some European clients had ordered hundreds of thousands of garments and that \u201cMade in China\u201d labels could be justified by additional work put into the clothes inside China.But he added: \u201cI\u2019m not a garment manufacturer. I just make the introductions.\u201dChina has kept North Korea\u2019s garment sector off the list of industries targeted by United Nations sanctions, arguing that punishing it would hurt ordinary people and not military programs. It has protected North Korea\u2019s seafood industry using the same argument.But it is difficult to say who benefits from this trade, in part because even private enterprise in North Korea is overseen by state officials who extract taxes and bribes.\u201cWhether the proceeds from the textile industry support the nuclear program is an open question,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a former American ambassador involved in sanctions policy. \u201cMoney is fungible.\u201dAnd South Korean officials say the millions paid by Chinese companies to fish in North Korean waters go primarily to firms controlled by the North\u2019s military.Sanctions also do not cover the organized export of labor. The United States has urged countries to eject North Korean workers, saying their remittances benefit the military, not their families. But China, Russia and other nations continue to hire them.The United Nations Security Council did not impose sanctions until July 2006, when, after a series of missile tests, it banned countries from selling material for missiles or weapons of mass destruction to North Korea.The North detonated its first nuclear device months later, followed by additional tests in 2009 and 2013, and two in 2016. The Security Council tightened sanctions after each test, as well as after a satellite launch in 2013. It targeted military supplies and luxury goods, shut Pyongyang out of the international financial system and, most recently, banned a range of mineral exports.\u201cHow much cooperation will the international community get from Cuba, Russia, Iran or even Pakistan, Bangladesh or Laos?\u201d asked Stephan Haggard, an expert on the North Korean economy at the University of California, San Diego.The United States has also urged a boycott of Air Koryo, the North Korean airline, but it still flies to China and Russia. Chinese tourism to North Korea is booming, said Cha Yong Hyok, whose company, Indprk, takes groups by train to Pyongyang and will soon use new flights from Dandong.The North often circumvents banking sanctions using front companies and agents overseas, and North Koreans routinely send and receive payments using Chinese intermediaries who take a commission, despite the ban on \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers.\u201cWe can and should go after these targets, but turning this into a game of financial cat-and-mouse will never achieve the level of pressure needed,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, a former Treasury Department official involved in sanctions enforcement.Ultimately, he argued, that pressure will come only if China makes a strategic decision to truly squeeze the North. \u201cThough China has taken helpful steps at times,\u201d he said, \u201cit has never been willing to go all in.\u201dMany of China\u2019s best-known companies have done business with North Korea even as they have sought customers and investors in the United States or relied on American-made parts and materials. ZTE, the mobile phone and electronics manufacturer, for example, shipped about $15 million of goods to the North in 2015, according to Chinese customs records viewed via the global trade database company Panjiva.But many Chinese companies sell products to North Korea without such problems. The electric car and battery maker BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns a 10 percent stake, has shipped $14 million in goods to North Korea since 2012, including rubber products in January and vehicles in December, customs records show. BYD and Berkshire Hathaway didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Just about every big Chinese appliance maker does business with North Korea, too, shipping refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions and other electronics. The major Chinese automakers sell vehicles to the North as well.Even Tsingtao Brewery shows up in customs records, delivering $20,000 worth of beer in the summer of 2014.United Nations sanctions prohibit the sale of luxury goods to North Korea, but countries are generally left to define what that means. The resolutions list jewelry, luxury automobiles, sports equipment and snowmobiles but make no mention of televisions, consumer electronics or home appliances.In some cases, Chinese companies with access to advanced technology are doing business with North Korea. Subsidiaries of the defense manufacturer Norinco made seven shipments, mostly of electronic and optical goods, worth a total of $1.5 million, in the second half of last year, records say. Norinco did not respond to a request for comment.Matthew Brazil, a security consultant and former diplomat for the United States who investigated Chinese trade controls in the 1990s, said it was often impossible to get China to follow up on leads suggesting Chinese firms were violating restrictions. \u201cThree months later, if you\u2019re lucky, the visit is scheduled, and many times, visits weren\u2019t scheduled at all,\u201d he said.Mr. Brazil said the problem had persisted, and \u201cany level of control of American electronics has completely collapsed because this technology can be so easily shipped from China to North Korea.\u201dOn AliExpress, an e-commerce platform run by the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, six of the nine shipping services list North Korea as a potential destination. Alibaba declined to comment.The manager of a shipping firm in Dandong who asked to be identified only by her surname, Li, because of the nature of her work said shipping a package of electronics to North Korea was straightforward \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t have obvious labels\u201d and meets weight requirements.In fact, a delivery is more likely to run into problems on the North Korean side of the border than with customs inspectors in China. \u201cThe key,\u201d she said, \u201cis to make sure everything is fine with the people on the other side.\u201dJane Perlez and Yufan Huang reported from Dandong, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "In China, Umbrellas and Basketballs Join the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China may be oversharing.Today, Chinese start-ups want to share umbrellas, concrete mixers and mobile phone power banks. One wants to share basketballs.As Chinese entrepreneurs and investors pile in, some skeptical industry insiders are wondering: Has China reached \u201cpeak sharing?\u201d\u201cAfter all these years, China is finally embracing its communist roots,\u201d said Andy Tian, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of communism: communal sharing.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a bubble,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may have roots in something valuable, but can you really share everything?\u201dChinese entrepreneurs like Xu Min think that, quite possibly, you can. In March, the 30-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiaxing, a town in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, came up with the idea of a basketball-sharing service after he heard some friends complain about the inconvenience of carrying a ball around.Just four days later, Mr. Xu set up Zhulegeqiu, which in Chinese is a pun that roughly means \u201cRent a Ball.\u201d It lets users rent basketballs from custom-designed automated lockers at basketball courts around the country. To rent a ball, users scan a code on the locker with their smartphone camera, unlocking a compartment holding a basketball.Zhulegeqiu charges users about one renminbi, or about 15 cents, per hour for rental. A deposit of about $10 is required unless the user has a high rating on Sesame Credit, the social credit scoring system developed by China\u2019s Ant Financial, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.\u201cIn the long run, it may be more cost-effective to buy rather than rent a ball,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cBut we think Chinese users are willing to pay a little more for convenience.\u201dEarlier this month, Zhulegeqiu received around $1.4 million in venture investment from Modern Capital, a Shanghai-based venture capital firm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of money bouncing around,\u201d said Zhou Wei, chief executive of XNode, a start-up accelerator and co-working space in Shanghai, \u201cand foolish investments being made.\u201dIn its latest iteration, the sharing economy in China has evolved into something like an internet-enabled rental business. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, which provide a platform that connects users to existing resources, the latest sharing companies in China own the product and rent it out to users.\u201cIn China, average incomes are still very low and the market in many ways is still very price-conscious,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo if the technology is there to support it and there\u2019s a viable business model, there are all sorts of sharing economy or pseudo-sharing economy businesses that can potentially do very well.\u201dThe Chinese government sees promise in sharing. It estimates sharing last year accounted for $500 billion in transactions, and projected it would account for 10 percent of China\u2019s economic output by 2020.All that drives ideas that may seem puzzling to others \u2014 including Shen Weiwei\u2019s umbrella-sharing business.Mr. Shen, an entrepreneur, acknowledges that it may be difficult for his start-up, a shared umbrella service called Molisan, to turn a profit. Molisan, which means \u201cMagic Umbrella,\u201d will reap only small profit margins charging one renminbi (15 cents) to rent an umbrella for 12 hours from one of Molisan\u2019s custom-designed kiosks, and customers could end up stealing them.But Mr. Shen said he was confident that others would see the public and environmental benefits of having an umbrella-sharing service. So far, Molisan has already reached agreements with both the Guangzhou and Fuzhou city subway companies to place kiosks there. The goal, he said, is to have an umbrella kiosk within a 100-meter range at all times.\u201cEveryone at home has a lot of umbrellas, but we never have them when we really need them,\u201d said Mr. Shen. \u201cIf we are successful, then users will no longer have to buy umbrellas.\u201dMany remain skeptical. \u201cSharing basketballs, sharing umbrellas \u2014 these are all bad ideas,\u201d said Allen Zhu, Shanghai-based managing director at GSR Ventures, which was an early investor in Didi Chuxing, the popular bike-sharing company Ofo and Xiaodian. \u201cThey\u2019re both very tied to a particular location, which makes it difficult for the company to expand.\u201dEntrepreneurs like Mr. Xu, of Zhulegeqiu, disagree, though they acknowledge challenges.For one, the company does not appear to have found a sustainable way to recover stolen balls. During initial testing, Mr. Xu said, one competitor stole a basketball to analyze it more closely. Zhulegeqiu had the thief\u2019s contact information and recovered it through an old-fashioned strategy: incessant telephone calls.\u201cWe thought about putting GPS trackers on the balls,\u201d said Xu Jie, chief executive of Modern Capital, the venture capital firm backing Zhulegeqiu, and no relation to its founder. \u201cBut we did the math and we discovered that hiring a few people to physically track them down was cheaper.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Strength and Its Shopping Lift Alibaba\u2019s Results", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s vast ranks of consumers are finding ways to spend more money online \u2014 and that\u2019s good news for Alibaba.Alibaba\u2019s results offer a positive sign for those tracking China\u2019s efforts to transform its economy to rely less on government spending and more on American-style consumption. But they also show Alibaba is finding more ways to get the businesses that set up shop on its e-commerce platforms to give it more money.But there are challenges. The results show Alibaba has a long way to go before it can diversify its business amid expectations that even China\u2019s online sales boom has its limits. And Alibaba is increasingly dipping its toe into American politics at an uncertain time.Alibaba said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 85 percent to $1.4 billion, thanks to strong sales as well as selling some investments. Sales across its e-commerce businesses rose 47 percent.While that\u2019s good news for the company, full-year results showed a more complex picture. Alibaba\u2019s revenue for the year grew more than twice as fast as its gross merchandise volume, a measure of sales volume, meaning much of the rise did not come from simply selling more stuff. Alibaba also is finding ways to squeeze more money out of vendors big and small, either by offering new services or charging more for existing ones.Because even China can\u2019t grow forever, Alibaba is hoping to find new sources of revenue. One of the most promising, according to analysts, has been to introduce its own business providing back-end computing to businesses \u2014 much like Amazon Web Services. While growth in the business remains strong, it is from a small base, and some analysts have signaled concern about increasing competition. In the quarter, Alibaba\u2019s cloud revenue more than doubled, to $314 million.It has also expanded into online entertainment and film, hoping to make use of its advertising data and customers to become a cultural force. The company\u2019s main online video acquisition, Youku Tudou, has fallen behind rivals in users and time spent per user. While in the long term it could pay off, in the shorter term heavy investment in content could cut into Alibaba\u2019s margins.Over all, the businesses outside Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business were unprofitable in the quarter.Alibaba has said this year will be the year it pushes in earnest outside China\u2019s borders. While the company\u2019s core business is still in China, some signs show that its efforts overseas are starting to pick up steam. In a recent note the boutique investment bank China Renaissance pointed out that Lazada, a Southeast Asian e-commerce company that Alibaba invested in last year, now leads in market share in the six major countries in the region. Alibaba\u2019s primary branded overseas e-commerce site, AliExpress, has also been picking up customers in Brazil, Russia and Eastern Europe, according to China Renaissance.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Fashion Designers Flock to City of T-Shirts and Flip-Flops", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byXiamen JournalAnd so, last September, Ms. Wang finally made her escape. Like a bird in search of warmer climes, she fled south to Xiamen, a coastal city between Hong Kong and Shanghai. She set up a studio in a four-story mansion in a quiet neighborhood on Xiamen Island, just a short walk from the beach.On a recent sunny afternoon, an ocean breeze blew in through the studio\u2019s open windows. Gritty Beijing, so often blanketed in smog and traffic, felt like a world away.\u201cIn Beijing, there was no such thing as work-life balance,\u201d said Ms. Wang, 32, settling into a vintage raspberry-colored leather armchair. \u201cBut here in Xiamen, I can slow down my pace and focus on my collections. I\u2019m much happier here.\u201dIn moving to Xiamen, Ms. Wang became the latest addition to a small but robust community of up-and-coming young Chinese fashion designers who have forgone the glamour of cosmopolitan Shanghai and Beijing in favor of off-the-beaten-path Xiamen.Together, the designers are behind some of the most cutting-edge fashion trends coming out of China. That strikes many as curious, given they are working out of a city where the concept of fashion seems to be an afterthought.The term \u201cchill\u201d comes up often in discussions about Xiamen. Visitors to the city stroll along boulevards lined with stately colonial buildings, the legacy of 19th-century European traders who once frequented the port of Xiamen \u2014 then known as Amoy \u2014 looking to exchange sugar and opium for Chinese tea and porcelain.But it is precisely Xiamen\u2019s laid-back vibe that attracts designers like Ms. Liu. The harbor city of almost four million consistently ranks near the top in lists of most livable cities in China. Couples from around China flock to Xiamen to take romantic photos on the island\u2019s beaches.And what the city may lack in fashion sense, it more than makes up for with its abundant greenery, waterside cafe culture, and vibrant culinary scene. Here, an idea of a good night out means squeezing into a dimly lit hole-in-the-wall restaurant and feasting on fresh seafood and cold beer.\u201cXiamen is one of those rare cities where you can work really hard and get a lot done but you can also relax,\u201d said Ian Hylton, the president of Ms Min and former creative director of men\u2019s wear for Ports, which maintains its China headquarters in Xiamen.Unlike Ms. Wang, who sought out Xiamen as a refuge, the other designers in the so-called Xiamen gang settled here more by circumstance. Many, including Mr. Zhe, Ms. Liu of Deepmoss and Ms. Liu of Ms Min, grew up in the region.But what keeps them here is more than inertia. Work-life balance aside, there are concrete incentives to running a fashion label out of Xiamen. For one, the operation costs can be much lower in Xiamen than in Shanghai, China\u2019s de facto fashion capital, and Beijing, the nexus of China\u2019s fashion media.Ms. Wang estimated that she paid about one-quarter of what she would pay to rent a comparable studio space in Beijing. Skilled employees, like machinists, can also be easier to find, given the region\u2019s history as a garment manufacturing hub.Local designers can also apply for generous rent subsidies from the Xiamen city government, which has been eager to promote the city\u2019s image as a contemporary fashion hub.But taking government subsidies can come with challenges. Designers are often pressured by officials to participate in local government-sponsored fashion events. Accepting the benefits also subjects designers to strict regulations that often don\u2019t take into account the nuances of the fashion design business.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t really know what it\u2019s doing,\u201d said Ms. Wan, who is currently looking for a new studio. \u201cDesign studios are really a new thing for them. They\u2019ve never thought about how to differentiate between large-scale manufacturers and small design studios.\u201dStill, such drawbacks are minimal when compared with the city\u2019s relaxed lifestyle and many conveniences. The ease of communication platforms like Tencent\u2019s WeChat and the frequency of flights out of Xiamen have further bridged the gap, allowing local designers to tap into what has become a fast-moving fashion revolution in China, a country that just one generation ago had little option but to wear somber-colored Mao suits.\u201cThese days, Chinese designers are more international,\u201d said Mr. Zhe, who created Sankuanz in 2008 and has since mentored many young local designers. \u201cBut of course, the sense of nationality \u2014 that sense of being Chinese \u2014 can be difficult to shake off.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of India\u2019s leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States.The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers.\u201cBuilding talent pools that define the future of America is what we want to do,\u201d said Ravi Kumar S., Infosys\u2019s president, in a phone interview from Indiana.Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence, will be the first beneficiary of Infosys\u2019s hire-American efforts. The company intends to open a new technology and innovation office in or near Indianapolis in August, recruiting 100 new workers this year and several hundred more next year, with a goal of adding a total of 2,000 employees by 2021.Infosys said it would seek out three other sites for American expansion, looking for places that are close to clients and universities and where state and local governments are willing to offer significant economic incentives. The company already has an innovation hub in Silicon Valley.The majority of Infosys\u2019s business is in the United States, and it typically receives several thousand H-1B visas every year to bring in mostly entry-level Indian programmers who move from project to project at companies in industries like banking, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and energy.Infosys has hired more American college graduates in the last couple of years, said Mr. Kumar. And now clients in the United States want the company to have even more people on site locally. So it must expand its American work force significantly, he said.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.\u201cWe polled our customers and a lot of our newest locations require a lot of presence,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThis year, we are taking it to scale.\u201dMr. Kumar declined to say whether Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrant workers had influenced its decisions.Whether Infosys follows through on its ambitious goal of hiring 10,000 Americans in the next two years remains to be seen. The company, which employs more than 200,000 people globally, has slowed its overall hiring to a trickle as revenue growth has stalled. Mr. Kumar said the American expansion plans depend on expected client demand, as well as whether it can find and train enough college graduates with skills in artificial intelligence and other technical fields that it needs.Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, aggressively pursued Infosys, the company said at a news conference with Mr. Holcomb. Infosys already had a small work force of about 140 people in the state.In February, Indiana state officials were approached about a potential investment by Infosys executives via the Indiana India Business Council, a local business group, according to Jim Schellinger, the state\u2019s secretary of commerce.Mr. Schellinger and his team traveled to India in mid-March, meeting with Infosys\u2019s senior leadership and visiting its campuses in Bangalore and Mysore to make their pitch for the state. At the end of the month, Infosys representatives sat down with Mr. Holcomb and agreed to go ahead with plans to invest in the state.\u201cThey\u2019re going to hire a wide variety of people including people with four year degrees as well as two-year ones,\u201d said Mr. Schellinger. \u201cThese are high wage jobs, including software developers and architects.\u201dMr. Holcomb was ebullient at Tuesday\u2019s announcement in Indianapolis, thanking Infosys for showing confidence in the state\u2019s tech work force.\u201cYou can\u2019t even spell Indiana without starting with India,\u201d he said. \u201cToday is just the beginning of a great partnership.\u201dThe state is offering Infosys incentives worth up to $31 million for the project. Indiana intends to give the company $500,000 in training funds and $15,250 in conditional tax credits per new job created.Infosys argues that it saves money for major American companies and allows them to operate more efficiently.Critics say that companies like Infosys have taken advantage of the H-1B program, which is designed to complement the American skilled labor force, by bringing in workers who ultimately undercut it by taking lower wages. While the program is relatively small, accounting for about 85,000 visas per year, it has become a lightning rod in the debate about large companies outsourcing American jobs.The proposed changes to the H-1B visa program have alarmed Indian companies and government officials, since Indians receive about two-thirds of those visas. The country\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, discussed the visa issue with Mr. Trump in February, and Indian tech executives raised it with members of Congress during a visit to Washington about two months ago.\u201cOur objective was to make sure that a well-thought-out process was put in place,\u201d said R. Chandrashekhar, president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, India\u2019s leading tech trade group, in a phone interview after Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.Like American tech companies, the Indian outsourcers have trouble finding enough qualified Americans to fill jobs, he said. \u201cIf the Indian companies are not able to get the skills that are needed in the U.S. and not bring in skilled workers from somewhere else, then the only option is to move the job out of the United States or leave the job undone,\u201d he said.As one of the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, Infosys could be hit hard by changes to the system. Major American technology companies like Facebook and Qualcomm also use the program to hire foreign talent, arguing that they cannot find enough skilled workers in the United States. Still, outsourcing companies like Infosys have caused the most controversy.One suggestion \u2014 that H-1B visas be given to companies paying the highest wages \u2014 could particularly affect outsourcing companies like Infosys, which usually do not offer wages as high as the likes of Facebook. To that end, new operations in America could help offset those difficulties.Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalistic approach to business puts international companies in a difficult position. But for many Asian companies, it is a position they are familiar with, with the rhetoric reminiscent of the politics of business in their home countries. In recent years, India has introduced a so-called Make in India industrial policy to push companies like Apple to build out manufacturing plants in the country. Both Japan and China often exhibit the kind of economic nationalism that the Trump administration has championed.Still, their pledges won an endorsement from Mr. Trump. It is not clear whether such moves will ultimately help win political advantages from a president who has been skeptical about the benefits of trade agreements.Nelson D.
