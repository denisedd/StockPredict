{"Headline": "A Fatal and Fiery Photograph Reawakens Memories of a Soldier\u2019s Life", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byIn the days after Specialist Hilda Clayton was killed during a training exercise in Afghanistan, an online condolence book sprang up on a website hosted by The Augusta Chronicle, her hometown newspaper in Georgia. Friends and family shared memories of her human rights essay in school, her love of football, and the way she said \u201cMom and Dad I\u2019m home\u201d when she walked through the door.But then, like that day in 2013 when her voice went quiet at the age of 22, those online condolences, for the most part, fell silent too.Until this month.The last photograph taken by Specialist Clayton, a combat photographer who died during an exercise training Afghan soldiers, was made public for the first time last week, appearing in the May/June issue of the United States Army\u2019s Military Review magazine.It shows the moment that a mortar tube accidentally exploded, spraying debris and shrapnel. Somewhere behind that lens was Specialist Clayton, capturing the end of her life.It also suddenly reawakened the online condolence page set up in her memory. Last week, the reincarnated grief of those who knew her was echoed in a burst of new entries by people who did not, strangers from across the nation and the world.\u201cI never knew you, but have seen your final image. Respect from Australia,\u201d Nara O\u2019Neil, from Canberra, wrote on May 2.\u201cHilda, I don\u2019t know you but you are a hero. Amazing work. Those images are burned into my head and I am fine with that,\u201d Pedro Rodriguez, of Lynnwood, Wash., wrote on May 3.Her photograph went from obscurity to a widespread reawakening after it found its way to the Military Review. As editors began planning their latest issue, devoted to gender roles in military planning, William Darley, the managing editor, said they were told about the photo by a person who had served with her in Afghanistan. Specialist Clayton\u2019s family, including her husband, agreed to allow the magazine to publish it, he said.\u201cIt was an opportunity to highlight the sacrifice of one individual as a representative of soldiers, and her contribution as a female,\u201d Mr. Darley said in an interview. \u201cThere was not really an ethical dilemma.\u201dCalls to Specialist Clayton\u2019s family in Georgia and Florida were not returned.\u201cShe was a female doing a dangerous job at a time when gender integration was going on in the military,\u201d Mr. Darley said. \u201cShe was chronicling this important shift in strategy.\u201dOn the morning of July 2, 2013, Specialist Clayton was sent on a live-fire exercise to train Afghan soldiers in combat photography. Afghan soldiers and other American personnel were on the mission. At one point, one of the Afghan soldiers dropped a mortar round into the tube and a malfunction occurred, Maj. Steven Miller, Specialist Clayton\u2019s supervisor there, said in an interview.Flames billowed. Debris and shrapnel sprayed. An Afghan soldier put his hands to his ears \u2014 those were the movements that Specialist Clayton captured. An Afghan soldier named Tamim took another photograph of the same moment from a different angle. He and three other Afghans were also killed.Specialist Clayton\u2019s camera survived enough for her images to be retrieved.A memorial service was held for Specialist Clayton at the Gamberi base in Afghanistan, after her death. Kailey Brown, a sergeant who served with Specialist Clayton, said she first saw the photograph of the explosion at that ceremony.\u201cI was honestly proud they finally released the images,\u201d Ms. Brown said in an email. \u201cThey can be very tough to look at due to the graphic nature, but I think the best way we can honor her is to publish the images she died making.\u201dIn December 2013, her name was added to the Hall of Heroes at Fort George G. Meade, Md. Her unit named its annual award after her.Specialist Clayton attended Westside High School in Omaha, Neb., went to technical college in Augusta and graduated from the Defense Information School in 2012.But about three months later, on July 10, 2013, Ms. Woodfork was again writing to Specialist Clayton, this time in the online condolence book, addressing her after death: \u201cTake your rest, precious love. We have it from here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But with the end of the bigfoot season on April 27 \u2014 the date by which productions must have opened to compete for this June\u2019s Tony Awards \u2014 it\u2019s once again safe for the smart, weird shows to come out and play.Aside from revivals of established masterworks, including the Sondheim-Weidman musical \u201cPacific Overtures,\u201d at Classic Stage Company, and Beckett\u2019s \u201cHappy Days,\u201d at Theater for a New Audience, May looks to be hospitable to a wide range of proudly oddball productions, Off Broadway and beyond. Here are five that I\u2019m especially looking forward to on my first day as the new co-chief theater critic here at The New York Times.In 1954 it apparently seemed like a profitable notion to reset the story of Homer\u2019s \u201cIliad\u201d and \u201cOdyssey\u201d in Washington State, circa 1900, and turn it into a musical. The result was a three-month Broadway bomb. Still, over time, the delicious through-composed score by Jerome Moross and John Latouche, along with Mr. Latouche\u2019s clever book (Paris is a traveling salesman who runs off with Helen after an apple-pie-baking contest) turned the bomb into a cult.Who knows what this Encores! concert production, directed by Michael Berresse and starring Lindsay Mendez as Helen, and Ryan Silverman as Ulysses, may do for the show\u2019s reputation? In any case, the chance to hear the lush songs (including the standard \u201cLazy Afternoon\u201d) in their full orchestrations is probably, sadly, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Rachel Dolezal notwithstanding, most people don\u2019t get to choose their race \u2014 or, therefore, what kind of racism they will experience or engender. That limitation on our power of perspective is temporarily corrected in this immersive production, conceived and written by James Scruggs, in which audience members, before entering a \u201cdystopian theme park\u201d called SupremacyLand, decide at the door what race they will be. (And no, you can\u2019t change your mind once you\u2019re in.) Incorporating large-scale video, text and music, the work (directed by Tamilla Woodard and Kareem Fahmy, at 3LD Art & Technology Center) may not be for the interactively squeamish, but perhaps that\u2019s part of the point.Whether the speed of composition will prove to have served the drama remains to be seen, but the speed with which it is reaching audiences is already impressive. Aside from this New York production, directed by Ari Edelson at New World Stages, five theaters have taken it up or are scheduled to present it in the coming months.Likewise, her latest play, about a woman unable to choose what kind of life (and man) to make, may remind you of the 1864 Trollope novel with which it shares a title. Not a bad model. Amber Tamblyn, making her New York stage debut, stars, along with the Off Broadway familiars Darren Pettie, Frank Wood and Ella Dershowitz, under the direction of Peter DuBois at the Vineyard Theater.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Turmoil Is High, but Wall Street\u2019s Fear Gauge Is Very Low", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIt has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.This trend, which began soon after President Trump\u2019s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 \u2014 the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 \u2014 but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.\u201cThe pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. \u201cAnd all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201dSince the VIX reached a recent peak of 22 in the days before the election in November, it has fallen sharply as equity markets have rallied in the belief that the president\u2019s promises to slash regulations, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure would buoy the economy.The gauge generally moves in the opposite direction of the stock market. So with the major stock indexes having hit highs, it would make sense that the VIX would reach these unusual lows.But what is less clear is why investors have been so willing to ignore so many outcomes that would send stocks reeling.This means that even as Mr. Trump has difficulties in getting his bills passed, investors are not abandoning the stock market, but are switching out of stocks tied directly to a Trump recovery, for example, banks and industrial companies.The net effect of this rotation is a stock market that goes up and a VIX that goes down.\u201cThere has been this epic disconnect between soft and hard economic data,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cAnd investors are just not willing to sell out of their stocks right now.\u201dRussell Rhoads, the director of education at the VIX\u2019s home, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, calls the high level of faith investors have shown in the president\u2019s promise to reinvigorate the economy the Trump put.Now, Mr. Rhoads says, investors are making a similar wager on Mr. Trump.\u201cWe used to have the Greenspan put, maybe it is the Trump put now,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said, citing a propensity of investors to stay in the market despite political ups and downs. \u201cHe is so business-friendly \u2014 there is a view that whatever happens he will do things that spur economic growth.\u201dUnlike a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the VIX is not driven by stock prices but by the prices of options to buy or sell the S.&P. For that reason, it is a forward-looking indicator \u2014 30 days to be precise \u2014 that measures how volatile traders think the market will be before the option expires.One reason for the gauge\u2019s recent equanimity, Mr. Rhoads said, is that even when investors purchase options to sell the S.&P. index at a certain level (betting that the market will fall) to insure against a sell-off, they are at the same time keeping their broad exposure to stocks.It is this tricky balancing act that has kept the VIX at these low levels.Mr. Rhoads, a student of financial market history, noted that the index is what is known as \u201ca means reverting vehicle.\u201d This means that even if it stays at these low levels for a while, the index will spike up when the next bout of fear hits the market.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rubber band that stretches and stretches until it pops,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said. \u201cEveryone might be too confident right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That means\u00a0there are times during the year when the setting sun lines up with the east-\u00a0and west-running streets in\u00a0Manhattan.If\u00a0Manhattan\u00a0were\u00a0laid out so that it aligned exactly with east and west on a compass, Manhattanhenge would occur on the\u00a0spring\u00a0equinox\u00a0and\u00a0the fall equinox.\u00a0Instead, the city is\u00a030\u00a0degrees from cardinal east and west, so the dates are shifted.Manhattanhenge\u00a0appears either as a full-sun\u00a0event\u00a0or a half-sun\u00a0one.Manhattanhenge happens in pairs, as a full sun one day and a half sun the other. The full sun is when the bottom of the sun kisses the city grid, according to Dr. Faherty. The half sun is when the middle of the sun touches the grid.There\u2019s no real difference between the two except the order in which the sunsets occur.\u00a0This year,\u00a0we\u00a0get the half\u00a0sun on May 29\u00a0and the\u00a0full\u00a0sun on May 30.\u00a0This summer,\u00a0we\u2019ll\u00a0get the full\u00a0sun\u00a0on July 12\u00a0and\u00a0the half\u00a0sun on July 13. So the order is half-full-full-half.Whether you get a good show\u00a0depends on how cloudy it is.The key is finding a spot with a clear view of New Jersey. Dr. Faherty suggests going to a point where the streets are wide and the buildings are beautiful.The most popular spots are 42nd\u00a0Street, with its flashing signs, as well as 57th,\u00a034th,\u00a023rd\u00a0and 14th\u00a0Streets.

It\u2019s hard to avoid, and the tendency to look at a phrase like \u201coffice temp\u201d and not chase someone down the hall at work and say, \u201cHey! You\u2019re an office temp? You know, \u2018office temp\u2019 contains the word \u2018ice,\u2019 and what\u2019s left makes up two complete words, \u2018off\u2019 and \u2018temp.\u2019 It\u2019s possible that people might get off the elevator a floor early, just to avoid those conversations.My point is, it\u2019s an addictive habit.You might not even be interested in making puzzles of your own, but it\u2019s hard to play with words day in and day out and not see how they can be manipulated and parsed differently. Today, Loren Muse Smith and Tracy Gray collaborate to show you just how artfully that can be done.I\u2019m not great at rebus themes, but I conquered this one without much slipping or sliding around. A word is hidden in four of the black squares, and Ms. Smith and Ms. Gray are warning you to watch your step.That\u2019s because four of the squares in today\u2019s puzzle are made of BLACK ICE (the revealer is in plain sight at 44A), that dastardly winter driving hazard. It\u2019s up to you to determine which ones they are. And to avoid wiping out on them.The theme is made more slippery, so to speak, by the fact that in most of the entries, the second word is its own entry with its own clue, so we\u2019re not sure whether it has any relationship to the word connected to it by the ICE.Got that? Steady yourself, proceed with caution and you will uncover the other three patches of BLACK ICE.\u25a0 5D: Wordplay alert! \u201cIt\u2019s out of this world\u201d refers to SPACE today.\u25a0 28D: Note that I have resisted the urge to make a United joke here. You should too. The answer to \u201cThey\u2019re pushed on planes\u201d is BAR CARTS.So Tracy and I came up with possible themers, and then she flat went to work. And work. And work. No telling how many grids she came up with. At one point I think \u201cwe\u201d just decided it would be too hard. Then a few months later, boom! She emailed with this grid and I was so impressed, I immediately got up from a nap to help with the tweaking and cluing.I like the idea for this theme because a word \u201cwritten\u201d in a black square is unexpected and hard to see, just like that patch of BLACK ICE we\u2019ve all wiped out on.It was a pleasure to work with Tracy, a talented, inventive, resolute constructor.The problems started with the revealer BLACK ICE being eight letters and not working in the center row of a 15x15 grid. It also didn\u2019t work on Row 13 in the lower SE corner, because of its symmetrical theme entry containing a black ice square on Row 3 in the upper NW corner. So, I decided to put BLACK smack dab in the middle of the puzzle with ICE directly below it, which led to the B and the K of BLACK as unchecked letters, but I thought Will might allow it. However, as much as I liked the looks of this quirky grid, I just couldn\u2019t get good fill with four pairs of crossings hiding ICE theme entries, so we decided to give it a rest for awhile.Fast forward to November 2016: A year after our initial conversation and eight grids later, I found that a simple change to a 16 x 15 grid appeared to solve all of our problems. I woke Loren up from her long nap with a surprise \u201cCOMPLETED BLACK ICE PUZZLE!\u201d email so that she could work her linguistics major magic on the tweaking of fill words and cluing.Thanks again, Loren \u2013 it was fun working with you!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

Manchester will resist.\u201dAddressing the crowd, the Greater Manchester\u2019s police chief, Ian Hopkins, said, \u201cAs your chief constable and as a father I cannot begin to imagine how anyone can carry out such an unthinkable act.\u201dBritain\u2019s home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attended the event along with several faith leaders and Manchester residents from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities.\u201cThis is about Manchester, our beloved city,\u201d said Ian Cross, 64, a resident of the city for over 40 years. \u201cThose young innocent girls were our children.

That means the authorities considered an attack \u201chighly likely.\u201d And counterterrorism officials have been warning that as the Islamic State comes under more military pressure in Iraq and Syria, it will try to strike abroad.\u2014 Steven ErlangerThe man was arrested at Stansted Airport before he boarded a flight to Turkey and the arrest is linked to travel to Syria, the Metropolitan Police said. Officers were searching two residential addresses in north London, they added.\u2014 Niraj ChokshiLast week, the Islamic State released a 44-minute video featuring fighters of different nationalities enjoining their supporters back home to carry out acts of violence. Among them was a man identified as a British citizen, according to a translation of the video provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute, which tracks jihadist propaganda.Besides the threat last week, the Islamic State has repeatedly targeted Britain in its propaganda, though with little visible effect until this year.The 23-year-old singer and actress began her career on the children\u2019s television network Nickelodeon.

Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching Science with the \u2018Trilobites\u2019 Column", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byScienceFor science teachers and students, this column represents a treasure trove of up-to-date, real-life science reporting.In this lesson, we suggest ways to use Trilobites for study and as mentor texts that lead to student writing. We also provide a sampling of articles that could be used in various science courses._________Teaching Ideas for the Classroom1. Weekly Science-Themed Current EventsHaving students begin (or end) the week in this fashion can introduce students to our constantly evolving understanding of the world, thanks to current scientific research.If you want this weekly routine to engender further scientific inquiry, students can track the names and subjects of the articles that are shared with the class. At the end of a quarter or semester, they can then choose one article that particularly interested them and use it as a beginning point for research.2. Mentor TextsThe Trilobites column provides students with many examples of how Times writers endeavor to explain complex and interesting scientific concepts to a general audience.Teachers can use these short, engaging articles as mentor texts to teach students about scientific writing for different audiences using a lesson plan like this one:Then, have them explain that same concept to a science teacher, as if answering a question on a test. Give them a few more minutes to write their explanation.Now ask the class to discuss how their writing changed based on the intended audience. What was easy about writing each piece? What was challenging?Note that while the above pairing lends itself naturally to a physics classroom, any article from Trilobites could be used.Students can read the articles as a class, in groups or individually at home. As they read, ask them to identify the following for each article:Note that the purpose of this activity is not necessarily that students understand the article written for fellow scientists in its entirety. Rather, the purpose is for them to be able to see the differences in how scientific discoveries or areas of research are presented to various audiences.Next, ask students to share their thinking in a class discussion. You may find it helpful to take notes (or ask a student to take notes) so that they can be referenced at a later time.It should be relatively short, like the articles in the Trilobites column, and include at least one captivating image. Students can select a topic from anything they have studied in class during the unit, semester or entire year \u2014 something they think readers would see as a \u201cfascinating morsel of science.\u201d Or, they can use a Trilobites article as a jumping-off point for further research.Then, students can reflect on the writing process. What strategies did they use to convey a complex concept to a general audience? What strategies did they notice their peers used? What approaches worked best, and why? What approaches didn\u2019t work as well, and why?Going FurtherSharing of scientific discoveries, large and small, doesn\u2019t just have to be the work of newspapers like The New York Times. Social media can work wonders for spreading scientific ideas, observations and enthusiasm._________A Selection of Trilobites Articles for Different DisciplinesEarth ScienceWhy Two Volcanoes in Hawaii Are So Close, but So DifferentWhat Makes Gravel-Size Gypsum Crystals Move Around the Desert?Continents Split Up at the Same Speed Finger Nails Grow.

Her reserve fell away whenever she was selling muffins to raise money for the school to buy new equipment for the student kitchen. Alyssa would stroll the school halls with a trolley loaded with baked goods during her free periods, Mr. Alburtus said, selling her creations to fellow students.\u201cThat was her way of connecting with people,\u201d he said.Grief counselors were at the school Friday to meet with students, Mr. Alburtus said. Alyssa\u2019s culinary instructor could not bear to go to school on the day after her student\u2019s death, Mr. Alburtus said.William Aubry, the assistant police chief in charge of Manhattan South detective squad, said Friday afternoon that Alyssa\u2019s 13-year-old sister was being treated at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center for a collapsed lung and broken pelvis.\u201cOur heart goes out to Alyssa, her family and all those that were injured yesterday,\u201d Chief Aubry said.On Thursday evening, the girls\u2019 father, Thomas Elsman, posted on Facebook that Ava was out of surgery and doing \u201cok.\u201d He added, \u201cand yes my daughter is gone and I love her so much.\u201dAva was one of the people that Alyssa was completely herself around.

After years of being plagued by drugs and crime, the green space has evolved into a gem in the heart of Manhattan.Want to take a look yourself?Enter the restroom on 42nd Street, in the northeast corner of the park.A tip: Go on a weekday, but not during lunch hour or a special event, when waits might be about 20 minutes. (Around 3,000 visitors, on average, use the toilets there every day.)And don\u2019t forget to check yourself out in the full-length mirror before leaving.

They taste of salt and earth, the dough made from urad dal, split black lentils with creamy insides, soaked overnight and ground to a flour.Never mind how long they\u2019ve been sitting in the glass case on the counter: Somehow they still have crunch. Scattered alarms of green chile are matched by red chile flaring in the coconut chutney served alongside, which has the confoundingly lovely effect of cooling and searing at once.On a recent evening, women of South Asian descent sat quietly by the A.T.M., sharing a cheese pizza. I can\u2019t tell you how the pizza tastes, because I wanted hoppers: blooming pancakes of fermented rice flour and coconut milk, spongy at the bottom with the sides reaching upward, growing porous and lacy as they rise. (The shape is achieved by swirling the batter in an appachatty, a sloping pan.)Order a batch, and the one on top comes with an egg cracked inside, the white sealed into the batter and the yolk unsteady. You could use a knife, but that seems prim; I ate by tearing and dipping into the accompanying sambols, one of onions caramelized to an operatic sweetness, the other a crush of chile and Maldive chips \u2014 bonito flayed by smoke and sun until desiccated, a hard concentrate of ocean murk.String hoppers, steamed convolutions of skinny rice-flour noodles that Mr. Badurdeen makes with a traditional wooden press (\u201cI\u2019m old-fashioned\u201d), bear little resemblance to their hopper cousins. They\u2019re meant to be daubed with the accompanying kiri hodi, a loose coconut-milk curry that forgoes heat for balance, and a potent pol sambol, fresh grated coconut cut with green chile and more of that Maldive fish, and buoyed by lime, both juice and flesh.Handmade roti is chopped into strips and fed to a pan with an egg midscramble and a collusion of leeks, carrots and meat, roused by green chile, garlic and ginger \u2014 kin to fried rice and as delicious. Mr. Badurdeen\u2019s signature version arrives with a molten thatch of Cheddar and mozzarella, a relatively recent innovation in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s cosmopolitan capital, perhaps most beloved in the starkest hours of night.I never had a chance to try lump rice or deviled beef or half the Sri Lankan dishes listed on the menu. On one visit, only a few were available; on another, none. (I was told that a cook was late.) But whatever I was able to eat, I wanted more: goat biryani from the steam table, the rice boiled with a touch of milk for extra body, or kaliya, eggplant melded with green plantains and nubs of beef liver, with its tinge like buried iron.The dining area is utilitarian: Seats along the window look across the street at a pawnbroker\u2019s, and a few tables are squeezed up front and along the wall. But dishes are brought to your table, and paper napkins endlessly resupplied, and sometimes Mr. Badurdeen himself will appear bearing a plate of kottu roti with both hands. His young nephews, college students who help out when they can, patiently field questions.Above, shelves run under the ceiling, stocked with Sri Lankan snacks like Munchee Hawaiian cookies and cheese buttons, Marmite, Nestomalt and jars of melon candy. Serious ingredients are kept in the back: canned mackerel and dried shark; green jackfruit in brine and wood apple jam; dried leaves from the hummingbird tree. They reminded me of all the dishes that might have been, and why I must go back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Forgive Me\u2019: Manchester Bomber\u2019s Tangled Path of Conflict and Rebellion", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Salman Abedi was wearing a red vest, his suicide bomb hidden in a small backpack, when he phoned his younger brother in Libya and asked him to put his mother on the line. It was about 10:20 p.m. on Monday, and the call was short.\u201cHow are you doing, Mom? Please forgive me for anything I did wrong,\u201d he said, and hung up.The brief phone call to his mother \u2014 \u201cforgive me for anything I did wrong\u201d \u2014 encapsulated a deeply complicated family tale of conflict and rebellion, a complex interweaving of personal histories and the tortured recent history of Libya.It is the story of a strict father\u2019s flight from the repression of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya\u2019s leader at the time, and a personal jihad against that dictatorship, which in turn shook up his children\u2019s world.The seismic tremors from Libya\u2019s revolution in 2011 reverberated across geographical and generational borders, in Manchester\u2019s sizable Libyan population \u2014 the largest outside Libya \u2014 and in the Abedi family as well. Almost certainly, the events that helped set Salman Abedi on his hauntingly familiar path, from quiet boy in a strict Islamic household to troubled young man to, eventually, suicide bomber, began there.As Colonel Qaddafi tottered in 2011, Mr. Abedi\u2019s father, Ramadan, returned to Libya to finish the fight he had started two decades earlier, and took his British-born teenage sons with him. The elder Mr. Abedi, a onetime Qaddafi enforcer, fled Libya in 1991 after supporting Islamists seeking to overthrow the brutal leader. Now, as Western warplanes pummeled Tripoli, the capital, that dream was finally coming true.His sons \u2014 Ismail, Salman and Hashem \u2014 accompanied Mr. Abedi to Tunisia, where he worked on logistics for the rebels in western Libya. The sons knew very little about Libya, having grown up in the Whalley Range, a working-class area of Manchester. But their father, a proud Islamist, wanted them to follow in his footsteps at this euphoric moment.Salman, a lanky 16-year-old at the time, joined his father as the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade descended on the Libyan capital that summer. A year later, Ramadan snapped a photograph of the 15-year-old Hashem holding a machine gun.\u201cHashem the lion\u2026 training,\u201d read the caption on the father\u2019s Facebook page.They were not the only ones to make the journey from Britain. Akram Ramadan, who fought alongside Ramadan Abedi, recalled there being a strong contingent known as \u201cthe Manchester fighters.\u201d\u201cWe were all fighting,\u201d Mr. Ramadan said in Manchester. \u201cDrug dealers from here were fighting \u2014 everybody went.\u201dAfter gaining a taste of battle, Salman was sent back to Manchester, while his father decided to stay.There is no way to prove that this experience in Libya put Salman on the path that led him to the doors of the Manchester Arena. But the experience of armed struggle in one generation can beget violence in the next, terrorism experts say, even with an entirely different ideological underpinning.\u201cThe older generation normalizes militancy,\u201d said Raffaello Pantucci, a specialist in researching terrorism at the Royal United Services Institute. \u201cWhich direction it goes depends on the time. And the kids rebel against their parents.\u201dAnd rebel Salman certainly did. According to accounts by family friends and neighbors, his strict Muslim upbringing was upended by the events of 2011.He had been a quiet boy who was teased, and sometimes bullied, at school, a former classmate recalled. A fan of Manchester United, he developed a passion and aptitude for soccer.\u201cHe was polite, just a normal teenager,\u201d said one neighbor, who remembers him as a boy.But that changed with the fall of Colonel Qaddafi. While Salman\u2019s father stayed in Libya, he lived with his mother and siblings in Manchester, where he began to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. Some said he fell in with local gangs. He became known for a temper and a readiness to fight.Mr. Ramadan said the absence of a father figure was often a problem for Libyan families, particularly the Abedi sons, whose father imposed strict discipline.\u201cThere was a lot of it here, putting pressure on their kids to become very, very, over the top, good Muslim kids,\u201d Mr. Ramadan said.\u201cWhen the revolution kicked off and all these dads went to Libya to fight, the kids found freedom,\u201d Mr. Ramadan said, adding that Salman\u2019s mother, Samia, was unable to control him.Salah Rashid, 69, the mother\u2019s accountant, concurred. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many residents leave for Libya,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t embrace their children and teenagers, they can get lost.\u201dIn Libya in the days immediately after the bombing, the father was arrested by a militia, the Special Deterrence Forces, which said it had also detained Salman\u2019s younger brother, Hashem, now 20. It was a spokesman for the militia who provided the details about Salman\u2019s phone call to his family before the bombing.His father divided his time between Manchester, where he led prayers at a local mosque, and Tripoli, where he worked as an administrator in the Interior Ministry. As other Arab countries plunged into conflict, he cheered on like-minded Islamists like the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in Syria.In Manchester, the Abedi family were well known at Didsbury Mosque, a longstanding establishment popular with Manchester\u2019s large Libyan population and the diaspora from other Arab countries. Ramadan Abedi, who had studied the Quran in Saudi Arabia, often did the call to prayer.Known by the honorific Abu Ismael, he had a \u201cparticularly beautiful voice,\u201d congregants recalled. Salman\u2019s older brother, Ismail, helped out at the mosque with I.T. support and some teaching. He was arrested in Britain in the days after the bombing.Salman was a more solitary figure. \u201cHe barely even attended Eid prayers,\u201d said Mohammed Fadil, 25, who knows Salman\u2019s older brother. \u201cHe kept away from the community. When prayer finishes, you stay behind, you chat. With him it was different.\u201dWhen he did come, it was usually with his father, Mr. Fadil said, \u201cbut after his father had moved back to Libya, there was no reason for him to come anymore.\u201d And with his father gone, Salman was showing signs of following a different path.The last time Salman was noticed at the mosque was during a Friday prayer session in 2015 when the imam gave a sermon that was critical of the Islamic State. Salman angrily objected. It was around this time that at least two members of the congregation reported him on a counterterrorism hotline for expressing extremist views.But as older Libyans spent their time discussing politics in their homeland, some younger ones, like Mr. Abedi, found an ideology elsewhere \u2014 one that by now had supporters in both Britain and Libya.Salman Abedi and other family members visited their father in Libya regularly. By 2015, the Islamic State had established a base in the city of Surt, and had hidden pockets of support in cities like Tripoli, where the Abedi family is from.It was there, according to officials from Libya and the United States, that Salman established a connection with Abdul Baset Ghwela, a radical preacher whose son had died fighting in the eastern city of Benghazi.Back in Manchester, he is believed to have had links with other young residents of the city who joined the Islamic State in recent years, security officials said. One of them is Raphael Hostey, a prolific recruiter for ISIS who is believed to have been killed in a drone strike in Syria in May last year, aged 24.Despite denials from Mr. Hostey\u2019s brother, Junade, officials believe that Mr. Abedi and Mr. Hostey knew each other before Mr. Hostey left for Syria in 2013. \u201cHe was his hero,\u201d one law enforcement official said of Mr. Abedi\u2019s admiration for Mr. Hostey.The Times got access to evidence photographed at the crime scene, and it suggests an improvised device made with forethought and care.The killing of Mr. Hostey was the start of a fateful two weeks that may have further steeled Mr. Abedi\u2019s urge for revenge.The killing was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Libyan parents about their children\u2019s involvement with gangs, said Ahmed Sewehli, a psychiatrist. \u201cIt was a big deal in the Libyan community.\u201dAround this time, Salman is believed to have started planning Monday\u2019s attack. He opened a bank account, which would go unused until he used it to buy supplies for his suicide bomb from two hardware stores nearly a year later. The money in the account came from student loans, officials confirmed on Saturday \u2014 loans that he continued to receive even after dropping out of Salford University, where he enrolled in 2015 to study business management.\u201cI saw him in the prayer room sometimes,\u201d said Abdul Omar, 22, a second-year student who presides over the university\u2019s Islamic Society. \u201cI remember seeing him waiting a bit earlier for the prayer. He was always alone.\u201dIn recent months Mr. Abedi had been worshiping at the Salaam Community and Masjid in the Moss Side area of Manchester. But here, too, things did not go smoothly.Though typically quiet and withdrawn, he was reprimanded twice, once for lingering after dawn prayers when he was supposed to have left the building. When admonished by Abdullah Muhsin Norris, the chairman of the board of trustees at the mosque, he reacted badly, saying he didn\u2019t want to be shouted at, only to be told in response that he was \u201cacting like a child.\u201dOn a separate occasion, Mr. Abedi objected when a beardless Libyan member of the congregation was about to lead prayers. \u201cHe walked out,\u201d said Mr. Norris, who added that he had not seen Mr. Abedi since he reprimanded him and that, had it not been for those two incidents, he would not have noticed him.Tensions were growing within the Abedi family. Alarmed at the direction his son was taking, Salman\u2019s father forced him to come to Libya this spring and briefly confiscated his passport.When Mr. Ramadan, the family friend, last met Mr. Abedi less than three months ago, he initially failed to recognize the young man, who was leaning on a car outside his brother\u2019s home, waiting to pick him up for prayers in a long, beige-colored, Islamic shirt.But Mr. Abedi recognized his father\u2019s friend and greeted him with the Arabic term for \u201cuncle.\u201d\u201cI hope you are not doing any naughty tricks or pranks anymore,\u201d said Mr. Ramadan, referring to Mr. Abedi\u2019s past reputation.\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Mr. Abedi had answered. \u201cI quit doing pranks.\u201dKatrin Bennhold and Stephen Castle reported from Manchester, and Declan Walsh from Cairo.

A growth spurt turned him into a gentle giant, keen to protect more vulnerable peers. He fell in love, became gregarious.By the time he enrolled at Pennsylvania State University two years ago, he was truly, friends and family said, coming into his own.But all that ended in February, when Mr. Piazza died at Penn State after a fraternity hazing ritual in which he was instructed to drink large amounts of alcohol and fell numerous times, injuring his brain and rupturing his spleen. He was 19.Eighteen young men involved with the fraternity, Beta Theta Pi, have been charged with a variety of crimes, eight of them with involuntary manslaughter, the most serious charge.Prosecutors will seek to show that the conduct that night in February, when Timothy was induced to drink dangerous levels of alcohol and left unaided and injured, was not just fraternity high jinks gone terribly wrong, but rose to criminal behavior.It hurt, Ms. Piazza said, \u201cto know that my baby\u2019s head hit the floor, and the iron railing, and the door, and he fell down steps and was there by himself alone \u2014 suffering.\u201d\u201cThis was new grief on old grief,\u2019\u2019 she added. \u201cI never imagined it to be as horrible as it was.\u201dMs. Piazza, who works in accounting, wore a necklace with her son\u2019s thumbprint pressed into a charm. In her hand she held a letter that he had written to his future self as an assignment when he was a high school junior, to be opened five years later. In a teenager\u2019s slanted penmanship, he promised to improve his lot with girls and, above all else, to succeed in college.But lost in the swirling debate over what happened in the Beta Theta Pi house, a red brick mansion on Burrowes Street in State College, Pa., is something essential, said Mr. Piazza\u2019s father, James, who also works in accounting: the boy at the center of it, the young man they loved.He was devotedly goofy, said his brother, Mike, who is a 21-year-old rising senior at Penn State, his hands trembling as he recalled his brother. At random Timothy would choose a foreign accent while playing a board game and never break character. A tempestuous toddler, he insisted to anyone who would listen that his red hair was brown.He embraced his flame-colored curls as he grew older and looked forward to when he might be old enough to grow his version of a salt-and-pepper beard: \u201cSalt-and-paprika,\u201d his brother said with a laugh. He stopped. \u201cI\u2019m never going to see it,\u201d he said.After rapidly growing several inches as a teenager, Timothy took on a role of protector of more vulnerable peers in high school, said his friend Dan Prager, 20, perhaps recognizing in them the social awkwardness that he was growing out of. The boy who had once delighted in making Italian dressing-flavored Jell-O as a prank to dish up to unsuspecting friends stepped into leadership roles in school. He played football with developmentally disabled children and, as a high school senior, became an instructor in a peer-to-peer drug and safe-sex education program.\u201cI\u2019m having to learn life without my friend, where I can\u2019t, when I\u2019m having a problem or when I see something funny, just go to him and talk to him about it,\u201d Mr. Prager said, sitting in the Piazzas\u2019 home, where the two used to have sleepovers and make comically giant pancakes.He added, \u201cI have to deal with the fact that all these life experiences that he was looking forward to, that everyone else was excited to see, that he can\u2019t have that.\u201dKaitlyn Tempalsky, Timothy\u2019s girlfriend over the past three years, said he had sought to join Beta Theta Pi because he craved the camaraderie that fraternity life seemed to promise.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in it for the partying,\u201d said Ms. Tempalsky, 20, a student at Susquehanna University. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize how many people loved him. He really wanted that brotherhood.\u201dWhen he was particularly silly or pulling a practical joke, he had an impish smile, and a catch phrase \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a delight!\u201d \u2014 his brother said.The friends nodded.

{"Headline": "In Police Shootings, Finding Jurors Who Will Say \u2018Not Guilty\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported by\u201cA jury was going to make that decision,\u201d said Sam Bregman, who defended one of the officers. \u201cAnd picking that jury was the single most important aspect of the entire trial.\u201dModern jury selection is a dark art practiced by a cottage industry of consultants who promise to sort antagonists from sympathizers using mock trials, questionnaires, exhaustive reviews of social media profiles and even photographs of prospective jurors\u2019 homes.The scrutiny is likely to be no less intense as jury selection begins this week in two highly publicized police shootings. One, the death of an unarmed black man during a traffic stop in Cincinnati, has already resulted in one hung jury. The other, in which a man\u2019s girlfriend live-streamed the moments after he was fatally wounded in a St. Paul suburb, also during a traffic stop, goes to trial for the first time.Prosecutors are looking for jurors who are usually more suspicious of law enforcement \u2014 liberals, minorities and people with arrest records \u2014 while the defense prefers conservatives, whites and the well-off, who tend to be more trusting of police officers. But those assumptions are not foolproof.That has given the jury selection process in police shooting trials an unusual twist: Discovering whether a potential juror has seen a video of the shooting is crucial. \u201cMany people who want to be on a jury will deny they have seen the video,\u201d Mr. Baggott said. \u201cWe have to get them to confess to us.\u201dFor prosecutors, it remains excruciatingly difficult to win a conviction against a police officer \u2014 juries must vote unanimously, so it takes only one holdout to derail a guilty verdict.Mr. Baggott, who spent 25 years as a Pennsylvania state trooper, was on one side of the jury selection face-off in Albuquerque.Mr. Tensing is white, while Mr. DuBose was black. Last week, the judge ruled that a Confederate flag T-shirt that Mr. Tensing wore on the day of the shooting could not be admitted as evidence.In the other case, Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, will stand trial for manslaughter after he fatally shot Philando Castile, 32, during a traffic stop. According to prosecutors, Mr. Castile, who was licensed to carry a gun, told the officer that he had a firearm moments before he was shot. Mr. Castile, who was black, was in the car with his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and her young daughter.Mr. Baggott offered free jury consultation to the two officers, Dominique Perez and Keith Sandy, after they were indicted on a charge of murder.The two sides had a pool of 1,450 potential jurors, of whom only basics like names and addresses were known. Focusing on the first few hundred on the list, the two sides set about searching the names online and checking Facebook profiles. Mr. Baggott even checked the profiles of their friends: A juror who may not reveal much online, he said, \u201cusually adopts the views and attitudes of people they\u2019re friends with.\u201dBut on Facebook, she expressed strong views against the defendant, enabling Mr. Laughrun to get her disqualified.Prosecutors in Albuquerque added a sheaf of questions to a 14-page questionnaire, which included what causes potential jurors had contributed to (law enforcement, the homeless and the National Rifle Association were among the choices) and whether they had ever felt threatened by someone with mental illness.Mr. Baggott, the defense consultant, took a different tack, dispatching workers to photograph the first 250 jurors\u2019 homes and automobiles.\u201cI can tell a heck of a lot more about lifestyle and where a juror is going to come down by looking at your house,\u201d Mr. Baggott said. \u201cOne guy has a white picket fence, a pickup and car in the driveway, a couple of kids\u2019 toys on the porch. Everything\u2019s orderly, the lawn\u2019s mowed. This is going to be a person who pays attention to detail, a person who\u2019s reasonable and is hard-working.\u201dA ramshackle house and beat-up car suggest a less stable and dependable juror, he said. Vehicles offer a bonus: bumper stickers with political and religious messages that shed light on a jurors\u2019 leanings.Both sides tried to sift out the handful of candidates that might particularly help or hinder their case. Ms. McGinn looked for potential opponents who were also leaders \u2014 people in management, or who answered questions confidently or forcefully.\u201cIf you have a question about that person, that person is more dangerous to you than a follower, because they\u2019ll lead the jury in the other direction,\u201d she said.The defense focused on finding \u201csleepers\u201d \u2014 candidates who hid their true views of the case in a bid to win a seat on the jury \u2014 through artful questioning during the selection process. Among those who passed muster, defense lawyers flagged people in jobs that dealt with facts, like engineers who based decisions on calculations, or accountants. \u201cThey believed in order,\u201d Luis Robles, who represented one of the officers, said in an interview. \u201cEven if they\u2019re not leaders, they\u2019d fight for us if they agreed with us.\u201dThe jury, six men and six women, was seated in September, heard 12 days of testimony and deliberated for two days. By mid-October, they were a hung jury: nine favored acquittal, including all six women. Three favored conviction, including the accountant.Ms. McGinn said she was disappointed, but unsurprised. \u201cWe recognized the impossibility of our task,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thing to find 12 people who will convict a police officer. This was the first prosecution here. I expected a 15-minute acquittal.\u201dMr. Robles, on the other hand, was disappointed because there was no acquittal \u2014 and because the net they used to catch hostile jurors wasn\u2019t fine enough. \u201cSoon as the verdict is read, the accountant goes downstairs and holds an impromptu news conference,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, \u2018That\u2019s not like an accountant.\u2019\u201dSeeking to determine what went wrong, the lawyers asked investigators to perform some additional spadework. They found that while he held a job at an accounting firm, he also wrote online, under a pen name, about social justice and other issues.\u201cWe missed it,\u201d Mr. Robles said. \u201cShame on us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was based on her real romance that she turned into a prize-winning novel in 2014.\u201cI had a woman spit on me!\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018You are even lower than the soil on the soldiers shoes!\u2019\u201dHer book sales then doubled. People bought multiple copies and posted photos of themselves holding the book in bookstores. Her book showed that the Israeli left may be comatose, but it is not quite dead.The book\u2019s main character, Liat, a dutiful young Israeli translator, falls for Hilmi, a Palestinian painter. Liat must decide how far to take a love she knows her family and friends will disapprove of, seeing her as a traitor to her upbringing, her Jewishness.\u201cShe takes him out of the multitude and acknowledges his humanity, her humanity,\u201d Ms. Rabinyan said. \u201cHe\u2019s not the Palestinian people. He\u2019s one person.\u201dStill, the book is tightly woven around the conflict. \u201cThis is what we call \u2018the situation.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the climate. Another season of the year, a fifth one.\u201dThe book opens with Liat, who, like Ms. Rabinyan, is of Iranian Jewish descent, being questioned by terror investigators. To them, Liat looked Middle Eastern, not necessarily Jewish. Soon after, she meets Hilmi. He is from Hebron and Ramallah, the Palestinians\u2019 de facto capital; she is from Tel Aviv, its own bubble of sea and secularism in Israel.The romance intensifies quickly, though Liat is concerned from beginning to end, less about him, but that her relationship goes against all she was taught.\u201cCut this off quickly,\u201d Liat tells herself after their first night together. \u201cDecide with a heavy but determined heart that it\u2019s better this way, better for both of us. And never see him again.\u201dNeedless to say, she does.\u201cIn New York they became more like each other, same land, same experiences,\u201d Ms. Rabinyan said of her characters. \u201cThey went into this bubble.\u201dThe couple find that their similarities and differences are very complicated. Liat, a high-minded, educated woman of the left, sees the only solution as two states, fair but in the end separate. Hilmi thinks there is no dividing the two people on the same land. (This argument, of course, has only intensified.)The book is too finely drawn for easy symbolism, but at one point Liat sums up what nearly all Israelis have thought, knowingly or not, of their Palestinian neighbors \u2014 sometimes not so much antagonism as the wish it simply was not an endlessly prodding problem.\u201cOnly 10 minutes,\u201d she scolds. \u201cJust disappear from my life for 10 minutes.\u201dThe book is also very much of a place and time: People called each other primarily on landlines, without the distracting screens of smartphones. There was no Facebook, Twitter or Tinder. When Liat returns to Tel Aviv, she is disturbed that she has no photograph with Hilmi.\u201cIt seems impossible now,\u201d Ms. Rabinyan said. \u201cEveryone is taking selfies, couple selfies, selfies after sex. If you said \u2018hashtag\u2019 in 2002, people would have thought it was a breed of dog.\u201dMs. Rabinyan, in person both fierce and pleasant, found success at an early age. Her first novel, \u201cPersian Brides,\u201d based on two days of her Iranian grandmother\u2019s memories, brought her acclaim at 22. Her wishes, she said, \u201ccame true even before I had the chance to ask for them.\u201dHer second novel, \u201cStrand of a Thousand Pearls,\u201d also did well. In 2002, Ms. Rabinyan attended the prestigious International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, which she summed up, in quite American terms, as \u201cawesome, quite beautiful, encouraging.\u201dShe worked on a third novel, which she shelved after six years. It took six more years to write \u201cAll the Rivers.\u201dThe backlash came quickly, at a time when many of the nation\u2019s leading, if leftist, literary idols \u2014 including Amos Oz, A. B. Yehoshua and David Grossman \u2014 were under attack by a right-wing group for being \u201cmoles in culture,\u201d not sufficiently dedicated to the Israeli cause.The ministry backed off slightly, allowing some teachers to use the novel in classrooms. What Ms. Rabinyan found disturbed her: It was the students, amid the nation\u2019s palpable drift to the right, who did not want to read the book, which had generally been popular.\u201cNowadays kids in Israel and in Palestine are so swept up with this wave of nationalism, exploitative of their instincts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids themselves rejected the book. They said: \u2018It\u2019s a lefty book. I don\u2019t want to read it.\u2019\u201dProspects for peace look as bleak as ever, though President Trump has, to the surprise of some, been pushing early in his administration for what he called the \u201cultimate deal.\u201d He is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, in the White House.Ms. Rabinyan said she would not give up hope, no matter how remote a deal might seem now (which, spoiler alert, are about as remote as the chances were that Liat could ever give in to Hilmi completely).\u201cI refuse to let go of my instinct of being in contact with others\u2019 pain,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is turning your back. I refuse.\u201dAn article on May 4 about a controversy over \u201cAll the Rivers,\u201d a novel by Dorit Rabinyan about a love affair between an Israeli woman and a Palestinian man, misidentified the program for authors that Ms. Rabinyan attended at the University of Iowa in 2002. It was an International Writing Program residency, not the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop.Advertisement"}

As the kefta browned, they were added, too, exchanging some of their brawny fat for the flavors of the sauce, everything on the way to becoming what Mr. Lahlou calls Moroccan shakshuka.\u201cIn Morocco, this is our fast food, because it only takes an hour or two instead of all day,\u201d he said.Mr. Lahlou, 48, grew up eating copious, slowly cooked meals with his large extended family in the heart of Marrakesh.\u201cWe\u2019d make breakfast, then sit around the table and argue about what we\u2019re going to have for lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all ate from the same pot; no one had their own plate. That was a really powerful connection to eat like that. In America, it\u2019s very lonely to have your own plate.\u201dSharing these meals, each consisting of a tagine or stew, homemade bread and an assortment of seven different salads, was, he said, \u201cthe glue that kept our family from going insane.\u201d (The seven salads were carrots with orange blossom water; cucumbers with cinnamon; herb jam; stewed tomatoes; eggplant pur\u00e9e; pickled beets; and braised chicken innards.)\u201cWe were all there together,\u201d he said, \u201cGrandma, Grandpa, my mom, my aunts. We were so dysfunctional, but not during the meals. That\u2019s when we took a break from the dysfunction.\u201dAt 17, Mr. Lahlou immigrated to San Francisco to study economics. Nostalgic for the foods of his childhood, he started cooking, calling his mother for advice about how much ras el hanout, or ground cumin, to add to a dish. The answer was always a pinch. \u201cYou know my hands,\u201d she would tell him.As the scent of sizzling lamb and garlic wafted through the kitchen, some cooks came over to see what he was making. Mr. Lahlou explained the dish, which was not on the menu, telling them how the carrot juice added sweetness to the tomatoes, and how white pepper was the pepper of choice in Morocco, where cooks prefer its delicacy to the brasher black variety.After the sauce and kefta had simmered into a velvety softness, it was time to add the eggs. For most shakshuka recipes, cooks slide in whole eggs to poach. Mr. Lahlou uses only yolks, which are better able to mix freely into the sauce without prisons of coagulated egg white holding them back.When all was done, his crew clustered around, dipping torn bread into the pan, letting orange yolk mingle with the sauce, herbs and browned meat. Everyone was happily eating out of the same pot, with not a lonely plate in sight.cookingAdvertisement"}

I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone of anything, but I feel demoralized. What should I do?ANONYMOUSYour ego is not your amigo \u2014 especially when healthy self-esteem turns to privileged self-importance.

And the evidence? Your college diploma and 120 more days on the job.

R\u00e9sum\u00e9s do not often speak to these skills. So, be bummed out. You\u2019re entitled. You didn\u2019t get a job you wanted. But don\u2019t imply that the process was rigged.Instead, head to your former manager or to human resources. Ask if they thought you were a good candidate, and what you can do to make yourself a better prospect the next time out.

But rather than telling you to lean into it, and schedule even more activities and clubs and internet dates, I have another idea.Relax more. In my experience, the less goal-oriented I am, the more open I can be to opportunities I might not otherwise see.

African-American opposition to the memorials \u2014 and to the Confederate emblem on Mississippi\u2019s state flag \u2014 has grown, naturally, since black citizens belatedly gained the power of the ballot box.Mr. Oliver finally apologized on Monday.

Mr. Oliver\u2019s district includes the hamlet of Money, where Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black boy from Chicago, was kidnapped, mutilated and killed while visiting relatives in 1955.That episode jump-started the civil rights movement and forced the country to finally confront the racial violence that had been a constant feature of African-American life in the Deep South. Perhaps Mr. Oliver\u2019s viciousness can help Americans acknowledge how much of that poison is still with us.As Representative Sonya Williams-Barns, the Black Caucus chairwoman, said this week, finally discarding that emblem would represent an important step toward breaking with Mississippi\u2019s toxic past.Advertisement"}

Borders wanted to see how Loyd was recovering. During their conversation, Borders also asked Loyd for any ideas on how to broaden the game and help expand the league\u2019s reach.Loyd recommended that the W.N.B.A. stream its games on Twitter, as other leagues have done. The idea struck a chord with Borders. On Monday night, the W.N.B.A. became the first women\u2019s professional sports league to sign a rights deal with Twitter.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to calling her and telling her that you made a suggestion, I heard it, we listened and we now have a deal with Twitter,\u201d Borders said on Monday afternoon.The games are exclusive to Twitter and are not simulcasts of local or national television games. Twitter is paying the W.N.B.A. guaranteed money to stream the games, but the league would not release the financial details. The W.N.B.A. also has a national television deal with ESPN that runs through 2022 and includes 16 games per season and coverage of the playoffs, the draft and the All-Star Game.\u201cWe are excited to help extend the reach of women\u2019s sports around the world by collaborating further with the N.B.A. to be the home of weekly live W.N.B.A. games for the next three seasons,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a news release. \u201cThe growing women\u2019s basketball fan base will be able to turn to Twitter to watch free games side by side with the real-time conversation.\u201dThis is the latest sports deal for Twitter, which streams weekly out-of-market Major League Baseball and N.H.L. games, some PGA Tour events and other minor events.Facebook also recently struck deals to stream live sporting events. During the 2016-17 season, the N.B.A.\u2019s Development League games were streamed on Facebook Live. In March, Facebook and Major League Soccer announced that at least 22 games in the 2017 season would be available on Facebook.\u201cSports are inherently social, with the power to build and connect communities around the world,\u201d Dan Reed, Facebook\u2019s head of global sports partnerships, said in a statement. \u201cThis aligns closely with our mission, and we feel Facebook is a natural home for sports content, including live games. Early experiments with these events on Facebook have delivered great results for fans, broadcasters and rights holders.\u201dFor now, major broadcasters like ABC/ESPN, NBC, CBS and Fox Sports dominate the market for sports rights and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to televise games. Major internet companies like Facebook and Amazon have the financial resources to compete with traditional broadcasters, although they have not invested much money in sports rights deals so far.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet how to make these profitable in their own right, but because there\u2019s a belief that it can be value-enhancing, I think you\u2019re just going to see more deals of this nature so long as the leagues are willing to sell those rights separately,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.He added, \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s worth putting some money into because they may want to go bigger.\u201dStill, deals with internet and social media companies are a way for smaller leagues like the W.N.B.A. to add revenue and experiment with new ways to show their games. In 2016, the W.N.B.A. streamed the ring ceremony for the Minnesota Lynx on Facebook.\u201cIf folks can\u2019t be physically in a market inside an arena, then we look for them to use tools like Twitter to enjoy the games,\u201d Borders said. \u201cFolks have their choice of when they want to see games and how they want to see games.

Bruce\u2019s applied more delicately, as if by brush, Mx. Hopkins\u2019s, more expressively, as if by trowel. PRW BTTM is the latest flare in a long, proud tradition of punk rock in a gender-agnostic dress, kicking and screaming since Jayne County (formerly Wayne County) stomped the boards of CBGB decades ago. That Mx. Bruce, 24, and Mx. Hopkins, 25, are proudly, unapologetically queer is central to their act; so is the fact that they rock.PWR BTTM\u2019s second album, \u201cPageant,\u201d out Friday, May 12, arrives after a debut record, \u201cUgly Cherries,\u201d that grew in tiny Brooklyn clubs like Silent Barn and Shea Stadium and broke into the mainstream, elbowing its way onto 2015 best-of lists of national critics. Where \u201cUgly Cherries\u201d could be lonesome and searching, \u201cPageant\u201d is fabulously defiant, a barbaric yawp sounded from the borderlands of gender expression and evolving sexuality. (The band name, PWR BTTM \u2014 \u201cpower bottom\u201d \u2014 comes from gay slang, meaning a reins-taking, enthusiastic sexual partner on the receiving end of the experience.)\u201cWe\u2019re like if Tom and Jerry were gender nonconforming,\u201d Mx.

Hopkins met as students at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Mx. Hopkins was escaping a small-town public school in South Hamilton, in eastern Massachusetts; Mx. Bruce attended a slightly more forgiving private school, Concord Academy, not far away. They arrived at Bard to find a campus far more open to the varieties of identity.Mx. Bruce took what seemed to be a significant breath: \u201cI\u2019m not getting choked up. I have pizza in my throat.\u201dMx. Bruce now identifies as transfeminine and non-binary, and is transitioning; both of them identify as queer, and given their druthers, individually prefer the pronouns they/their, which as yet bedevils many news organizations\u2019 style guides. Despite speculation, Mx. Bruce and Mx. Hopkins are not now, and have never been, a couple.\u201cUgly Cherries\u201d was recorded during Mx. Bruce\u2019s senior year at Bard, with Mx. Hopkins, who had graduated the year before, holed up and lonely in an apartment in nearby Hudson, N.Y. Though in parts murky and soulful, \u201cUgly Cherries\u201d can also be exciting in its unbridled directness. On \u201cI Wanna Boi,\u201d Mx.

Hopkins agreed, \u201cPageant\u201d is defiant. Mx. Hopkins and Mx. Bruce each get a song on the album reclaiming terms used against them (\u201cSilly\u201d and \u201cSissy\u201d), and the first single, \u201cBig Beautiful Day,\u201d opens with Mx. Hopkins on the offensive:Like many of their punk predecessors, PWR BTTM has a fervor onstage that\u2019s hard to fully capture on record, and the band has spent the last year touring widely and at a furious clip (it played 186 shows last year). Along the way, they have accrued a passionate fan base, who tattoo their tweets on their bodies and slavishly recreate their stage makeup. And Mx. Bruce and Mx. Hopkins do find themselves on the receiving end of messages and photos from fans to whom they represent a lifeline, who travel hours to see them perform, in areas far less gay-friendly than Brooklyn. The responsibility of being counselor and confessor is a high-pressure one, and one that the two hesitate to fully embody.\u201cA band can\u2019t save your life,\u201d Mx. Hopkins said. \u201cA band can be a great soundtrack for that, but people don\u2019t have enough faith in their own power.\u201dThat said, Mx. Bruce added, \u201cThe self-help montage in the movie wouldn\u2019t work without the soundtrack.\u201dAnd PWR BTTM as a band wouldn\u2019t work if the soundtrack it provided wasn\u2019t legitimately exciting, and fun \u2014 if the duo were all gay liberation theology with no chops. They trade off singing duties, both performing their own lyrics, and alternate between drums and guitar (though Mx. Hopkins is the stronger shredder).\u201cI think the reason they\u2019re successful is because they\u2019ve developed a virtuosity,\u201d said Justin Vivian Bond, the queer performance artist, for whom Mx. Hopkins worked as an assistant one summer when Mx. Bond was curating the Spiegeltent Cabaret at Bard\u2019s Fisher Center for the Performing Arts. \u201cIt\u2019s that combination of what\u2019s happening in the world, their aesthetic and their musicianship. And their work ethic. A lot of people dream the dream but don\u2019t know how to work hard enough to make the dream come true.\u201dBut if PWR BTTM\u2019s appeal is not limited to the frontiers of otherness \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a mid-50s straight guy with a house in the suburbs and who typically doesn\u2019t like pop. I\u2019ve been sending links to this video to friends for a week,\u201d a commenter wrote on the YouTube page of one of their clips \u2014 it is not surprising that it resounds with special strength among those still looking for queer validation, which is not an untroubled privilege, even in this era of marriage equality.\u201cQueer people are always meant to be the helper, the hairdresser, the fairy godmother, the sassy gay friend,\u201d Mx. Bruce said.Mx. Hopkins agreed: \u201cWhat is empowering for me in PWR BTTM is, I am going to take up this space \u2014 very effeminate and very insecure, ridiculous in a $2 thrift store dress on with stars glued to my face \u2014 and go do that thing I wanted to do.

{"Headline": "Rioja Grapples With How to Define Its Best Wines", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe PourThe wine was an extraordinary pleasure, a mellow red with a texture somewhere between silk and velvet that didn\u2019t so much invite as demand a next sip.The flavors were both sweet and tart, more cranberry than raspberry and fresh. The wine extended well into the complex territory of tobacco, smoke and leather, with a touch of vanilla from its long rest in old American oak vats. There was polish to the wine, the sort of sheen that comes only from the friction of age sanding away the rough edges of rambunctious youth.The rules governing gran reservas require that the wines be aged at least two years in barrels and three years in bottles \u2014 five years in all \u2014 before they can be released. Most good producers of gran reservas go beyond the minimum.The current release of Muga\u2019s gran reserva, Prado Enea, is 2009, for example. Murrieta\u2019s current gran reserva, Castillo Ygay, is 2007, while La Rioja Alta\u2019s 904 is 2007 and its 890 is 2004. By contrast, the youngest gran reserva red from L\u00f3pez de Heredia is 1995.Very few regions define their wines by age as Rioja and a few other Spanish wine regions have done. Brunello di Montalcino, which must have at least four years of aging; Barolo, which needs at least three; and Champagne, which requires single-vintage wine to be aged a minimum of three years, are among them.But Rioja\u2019s system is the most intricate. Its traditional terms crianza (three years), reserva (four years) and gran reserva indicate in ascending order the aging a wine received in the cellar.Defining a wine by aging seems out of step with the times. With the ascendance of Burgundy, with its emphasis on place and terroir over age, more and more regions have redefined themselves in Burgundian terms.Over the last 30 years, there has been a rise in single-vineyard Barolos, even as a few ardent traditionalists like Bartolo Mascarello insist on the primacy of wines blended from different communes. Similarly, in Champagne, where blending has been portrayed and marketed as an art form, more producers emphasize the terroir and the vineyard.The rise of cheap industrial Rioja, Mr. de la Serna said, affects the entire market, including the gran reserva category.Mr. de la Serna was among the signers, though he doesn\u2019t hold out much hope for it.\u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of such an approach ever being reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Spain, after all, and wine culture seldom forms the basis of wine regulations.\u201dMar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Heredia, who, with her sister, Mercedes, and brother, Julio C\u00e9sar, runs the winery founded by her great-grandfather, said in an email that classifying a wine, whether by terroir, aging requirements or production methods, will not assure that it is good.\u201cYou can pick the classification that you want, but at the end it is the honesty and the will to make a good wine that matters,\u201d she said.In some wine regions, conflicts have caused conscientious producers to leave appellations. Most famously, this occurred in Tuscany in the 1970s, when frustrated producers left the appellation to start making wines that eventually came to be known as \u201cSuper Tuscans.\u201dIt\u2019s happening in France today, especially in the Loire Valley, where more producers are accepting the lesser designation \u201cVin de France\u201d rather than submit to rules they regard as silly or hidebound.I do agree with Ms. L\u00f3pez de Heredia that any classification depends on the integrity of producers to make the best possible wines. The gran reserva classification, she said, comes with the implication that producers are selecting their best wines for prolonged aging. She and other top producers take that underlying notion seriously. Not everybody does.\u201cFor a winery that produces millions of bottles but has no brand reputation, gran reserva will mean nothing,\u201d she said.Bottom line: If you want to see what a good Rioja gran reserva is all about, avoid the $20 bottle. The \u201995 Vi\u00f1a Tondonia will set you back $100, which for a great 22-year-old bottle is way below what a top wine would cost from Bordeaux, Napa Valley or Barolo. But if that\u2019s too much, you can find a 2001 Faustino 1 for around $40, a 2004 La Rioja Alta 904 for around $60 and a 2006 Muga Prado Enea for around $65.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Chicken That Grows Slower and Tastes Better", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported bySALISBURY, Md. \u2014 The chickens in one pen were, for the most part, doing what they usually do toward the end of their lives on a factory farm: resting on the floor, attacking the feeding pan, getting big fast.But in the next pen over, smaller, leaner birds of the same age ran around, raising a ruckus as they climbed on haystacks, perched on roosts and gave themselves dirt baths.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to come up with a sturdier water line,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Stewart-Brown, a veterinarian and senior vice president of Perdue Farms, as he watched two of them swing the tube that supplies water to the pen.The frisky birds and their more sedentary neighbors here in a barn on the Delmarva Peninsula are part of an experiment that could help change the way Americans eat, and think about, poultry.\u201cWe want to get back to a place where people don\u2019t have to put a marinade on their chicken to make it taste like something,\u201d said Theo Weening, who oversees meat purchasing for Whole Foods and recalls how his mother bought chicken by breed in the Netherlands, where he grew up.Mr. Weening is realistic, though. \u201cWe have to figure out how can we make this happen so we\u2019re not ending up with a chicken nobody can afford,\u201d he said.That is the big challenge for chicken producers. Dr. Stewart-Brown, of Perdue, said it cost about 30 percent more to feed the Redbro birds; the expense can run even higher for other slow-growth breeds, some of which can take as much as twice as long to reach full weight as conventional birds.Differences in their musculature may cut into a producer\u2019s profits as well. The Redbro chickens, for instance, have skinnier wings than their conventional cousins, and wings command a high price by weight.How the slower-growth chicken compares to the conventional broiler.\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll be selling any of these kinds of birds in pieces,\u201d Dr. Stewart-Brown said.Consumers would also have to accept some trade-offs: While the new chickens have a fuller flavor, their meat tends to be distributed differently over the body, with more generous thighs and smaller breasts than the chicken most Americans are used to.\u201cThe reaction I got from the mainstream chicken suppliers at that time was kind of deadpan,\u201d said Maisie Ganzler, who is Bon App\u00e9tit\u2019s vice president for strategy. \u201cThey essentially said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s interesting that you want to go in that direction. We don\u2019t.\u2019\u201dFood is the largest cost for chicken producers, and the Redbro birds don\u2019t eat as much as the two conventional chickens Perdue is using for comparison, Dr. Stewart-Brown said. \u201cThey\u2019re bred to put on as much weight as possible in as little time, so they have quite an appetite,\u201d he said of the conventional chickens.But because the Redbros take longer to mature and are far more active than the conventional birds, they will eat more to produce each pound of meat, he said. And because they are more active, they need more space, which Dr. Stewart-Brown estimated would mean limiting the population of a chicken barn to 22,000, or about 3,000 fewer birds than is standard with today\u2019s breeds.The Redbro birds stand taller and drink less water \u2014 \u201cI like that,\u201d Dr. Stewart-Brown said. Their higher activity levels also help aerate the litter that covers the floor of chicken houses; drier pens, he said, are less likely to create food-safety problems.Conventional birds need larger feet and shorter legs to support the fast development of their musculature, which is the meat. Their muscles grow faster than their skeletons, so by the time they are slaughtered, they cannot move around easily for long and end up nesting in litter, which can lead to sores on their sternums, and foot and leg problems.\u201cThe breeding companies have done a great job of giving their customers, the chicken producers, what they want, which has been fast growth with lots of muscle tissue,\u201d said Anne Malleau, the executive director of the Global Animal Partnership. The group is working on a protocol for assessing genetics so that it can then establish a list of breeds or standards that will qualify as slow-growth.\u201cSo is that a slow-growth chicken?\u201d Mr. Cockrell asked. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll respond to customers, but I\u2019m not really sure we know what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201dIn marketing slow-growth chickens, Perdue and others will have to make consumers understand why they are paying a higher price. Emmer, for instance, sells two 3.25 pound birds for $59 on its website, while the suggested retail price of a Sonoma Red (from Perdue\u2019s Petaluma Poultry) that weighs four pounds is $16.Shoppers often say they want better welfare for the animals they eat, then balk at the cost that adds to the price of a pork chop or chicken breast. Ms. Malleau said she believed, however, that a growing number of consumers were diversifying the proteins they ate.\u201cAs a society, we\u2019re going to be making different choices than we did 20 years when it comes to protein in our diets, and in some ways, this move to slow-growth chicken is a gamble on that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it turns out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The work \u2014 which, like almost everything on Snapchat, disappeared after 24 hours \u2014 was costly for Mashable.Even so, Mashable is today making money off Discover under a partnership with Snapchat\u2019s parent company, Snap, to sell ads against its videos and stories.

High-quality storytelling on Discover should also help build a highly engaged and loyal audience on Snapchat, he said.Although Snapchat\u2019s number of users is smaller than Facebook\u2019s, publishers said they could still reach a lot of people on Discover.Steven Kydd, a founder of Tastemade, a digital food and lifestyle publication, said his company got over a billion views a month on Discover. And people don\u2019t just skip over the videos and stories \u2014 more than 28 percent of viewers in the United States visit Tastemade\u2019s Discover channel at least five days a week, he said, and his daily audience has grown more than 4.5 times as large over the past year.As a result, Tastemade has created a studio it can use to make daily videos for Discover, which are produced in eight languages across three channels in the United States, Britain and France. Tastemade now generates a significant amount of revenue with Discover, said Mr. Kydd, who declined to say whether the effort was profitable.All of this is a change from the early experiences that some publishers had with Discover. Creating videos and stories for the platform was initially a time-consuming, money-losing effort, according to five people who produced Discover content for publications that included Bleacher Report, NowThis News, Mashable and Refinery29. These people asked to not be identified because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with their companies.Now publishers have hired teams of designers, video editors and writers focused solely on making content that fits Snapchat\u2019s unique formatting requirements. That includes videos that are shown vertically, not horizontally, on a phone screen. Stories are also told in a series of \u201csnaps,\u201d or snippets.Snap is still experimenting with how to make Discover as lucrative as possible. The company has made some recent changes to its financial deals with publishers, according to four people involved in the deals who were not authorized to discuss the private contracts.Snapchat initially sold ads against the stories in Discover and shared that revenue with the publishers. Publishers who wanted to sell ad space themselves had to meet certain revenue minimums, or pay the difference.Now, Snap has signed some licensing-type agreements, in which publishers are paid a flat fee for their work. This model theoretically limits the risk to publishers by giving them a guarantee of some money, even as Snap tries new ad formats that may fall flat.\u201cWhat Snapchat did well is it curated a place where a publisher\u2019s brand could live and it created an ad model that can pay,\u201d said Troy Young, president of Hearst Digital Media. Hearst has six brands on Discover, including Cosmopolitan and Popular Mechanics, and is profitable on the platform.Facebook did not return a request for comment.Regardless of whether Discover bears fruit for all publishers, it is still likely to help Snap.\u201cFor a generation of people, Snapchat is the place where they\u2019re getting all of their news,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. She added that Discover \u201chelps Snapchat as it tries to be the next big online portal.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated how risk is managed in Snap\u2019s licensing-type agreements. The model theoretically limits risk to publishers, not advertisers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Shrimp Cocktail With a Jumbo Jolt, at La Esquina in Queens", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byHungry City10 PhotosThe bodega is two aisles wide. Toward the back, where a pi\u00f1ata shaped like a giant frilly Negra Modelo beer bottle hangs by the ceiling vents, Pedro Rodriguez stands as studious as an apothecary, quietly filling plastic cups with shrimp, purplish nubs of octopus and a red liquid that looks lit from within. It is half cocktail, half remedy, a conjuring of Veracruz, Mexico, in Jackson Heights, Queens.\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since I was a kid,\u201d said a young woman seated at the lone table, backed by boxes of Cup Noodles and Coors Light. She inherited her taste for c\u00f3ctel de camarones from her mother, who craved it when pregnant.Her family found Mr. Rodriguez five years ago, selling his tonics \u2014 versions of the cocktail are known in Latin America as vuelve a la vida (back to life) and rompe colch\u00f3n (mattress breaker) \u2014 under the name La Esquina del Camar\u00f3n Mexicano, outside a bodega near the Elmhurst Avenue subway stop. Later they followed him to this corner of Roosevelt Avenue, faithful customers as La Esquina expanded from a sidewalk stall to a small indoor kitchen. (The stall still appears on weekends.)The menu has expanded, too, but the cocktails remain the draw, available in four sizes, including by the quart. Mr. Rodriguez learned to make them in Mexico City from a native of Veracruz. He starts with homemade tomato sauce, onions, lime, a touch of olive oil and clam juice, a concession to circumstances. \u201cIn Mexico,\u201d he said, \u201cwe use oyster juice, but here I can\u2019t get it.\u201dBeyond that? He laughed. \u201cMy secret.\u201dShrimp and octopus, boiled with salt, crowd the depths. (The cocktail can come with either alone, but I like the contrast.) On top is a small riot of cilantro and crescents of avocado in immaculate pale yellow-green ombr\u00e9. The first sip triggers the nostalgia centers for ketchup, and then the brine kicks in. It\u2019s best when you work all the flavors and textures into one spoonful: bright, creamy, meaty, salty-sweet.Packets of saltines accompany each cup. A friend and regular advised me to crumble them over the cocktail, but I observed others simply taking nibbles between spoonfuls. Mr. Rodriguez said, \u201cIt\u2019s whatever you like.\u201d In truth, I didn\u2019t need them.Mr. Rodriguez, who came to New York in 1989 and worked for years as a painter and carpenter, sending money home to his family in Mexico, now devotes his time to La Esquina. He has added empanadas to the menu, their shells as light as wonton skins, sealed around sea bass flaked in a pan with garlic and Mexican adobo seasoning. After they\u2019re fried, he opens a bit of the seam and slips in mayonnaise, cilantro and a slice of avocado so fresh it tastes like sunrise.A clean, mild ceviche of sea bass and lime, given a boost by pico de gallo, is strewn over a tostada. Tacos are generously stocked: a tumble of octopus and onions, some bits glossy and crunchy, some dark and sticky-sweet; fillets of sea bass simply grilled with paprika, or given a rugged breading and stripes of fired-up guacamole; whiting dusted in corn flour and fried until it achieves an effervescent crust that calls to mind puffy pork skins.Customers station themselves at the table, the windowsill or a low shelf, each set with a saltshaker and an enormous bottle of Valentina hot sauce, which brings good cling, upfront heat and a citrus coda. But it\u2019s worth asking for the house-made salsa roja, a crush of chiles de arbol, served not in a meager ramekin but in a bowl with a wooden spoon. It is thick and hot, with an honest smack of bitterness, and great.On my visits, fellow diners chatted with me in Spanish, as if I, too, were a regular. When I finally confessed that I didn\u2019t speak the language, one man asked in English: \u201cDo you live around here? How do you get by?\u201d He then kindly gave me directions to other hidden kitchens inside other bodegas up and down the strip, and, grateful, I wrote down every word.Advertisement"}

The newspaper could not get the distribution company to pick up the phone; it suspected political interference.Eventually, 3,600 copies were returned, some of them stained and smudged. The cartoonists took to an outdoor book market in Sofia, where about 50 copies were sold in 10 minutes.For the second issue, the publishers decided to distribute the newspaper themselves, to independent bookstores and newsstands throughout the country. This time, the print run was 8,000, and only 76 copies were returned unsold.Stefka Veleva, 77, visited five newspaper kiosks before she could get her hands on a copy of the third issue, at a bookstore in central Sofia. \u201cI enjoy satire and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more critical voices in this country.\u201dMr. Nikolov marveled: \u201cPeople stop us on the street to congratulate us and tell us that they support us, or just give us a \u2018thumbs up\u2019 sign.\u201dGeorgi Lozanov, a media expert and associate professor at Sofia University, praised the newspaper\u2019s focus on images, saying that \u201cmessages delivered by caricature\u201d resonated strongly in \u201csocieties where traditional media fails to expose problems and deficiencies through deductive reasoning.\u201dBut keeping a new print publication afloat, even an inexpensively produced one, will be a challenge.\u201cThe only way to survive is to stay popular among the audience and to demonstrate their boldness of ideas, biting wit and talent with each upcoming issue,\u201d Mr. Lozanov said.Vesislava Antonova, a journalist who has been covering the media in Bulgaria since 2000, said that a move to online-only publication might be inevitable. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to escape the traps of the suppressed media market in Bulgaria,\u201d she said.Aside from economic survival, there is the question of censorship.\u201cThe government\u2019s allocation of E.U. funding to certain media outlets is conducted with a complete lack of transparency, in effect bribing editors to go easy on the government in their political reporting or refrain from covering certain problematic stories altogether,\u201d the group noted.In April 2016, Nova TV, one of the biggest private television channels in Bulgaria, terminated Mr. Nikolov\u2019s contract and removed his cartoons from its website after he depicted Mr. Borisov as a leader of a group of vigilantes \u201chunting\u201d for migrants along Bulgaria\u2019s border with Turkey. (The channel said the timing had been a coincidence.)Christo Komarnitski, another founder of Prass Press, said that he had thought that \u201cno one buys newspapers anymore,\u201d and was \u201cblown away by the overwhelming interest\u201d in the first several issues.He added: \u201cWe wanted to give people a paper which is honest and sincere. At the newsstands, the variety of papers on offer is overwhelming, but most of these publications are tabloids peddling gossip and untruths.\u201dThe name of Prass Press is a pun. The word \u201cprass\u201d is the sound produced when a watermelon, or someone\u2019s head, is smacked with a stick \u2014 the intention is to mock Mr. Peevski\u2019s publications, which are often seen as the government\u2019s attack dogs, and to represent the cartoonists\u2019 own goal of independent, hard-hitting satire.\u201cThere will be no harmless jokes in our paper,\u201d Mr. Nikolov declared. \u201cBut who knows? Maybe for our 100th issue, we\u2019ll portray Borisov as thin.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Back home in Berkeley, \u201cEverywhere that I took it, people would run down the street after me and ask, where could they get this thing?\u201d Mr. Goldwater said.Monkeylectric \u2014 no one remembers how it got the name \u2014 sits at the intersection of safety and art, with an overlay of whimsy. Cyclists pay $25 to $60 for a set of lights to attach to their bicycle wheels. When the wheels spin, they produce rotating light shows with various designs: rainbows, hearts, a skull-and-crossbones or geometrics.\u201cMy colleagues love them and love recommending them,\u201d said Christopher Kisicki, a cycling associate at the flagship store in Seattle of REI, the sporting goods retailer. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep them in stock,\u201d he said.Monkeylectric does $1 million in sales annually. There is the Christmas rush and in summer, the Burning Man bump.\u201cI hate to say it, but it\u2019s almost mandatory to have them on your bike at Burning Man,\u201d said Jefferson McCarley, manager of the Mission Bicycle Company, which builds custom bikes in San Francisco.Monkeylectric\u2019s market is a niche one, but growing: As of 2015, 885,000 people commuted on bicycles in the United States, up from 488,000 in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And biking in the dusk or dark is clearly very dangerous. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, bicycle deaths occur most often from 6 to 9 p.m.In an unscientific survey along San Francisco\u2019s Market Street one night last week, most cyclists had front lights and weak red reflectors on the back (as required by law), but no side lights. Few bicycle lights are as eye-catching or noticeable to motorists as Monkeylectric\u2019s lights. They are sold in 500 stores and on Amazon, which offers many similar-looking products for much less money.Mr. Goldwater calls many of those products knockoffs. Every year, he said, he saw a half-dozen more companies based in China with look-alike lights that sell for $10 or $15. Mr. Goldwater, who holds five patents on bicycle lighting, refers to them as \u201ctoys,\u201d although some consumers fail to see the difference.Cheaper lights, Mr. Goldwater said, tend to be dim, not very durable and not waterproof.James Hill, a worker owner at Missing Link, a cooperative bicycle shop in downtown Berkeley, who monitors bike lights when he is in his car, recalled being at a stoplight with his wife late one afternoon when they watched a cyclist whip across the road, with \u201cvery impressive lights,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of inventions are terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of them are great.\u201dMonkeylectric lights \u201care arguably the best way to be seen\u201d by motorists, he said.Janelle Wong, operations manager at the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group with 10,000 members, has Monkeylectric lights on three of her five bicycles. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable way to light up a bike,\u201d she said.The co-founder of Revolights, Kent Frankovich, a 33-year-old mechanical engineer, began his quest for a better bike light after pedaling into a pothole one night while commuting from Stanford University where, among other things, he helped design a solar-powered freezer. Before entering the bicycle business in 2011, he was a researcher at a biorobotics lab and at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, helping build an instrument that identifies rocks and soil on Mars.Despite his product\u2019s benefits, Mr. Frankovich said, \u201cIt\u2019s a hard sale.\u201d Many cyclists are minimalists, reluctant to add anything to their simple mode of transportation.That a product improves safety is insufficient. It has to be cool, Mr. Frankovich said. \u201cWho in the world doesn\u2019t know a helmet will save your life?\u201d he said. Yet many cyclists reject them because \u201cthey think they look dorky.\u201dAt several bike stores contacted for this article, sellers said they liked Revolights, but considered them on the expensive side, particularly for cost-conscious consumers who buy modestly priced bikes.But that is not a problem at the Mission Bicycle Company, the custom bike shop that builds $999 bicycles. Revolights are \u201cfashion forward, high-tech lights,\u201d said Mr. McCarley, the manager. \u201cOur customers appreciate minimalism.\u201dYears ago, the Mission Bicycle Company shared a Kickstarter campaign with Revolights, but today, Mission Bikes is developing an LED wheel light to be built into its bikes.Before Mr. Goldwater started Monkeylectric, he considered his art project \u201ca Ferrari.\u201d The market was there, but, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine how I could make a commercial project out of it.\u201dHis early work would become a precursor for Monkeylectric\u2019s high-end product that, when spun, shows video clips of, say, a swimming fish or a running dog \u2014 for $1,000.When Mr. Goldwater got started, there was already one LED bicycle light company, Hokey Spokes. Carole Barnes, who with her husband, Richard, bought the business in 2005, said they had since \u201clost our enthusiasm.\u201d They sell a few hundred lights a year, she said.Mr. Goldwater started working on his product 12 years ago, when he was an electrical engineer at the MIT Media Lab researching smart paint and self-assembling robots. He made what he calls \u201ca monumental art piece\u201d \u2014 the bicycle with kaleidoscope wheels he rode at Burning Man. For an electrical engineer who cycles, adding LEDs to wheel spokes \u201cis a coming-of-age project,\u201d Mr. Goldwater said.The appeal is obvious: \u201cWhen you spin, the effect is much greater than when you started,\u201d he said.Lights on rotating wheels create what scientists call persistence of vision, which is an illusion. When bicycle wheels with LED lights rotate, our eyes perceive moving light as a continuous image.Monkeylectric has gone to the Kickstarter well three times. The last time, it raised $248,331, many in preorders for new lights that automatically turn on when rotated in the dark.Mr. Frankovich, the founder of Revolights, holds six patents on bicycle lighting. He has raised funds on \u201cShark Tank,\u201d Indiegogo and Kickstarter.Both companies have marketed their products on Facebook, Instagram and other sites. But Mr. Frankovich said that nothing compared with \u201cstreet viral marketing\u201d \u2014 cyclists pedaling dark streets, with wheeled illumination.\u201cEvery bike is a little billboard for us,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of a bicycle shop in downtown Berkeley. It is Missing Link, not Missing Links. And an earlier version of a picture caption misstated the surname of Monkeylectric\u2019s top engineer. He is Phillip Yip, not Ye.Advertisement"}

Peters and the other members of his Navy parachute team began their final preparations to jump from their C-130 transport plane. At two minutes, the group members, firing one another up, huddled together and said a prayer. At one minute, they duckwalked their way to the now-open back hatch, a smile glued to Petty Officer Peters\u2019s face.That performance turned out to be one of the last for Petty Officer Peters. A special warfare operator first class, he died on Sunday when his parachute did not open properly and he plunged into the Hudson River as hundreds of people watched from Liberty State Park in Jersey City. He was 27.With the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline visible in the distance, the parachutists jumped out of a helicopter around noon, spinning through the sky.But Petty Officer Peters separated from the others, dropping out of view. His parachute, which never fully opened, fell into a parking lot. The Navy said in a statement released on Monday that it was investigating the accident and pointed to \u201can equipment malfunction, though the specific nature and cause is currently unknown.\u201dAnd in a statement the Navy released on Monday, Petty Officer Peters\u2019s family praised its \u201ccourageous warrior\u201d as \u201can angel on earth and role model to all.\u201d The family continued, \u201cHe lived life to the fullest and taught us to do the same.\u201dPetty Officer Peters grew up in western Colorado and attended Grand Junction High School. One of his closest friends, Tyler Volkmann, recalled that Petty Officer Peters, who was in \u201cwildly good shape,\u201d ran sprints for the track team, played football and often snowboarded at nearby Powderhorn. And he made friends easily.\u201cHigh school is a crazy time where people judge each other all the time based on what you\u2019re wearing or what you\u2019re driving,\u201d said Mr. Volkmann, 27, who is now a project manager for a general contractor in Wisconsin. \u201cBut he was happy to be anybody\u2019s friend. He was always smiling.\u201dA guitar player, Petty Officer Peters was fond of music, including contemporary Christian rock, and he and Mr. Volkmann traveled one summer to the Creation Northwest festival in Washington State, which featured one of their favorite acts, Grits, a Nashville hip-hop group.But above all, Mr. Volkmann recalled, Mr. Peters, with a penchant for fast cars and motorcycles, wanted to join the military, perhaps as a pilot, because \u201che liked the adrenaline.\u201dMr. Peters enlisted in the Navy in September 2008, a few months after graduating from high school. He became a member of the Navy SEALs and was a veteran of two combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the Leap Frogs about a year ago. He made more than 900 jumps.In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, James Moore, a retired SEALs chief who is currently deputy operations officer for the Naval Special Warfare Basic Training Command, said there was still no explanation of what had gone wrong. He described Petty Officer Peters as full of \u201cuncompromising integrity\u201d and \u201calways striving to be the best.\u201d Petty Officer Peters would often come in on weekends, \u201cworking on his gear, making it perfect,\u201d he said.The Leap Frogs are based in San Diego, and in recent years, Petty Officer Peters had embraced an active outdoors lifestyle with his longtime girlfriend. Friends said he loved to sky-dive, hike and go rock climbing.Petty Officer Peters, who billed himself as an entrepreneur, also incorporated several businesses and registered numerous domain names; one business, still active, promoted a natural sleeping aid.\u201cIgnorance and fear are the only reasons for this law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s abolish this and allow athletes the freedom to safely huck it off cliffs, instead of having to sneak around at night and jumping in less than ideal conditions to avoid getting arrested.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers and Studios, Scrambling to Avert Strike, Reach Last-Minute Deal", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood writers reached a tentative deal for a new three-year contract with television and movie studios early Tuesday, averting a strike in dramatic overtime negotiations.At nearly 1 a.m. on the West Coast, weary union leaders, including Patric Verrone, the former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, emerged from the offices of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, and said that a favorable contract had been drawn up.In a statement posted on its website, the Writers Guild, West, said it had made \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d It added, \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dIn a one-sentence joint statement, writers and the producers\u2019 alliance said that they had secured \u201ca tentative agreement on terms for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement.\u201dThe previous contract between studios and more than 12,000 writers expired at midnight. The Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as soon as Tuesday morning.Union negotiators had locked horns with their studio counterparts all the way through. On Sunday, studios had made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.A deal only started to take shape as midnight approached, with both sides scrambling to find common ground.Writers and studios did not see eye to eye on several issues involving technology. Most prominently, writers wanted pay rates for shows that run on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to be more like those for blue-chip broadcast network series. The unions also wanted members to receive bigger residual payments for online reruns of old shows and movies.Another sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long TV writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering many fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode are often making less while working more.Under proposals discussed Monday, according to analysts at Moody\u2019s, higher compensation for writers would cost some entertainment companies $100 million to $125 million annually for each year of a new three-year contract. Unions representing directors and actors \u201cwill likely key off any agreement\u201d with writers, adding to cost increases.The actors\u2019 contract with studios expires on June 30.As the entertainment capital waited for word on talks on Monday, union members, including one involved with talks, posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong!

{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s Disappearing Valuation", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe company, known for its rainbow-vomit photo filters, suffered a market drop of more than 25 percent during after-hours trading on Wednesday, sending shares close to its $17 offer price before it went public on March 2.On just about every metric, Snap disappointed. Revenue rose almost 300 percent to nearly $150 million but missed analysts\u2019 consensus. It torched more cash. Even excluding the whopping $2 billion in stock-based compensation, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, it still notched a loss of $188 million.Perhaps most concerning for the five-year-old company is the snaillike pace of daily active user growth. Year-over-year, it rose 36 percent to 166 million. That compares to a 48 percent year-over-year uptick in the fourth quarter.Evan Spiegel, the co-founder and chief executive, chalked up the tepid growth to exclusivity. It is true that part of its appeal to a young base \u2014 more than 80 percent of social network users in the United States between 12 and 17 use the app, according to eMarketer \u2014 is the way it allows close management of contacts. But slow growth also implies that Snap\u2019s valuation at 27 times revenue, at least before Wednesday afternoon, is unjustified. Facebook, for example, is trading at around 11 times estimated sales for this year.In the meantime, Facebook is treating Snapchat like its own research and development lab.

Now it is hamstrung by slowing adoption and declining revenue. Snap\u2019s first set of results looks more like an egg hatched out of Twitter\u2019s nest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claims of Liberal Bias in Media Now Include Sportscasters, Too", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byA TV network is accused of political bias: hardly a surprise in 2017. But what if the network is a sports broadcaster?\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of the times,\u201d said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who is an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Professional Studies. \u201cI think people are looking for bias, and opinion, and information that in some way involves some hidden signal or indication that there\u2019s a political bias in one direction or another.\u201dIt is not as if American sports and politics have never intersected. From Jackie Robinson\u2019s breaking Major League Baseball\u2019s color barrier to Billie Jean King\u2019s fight for gender equality in tennis to John Carlos and Tommie Smith\u2019s black power salute at the 1968 Olympics, many moments and figures in sports history mark social mileposts.And ESPN has had no shortage of political story lines to explore lately, after quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem in protest of what he saw as widespread American racism, the United States women\u2019s soccer team and women\u2019s hockey team raised issues of equal pay in labor disputes, and several members of the New England Patriots declined an invitation to the White House.But for fans to detect a viewpoint from a mainstream sports broadcaster appears to be a novel development.In some cases, ESPN has been accused of putting a thumb on the scale of social debates that are not settled. A galvanizing incident for critics was Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs, ESPN\u2019s annual award show, in 2015, after Ms. Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist in the decathlon, announced she was transgender.The claim that the layoffs somehow resulted from disenchantment with political bias is most likely untrue. Industry analysts have tied ESPN\u2019s job cuts to radically shifting habits of media consumption \u2014 notably the fact that millions of people are turning away from cable TV, which for decades has been ESPN\u2019s mother lode for revenue \u2014 and to other business-related factors.\u201cI\u2019m not aware of a tangible connection that has expressed itself through any data,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, in reference to theories that a political slant helped cause layoffs. He added, \u201cThere are much more obvious things to point to.\u201dStill, some viewers seized on a rare moment of public vulnerability for ESPN to air their grievances, an echo of Gamergate, a heated dispute that escalated a few years ago when video game reviewers were accused of inappropriately infusing politics and biases on other subjects into their work, leading to a campaign of harassment against those who were derogatorily called \u201csocial justice warriors.\u201d(It is difficult to discern, of course, whether the complaints lodged against ESPN on social media and other digital platforms represented a small or large portion of the network\u2019s viewership.)But conservatives might disagree with Mr. Skipper\u2019s parsing, and Bob Ley, one of ESPN\u2019s longest-tenured anchors, perhaps hinted at one byproduct of ESPN\u2019s \u201cdiversity and inclusion\u201d when he told the ombudsman, Jim Brady, in reference to gender and racial emphases in personnel: \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job of diversity. But the one place we have miles to go is diversity of thought.\u201dAn ESPN-commissioned study last October found that 28 percent of the network\u2019s consumers believed it was politically biased, according to figures provided by ESPN. Of that 28 percent, 56 percent believed the network was biased in a liberal direction, while 37 percent said it was biased in a conservative direction.By contrast, coverage of Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an N.F.L. team, and a town hall event in October with President Barack Obama both resulted in slightly more ESPN viewers feeling better about the network than feeling worse, according to ESPN.Mr. Pilson said he believed that amid the present political deluge, even sports media outlets could not help but get wet.\u201cPeople are either anticipating, expecting or microwatching sportscasters to see if they can detect any bias,\u201d he said.Barry Blyn, ESPN\u2019s vice president for consumer insights, noted in an interview that ratings for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC had not fallen off since November.\u201cThe election isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because it isn\u2019t over, everything is political.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about claims of liberal bias hitting ESPN misstated the position Neal Pilson holds at Columbia University. Mr. Pilson, who said the criticism of ESPN was \u201ca sign of the times,\u201d is an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Professional Studies, not a professor at the journalism school.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Some Can\u2019t Wait for a Repeal of Obamacare", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byFor Linda Dearman, the House vote last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act was a welcome relief.Ms. Dearman, of Bartlett, Ill., voted for President Trump largely because of his contempt for the federal health law. She and her husband, a partner in an engineering firm, buy their own insurance, but late last year they dropped their $1,100-a-month policy and switched to a bare-bones plan that does not meet the law\u2019s requirements. They are counting that the law will be repealed before they owe a penalty.\u201cNow it looks like it will be, and we\u2019re thrilled about that,\u201d Ms. Dearman, 54, said. \u201cWe are so glad to feel represented for a change.\u201dThe voices of people like the Dearmans helped spawn a political movement after the passage of the health law seven years ago. But unlike the pro-Obamacare forces that have flooded congressional phone lines and town hall meetings, opponents of the health care law have been quieter as Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have worked to fulfill their promise to get rid of the law.Yet even if the law no longer faces the kind of strident grass-roots opposition that helped hand the Republicans the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, many who perceive themselves as losers under its policies are still anxiously awaiting its demise.The challenge for Republicans is to reclaim the narrative, countering the intense resistance to repeal with personal stories of people struggling with high insurance costs, tax penalties and government rules.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, invoked those struggles when he sent a Twitter message on Monday: \u201cTo those who\u2019ve suffered from the failures of Obamacare: We hear you. Congress is acting.\u201dHouse Republicans find themselves on the defensive for passing a bill that would weaken protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, sharply cut federal Medicaid funding and require many poor and older people to pay a much larger share of their health insurance bill. Yet they are being rooted on by Americans like the Dearmans who expect the Republican legislation to bring them more choices and lower their personal costs.In some cases, though, their zest for repeal has been tempered by concern or confusion about some specifics of the Republican bill, especially the relaxing of protections for people with pre-existing conditions.In interviews over the last few days, people who support repealing the Affordable Care Act pointed to their long-simmering resentment of its mandate that most Americans have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Many also said that they could no longer afford the comprehensive coverage available on the individual market, and that they were eager to once again be allowed to choose skinnier policies without a penalty.\u201cNow I will no longer be expected to pay twice what I should for a product I don\u2019t need and be treated like a criminal with a fine if I refuse,\u201d said Edward Belanger, 55, a self-employed business appraiser in Dallas. He is an independent who usually votes Republican but last year chose Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, over Mr. Trump.Like the Dearmans, Mr. Belanger canceled a plan that complies with the Affordable Care Act and bought a short-term policy that does not meet the law\u2019s standards, paying $580 a month for his family of four compared with the nearly $1,200 a month he paid last year. Policies like theirs usually have high deductibles and primarily offer catastrophic coverage for major injuries. Once the policies expire, policyholders must reapply and may be rejected if they are sick.Last year, the Dearmans paid $1,100 a month for themselves and a college-age son, with a $2,000-per-person deductible. Both they and the Belangers earn too much to receive subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which limits them to people with incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty level, or $97,200 for a family of four.Middle-class Americans who feel squeezed by the full cost of insurance under the law are among its fiercest critics, and could in many cases be winners of a sort under the House bill, which would provide subsidies to families that earn far more than the Affordable Care Act\u2019s income limit. They would range from $2,000 a year for people in their 20s to $4,000 for those in their 60s, with a limit of $14,000 per family, gradually phasing down for couples earning more than $150,000. There is no guarantee, however, that deductibles would be smaller under the Republican plan.\u201cI\u2019ve been listening to some TV here and there and thinking, \u2018What am I missing?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey were showing protests outside somewhere in Chicago. That\u2019s when I thought, \u2018All right, I need to read a little bit more.\u2019\u201dOthers feel the plan does not go far enough. Austin Craig, a commercial video producer in Provo, Utah, said he was frustrated that it would provide premium subsidies to many Americans \u2014 though based on age instead of income \u2014 and retain many of the insurance regulations in the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThis is not principled reform,\u201d said Mr. Craig, 33, who likened his political philosophies to those of Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, who has called the House bill \u201cObamacare lite.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just rearranging the government involvement instead of pulling it out.\u201dThomas Johnston, a retired factory manager in Marco Island, Fla., said he supported repealing the health care law only out of hope that he could afford health insurance again.Mr. Johnston, 61, bought coverage through the law\u2019s online marketplaces for several years but did not renew his plan for this year after learning his $640 monthly premium would be rising again. He said he qualified for a subsidy last year under the Affordable Care Act, but owed back all $2,000 of it at tax time. His income ended up being over the $64,000 limit for a household of two once his wife, who is on Medicare, started receiving her pension and he took a part-time job at a miniature golf course.\u201cIt has to be better than what we\u2019ve got now,\u201d Mr. Johnston said of the Republican plan to replace the law. \u201cI have literally no health insurance because I can\u2019t afford it.\u201dHe has not followed the details of the Republican plan, he said; he was not aware, for example, that as someone in his 60s, he would receive a $4,000 annual subsidy under it.\u201cTo be real honest, I wish I understood it a little more,\u201d he said of the bill.Mr. Belanger said that while the Republican bill would most likely help \u201cpeople in my situation, who are in the individual marketplace and generally healthy,\u201d it would not address the problems of people with expensive diseases.\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s going to be some sort of government program that takes care of those people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it were up to me, I\u2019d allow people to buy their way into Medicaid. I\u2019d rather be taking care of them through my tax dollars, with all the other taxpayers in the country, than pay twice as much as I should for insurance.\u201dKatrice MacKay, a homemaker in Provo, expressed revulsion toward the Affordable Care Act, yet said she wanted people with pre-existing conditions to be protected moving forward. She said her family of four was paying $1,000 a month for a high-deductible plan with no subsidy, up from $500 a month before the law took effect.\u201cThe amount we are getting hit, compared to other people who are paying nothing and getting everything covered, doesn\u2019t add up to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the divide is too wide.\u201dStill, Ms. MacKay, who voted for Mr. Trump, added that people with pre-existing conditions deserved to be protected.\u201cI did have siblings who couldn\u2019t get insurance in the past and that\u2019s just wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be dinged more than anyone else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Shocking Diagnosis: Breast Implants \u2018Gave Me Cancer\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byRaylene Hollrah was 33, with a young daughter, when she learned she had breast cancer. She made a difficult decision, one she hoped would save her life: She had her breasts removed, underwent grueling chemotherapy and then had reconstructive surgery.In 2013, six years after her first diagnosis, cancer struck again \u2014 not breast cancer, but a rare malignancy of the immune system \u2014 caused by the implants used to rebuild her chest.\u201cMy whole world came crumbling down again,\u201d said Ms. Hollrah, now 43, who owns an insurance agency in Hermann, Mo. \u201cI had spent the past six years going to the oncologist every three months trying to keep cancer away, and here was something I had put in my body to try to help me feel more like a woman, and it gave me cancer. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going to see my kids grow up.\u2019\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration first reported a link between implants and the disease in 2011, and information was added to the products\u2019 labeling. But the added warnings are deeply embedded in a dense list of complications, and no implants have been recalled. The F.D.A. advises women only \u201cto follow their doctor\u2019s recommended actions for monitoring their breast implants,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email this month.Until recently, many doctors had never heard of the disease, and little was known about the women who suddenly received the shocking diagnosis of cancer brought on by implants.Women who have had the lymphoma say that the attention is long overdue, that too few women have been informed of the risk and that those with symptoms often face delays and mistakes in diagnosis, and difficulties in receiving proper care. Some have become severely ill.Implants have become increasingly popular. From 2000 to 2016, the number of breast augmentations in the United States rose 37 percent, and reconstructions after mastectomy rose 39 percent. Annually, nearly 400,000 women in the United States get breast implants, about 300,000 for cosmetic enlargement and about 100,000 for reconstruction after cancer, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Allergan and Mentor are the major manufacturers. Worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million women got implants in 2015.\u201cI\u2019d like to think that since then we\u2019ve made progress on that,\u201d Dr. Clemens said.Late last year, an alliance of cancer centers, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, issued treatment guidelines. Experts agree that the essential first step is to remove the implant and the entire capsule of scar tissue around it. Otherwise, the disease is likely to recur, and the prognosis to worsen.Not all women have been able to get the recommended treatment. Kimra Rogers, 50, a nursing assistant in Caldwell, Idaho, learned last May that she had lymphoma, from textured implants she had for more than 10 years. But instead of removing the implants and capsules immediately, her doctor prescribed six rounds of chemotherapy and 25 rounds of radiation. A year later, she still has the implants.\u201cUnfortunately, my doctor didn\u2019t know the first line of defense,\u201d Ms. Rogers said.She learned about the importance of having the implants removed only from other women in a Facebook group for those with the disease.Her health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana, covered the chemotherapy and radiation but has refused to pay for removal of the implants, and told her that her appeal rights were \u201cexhausted.\u201d In a statement sent to The New York Times, a spokesman said, \u201cCosmetic breast implants are a contract exclusion, as are any services related to complications of the cosmetic breast implants, including implant removal and reconstruction.\u201dPhysicians dispute that reasoning, saying the surgery is needed to treat cancer. Her lawyer, Graham Newman, from Columbia, S.C., said he was planning a lawsuit against the implant makers, and had about 20 other clients with breast-implant lymphoma from Australia, Canada, England and the United States.Ms. Rogers has been unable to work for a year. If she has to pay to have the implants removed, it will mean taking out a $12,000 loan.\u201cBut it\u2019s worth my life,\u201d she said.Insurers generally cover implants after a mastectomy, but not for cosmetic enlargement, which costs $7,500 or more. Repeat operations for complications are also common, and usually cost more than the original surgery.Most of the cancers have developed from two to 28 years after implant surgery, with a median of eight. A vast majority occurred with textured implants.Most implants in the United States are smooth. But for some, including those with teardrop shapes that would look odd if they rotated, texturing is preferable, because tissue can grow into the rough surface and help anchor the implant.Researchers estimate that in Europe and the United States, one in 30,000 women with textured implants will develop the disease. But in Australia the estimate is higher: one in 10,000 to one in 1,000. No one knows why there is such a discrepancy.What\u2019s inside the implant \u2014 silicone or saline \u2014 seems to make no difference: Case numbers have been similar for the two types. The reason for the implants \u2014 cosmetic breast enlargement or reconstruction after a mastectomy \u2014 makes no difference, either.Symptoms of the lymphoma usually include painful swelling and fluid buildup around the implant. Sometimes there are lumps in the breast or armpit.The disease is usually treatable and not often fatal. Removing the implant and the entire capsule of scar tissue around it often eliminates the lymphoma. But if the cancer has spread, women need chemotherapy and sometimes radiation.\u201cIn the cases where we have seen bad outcomes, it was usually because they were not treated or there was a major delay in treatment, on the level of years,\u201d Dr. Clemens said. Doctors at MD Anderson have treated 38 cases and have a laboratory dedicated to studying the disease.About 85 percent of cases can be cured with surgery alone, he said. But he added that in the past, before doctors understood how well surgery worked, many women were given chemotherapy that they probably did not need.Case reports on the F.D.A. website vary from sketchy to somewhat detailed and rarely include long-term follow-up. Some describe initial diagnoses that were apparently mistaken, including infection and other types of cancer. In some cases, symptoms lasted or recurred for years before the right diagnosis was made.What exactly causes the disease is not known. One theory is that bacteria may cling to textured implants and form a coating called a biofilm that stirs up the immune system and causes persistent inflammation, which may eventually lead to lymphoma. The idea is medically plausible, because other types of lymphoma stem from certain chronic infections. Professional societies for plastic surgeons recommend special techniques to avoid contamination in the operating room when implants are inserted.\u201cIt could also just be the immune system response to some component of the texturing,\u201d Dr. Clemens said. The rough surface may be irritating or abrasive. Allergan implants seem to be associated with more cases than other types, possibly because they are more deeply textured and have more surface area for bacteria to stick to, he said. Allergan uses a \u201clost-salt\u201d method that involves rolling an implant in salt to create texture and then washing the salt away. Other makers use a sponge to imprint texturing onto the implant surface.Allergan is studying bacterial biofilms, and immune and inflammatory responses to breast implants, a spokesman said in an email. He said the company took the disease seriously and was working with professional societies to distribute educational materials about it.Another possible cause is that some women have a genetic trait that somehow, in the presence of implants, predisposes them to lymphoma. Dr. Clemens said researchers were genetically sequencing 50 patients to look for mutations that might contribute to the disease.Dr. Clemens was a paid consultant for Allergan from 2013 to 2015, but not for breast implants, and no longer consults for any company, he said.A spokeswoman for Mentor said the company was monitoring reports about the lymphoma, and stood behind the safety of its implants.Ms. Hollrah had implants inserted in 2008 and felt fine for five years. Then in 2013, in a matter of days, her right breast tripled in size, filling painfully with fluid.Her plastic surgeon removed the implant and replaced it. He had just read about the lymphoma, so to be on the safe side, he ordered CD30 testing. The results were positive.\u201cIt\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Ms. Hollrah said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You have cancer again, but it\u2019s not breast cancer.\u2019\u201dOn her doctor\u2019s recommendation, she saw Dr. Clemens, who removed the implants and surrounding tissue. Chemotherapy and radiation were planned but turned out to be unneeded, because tests found no spread of the cancer. She remains well, but returns to MD Anderson once a year for scans.\u201cI will be monitored for the rest of my life,\u201d she said.Other women have needed more extreme treatment. Terri McGregor, 52, from North Bay, Ontario, had implant surgery in 2009. Six years later, after a routine mammogram with normal results, she felt lumps in her breast. Thinking the mammogram had ruptured her implants, her doctor removed and replaced them.Because the tissue around the implants looked abnormal, he had it tested for CD30.Ms. McGregor was stunned to learn she had the implant-associated lymphoma.\u201cI had no symptoms,\u201d she said.The new implants had to be removed. Further tests led to another shock: The cancer was advanced. Ms. McGregor felt ashamed, because she had gotten the implants simply to improve her appearance.\u201cI brought this on myself. I brought this on my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI really needed to work through that shame and guilt.\u201dTwo chemotherapy regimens failed. In March 2016, she was given three to six months to live. She sold her paving business but tried to keep the prognosis from her sons, who were 20 and 23.There was one more option: a drug called brentuximab vedotin.\u201cI had four rounds,\u201d Ms. McGregor said. \u201cThe tumor on my chest literally disappeared.\u201dDoctors then gave her high-dose chemotherapy, a transplant of her own stem cells and, in December, 15 radiation treatments.The aggressive treatment has taken its toll. She used to shovel asphalt and hoist 50-pound bags of cement.\u201cNow I struggle to carry my laundry basket upstairs,\u201d she said.She hopes the treatment has cured her.Like Ms. Hollrah, she participates in the Facebook group, and thinks women need more information.\u201cOur motive is informed consent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a bunch of very unorganized women doing that because they have a passion for it, and how do you process your injustice feelings but to try to make change?\u201dStacey Boone, 51, of Bradenton, Fla., also needed a stem-cell transplant, for lymphoma that had invaded her liver by the time it was diagnosed. The disease is in remission.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road,\u201d she said.Kim Crespo, 49, from Palm Beach, Fla., said she had consulted several plastic surgeons in Florida who even in 2016 had never heard of lymphoma associated with breast implants. Nor had her gynecologist. She was treated for the disease at MD Anderson.Vikki Radow, 46, of Los Angeles, said that when she had heard the F.D.A. reported nine deaths from implant-associated lymphoma, \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, my God, my mother was one of those nine.\u2019\u201dMs. Radow\u2019s mother, Bettye C. Yaller, first received an implant about 30 years ago after a mastectomy for breast cancer. She had the implant removed and replaced a few times, and began to have swelling and pain in 2009 or 2010, Ms. Radow said.Doctors diagnosed an infection, removed the implant and replaced it. In 2012, at 76, her mother became short of breath and had pain and swelling in her breast, a lump in her chest, and swollen lymph nodes in her chest and neck.\u201cIt started the most wild goose chase I\u2019ve ever been on,\u201d Ms. Radow said.Her mother was hospitalized for two months, worsening steadily, as doctors struggled to determine what was wrong. In desperation, Ms. Radow\u2019s husband consulted a physician friend, who suggested testing for lymphoma \u2014 and the diagnosis was finally made. By then, Ms. Yaller was critically ill, on a ventilator.She improved with chemotherapy and came home from the hospital.When she was considered strong enough for surgery, she went back to the hospital to have the implant removed. Her heart stopped on the operating table. She was resuscitated but died two weeks later.Ms. Radow described her mother as a vibrant, lively woman who line danced, took water aerobics classes, traveled, belonged to a book group and reveled in the company of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Her mother had no idea that there was any cancer risk from implants, and told doctors that if she had known, she never would have wanted one, Ms. Radow said, adding, \u201cMy mother was robbed of the rest of her life.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect middle initial for a woman who died after contracting cancer from a breast implant. She was Bettye C. Yaller, not Bettye K. The error was repeated in an earlier version of a picture caption.Sarah Cohen contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Murder at College Park", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byOn CampusThe news hit us so hard. It was like a huge brick house landed on my chest.Obviously, an entire school cannot be judged by the actions and beliefs of one student. But this horrific death is part of a pattern of racial intimidation happening on many college campuses. The output of hate \u2014 usually in the form of white nationalist signs, or graffitied slurs \u2014 is not new but it seems to constantly take new forms. Bananas hung from nooses, scrawled with the name of an African-American sorority on American University\u2019s campus. Fliers posted around the University of Maryland that say, \u201cAmerica is a white nation.\u201d Even at my historically black college, Bowie State, there were swastikas drawn around the campus.At Bowie State, no one really questions whether race was involved in this killing. Of course, administrators at the University of Maryland can\u2019t say that. Racism is an ugly word. It could cost the university money; maybe Maryland alumni would jump down the administration\u2019s throat. No prospective student wants to go to a school that is open about the fact that it has a problem with racism.But what happens in the dark always comes to light, and racism on campus is no different. Addressing it head on may create more political problems in the short term, but if schools cannot crack down on racist incidents, hateful behavior will only proliferate. Too often, truly cruel speech is excused because it falls under \u201cfree speech.\u201d But is there any doubt that hateful speech \u2014 the kind that proliferates online, and shows up on our campuses \u2014 can easily becomes hateful action, or at least, that it makes room for such action? Is there anything more threatening to a student\u2019s self-expression than being killed?It is impossible to know without a doubt about the intentions of Richard Collins\u2019s killer \u2014 alcohol was clearly involved. But his death was needless. Since the tragedy, the entire Bowie State community has banded together. It is good to see the outpouring of love and support from alumni, professors and students. It also shows just how important the HBCU community is. The mentality is: We are all in this together. Now is no exception.Stress is common to all college students, but I think race-related stress \u2014 which extends, of course, beyond campuses \u2014 is incredibly overlooked. People of color experience heightened anxiety based on our experiences and what we see in the news. It\u2019s not always fear of a racist act. It could be anxiety from impostor syndrome or about being perceived as conforming to a stereotype, for example. We are seen differently and it gives us higher levels of sensitivity to imagine, and prepare for, the ways we may be perceived.The news of Richard Collins\u2019s death is horrible. I don\u2019t want to diminish his life, but this is what we have come to expect. It is hard not to become numb to the news. In it we see reoccurring themes that reveal how black life is valued less.There is plenty of mystery about the details of Richard Collins\u2019s killing, but the bottom line is a white male college student came up to a black male college student and stabbed him, unprovoked. Collins was merely waiting for an Uber with two friends.This terrible tragedy came at the end of a school year at the University of Maryland riddled with racially fueled incidents that have deeply affected people of color on campus. Following November\u2019s election, posters for the National Vanguard, a white nationalist organization, were pinned up on buildings throughout the campus. These posters urged white students to take back \u201ctheir country.\u201d More recently, a noose was found hanging in a fraternity house that is staffed with black workers and owned by the university.Regardless, students of color want the UMD administration to respond more forcefully. A coalition of students, ProtectUMD, formed after last year\u2019s presidential election to negotiate with the administration for better acknowledgment of the adversity students of color face. But we feel we have been ignored.After the noose incident, President Loh condemned the act and reaffirmed the university\u2019s dedication to promoting diversity, saying that this was not representative of the community. But he has not done enough to meet with student leaders or call out horrible racism for what it is. Students of color at the University of Maryland are rarely consulted when initiatives to help them are drafted.Since the death of Richard Collins, students have been shaken. We are scared that we attend a school where something like this could happen. Students of color do not feel safe, and we have been saying this repeatedly. We ask that our problems be officially acknowledged \u2014 that the administration send a message that there are extreme repercussions for those who feel perfectly comfortable disrespecting and disregarding the lives of people of color.Soon after a noose was found hanging in a frat house, a group of students of color organized a safe area in the library. It was essentially just a place for those students and their allies to study without fear of judgment or intimidation \u2014 but other students complained that we were taking up a whole floor and that it was \u201cinconsiderate.\u201d Many white students were upset with us for \u201cdisrupting the community during finals week.\u201dIt is so incredibly frustrating to be called \u201cinconsiderate\u201d or \u201cdisruptive\u201d when the truth is that students of color are in much greater danger than so many of our white peers.A black student from Bowie State University was murdered on our campus by a white student. It feels like it could\u2019ve been me or any of my friends \u2014 and that is frightening.I hope and pray that this tragedy will open up people\u2019s eyes to the fact that racism is very much alive and real, and when students of color bring it up, we should be taken seriously. Listen to us.The terrible news unfolded over the course of graduation weekend. As seniors, we have all spent the better part of this semester asking, answering, or avoiding the question: \u201cSo, what are you doing next?\u201dMr. Collins had an answer. After his graduation he was joining the Army as a second lieutenant. How is it that everything could be taken from him and his family, so completely and so quickly?Most students had already left for the summer when the news broke. There were no large crowds to rally on the mostly empty campus. The outrage was immense, but there is a huge, unanswerable question: How do we fix this? How do we honor his life?Soon after the attacker\u2019s name was released, we heard about his affiliation with an alt-right Facebook group, and that Lieutenant Collins\u2019s death was being investigated as a hate crime. I was shocked. I have been so proud of the strides this campus has taken to increase diversity and promote inclusive language and behavior. Posters cover dorm walls and notice boards challenging us students to think about the impact of our words. We have been encouraged to speak up for ourselves, to make UMD a safe space for everyone.But the attacker was a UMD student. Lieutenant Collins was a guest on our campus. And he was subject to a hatred and violence that I refused to believe we harbored. During graduation, seniors took pictures with the beloved Testudo mascot, chanted \u201cTerps for Life\u201d, and proudly wore stoles emblazoned with the UMD logo. But loyalty to our fellow students was suddenly in question. The shared confusion and shame that one of us, a fellow Terp, could be so unspeakably cruel, made us all question \u2014 at the precipice of entering the wide unknown of the \u201creal world\u201d \u2014 just how deep our efforts to celebrate diversity go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why the Netflix-Cannes Clash Couldn\u2019t Be Avoided", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 France is a paradise for moviegoers, with thriving cinemas and state subsidies for new productions. Netflix is a global streaming giant founded on the concept that movie theaters are a thing of the past. So it was perhaps inevitable that the two worlds would collide over the Cannes Film Festival, which begins here on Wednesday.At the heart of the Cannes-Netflix clash is what\u2019s known as the French cultural exception, a law that requires a percentage of all box office, DVD, video on demand, television and streaming revenues to be pooled to finance homegrown films and help finance foreign films. The law also mandates a 36-month delay between theatrical release and streaming date. Netflix has not wanted to participate in the French system, and that offended some in the film industry here.\u201cThey are the perfect representation of American cultural imperialism,\u201d said Christophe Tardieu, director of the National Cinema Center, known as the CNC, a state entity that coordinates public financing of films. It also underwrites more than half the budget of the Cannes Film Festival and has seats on its board, as do French movie theater owners. \u201cI deplore Netflix\u2019s attitude in this affair, which showed total intransigence and refusing to understand and accept how the French cultural exception works,\u201d Mr. Tardieu added.Representatives of Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. After the festival\u2019s decision last week, Reed Hastings, a co-founder of Netflix, posted on Facebook, \u201cThe establishment closing ranks against us. See \u2018Okja\u2019 on Netflix June 28th. Amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into Cannes film festival competition.\u201dIn contrast, another streaming company, Amazon Studios, says it aims for theatrical releases for its films. It has a film in competition at Cannes this year, Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which will be shown in theaters in France.\u201cCannes misjudged,\u201d said Thomas Sotinel, a film critic and journalist at Le Monde. Festival programmers thought \u201cthey could get away with showing Netflix movies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they found out Netflix wouldn\u2019t move, and at the same time they were reminded that on the board of Cannes sit people like the theater owners, who don\u2019t want to budge either. So they were caught between those two very immovable protagonists \u2014 or rather, antagonists.\u201dIn France, the CNC said the Netflix films did not qualify for limited releases under an exemption for less mainstream work. But if Netflix had agreed to a wide release, it would have meant a 36-month wait before the movies could be streamed. That delay is part of France\u2019s \u201cmedia chronology\u201d in the cultural exception law, which sets a strict time frame in which a film moves from theaters to video-on-demand after four months, to cable television after 10 months, to free television after 22 months and finally to a streaming service.Most of the entities in France\u2019s film industry, as well as viewers, agree the 36-month wait is far too long, but complex talks about altering the time frame broke down just days before Cannes announced its rule change.Any new chronology must be approved by cinema owners, producers, cable and free television broadcasters, on-demand operators and associations representing writers, among others. Cable television operators like Canal Plus, which help finance productions aimed for theatrical releases, eventually want those films to be shown on their channels before they move to free channels or to a service that is not contributing to the financing system.\u201cThe difficulty is that you have a system that\u2019s extremely regulated but that works,\u201d said Marc-Olivier Sebbag, the general delegate of the National Federation of French Cinemas.\u201cThere are idiotic rules that don\u2019t let Netflix films come out for 36 months; I understand it\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Pascal Rogard, director general of the authors\u2019 society. \u201cThe real open question that will be given to the next culture minister is, \u2018Can we create a modernized media chronology so a film doesn\u2019t have to wait three years to go to Netflix?\u2019\u201dMr. Rogard and others said that they hoped the new government of President Emmanuel Macron would dedicate some political will to helping the parties shorten the time frame. Mr. Macron is expected to name a new culture minister this week.Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the Cannes Film Festival director who oversees selecting films for competition, said he had no comment beyond the official statement last week.That statement said that the festival was \u201caware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in France,\u201d adding that it had \u201casked Netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of French movie theaters and not only its subscribers.\u201d As a result, it stated, \u201cthe festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\u201dOn Monday, the festival announced that its opening and closing ceremonies would be broadcast to select French movie theaters \u2014 at the same time they\u2019re broadcast live on Canal Plus pay television.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buying Into the Turmoil: Investors Embrace the Risks", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byBuy the dip.Be it stocks, bonds or more complex derivative bets, investors following this Wall Street maxim have reaped robust rewards in recent years.Such buying has been evident in the shares of large American companies since March 2009, when the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index touched a low of 666. (It closed on Wednesday at 2,399.63.)Yet as stock markets hit record highs and the yields on volatile junk and emerging market bonds plunge, this view that market corrections should be seen as a buying opportunity, as opposed to a warning to be heeded, has begun to worry investors.The fear is that each subsequent rebound will embolden excessive risk taking and inflate richly valued stock and bond markets.Investors have repeatedly shaken off the risks of political turmoil, including the latest shock, President Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 ended the day up 0.11 percent, while the VIX was still near its decade lows, at 10.21.\u201cNo one has been penalized for buying the dip,\u201d said Bill Luby, an independent investor and active blogger who specializes in trades connected to the VIX.Until recently, he has been an active participant in Wall Street\u2019s most popular trade: Betting against VIX futures with the expectation that market volatility will remain quiescent.Now, he is worried about what will happen when the dip becomes something more severe than just a temporary dip, and the index bolts higher as investors panic.\u201cThat trade is really loaded up,\u201d Mr. Luby said. \u201cIt won\u2019t take much of a spike to cause a lot of pain.\u201dShorting, or betting against, the VIX is not the only trade of late where investors have been handsomely compensated for setting aside their fears.Investors have been snapping up government bonds issued by countries like Russia, Turkey and even Mongolia, enticed by mouthwatering yields and a perception that economic and political risks, which previously warned investors away, are no longer so severe.And in the United States stock market, stock pickers continue to ignore sky-high valuations of stocks and the market as a whole, buying up index giants like Amazon, which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 136, Apple and Facebook at the slightest sign of weakness.Few are predicting an outright market collapse.Economic growth, at home and abroad, is picking up, and the earnings for companies listed on the S.&P. 500 have been strong. And even with the political upheaval in Washington, most market participants remain convinced that the Trump administration\u2019s pledges for lower taxes and lighter regulation will provide ballast to the market.And with bank deposits and bonds from developed countries still offering meager returns, stocks and higher-risk fixed-income securities have come to be seen as the default option for investment managers looking to the long term.Nevertheless, the combination of complacency and rising markets has prompted a growing number to become more cautious.\u201cWe have been in a long up cycle and valuations are above average,\u201d said Bradley J. Vogt, a portfolio manager who invests in large capitalization United States stocks for the Capital Group, the Los Angeles-based fund giant that oversees $1.4 trillion. \u201cI am holding more cash than I usually hold in my funds right now.\u201dTo be sure, some of this recent spate of buying can be explained as investors looking for bargains in beaten-down areas \u2014 like emerging markets.Having lagged the broader rally in recent years, these markets took a further hit in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Currencies tumbled and investors took flight, fearful of the administration\u2019s anti-trade policies and a resurgent dollar, not to mention the usual dose of political turmoil.Nishant X. Upadhyay, an emerging market bond investor at HSBC Global Asset Management, took the opportunity late last year to buy Turkish government bonds, betting that worries about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his political ambitions were overdone.It was a winning trade \u2014 bond yields have fallen and the lira has strengthened substantially. Now, billions of dollars (Mr. Upadhyay estimates over $30 billion last quarter) are flowing into emerging market bonds as investors rush in to get a piece of the action.\u201cNo doubt the spreads are tightening,\u201d he said, in describing how the recent boom in the asset class has made them less attractive relative to lower-yielding bonds in developed markets. \u201cAnd there are risks out there. But the question is: Do you want to be sitting in cash right now or investing your dollars in alternative markets?\u201dFund managers with a long memory argue that while it may be true that markets are richly priced, it would be a mistake for investors to try to predict when markets will fall and remove their funds accordingly.Especially now, when cash and safe government bonds are such unattractive alternatives in terms of investment returns.Indeed, for all the ups and downs in the stock market over the last five years, the total return of the S.&P. 500 stock index is up close to 15 percent \u2014 beating most of the opportunities available to investors.\u201cThe view we frequently hear today is, \u2018aren\u2019t stocks expensive now given S.&P. price to earnings multiple,\u2019 which is at a 15 to 20 percent premium to the historical average,\u201d said William C. Nygren, who has been investing in United States stocks, under the Oakmark Funds brand, at Harris Associates in Chicago for more than 30 years.Making market timing bets have been a \u201ckiss of death\u201d for investors over the years as stocks continue to rise over the long term, he said.And that holds true for today, he believes.\u201cWe have better economic growth looking forward the next five years than we do looking backward,\u201d Mr. Nygren said. \u201cAnd alternative asset classes offer returns that are exceedingly low.\u201dAdvertisement"}

For years she seemed to be living out an up-tempo number that she often performed, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Where You Start.\u201dIn her 20s, she established herself on Broadway. She starred in \u201cThe Music Man\u201d and in \u201cCandide,\u201d by, as she referred to him in a memoir published last year, LEONARD BERNSTEIN, in capital letters. \u201cHe was already LEONARD BERNSTEIN, so I was, as usual, nervous as hell,\u201d she wrote.But she wrote that by the late 1960s, she was all but unemployable because she was \u201ca drunk \u2014 not a nice, ladylike drinker, but a drunk.\u201d A few pages later, she added, \u201cMy life was a complete mess.\u201dThen, in her late 40s, she contradicted F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s line about no second acts by reinventing herself as a solo performer. Carnegie Hall served as a bookend. A 1975 concert there opened the way. Her last public appearance was there, too, as a surprise guest at Kelli O\u2019Hara\u2019s solo concert last fall.The symbolism was not lost on Ms. O\u2019Hara. \u201cLet me be personal,\u201d she said last week, \u201cas a woman who is where I am, agewise, which is you\u2019ve finished that beautiful climb to establish yourself and now it\u2019s where am I headed? You remember that she made a second half in life. That\u2019s pretty powerful for someone like me.\u201dMs. Cook\u2019s career seems all the more remarkable, considering that she does not read music. Ms. O\u2019Hara, who does, said that might have been a secret of Ms. Cook\u2019s success.\u201cIf you have the page in front of you, you get caught up in it \u2014 \u2018That\u2019s an eighth note,\u2019\u201d Ms. O\u2019Hara said. \u201cYou might ask, \u2018Why is Barbara Cook such a good interpreter?\u2019 Maybe it\u2019s that she never cemented what was written. She made it her own.\u201dBut if Ms. Cook was Broadway royalty, she wowed the classical set, too. The lyric soprano Amy Burton discovered her through the recording of \u201cCandide\u201d and, years later, marveled at the continuing freshness of her voice.\u201cShe has a quality about her that reminds you of Ella Fitzgerald,\u201d Ms. Burton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a clarity, and the text is impeccable.\u201dAll that flashed through Ms. Burton\u2019s mind as one of those New York moments played out. One night nearly 20 years ago, as intermission at the Metropolitan Opera was winding down and the audience was returning to its seats for the next act of Handel\u2019s \u201cGiulio Cesare,\u201d there she was, going down the same aisle: BARBARA COOK.Ms. Burton could not resist saying hello. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m such a huge fan, and you are the greatest Cunegonde that ever was,\u2019\u201d Ms. Burton recalled last week. \u201cShe said, \u2018Shhhh, don\u2019t say that around here.\u2019 She was being funny. If this were on Facebook, I would now put in a winkie emoji.\u201dBarbara Cook fans have their Barbara Cook moments \u2014 when they realized that she was the soundtrack for the best first date ever, when they realized that Liza Minnelli really was 30 feet away at another table at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, when they understood that there was more to Barbara Cook than sunny numbers like \u201cAc-cent-tchu-ate the Positive.\u201d There were the songs by Stephen Sondheim \u2014 complicated, technically demanding, transcendent.\u201cHer own life experience allows the necessary gravitas needed for a canon of work that runs incredibly deep and wide,\u201d observed the pianist Lee Musiker, her music director since 2007.Mr. LeGrant was taken to a performance. \u201cIt was the first time I was allowed to see my mother onstage,\u201d he said, \u201cand my mother made it very clear me that when she walked onstage, I was not to shout, \u2018That\u2019s my mommy.\u2019\u201d\u201cHere we are in the darkened theater\u201d \u2014 the Eugene O\u2019Neill, on West 49th Street \u2014 \u201cand I had a memory of my mother\u2019s admonition,\u201d Mr. LeGrant recalled, \u201cso as soon as Jack Cassidy came on, I stood up and said, \u2018That\u2019s my friend Jack Cassidy.\u2019\u201dIf Mr. LeGrant remembers his mother\u2019s admonition, he does not remember her reaction. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cthat she just shook her head.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We martial-law babies are living an eerie moment today: With Rodrigo Duterte now president, it\u2019s like history is making a bad pun.When norms shift, one of the first things to change is language. In a fascist world, shocking neologisms become everyday speech. \u201cStockade\u201d was a special verb I learned as a little girl. \u201cNa-stockade hiya,\u201d or \u201che was put in the stockade,\u201d was the explanation for someone jailed for staying out after curfew during martial law.

The most mysterious phrase for me as a child was \u201chabeas corpus\u201d; it wasn\u2019t a recent invention, but it was newly common. I would hear it often on public service announcements on TV, not understanding it even after my friend\u2019s sister, a university student in Manila, disappeared. Leticia was an activist, and the Philippine Constabulary, first set up in 1901, during the U.S. colonial period, took her.The Duterte administration calls its antidrug campaign Project Tokhang. \u201cTokhang\u201d is a linguistic invention and an existential dread. It combines \u201ctoktok\u201d (to knock) and \u201changyo\u201d (to plead), two words from Cebuano, Duterte\u2019s mother tongue and a sister language to my own, Waray. In Project Tokhang, the police knock on your door and plead for you to come out. If you don\u2019t, you could then be \u201cna-tokhang,\u201d meaning arrested without recourse and killed.On social media, \u201cna-tokhang\u201d has become a sliding signifier with infinite possibilities. Your fingernail broke; it\u2019s \u201cnatokhang.\u201d Your salary is low and you want to avoid having a wallet that\u2019s \u201cnatokhang,\u201d or empty.

A political prisoner during the Marcos years said: \u201cWhen I was detained in Fort Santiago in 1973-74, some of our meals were \u2018sinibak na gulay\u2019 (knifed vegetables), \u2018tinortyur na galunggong\u2019 (tortured scad), \u2018binartolinang bangus\u2019 (caged milkfish).\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether it was the guards or the prisoners who came up with those terms.I dug up my research for a novel I\u2019m writing about the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902. It turns out that the 1900 birthday menu of President Emilio Aguinaldo, whose revolutionaries were holed up in remote Palanan, northeast of Manila, while fighting the Americans, included Stew a la Mauser (chicken caught with confiscated Spanish guns), Roast Beef a la Bayonet and Thunder Gulaman (a custard that, the diarist joked, smelled of gunfire). Then, as now, people reached for wordplay to reclaim a semblance of control over lives that seemed to have none.Perhaps the most pitiful, and most gruesomely amusing, of the dishes at the Navotas diner is \u201cnanlabang ham,\u201d the ham that fought back. In my view, \u201cnanlaban,\u201d to resist, should be seen as a heroic thing. But Mr. Duterte has said that the police have a right to kill any drug suspect, guilty or not, who resists arrest, and reports abound of police officers planting guns on victims, sometimes the same gun.\u201cNapagkamalang hot dog\u201d is a close second for the Saddest Dish Award. It means mistaken hot dog. That made me laugh out loud at first.

{"Headline": "The South Faces a Summer With Fewer Peaches", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byATLANTA \u2014 Peaches are such a part of Georgia\u2019s identity that schools, streets and health care plans are named after them. Even the sticker you get when you vote is in the shape of the fruit. South Carolina, one state over, grows more peaches than Georgia. A giant statue of a peach is its most famous roadside attraction.Production in Georgia might be a quarter of what it was in 2016, when the state produced 43,000 tons of peaches, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. In South Carolina, which is second only to California in peach production, the numbers are as bad or worse. As much as 85 to 90 percent of the state\u2019s peach crop is gone, according to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. The state\u2019s peaches usually bring in about $90 million a year, and their impact on the greater economy is three times that much.\u201cIt\u2019s just really, really bad,\u201d said Juan Carlos Melgar, an assistant professor of pomology at Clemson University in Clemson, S.C. \u201cHistorically bad.\u201dAlthough many growers have crop insurance, it won\u2019t replace lost income. And it won\u2019t help workers who rely on the peach crop. Peaches provide about 1,500 jobs in South Carolina. Many workers are from Mexico and spend as much as nine months pruning the trees, thinning the orchards and harvesting the crop. Many contracts are being canceled or cut short, and workers are heading home or trying to find other agricultural work, Dr. Melgar said.Then came a brutal three-day freeze in March. In South Carolina, many trees had blossoms or had already set fruit; that crop was devastated. In Georgia, the trees were so confused by the weather many just never produced fruit at all.The strange weather combination might save some of the crop. Trees that had worried farmers when they were late to bloom because of the warm winter weren\u2019t hurt by the freeze. As a result, Georgia will have early peaches, but growers warn the supply will stop by early or mid-July, which is when most people here say peaches begin to taste the best.It\u2019s an odd blessing, said Will McGehee, the sales and marketing manager of Pearson Farm, which grows peaches and pecans in Fort Valley, Ga., about 100 miles south of Atlanta, in a part of the state with 1.6 million peach trees.\u201cIf you go by what the old-timers say, we should have had nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re looking forward to pecan season.\u201dSouth Carolina has the opposite problem. The state\u2019s early fruit was wiped out, but growers are hopeful about the late-season crop. There just won\u2019t be that much of it. Roadside stands and local markets will be stocked with peaches, but there will be little to ship elsewhere.In Atlanta, grocery stores might appear to have more peaches than usual in the next month or so because shippers are likely to forgo the cost of shipping most of the state\u2019s peaches north, which is what they do when the crop is more abundant, said Gary W. Black, Georgia\u2019s agriculture commissioner.This year, Northerners might not miss that Southern fruit at all. The 2017 New England peach crop is looking great, growers there said. Of course, after last year, any peaches look good.For Southerners, whose summertime rituals involve eating peaches over the sink, making them into cobblers and ice cream and canning whatever\u2019s left, California might offer the only solution. That state is expected to grow about 625,000 tons of peaches. That\u2019s up almost 8 percent over last year, according to Department of Agriculture estimates.But one would be hard-pressed to find a Southerner who really wants a California peach, even though that state produces half the nation\u2019s crop. California fruit can\u2019t compete with fruit born in Southern soil and made sweet with the heat of Southern nights, they argue.He grew up in the South, the son of a plant breeder. And like many Southerners, he\u2019d rather not eat peaches at all than eat one from California during a Southern summer.\u201cI feel like California peaches are just symbols of peaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just the idea of a peach.

{"Headline": "The Online Marketplace That\u2019s a Portal to the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byThe Money IssueAbout three years ago, like millions of other Instagram users, I became acquainted with an app called Wish. At first, my awareness was purely subliminal. Wish ads appeared in my social-media feeds without explanation or context, peddling a deliriously weird selection of heavily discounted products: a smartwatch for under $20; selfie sticks for around $5; a \u201cself-stirring mug.\u201d By the end of 2015, though, these posts were appearing with striking frequency. That year, Wish\u2019s parent company was reported to be one of the largest advertisers on Facebook and Instagram during the holiday season.Finally, I relented. A friend and I signed up and agreed on an amount each of us would spend on the other. The packages, ordered over the course of New Year\u2019s Eve, would be surprises. Ordering on Wish, I soon found out, is dangerously easy. (When I signed up, the first purchase was free; I chose yellow toe socks.) Shopping involves scrolling through an intoxicating admixture of goods: Commodity necessities appear next to fast fashion and knockoff apparel; extraordinarily cheap but on-trend electronics mingle with what I can only describe as global manufacturing overspill. Among the items I sent to my friend, on our modest budget: a laser pointer; 100-count \u201csuper strong\u201d small magnets; a functioning violin; a spare part for the window mechanism on an Audi A6; a deep-V-neck sweater; and of course, the self-stirring mug. Shipping was often free, or only a dollar. The items were extraordinarily well reviewed, often by thousands of customers. The deals seemed, if not exactly too good to be true, at least economically unfeasible \u2014 which, close enough.My experience as a recipient was more informative. A sampling of my haul, clearly selected under the influence: \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage-style sunglasses with built-in Bluetooth speakers; a pillow cover emblazoned with unrepeatably offensive text; a T-shirt with an obscene graphic print; a pale silkish robe; a bag of loose Sri Lankan coins; a fondant mold shaped like a human fetus; and a 12-hole ceramic ocarina. Packages arrived in waves over the next month, carrying with them a hint at what makes operations like Wish possible: their shipping labels. Most were classified as \u201cePacket,\u201d courtesy of the United States Postal Service and China Post.These shipments were made in accordance with a bilateral trade agreement between the United States and China that originated in 2010, meant to address the rising tide of cross-border e-commerce. Items up to 4.4 pounds \u2014 more than the weight of, for example, a violin and bow \u2014 can be shipped as ePackets, at extremely low rates with tracking numbers and delivery confirmation. Tracking is crucial for foreign sellers that are up against consumer skepticism and comparatively slow shipping times. The deal seems to have worked: ePacket\u2019s usage has ballooned in recent years.This obscure trade deal has become the quiet conduit for an explosion in a new and underexamined American consumer behavior: buying things directly from their countries of manufacture. (Similar agreements also exist with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.) This, obviously, presents a problem for the stores and retailers accustomed to serving as importers themselves. Brick-and-mortar retailers are already experiencing a grim 2017, shedding tens of thousands of jobs a month under pressure from e-commerce. Cross-border purchases compound the issue: Because of ePacket, and the decades-old international postal agreements that serve as its foundation, lightweight product shipments from China are heavily subsidized by the U.S.P.S. \u201cIt\u2019s providing an artificially low rate,\u201d says Jim Campbell, a consultant and lawyer specializing in international postal law. \u201cIt\u2019s redistributing wealth, and the winners are essentially the big exporters.\u201d Accordingly, these agreements have drawn intense criticism from American retailers large and small. In 2015, an Amazon representative testified in front of Congress about what he called a \u201ccompletely unnecessary and illogical\u201d system.It\u2019s tempting \u2014 and not entirely unfair \u2014 to see this surge in American cross-border shopping as nothing more than a strange side effect of international postal policy. But that would be too tidy. Wish certainly illuminates the peculiarities of international shipping, but it casts a much brighter light on the state of globalized manufacturing and commerce. In fact, it offers a somewhat convincing vision of what they might become in the near future.The Walmart shopping experience is largely opaque with respect to the chain\u2019s dependence on imports. A product\u2019s country of origin is relegated to labels or printed on mandatory stickers, subordinate to a curated and thoroughly American shopping experience. Wish wastes no such effort on concealing its international character. Its product selection feels like a churning, infinite cascade; its lack of any sort of organizing principle is part of the reason it\u2019s so hard to stop scrolling. More recently, I ordered a smartwatch for the cost of a combo meal. The seller has shipped more than 13,000 units through Wish, and the watch has been reviewed more than 2,000 times. A single day produced ratings written in English, Spanish, Danish, Cebuano, German, French and Romanian.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Denied a Wild Card at Roland Garros, a French Player Makes His Point", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 The main draw of the French Open does not begin until Sunday, but raw emotions were already on display Friday when Paul-Henri Mathieu, a 35-year-old Frenchman playing his final year on tour, won his final qualifying match against Denis Kudla.With more than 1,000 fans packed into tiny Court 6 and long lines of others waiting under a blazing sun in the hope of squeezing inside, Mathieu dispatched Kudla in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, before making it clear what it all meant to him.He chucked his racket onto his courtside chair, turned to his delighted supporters with arms raised, then pounded his chest three times with his right fist. There was no mistaking the message.Yes, he had beaten Kudla, but his larger victory was against Bernard Giudicelli and the French Tennis Federation, of which Giudicelli is president. The federation had denied Mathieu a wild-card entry, but Mathieu barged through anyway, winning the necessary three matches in the qualifying tournament.\u201cIt was the best answer I could give after not getting the wild card,\u201d he said.Mathieu, who reached No. 12 in 2008, was ranked 119th entering qualifying. After he failed to get a wild card, he posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that he accepted the decision but disagreed with it and found the explanations confusing.Giudicelli was quoted as saying the federation had withheld the wild card from Mathieu because he had not played Davis Cup matches for France since 2008. Mathieu scoffed at that rationale.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI was number 12 in the world. I don\u2019t understand, and I will never understand. No matter what is explained to me, it is not the right choice.\u201dFor his efforts, Mathieu will play 10th-seeded David Goffin in the first round. It was suggested that the tournament directors might feature the match on one of the big courts to take advantage of Mathieu\u2019s peaking popularity.\u201cI don\u2019t play for them anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI play for myself and my family who support me all the time.\u201dMathieu\u2019s best result at the French Open was reaching the fourth round, which he accomplished twice. Over the years he has lost here to many in the tennis elite, including the former No. 1 players Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\u201cThis is always a key tournament for me, but I didn\u2019t have great luck in the draw,\u201d Mathieu said. \u201cI always lost against great players.\u201dWhile the decision to force Mathieu to go through qualifying in his final year on tour hurt his pride and his body, it was a boon to fans who regarded the veteran French player\u2019s matches as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.The qualifying tournament begins the week before the main draw, and half the Roland Garros grounds are cordoned off, concentrating players and fans in a smaller area and generating a buzz. Spectators fill the outlying courts, often waiting in lines to get inside, and cheers from hotly contested matches can be heard around the grounds.On Friday, Court 6 was the center of attention. Many of those who could not fit inside watched the match on the main video screen outside Court Suzanne Lenglen.The fans favored Mathieu with loud chants, and Kudla, a 24-year-old American, felt no ill will toward the spectators.\u201cIt was probably the best atmosphere I\u2019ve ever played in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like Davis Cup. I think there were like 10 people cheering for me. The rest were for him, and that was O.K. I totally understand it. Hey, it\u2019s better than no one being there.\u201dAfter he won, Mathieu went to the stands, scooped up his 5-year-old son, Gabriel, and carried him around the court as the fans cheered. Before he left, Mathieu waved at everyone who had sat through the heat to celebrate his special, if grudge-filled, occasion.\u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d Mathieu said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had to play the qualies here before. It was very difficult to go through it, but I was very happy to go through. It was not only a big week of tennis for me, it was a big week of emotions.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was prevented by the police from speaking with reporters.In addition to the charge of climbing Everest without a permit, Mr. Davy was accused of a public offense after a verbal altercation with the police.All foreign climbers are required to obtain an $11,000 permit that allows a mountaineer to climb Everest. Those caught climbing without a permit face a fine of twice the fee they were trying to evade. Fees are less for other mountains.Mr. Davy, a filmmaker, now faces a $22,000 fine and possibly more, if he is found to have climbed any other mountains in his time in Nepal. He could also be barred from the country for five years or from mountaineering in Nepal for up to 10 years, while facing jail time if he fails to pay the fine, the Nepali authorities said.The arrest is the latest evidence of the great lengths some mountaineers go to reach the peak of Mount Everest. Several hundred climbers obtain the permits every year.Mr. Davy arrived in Nepal on March 17, and received a $55 permit to climb to the Everest Base Camp. He took a bus to Jiri, east of Kathmandu, and hiked about 50 or so miles to Everest Base Camp, a process that takes days.But he did not stop there. Though he had no permit, he climbed up through the Khumbu Icefall, a dangerous pass toward Everest from the base camp.\u201cI had reached 23,000 feet after a six-hour, fascinating, thrilling, magical, fantastical and awe-struck experience up the Ice falls, it\u2019s everything I imagined,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI could have stayed in there all day.\u201dHe evidently returned to camp, because on May 5 he caught the attention of Gyanendra Shrestha, an official with the Department of Tourism.\u201cHe was walking down to the Everest Base Camp, and I was suspicious of him as he was walking with all his mountaineering dress even below all the tents,\u201d he said.Mr. Shrestha wondered why he was not camping with the other climbers and stopped him. Mr. Davy admitted climbing without a permit and tourism officials then confiscated his passport and ordered him to report to the tourism department in Kathmandu.Mr. Davy began his arduous journey back to the capital. On May 8, he wrote a Facebook post apologizing for what he had done, saying when he arrived at base camp, it became clear he lacked the funds for a permit.\u201cI was ashamed that I couldn\u2019t afford the permit after all the help, preparation and what everybody had done for me during my training, it would have been a total embarrassment to turn around and accept defeat because of a piece of paper,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I took a chance and spent the little money I had on more gear to climb and practice on the surrounding peaks for acclimatizing in preparing for a stealth entry onto Everest.\u201dHe was arrested after refusing to give a written statement and arguing with the authorities, said a police inspector, Tulasa Khatiwada.\u201cHe has given us a three-page written statement and we are investigating it,\u201d said Dinesh Bhattarai, the head of the tourism department. \u201cHe will be punished according to the law.\u201dNepal set the price of climbing permits quite high both to dissuade mountaineers from swarming the garbage-strewn site and to provide much-needed revenue.Rajneesh Bhandari reported from Kathmandu, Nepal, and Nida Najar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Return of the S.R.O., With a Twist", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosWhen Benny Ventura, a 25-year-old visual designer from Austin, Tex., moved to New York last September, he knew he would not be making enough to live alone, but he did not know anyone he could split an apartment with. Like countless other freshly minted New Yorkers, he set about looking for a room.\u201cIt took almost the entire month,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I met 15 people for coffee. It was like speed dating. I\u2019d done shares before in Austin, but I knew all my roommates. I didn\u2019t have to scout for them.\u201dWhile brokers have been urging budget-constrained renters to get roommates for decades, only recently have they started to take a more proactive role in the process, actively offering matching services or posting Craigslist ads for rooms in larger apartments. The practice is just one of many ways that New York City\u2019s rental market is moving toward a rent-by-the-room model \u2014 a response to the imbalance between New York\u2019s large single population and the prohibitively high cost of living alone, and, perhaps not coincidentally, a model that thrived in the last century.Although only buildings zoned for single room occupancy, or S.R.O.s, can rent by the room, the market has increasingly found ways to legally \u2014 and not so legally \u2014 accommodate those seeking rooms rather than apartments. Alternatives range from relatively low-cost apartment shares, wherein brokers represent apartments with multiple bedrooms and help renters find roommates to bring the cost per person down to as low as $650 a month, to luxurious, all-inclusive shared suites in co-living developments, where rooms are priced at as much as $2,900 a month.\u201cThe bad part is it makes them kind of transient, because how long can you live with three people?\u201d he said. \u201cAbout two years. Then I get a phone call, \u2018Hey, me and this other person want to move out.\u2019\u201dTwo years and two roommates later, \u201cI\u2019d gotten a big fat raise and more responsibility at work and I decided, \u2018I\u2019m going to spend that money on rent,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Irwin, now 27, who moved on her own into a $2,050-a-month one-bedroom on 74th Street and First Avenue.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lesson, though moving in with a roommate feels like a step down, to be honest,\u201d said Ms. Irwin, who is looking for a two-bedroom to share with another teacher from her school. \u201cBut I have friends in their 30s who still live with roommates. In New York, it\u2019s just a way of life.\u201dIn April, the average price for a Manhattan studio was $2,688 a month, according to the Douglas Elliman market report, and while studios can be found for roughly $1,000 less in northern Manhattan and many parts of Brooklyn, that is still too high for many.Mr. Courts, a native New Yorker who started working as a broker after his skateboarding company failed, quickly found he could move large apartments in Brooklyn that were languishing on the market by holding open houses with pizza and beer.\u201cThe way people are living is transitioning,\u201d he said. \u201cHousing was built for two generations ago,\u201d he added, when people married at younger ages and spent less time living on their own.Mr. Court said he would love to see renting facilitated by room and not by apartment, but he thinks landlords, and the law, are a long way from accepting that.In many ways, matchmaking brokers are reinventing a once popular, expansive housing concept in the city. \u201cBoarding and rooming houses stretch back to the founding of the country,\u201d said Alex Armlovich, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a policy research group.Not only was renting by the room common, it also was not isolated to the low end of the market. There were middle-income and even some very high-end residential hotels, both transient and longer term. The Barbizon Hotel for Women, on East 63rd Street, for example, received landmark status largely because of residents who went on to become household names, including Grace Kelly, Liza Minnelli and Joan Didion. At the end of World War II, rooms-for-rent hit a peak with about 200,000 available units.At last official count, the city had some 35,000 S.R.O. units left, but researchers believe there may now be as little as half that. While the number of such units swelled during the Great Depression, several factors led to their disappearance, among them the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, which flooded rooming houses with often-troubled tenants, driving out those with the means to live elsewhere. The shift led to bans on the creation of new S.R.O. units starting in the late 1950s and tax incentives to convert existing ones to traditional apartments. By the late 1980s, the city started to implement policies to preserve existing S.R.O. units, because their loss was strongly correlated to homelessness.\u201cThe problem was management and money and a whole lot of people in poverty put together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t design. That\u2019s what\u2019s such a shame about it.\u201dToday, while brokers help renters at the low end of the market find one another to fill large apartments, co-living purveyors target the higher end, offering shared suites in new or newly renovated buildings with extensive shared amenities. Rooms often come with perks like weekly housekeeping, West Elm furnishings, roof decks and social coordinators to help residents acclimate to their neighborhoods.Renters pay a premium for such attentions; most rooms exceed $1,500. At Common\u2019s Boerum Hill location, which opened this February, one room in a shared two-bedroom suite is going for $2,900 a month.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to reinvent how people live,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is already the way people are living. We\u2019re trying to create a more convenient, comfortable version of it.\u201dSuch models can resemble a friendlier, hipper version of extended stay or executive housing aimed at those with some financial resources, but little local knowledge, or furniture.Marine Berardan, 25, had just arrived from France and was shuttling between Airbnbs when she found her room on a Facebook room-sharing page, posted by Elesia McCray, who is now her roommate. \u201cI had just agreed to signing a lease somewhere that was not the best, but was the least worst I could find,\u201d Ms. Berardan said. \u201cBut then I saw this and it felt like home right away. I was like, \u2018Give me the papers!\u2019\u201dMs. McCray, 22, who had been living in a furnished one-bedroom in Murray Hill since starting a job at BankMobile in January, found the apartment by Googling \u201cfully-furnished apartments.\u201dMs. Berardan and Ms. McCray, who pay $1,300 and $1,400 a month, moved in before finding a third roommate. (Node agreed to cover the rent on the other bedroom for a month.)Ms. Watson said that while she could see the appeal of co-living models for recent arrivals, it was unfortunate that \u201cselling the idea of people all eating around a recycled Brooklyn table rather than just offering well-designed shared housing\u201d had become the driving force of such companies.\u201cThe hope is that these aspirational models filter down through the housing market and show you can do this legally,\u201d she said.\u201cBasically the whole city was calling me,\u201d Mr. Matsui said.The first man who managed to hustle himself and his paperwork to a showing a few hours later declared he would take it within minutes of walking in the door. \u201cHe was like: \u2018I like it!\u2019 What do I have to do?\u2019\u201d Mr. Matsui said. \u201cIt was off to the races.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had basically no vacancy since the units came on line,\u201d Matthew Weissman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of competition where our price point is. We get a lot of students, restaurant managers, nurses, waiters \u2014 people who are budget-conscious and need a well-kept, clean place.\u201dMs. Watson, of the citizens council, pointed out that it was clear from a quick Craigslist scan that \u201crooms have become their own market and that completely changes the value of the unit.\u201d Creating legal channels would not only protect tenants in that market, but it could also help create options more reflective of the overall needs of the city.While the existing and emergent rent-by-room markets are overwhelmingly geared toward the young and newly arrived, the demand for such units is far more diverse.Jim Georgiou, 59, moved to New York in 1996, wanting to start a record label that would help showcase jazz artists. He never started the company, but sold records and taught Qigong, making just enough to get by.He was living in a loft on Chambers Street during Sept. 11, with his dog, Teddy. In the months that followed, he developed serious health problems \u2014 despite having never been a smoker, he now breathes with the deep wheeze of someone with a two-pack-a-day habit. He later moved into a $1,600-a-month studio at the Chelsea Hotel.He lived there for a decade, but when he was sick he would fall behind on his rent for months at a time. He was forced out not long after the Chelsea\u2019s manager, Stanley Bard, lost control of the building. Mr. Georgiou and Teddy ended up living on the street, sleeping on a ledge in the flower district and selling records on the corner of Seventh Avenue and 23rd Street.He had been homeless for two years when someone from the neighborhood told him that a room where he lived, an S.R.O. on 20th Street, was opening up. \u201cIt was a miracle I got in,\u201d said Mr. Georgiou, who pays less than $700 a month for a room with a shared bath in the hall.While to some the distinction between a room in someone else\u2019s apartment and one in an S.R.O. might seem minor \u2014 a matter, perhaps, of 40 or 50 square feet \u2014 Mr. Georgiou argued that it was, in fact, a critical one: the difference between living alone, or living at the mercy of another person\u2019s moods and habits.\u201cAt my age, to go into a house with someone else? And to have to be on eggshells all the time?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo way. Right now I live in my own house.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood-Style Heroism Is Latest Trend in Police Videos", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byThomas J. Wydra, the police chief of Hamden, Conn., has seen plenty of disturbing body-camera recordings depicting officers committing misconduct. Last month, he decided to throw a more uplifting video into the mix.It showed one of his officers in a heart-pounding act of rescue. Called to a nursing home because of a troubled resident, the officer chased the man up several flights of stairs and onto a sixth-floor balcony. Just as the man hoisted a leg over the edge, the officer pulled him back to safety.\u201cIt was like out of Hollywood,\u201d said Chief Wydra, who distributed the video to every news outlet he knew and posted it on Facebook and Twitter.But as more police departments have adopted the cameras, they have also begun to cannily take advantage of a tool that they once distrusted. They are releasing video clips of officers carrying out impromptu acts of heroism.This month in Topeka, Kan., for instance, the local force made public a stunning body-camera recording showing an officer wading into a pond and rescuing a small boy from drowning.In Norton, Ohio, back in January, two officers carried a man out of a burning car moments before it exploded, an event also captured in a body-camera recording.And in January of last year, a video from Albuquerque showed an officer finding a crying child who had been abandoned in a parking lot hours earlier. As he picked her up and soothed her \u2014 \u201cHi, sweetheart, you O.K.?\u201d \u2014 his body-worn camera continued to roll.In promoting videos recorded on the very sort of body-worn cameras that have documented episodes of police misconduct, law enforcement officials say they are trying to use the positive images as a counterbalance. Policies on the release of police videos vary widely across the nation and remain a matter of intense debate. Critics say the practice of releasing selected recordings \u2014 but not all of them \u2014 threatens to create a falsely upbeat narrative about police conduct without full transparency.But law enforcement officials say the positive videos accurately highlight moments that have too often been overlooked: when officers do something brave and unexpected, daring and heartwarming.\u201cDid I think the release of this video would help our image? Absolutely,\u201d Chief Wydra said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for police chiefs to worry about their brand, worry about their image and worry about how they\u2019re viewed by the public.\u201dIn Norton, a suburb of Akron, a local news outlet heard about the episode in which officers pulled a man from a burning car, and they asked the police chief for the video. The chief, John Dalessandro, emailed it to the media and waited for it to go viral.\u201cWe wanted to show the different side of law enforcement,\u201d Chief Dalessandro said. \u201cIt depicts the officers as human, the human side of the badge.\u201dStill, many law enforcement officials resisted. In particular, rank-and-file officers and the unions that represent them argued against the extra layer of scrutiny that the technology seemed to threaten.\u201cThere were some concerns,\u201d said Andrew Gant, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s department in Volusia County, on Florida\u2019s east coast. \u201cWould a deputy be disciplined for something that was caught on camera that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been?\u201dCurrently, more than half of medium to large police departments around the country have adopted or are testing body-worn cameras, according to the Police Executive Research Forum in Washington.Yet policies on when to release videos vary widely by state, depending on open records laws, and advocates of police transparency argue that the practice of releasing \u2014 and promoting \u2014 some videos has hidden complications.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that law enforcement does very important work for the public and very heroic work from time to time,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. \u201cI think it is very valuable for the public to see what the police are doing on their behalf. What you don\u2019t want to have happen is the selective release of videos to create a false narrative about what the police are doing.\u201dIn Kansas, a state where most such videos are protected from release by public record requirements, Kris Kramer, the Topeka police chief, decided in early May to release a recording of one of his officers, Aaron Bulmer, jumping into a pond and rescuing a child with autism who had wandered away from his father.\u201cRecruiting new police officers has become more challenging in light of the numerous high-profile negative stories around the country in the last few years concerning law enforcement,\u201d Chief Kramer said in an email. \u201cA little good news can also help with public confidence and morale as well.\u201dSome police officials said they had sharpened their publicity and marketing skills with the advent of positive body-camera videos. They take long recordings and edit them down into quick, digestible clips that are more likely to be watched and shared. They post the clips on their department Facebook page and Twitter feed.\u201cIt is subverting the original use of the cameras,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with showing positive video. But just as ready as they are to show the positive video, they ought to be ready to release the video that doesn\u2019t make them look good.\u201dMichael J. Chitwood, the sheriff of Volusia County, said he released every video he could, both negative and positive, in the hope of gaining public trust.\u201cI think in today\u2019s climate, when we look at Ferguson and South Carolina, every progressive police leader would be out of their mind to say we don\u2019t need these things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good far outweighs the bad.\u201dIn Topeka, a spokeswoman for the police said the video of Officer Bulmer rescuing the child from the pond was only the second body-camera recording she could remember the department releasing.Officer Bulmer said that after the rescue he had been overwhelmed by attention.\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of officers coming up to me and shaking my hand. I\u2019ve had a lot of officers kind of joke and harass me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say jealousy, but it\u2019s probably one of those things where everybody wishes it was them.\u201dHe recounted the day of the rescue, when he was out on a call to help track down two armed robbery suspects. Driving through a public park, he spotted the boy and chased after him, jumping into the muddy pond and bringing the child safely back to shore.Officer Bulmer later returned to the police station and transferred the video from his body-worn camera as he does at the end of each day. An administrator at the department, fighting back tears, later called and asked if he would object to having his name added to a news release about the episode. Then Officer Bulmer had a conversation with the chief of police, who lamented the run of bad news coverage that Topeka has had lately.\u201cThe chief talked to me about how Topeka was really getting beat up in the news with some shootings, some homicides,\u201d he said. \u201cTopeka really needed a good story.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The Monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor, which I visited a decade ago, is very hard to reach. One hundred and ten miles on the Cairo Luxor desert road, you make a right-hand turn and for the next 17 miles drive on an unpaved road. The single lane forces cars to drive slowly, and, as the only route leading to the monastery, the victims were guaranteed to be Copts. Friday is a day off in Egypt, and church groups regularly take trips there. Outside of a few policemen stationed out front, there is little security presence.The terrorists waited on the road like game hunters. Coming their way were three buses, one with Sunday school children. Only three of them survived. Their victims were asked to recite the Islamic declaration of faith before being shot.Many serious questions will be asked in the next few days. How has the Islamic State been able to build such an extensive network inside mainland Egypt? Is the Islamic State moving its operations to Egypt as it faces pressure in Iraq and Syria? And why has Egypt repeatedly failed to prevent these attacks?All of these questions are important and require thoughtful deliberation by the Egyptian regime and its allies around the world. But these are not the questions on the minds of my Coptic friends at home. They have far more intimate concerns: Am I putting my children\u2019s lives at risk by remaining here? Should we leave? And what country will take us?At the time I thought the prospect was overblown. There are millions of Copts in Egypt. Where would all of them possibly go? Surely some will remain, I reasoned. But I had left the country myself in 2009 \u2014 and so have hundreds of thousands of Copts. Even before the recent wave of attacks, Copts have been packing their bags and bidding 2,000 years of history farewell.

{"Headline": "The Rise of the $38 Pizza, Exclusive and Elusive", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byNew York is well known for its obsession with cheap pizza: the $1 slice, the sporadic price wars, the hand-wringing over each new increase in the average cost.The pie, called the DoughDici, is a two-inch-tall, puffy-crust pizza with a crisp edge and a blanket of red sauce, fresh mozzarella and grated cheeses. Pizza obsessives may liken it to a souffl\u00e9 for its dough, which traps air to form an elevated structure.Thomas DeGrezia, who opened the shop last July with Matthew Porter, said he cold-fermented the dough for about three days before letting it rise in an oil-lined pan with grated cheese for 12 hours. (The name is a play on \u201cdodici,\u201d Italian for \u201c12.\u201d) It is cooked for 10 minutes without stretching the dough, resulting in a collapsed, airy crumb. The result is a six-slice pizza that Sofia will sell only by the pie.If all that seems a lot of bother for pizza, the partners say it reflects the time, labor and cost of making the pies.The first round of four tickets, for two nights this week, sold out on the day they were announced. The partners plan to offer additional dates for the remainder of May, and to serve the DoughDici a few days weekly through the end of summer.\u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a pizza event, but once we realized that we wanted it to be an in-house-only pie to best ensure quality, we decided it needed to be a bit more experiential,\u201d Mr. DeGrezia said. \u201cSince our shop is so small, we added the stools, reservations and drinks.\u201d (The price includes two nonalcoholic drinks.)On Monday, four friends with 40 years of New York City pizza-eating experience were the first DoughDici customers. Rachel Meakins, 30, a model and a doula, bought the ticket after seeing the pizza on Instagram. She knew that her friends Vinay Tolia, 38, and Ross Goodhart, 37, both pizza fanatics, had to try it.\u201cShe knows that we have a problem with pizza,\u201d said Mr. Tolia, a hedge fund manager for Bengal Capital Trading. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dough, and the sauce is not as tangy and present as on some other pizzas that I\u2019ve had. But this is really about the crust, and that\u2019s really original.\u201dOf the price, Mr. Tolia said: \u201cI\u2019m not the right person to ask. I\u2019m a sucker for these kinds of things.\u201d (And the price will rise. \u201cThis is an introductory price for the month of May,\u201d Mr. DeGrezia said. \u201cIt\u2019s just way too much work for the price. It\u2019s not going to skyrocket, but it is going to be a bit more.\u201d)Adam Kuban, who runs Margot\u2019s Pizza and sampled an early trial of the DoughDici, said he hadn\u2019t seen anything like it. \u201cIt\u2019s a tightrope walk, letting that dough rise so high for so long,\u201d Mr. Kuban said. \u201cSomehow they manage to cross to the other side and come out with a pretty special pizza.\u201dWhatever customers think of the DoughDici, Mr. DeGrezia says, they can still count on Sofia\u2019s traditional pizzas, which range in price from $21 to $35.\u201cOur everyday pies are still our favorites,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a fun, once-in-a-while treat, but it is not an everyday pie.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Democrats See a Launching Pad in Trump", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Democratic leaders in California are in near-constant combat with President Trump these days, pushing back on his policies on immigration, health care and the environment. They are girding for massive cuts in financial assistance, dirtier air and the potential of drilling along the Pacific Coast.Yet by one rudimentary measurement \u2014 climbing up the political ladder \u2014 Mr. Trump may not entirely a bad thing for Democrats here. At a time when this state\u2019s political leadership is in the midst of a generational transition, top Democrats \u2014 while clearly in fundamental disagreement with much of what the new president is doing \u2014 see in him as a way to draw attention and position themselves in crowded fields to run for governor, lieutenant governor and, potentially, United States senator.Hence, the frequent assaults on Mr. Trump from a chorus of Democrats running for higher office, or thinking about it: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom; the attorney general, Xavier Becerra; the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti; and his predecessor, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, to name a few.Basking in the Trump spotlight this week is Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the state Senate. Mr. de Le\u00f3n took the lead in announcing ambitious legislation that would accelerate California\u2019s drive to reduce carbon emissions, requiring the state to get 100 percent of its retail electricity from renewable resources by 2045.\u201cHe is clearly eying a next step,\u201d said Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs.Mr. de Le\u00f3n, in an interview, was quick to point out that he has, since Election Day, been one of the leading critics of the new president. \u201cI\u2019ve always been strong on these issues regarding Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I took advantage and became opportunistic and jumped in front of the parade in a New York minute to lead the resistance. Look at my record.\u201dThat said, because of term limits, Mr. de Le\u00f3n has to step down next year. Asked what the next step in his own political career is, he responded obliquely.\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I know,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The tallest tower in San Francisco will also be a beacon of public art.The installation is the vision of Jim Campbell, an artist and M.I.T.-trained engineer known for his work with LED lights.The presentation before city planners on Thursday was a courtesy.

Worse, by creating the appearance of change, they may actually entrench those problems. Rather than say what he wants to see changed about a system he has pilloried, Mr. Trump has simply told executive agencies to recommend reforms in the H-1B program.Infosys is, in effect, getting out in front of presidential criticism of outsourcing in a way that makes Mr. Trump\u2019s plan appear effective \u2014 even though no real reforms have been broached. The situation is akin to what happened last year at Carrier, when the company blunted criticism from Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, by keeping 800 jobs in the United States rather than offshoring them to Mexico as planned. The workers were happy and Mr. Trump declared victory. But the populist appeal of the deal has far outweighed its practical effect, not just because that deal involved only one plant, but because the Trump administration has shown no interest in or aptitude for addressing the underlying trends in technology, anti-unionism and public policy that undermine blue-collar jobs.Similarly, the Infosys pledge to hire 10,000 American workers pales in comparison to roughly 85,000 H-1B visas that are granted each year \u2014 and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that could go to Americans over the years if the H-1B system were reformed. Will Mr. Trump follow through? If recent history is any guide, the answer is no.A fair H-1B system would require companies seeking foreign workers to prove that they have actively tried and failed to find American workers with the requisite skills. It would require higher wages for H-1B workers to ensure that they cannot be used as cheaper substitute labor. It would also include an enforcement system of random audits and steep penalties for noncompliance. Most important \u2014 and most unlikely given the demonstrated corporate-friendly bias of the Trump administration \u2014 the rules would apply to American companies like Facebook and Qualcomm that use H-1B visas, as well as to foreign staffing firms.The United States needs comprehensive reform of the H-1B system more than it needs Infosys\u2019 pledge of 10,000 new jobs. It also needs a president who understands that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Restaurant-Worthy French Toast, Without the Wait", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byFrench toast that good demands a recipe. And, fortunately, it\u2019s one that calls for no new ingredients, tools or technology. You don\u2019t even need stale bread.When I set out to make a travel-worthy French toast, my first call was to the ace of the new American breakfast: Jessica Koslow, the chef and owner of Sqirl.At Sqirl, the French toast is cut so thick that it\u2019s cooked like a steak: seared on the stove, then roasted in the oven. (It\u2019s also stuffed with a pocketful of jam.) I wasn\u2019t interested in adding more steps to my process, but, knowing that Ms. Koslow\u2019s judgment on morning flavors is spot on, I asked what home cooks could do to make their French toast more like hers. \u201cCream,\u201d she said immediately. Many cooks think of French toast as an egg dish, but restaurant recipes lean just as heavily on cream and milk, preferably whole.\u201cBut that\u2019s so rich!\u201d I hear you wailing. There\u2019s a lot of confusion about the fat content of milk. Whole milk seems like an indulgence on a par with Double Stuf Oreos these days, but the difference between whole and reduced fat isn\u2019t that great; a cup of 2 percent milk has five grams of fat, while a cup of whole milk has eight, and makes for much better French toast.While whole milk may not be as rich as one might think, cream, it must be admitted, is full of fat, with 10 grams in two tablespoons.But, Ms. Koslow said, \u201cA little cream goes a long way.\u201d She suggests adding a couple of tablespoons to the milk-egg mixture. And, she said, the bread shouldn\u2019t be soaked, only dunked, making it possible to use fresh bread, which is less absorbent. \u201cYou want to just fill the pores of the bread to make it supple and fluffy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to cream-log it.\u201dFrench toast that has been oversoaked stays damp and gooey in the middle even after the outsides are crisp and brown. A dip lasting for a few Mississippis on each side is enough to coat the slices and keep them from falling apart, especially if you\u2019re using fresh bread.Of course, stale is the traditional choice. Like panzanella in Tuscany or chilaquiles in Mexico, French toast is a classic in part because it uses an ingredient that people tend to keep around. But I have found thick slices of fresh bread to work just as well. They soak up slightly less liquid than stale bread, but, if the bread itself is delicious, the result is just as good. (Heresy alert: Maybe even better.)While freshness may not matter as much, the type of bread does. As a child of the food revolution, I was raised exclusively on whole-grain bread, and I\u2019m here to tell you that nothing ruins the custardy pleasure of French toast faster than a stray rye grain or wheat berry between the teeth. Sourdough, with its chewy crust and tang, is almost as bad. French toast is simply not the place for them.Basic white bread is the clear choice, as are brioche or challah, which have extra fat in the dough. If challah is hard to find where you live, go shopping on a Friday; many supermarkets receive shipments that day. I have no problem with packaged, sliced white bread, except that the slices are usually too thin. It\u2019s worth seeking out a whole loaf, so you can make substantial slices. Many bakeries, even the kind that grind their own flour and brag of centuries-old sourdough starter, stock whole Pullman loaves, white bread in an artisanal disguise.Whether French toast should be sweet itself, or unsweetened, is a matter of taste. Many recipes include sugar (alongside Grand Marnier, amaretto and other cloying concoctions) in the egg-milk mixture. I prefer it unsweetened, to let the deliciously basic egg-milk-bread flavors shine through \u2014 the better to enjoy with maple syrup, preserves, sugared fruit and the like. Either way, French toast is not a dessert, so skip the whipped cream and chocolate sauce.The final, irresistible flourish of restaurant French toast is in the lacy brown crust that adorns both sides. You\u2019re looking for the golden brown of caramelized sugar, not the dull brown of overcooked egg whites, which often gives the dish a tough texture and a sulfurous taste. Adding egg yolks to the custard is part of the solution. Dusting the French toast with sugar at the end of the cooking, flipping it often to build a crisp crust, is another. This step is optional, but it does make people mad with lust \u2014 for more French toast.But if a slosher you are, and a slosher you wish to remain, think of these instructions not as a recipe, but as a formula. For every four slices of bread, slosh in about cup of milk (or milk with some cream). Add an egg and an egg yolk. Whisk vigorously. Dunk quickly. Cook slowly.Eat immediately, and be glad you\u2019re not standing out in the rain.cookingAdvertisement"}

Director James Comey, one question has been repeated over and over: With Democrats lacking any real governing power, are there a few good elected men or women in the Republican Party who will stand up to the president\u2019s abuse of power as their predecessors did during Watergate?But we already know the answer: No.The G.O.P. never would have embraced someone like Trump in the first place \u2014 an indecent man with a record of multiple bankruptcies, unpaid bills and alleged sexual harassments who lies as he breathes \u2014 for the answer to ever be yes. Virtually all the good men and women in this party\u2019s leadership have been purged or silenced; those who are left have either been bought off by lobbies or have cynically decided to take a ride on Trump\u2019s Good Ship Lollipop to exploit it for any number of different agendas.And the one thing I admire about Trump and his enablers: They are not afraid of, and indeed they enjoy, exercising raw power against their opponents. They are not afraid to win by a sliver and govern as if they won by a landslide.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had the power to block President Barack Obama from naming a Supreme Court justice and he did not hesitate to use it, the Constitution be damned.Trump had the power to appoint climate deniers to key environmental posts and he did it \u2014 science be damned. And Trump had the power to fire Comey, even though it meant firing the man investigating him for possible collusion with Russia, and Trump did just that \u2014 appearances be damned.Democrats and independents should not be deluded or distracted by marches on Washington, clever tweets or \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skits lampooning Trump. They need power. If you are appalled by what Trump is doing \u2014 backed by House and Senate Republicans \u2014 then you need to get out of Facebook and into somebody\u2019s face, by running for Congress as a Democrat or an independent, registering someone to vote for a Democrat or an independent, or raising money to support such candidates.Nothing else matters.Personally, I\u2019m not exactly a rabid Democrat. I\u2019m more conservative on issues of free trade, business, entrepreneurship and use of force than many Democratic candidates. I think the country would benefit from having a smart conservative party offering market and merit-based solutions for our biggest challenges \u2014 from climate to energy to education to taxes to infrastructure \u2014 that was also ready to meet Democrats halfway. But there is no such G.O.P. today. The party has lost its moral compass.That\u2019s why for me, in 2018, the most left-wing Democratic candidate for House or Senate is preferable to the most moderate Republican, because none of the latter will confront Trump. And Trump\u2019s presidency is not just a threat to my political preferences, it is a threat to the rule of law, freedom of the press, ethics in government, the integrity of our institutions, the values our kids need to learn from their president and America\u2019s longstanding role as the respected leader of the free world.That\u2019s why there are just two choices now: chicken or fish \u2014 a Democratic-controlled House or Senate that can at least deter Trump for his last two years, or four years of an out-of-control president. This G.O.P. is not going to impeach him; forget that fantasy. Either Democrats get a lever of power, or we\u2019re stuck emailing each other \u201cS.N.L.\u201d skits.It\u2019s chicken or fish, baby.

For many here, this is very much a family matter. It is about family members who went to war and family members who were sold in the slave market downtown, and family in whom the bloodlines overlapped in ways that have seldom been acknowledged. The public history in the news has made the personal history all the more immediate.Some prominent family lineages are on full display, recounted at debutante and Mardi Gras balls. But DNA tests and online research sites have opened up family histories that were passed down simply as family lore, or family secrets, or in some cases not known at all. In a city on the verge of celebrating its tricentennial, this was not that long ago.His name was Madison. He was only 11 years old when he was stolen from his mother and his father and brought here to New Orleans by Francis E. Rives, who went on to become a U.S. congressman from the state of Virginia. On his bill of sale, it says that he is a griffe, a person of African and Native American descent.Last year, I honored him with my suit. I honor him because, despite all of the atrocities perpetuated against this child, he lived to be an elder. Because of that, I am here.When the crane lifted Lee off his pedestal, I exhaled. I thought: \u201cIt\u2019s about time. It\u2019s about time.\u201d You know, he was standing there with his arms folded as if he was surveying all that was his. But that statue was such a lie. Eight thousand pounds of a lie.I came to the Lee statue straight from the iPhone store, where I got my new phone so that I could tape the statue coming down. Because it was important for me to have pictures that were mine. Though it was a collective moment for all of New Orleans, I felt like it was also my moment.He was a very complex person. As I go around the country having the opportunity to educate Americans about this most misunderstood historical figure, what I hear is: Why don\u2019t we know this about him? My answer is, you know, he lost. He\u2019s to blame. He\u2019s the one that was shouldered with this.I think the statue itself is indicative of the problem of America, in that we\u2019re reducing history to one sentence and then we add connotations onto it: Jefferson Davis created slavery. Oh really? Or, Jefferson Davis created the Confederacy. The problem we have in America is we don\u2019t have a lens to understand history through. We have to look at a lens from that period of time, and we also have to have to look at the lens that the person had at that period of time.You can\u2019t change history. If we eliminate history we\u2019re bound to repeat it. You just can\u2019t eliminate it, you have to understand it and teach it.On the protests for and against removal:I don\u2019t take either one of those as personal. What I reflect on is that everyone needs to have a complete understanding of the facts related to the individual, and let them make up their mind. I don\u2019t believe either side probably had that.I was there the week before. I walked down the street and stood there for a while. They had barricaded it and I knew they were going to do it, but there weren\u2019t people around it at the time. People just came and went.Once the decision was made, it was not my position to do any protesting. It was: How do we get them to understand the man? If we do that, perhaps someday, somebody will come back and say we made a mistake here.I\u2019m a musician so we travel all the time. For some reason I always stopped at this gas station because I thought it was pretty, with a bayou right there. My great-great-grandfather is buried a half-mile from that gas station. I\u2019d been stopping here for years and this is where my family\u2019s from, they were brought from Maryland to this spot. They got there in 1839 till the end of slavery, and then they were still working there after slavery.First thing I did was look out there and visualize it full of cotton, and my family out there singing and picking cotton and working the fields. Working every day, being forced to do that. In the heat; it was June when we were out there. It was hot. What about in August, when they were still out there? Even though I know I can\u2019t comprehend how horrible it must have been, just thinking about it kind of made me sick.It changes everything. It\u2019s definitely more personal. I have names, my family, it\u2019s in my blood. It\u2019s not just a story, its part of my life. I live right here, I don\u2019t want to go by and see Jefferson Davis, someone who fought to keep my family as slaves.We got the word that Jefferson Davis was coming down so we all assembled at Jefferson Davis. While we were there, we had lookouts placed at other monuments. We got the word they were forming at the foot of Canal Street. I got there around 3 and they had just begun taking it down.The name of that war, the most accurate name was the War of Northern Aggression, of the Northeastern establishment slave trader robber barons.When you attack a person\u2019s family member it\u2019s very personal. My ancestors are being reviled as evil and bad people, and they are good people. We\u2019re condemned because we fought the federal government, right? What about the Native Americans? They waged war also and they also owned slaves. Are we going to tear down their monuments?This monument is a monument to greatness and nobility and the sublime purpose of the human race, and they vilified it through a massive lying campaign. I can assure you that everybody who has ancestors and knows this story is very upset about it.Because I\u2019m a student of history and I know how things work, I know that when you are going to conquer a people, subjugate a people, it\u2019s very important to remove their cultural foundations because their strength comes from that. The bad guys know that, which means they have to destroy our culture, our history. And when they do that, they destroy your identity, they destroy your soul. They come back and they replace it with the personality and the soul of a slave or a serf.Up until a few years ago, my mother wouldn\u2019t talk about what she had heard about her grandmother\u2019s life on the plantation. My mother was born in 1904 and so you couldn\u2019t just talk about white people in those days.I passed those New Orleans monuments all the time for most of my adult life. It never dawned on me that those statues were really honoring those people. But that point was made clear to me by the people who fought to keep the monuments there.We know it\u2019s a part of history. It happened. That\u2019s the way things were in those days. But why do you want to hold on to something so evil?To me, it\u2019s like a never-ending story. My people are religious. They\u2019re Baptists. When I was a little girl, the white Baptist church hired my father, who was a brick mason, to build a pretty brick building for them. But our church was wooden and it was raggedy. So I remember asking him: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just shut down our church and go to church with them? Because God loves everybody, right?\u201dHe told me, \u201cWe can\u2019t do that, baby.

{"Headline": "The Warp-Speed Presidency", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byThe ConversationHere\u2019s my topic: Acceleration. The pace of news, of scandal, of Trump. It\u2019s like a hot dog-eating contest. We\u2019re shoveling in the Trump news with little time to chew it over and even less time to digest it.I know this is a little dated but the other week I noticed someone on Twitter trying to summarize five days\u2019 worth of Trump news. I can\u2019t find the tweet but here is how I remember it. On Monday it was 18 Days of Flynn. On Tuesday we had the Comey Firing. Wednesday brought the full flowering of the Rosenstein Defense. With Thursday came the Holt Admission. Friday featured the Comey Threatening.And then the cycle started again the following Monday, with Trump\u2019s Oval Office intelligence disclosures to the Russians.Or is it more like what Dostoyevsky has Raskolnikov say in \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d: \u201cMan grows used to everything, the scoundrel!\u201d?Under anything approaching normalcy, the fact that a president went before a group of young people dedicating their lives to military service and complained that he was the most unfairly persecuted politician in history would have been, um, noticed.But that\u2019s about to end. The appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel means we\u2019ve gone from the \u201cthis is totally nuts\u201d stage of the presidency to the \u201cthis is deadly serious\u201d stage. Mueller is to this White House approximately what Birnam Wood is to Dunsinane in \u201cMacbeth.\u201dDo you see this ending in high drama \u2014 Trump gets impeached or resigns? Hard to imagine the resignation part with this guy. And the idea of struggling to get the nation a President Pence doesn\u2019t fill me with excitement.People who don\u2019t normally pay much attention to presidential diplomacy are nervously watching every stop because \u2014 you know, there\u2019s the Agogment Rate. They\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll do something strange or terrible or ridiculous and cause an international incident.Because of that, every time Trump behaves normally it\u2019s seen as a kind of triumph. Lucky guy.Trump is inescapably himself. That\u2019s his undoing.Lieberman\u2019s terrible campaign for vice president might have cost Al Gore the election, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Lieberman\u2019s self-promoting refusal to wage the good fight over Florida\u2019s votes definitely cost Al Gore the election. Which is how we got George W. Bush and the war in Iraq, which Joe Lieberman wholeheartedly supported.I could go on, but this is supposed to be a conversation, not a rant.But, anyway \u2026.I like Joe because he\u2019s middle-of-the-road, smart, honorable and experienced. He also blurbed my book, so he\u2019s golden forever as far as I\u2019m concerned.If he gets the job, he won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s idea of a Trump lackey. And would you have preferred such experienced former prosecutors as \u2026 Chris Christie? Rudy Giuliani?I think liberals feel about Joe Lieberman approximately the way we conservatives feel about John Roberts. But maybe politics shouldn\u2019t be about getting everything you want or getting nothing at all.And speaking of the plus side, one advantage to the whole Trump fiasco is that it\u2019s going to make it impossible to get a tax bill through Congress. Republicans always talk about tax reform, but what they really mean is cutting taxes for people who can easily afford to fork over what they\u2019re being billed now.That said, you\u2019re right: Love it or hate it, Trump\u2019s epic incompetence makes it unlikely that any significant pro-growth reforms will move through Congress. That\u2019s just another reason for thoughtful conservatives to despise him.And I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve found a subject we can disagree about. There will be others. Did I mention that my next column is going to be called \u201cDavid Irving Is Right About Global Warming\u201d?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thailand Warns Facebook After Video Seems to Show King in Crop Top", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byThe standoff is the latest sign of a clampdown on online speech by a military junta that seized power in a 2014 coup, and the latest test for Facebook, which has struggled to balance local laws and cultural expectations with its core identity as a network where people are free to share ideas and news.\u201cThe government\u2019s moves to restrict Facebook indicate that it is solidifying ideologically around the monarchy, making it the cornerstone of its overall efforts to stem political freedom,\u201d said David Streckfuss, author of \u201cTruth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and L\u00e8se-Majest\u00e9.\u201d\u201cIts main tactic will be to refashion this law, already much abused, into an offensive weapon designed to eliminate all forms of political opposition,\u201d he said.Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of Thailand\u2019s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, told reporters on Tuesday that 131 Facebook pages that were deemed to violate computer crimes or l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws had not yet been removed.He said that the government had obtained a court order to block 34 of the pages and was still working on the others, and that Facebook had agreed to cooperate. He did not say which pages or what was on them.\u201cWe must thank Facebook for cooperating with us and complying with Thai law,\u201d he said.Mr. Somsak\u2019s post has been blocked in Thailand, and neither the government nor Facebook has publicly said whether it was one of the 131 in question.Also this month, the domestic news media quoted the Thai Internet Service Provider Association as saying that it would be forced to shut down Facebook by Tuesday morning if the company had not removed all 131 pages. That shutdown did not occur, and the standoff was not receiving much attention on social media in the country on Tuesday.The l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law carries a maximum jail term of 15 years.The video has been blocked in Thailand but was still available outside the country on Tuesday.Facebook, which opened an office in Thailand in 2015, declined to answer questions about its operations in the country or the pages that the government wants to remove. A spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, said only that the company\u2019s policy was to comply with requests by governments to restrict access to content that officials believed violated local laws.\u201cWhen we receive such a request, we review it to determine if it puts us on notice of unlawful content,\u201d Ms. Wareing said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf we determine that it does, then we make it unavailable in the relevant country or territory and notify people who try to access it why it is restricted.\u201dFacebook has faced political blowback in the region for posts on its social network.In Thailand, Facebook has done its best to show respect to sensitivities around the monarchy. After King Bhumibol\u2019s death, the network completely suspended advertisements in Thailand on its site for a week.Yet the government\u2019s new demands have presented a distinctly new challenge for the company: While it can say it is following local laws in taking down videos of the king, its actions may embolden other world leaders to expect the same treatment.Facebook\u2019s website says that, after requests from the Thai Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, it restricted 40 pieces of content from last July to December that reportedly violated l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws, up from 10 in the previous six months.\u201cDespite good cooperation between the regulator and the ministry to prevent illicit content on websites over the last two years, the government hopes for more, and expects better\u201d results by May, he said.Last week, the commission said it had identified about 6,900 web addresses that required blocking, including about 600 total from Google, Facebook and YouTube. Google and YouTube had removed the addresses of their own accord, the commission said, and Facebook removed 178 of the 309 Facebook pages that the government had cited, also of its own accord. But 131 other Facebook pages were encrypted, it said, so it would seek the company\u2019s help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Networks Offer Taste of TV\u2019s Ad Future. Marketers Are Hungry for More.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAmerica\u2019s biggest television networks invited advertisers to New York institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center last week, giving them an early glimpse at their fall lineups and treating them to lavish parties and a parade of stars including Stephen Colbert, Kim Kardashian and Tony Romo, all with the aim of attracting billions of dollars in advertising by the end of the summer.The tradition dates to the 1960s, when viewing habits were entirely different. And while the networks have spent the past few years trying to convince marketers of their digital prowess despite falling ratings and new platforms for watching TV, Silicon Valley seemed to cast an especially long shadow this year.\u201cMost networks are starting to recognize that the standard model of 18 minutes of 30-second spots in a 60-minute show will never grow and is probably not sustainable,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD. \u201cJust making more compelling shows is not going to solve that problem.\u201cThat goose continues to lay golden eggs; they\u2019re just smaller every year,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThis is the same challenge the record companies had: How fast do you shift to a new model at the risk of your existing, lucrative one?\u201dTurner Broadcasting, which owns channels like CNN, TBS and TNT, especially impressed advertisers with its presentation. The company emphasized its willingness to experiment with new, longer formats for traditional commercials and said it would continue to reduce the number of ads it runs during shows. It is risky to cut back on ad inventory, especially as ratings decline, but the company contends that doing so creates a better viewer experience and more effective, engaging commercials.Turner also highlighted its new data and audience-targeting collaboration with its rivals Viacom and Fox Networks Group and the number of video-on-demand rentals its properties commanded in the first quarter.\u201cI was really kind of blown away by Turner,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, an executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who oversees paid media investments. He said the company\u2019s presentation, as well as some of the new advertising ideas discussed by Fox Networks Group and CBS, addressed the major concern that he and other marketers shared: How do you compete for consumers\u2019 attention, especially as they move to block ads and turn to platforms like Netflix, where running commercials is not an option?\u201cIf the consumer\u2019s in control, you have to figure out how to adapt your consumer experience to the device they\u2019re going to consume your content on,\u201d he said.The Fox group also discussed a new system for measuring the effectiveness of ads on its online properties to help marketers determine which versions to use just hours later on traditional TV.That fits into a broader narrative in the TV industry, in which executives have long complained that as Americans increasingly watch shows on an array of devices, and do so outside the three- or seven-day windows that are now measured, networks are not getting full credit for their total audience figures.Joe Marchese, Fox Networks Group\u2019s new ad sales chief, dismissed Facebook\u2019s claim that it could offer advertisers a \u201cSuper Bowl on mobile every day,\u201d saying that the number of video ad minutes available in Fox\u2019s prime-time broadcasts \u201cdwarf\u201d those on YouTube and Facebook.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales chief, expressed skepticism that people \u201cliking\u201d an ad or product on Facebook actually led to sales. And Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, cited Amazon, Apple and Google as companies that, like the network, were \u201call about mass audience\u201d while noting that all three also paid to advertise with CBS.Still, the new ideas about advertising did not dominate the presentations, in part because the concepts are still evolving but mostly because the traditional way of selling TV ads remains the biggest moneymaker for the networks.\u201cThe statement used to be \u2018digital pennies for TV dollars,\u2019\u201d said Mike Law, executive vice president for video investments at Amplifi, Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s investment arm. \u201cNow it may be digital nickels for TV dollars, but the vast amount of revenue these networks are generating is coming from TV. In a marketplace we think will be down a little bit in spend volume, networks getting their fair share of revenue is critical to them.\u201dThat may have to change, particularly now that networks have given marketers a taste of new possibilities. Mr. Paskalis of Bank of America, for one, was left wanting more.\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see the most, frankly, is even more focus on user experience and opportunities for marketers to join the conversation around the programming than just advertise adjacent to the programming,\u201d Mr. Paskalis said. He offered examples like creating polls in advance for marketers to run related to particular plot developments in scripted shows and allowing brands to sponsor limited commercial interruptions.\u201cHow can marketers do more to add to the experience,\u201d he said, rather \u201cthan just be the tax you have to pay to enjoy the experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}

I came out of surgery with a half-dozen Steri-Strips across my nose, a Jack Nicholson \u201cChinatown\u201d look, and the nurse said she\u2019d had a patient once who actually had slammed into a taxi partition and looked just like me.I tried that for a few days, but I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it. It raised a serious question: Why is it better to present myself as an idiot who doesn\u2019t wear a seatbelt than somebody who got a little work done because I hated my neck? What is this ridiculous bias against cosmetic surgery? Am I going to besmirch the entire taxi industry because I am desperate for a cover story?Anyway, there are scarves.Excuse me, I have an I.M. from a devoted fan:Joyce, you vapid, self-absorbed, car-loving, coyote-indifferent elitist; there are people who are unable to afford lifesaving medical care, and you do this. This really is a problem of the 1 percent.Reply: Given the tab, I\u2019d say it was more like a problem of the upper 1 percent. This procedure cost as much as my car.But to return to the big problem: Why do we feel compelled to hide having cosmetic surgery, sneaking around as if we were unwed mothers in the 1950s, with clandestine conversations about doctors and extended stays out of sight or out of town?O.K., the first few days after surgery one may not be looking one\u2019s best. I, in addition to the Steri-Strips across my nose, had bristly, black sutures under my chin and nose. That\u2019s a look you don\u2019t want for your OkCupid meeting.But had I been in an accident, such as the one I anticipate this summer when a scooter maniac crashes into me, would I feel the need to lie about it or hide?I would not. I would tell you the gripping medical details of my facial reconstruction, and you would look at me and my whiskery black sutures with compassion and respect.The Steri-Strips and nose and chin sutures, by the way, came off after four days. That meant all I had to hide were the yellow-green bruising on my neck and the purple-blue bruising below it. I went to a party for my beloved hangout, the Knickerbocker, with a scarf so high on my face I ate some as a first course. Heaven forbid someone figured out I had just had surgery to look better.This makes no sense. People in this country yap loudly on their cells about the kind of sex they\u2019ve had. They have affairs and put photos up on Facebook, where their husbands or wives can find them. They refuse to stand up and let other people get past their seats at the movies. They work in customer support for Verizon.I just wanted to get rid of my jowls and chicken neck.Believe me, I was suffering terribly.I couldn\u2019t pass the mirror in front of my elevator without doing the face-skin pull \u2014 a nerve-racking move because you never know when the elevator door will open and you have to pretend to be doing something socially acceptable, like squeezing a pimple.I\u2019d pull a V-neck dress out of the closet and realize I could not wear it because nature and genetics had conspired to give me the neck of a 69-year-old, which, coincidentally, is the age on my passport.Had I been alive 140 years ago, I would have had no choice but to live with a saggy neck. Back then, there wasn\u2019t even decent hair color. My hair would have had to remain its natural \u2014 honestly, I can\u2019t remember.

Cancer protects you from criticism, not merely for cosmetic surgery, for everything. Plaid drapes?

The police added that the two women, who were not injured, left the scene and were later identified and contacted by investigators.\u201cIt\u2019s horrific; there are no other words to describe what happened today,\u201d Sgt. Pete Simpson, a spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said at a news conference. The police statement also said part of the investigation would focus on Mr. Christian\u2019s \u201cextremist ideology.\u201dOne of the victims, Ricky John Best, 53, died in the train car, the police said. Another, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, 23, later died at a Portland hospital.A third victim, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, was being treated for serious injuries on Saturday, but the police said his wounds were not considered life-threatening.Mr. Christian has a history of making extremist statements on social media, said Zakir Khan, a member of the Council on American-Islamic Relations who is working to set up a chapter of the organization in Oregon. \u201cFrom reviewing the suspect\u2019s Facebook page, it seems like he was very enthralled with the alt-right and Nazi movements.\u201dMr. Khan added that the two slain men \u201creally sacrificed everything.\u201cThey really stood up for the values of the Constitution,\u201d he said.The post goes on: \u201cChristian also expresses anti-Muslim sentiments on his page. One included a meme, which read, \u2018If we\u2019re removing statues because of the Civil War \u2026 we should be removing mosques because of 9/11.\u2019\u201dIt also says that Mr. Christian has promoted the notion of a whites-only area in the Northwest.\u201cI didn\u2019t think that video would lead to being some sort of evidence of his possible premeditated hate crime,\u201d Mr. Bivins said in an interview.On the video, while Mr. Christian is seen yelling, other demonstrators are pointedly disavowing his comments. And on Saturday, Richard B. Spencer, a white nationalist and well-known self-appointed leader of the fringe alt-right movement, condemned the attack.The attack on Friday occurred around 5 p.m. in a train car on Portland\u2019s light-rail system. The attacker began yelling \u2014 calling Muslims \u201ccriminals\u201d \u2014 shortly after the two women boarded, said Evelin Hernandez, a train passenger.When the men tried to intervene, Mr. Christian pulled out a knife and slashed them, Ms. Hernandez and the police said.The attacker fled the train car but was soon arrested, the police said, adding that a review of Mr. Christian\u2019s record did not show any known history of mental illness.Advertisement"}

Bush administration: According to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee report on the C.I.A.\u2019s detention and interrogation program, Rice was among the first top administration officials to approve the torture of Abu Zubaydah, a terrorist suspect and human being, who was subjected to waterboarding 83 times as well as sleep deprivation, beatings and confinement for hours in a coffin-like box in violation of domestic and international law and fundamental ethical principles.

Students practice memoir, essay, biography, literary journalism and other fact-based forms in which show and tell may be the better rule, and \u201cart\u201d and life (\u201cpolitics, history, theory, philosophy, ideology\u201d) need not conflict. The result is new writing that is as diverse as students\u2019 own experience, as wide-ranging in content as curiosity will allow. \u201cWrite what you know\u201d expands to \u201cwrite what you can find out\u201d through research. Faculty across genres in M.F.A. programs these days seek to foster unique student expression, but nonfiction, with its profusion of forms, may be the genre in which many students can most naturally find and exercise their own voices in workshops less bound by tradition. The writer, who won the 2014 Pulitzer in biography and memoir, teaches nonfiction writing and archival research in the M.F.A. program at Emerson College.\u2666To the Editor: James Ryerson reviewed three new exciting books on the history and role of numbers in society (Ivory Tower, May 7), among them Keith Devlin\u2019s \u201cFinding Fibonacci.\u201d Arguably, Fibonacci\u2019s greatest contribution was helping to introduce Europeans to the Hindu-Arabic numerals. Going from Roman numerals to this system dramatically simplifies and extends arithmetic calculation. Fibonacci, as a boy, learned the new way to represent numbers and to calculate with them in North Africa, (present-day Algeria), where his father was serving as a trade representative.\u2666To the Editor:James Ryerson\u2019s discussion of the Amazonian Pirah\u00e3\u2019s sense of number (Ivory Tower, May 7), in connection with his discussion of Caleb Everett\u2019s \u201cNumbers and the Making of Us,\u201d is reminiscent of the cognitive psychologist and epistemologist Jean Piaget\u2019s observation that children\u2019s earliest mathematics is ultrametric \u2014 not quantified metrically, but rather derived from concepts of enclosure and topology. Mathematicians call this early mathematics p-adic mathematics, in which numbers do not quantify count or measure size in the usual sense, but instead label paths of a hierarchy tree. Some cognitive scientists consider p-adic mathematics the natural mathematics of cognition, evolutionarily developed to conceptualize large quantities of complex information.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Erdogan Security Forces Launch \u2018Brutal Attack\u2019 on Washington Protesters, Officials Say", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byEleven people were injured, including a police officer, and nine were taken to a hospital, the Metropolitan Police chief, Peter Newsham, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Two Secret Service agents were also assaulted in the melee, according to a federal law enforcement official.The State Department condemned the attack as an assault on free speech and warned Turkey that the action would not be tolerated. \u201cWe are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms,\u201d said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman.A group of Republican lawmakers went a step further, calling the episode an \u201caffront to the United States\u201d and calling for Turkey to apologize.Photos and videos posted on social media by witnesses showed a chaotic scene of flying fists, feet and police batons \u2014 all in the middle of rush hour traffic along stately Embassy Row. The video showed two men bleeding from the head and men in dark suits punching and kicking protesters, some lying on the ground.The initial rush devolved into several smaller skirmishes as uniformed police officers, some in helmets and swinging collapsible batons, struggled to restore order. The Anadolu Agency, a state-owned Turkish news service, reported that members of the president\u2019s security team were involved in the attack.The White House has thus far been silent on the episode. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, referred reporters to the State Department and declined to comment further.The Turkish embassy released a statement late Wednesday that contradicted United States officials and video evidence and blamed the demonstrators, who, it said, had been \u201caggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet the president.\u201d The president\u2019s supporters and security forces were reacting in self-defense, the statement said.The altercation, which played out in broad daylight and ricocheted across social media on Tuesday, puts the United States in an uncomfortable position as it must navigate investigating and potentially charging the security personnel and other Erdogan supporters involved in the attack, who could potentially claim diplomatic immunity.Chief Newsham demurred when asked whether members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s security team were involved in the attack, but the State Department later acknowledged their presence. Mr. Erdogan and his security guards have since left the country. It was unclear if embassy staff had also been involved.Chief Newsham said an investigation was continuing, adding that the authorities were reviewing video from the scene and had a good sense of who was involved. He said that some members of the pro-Erdogan group were carrying firearms, which made it more difficult for the police to contain the scene.\u201cWe intend to assure that there is accountability for anyone involved in this assault,\u201d Chief Newsham said. \u201cYesterday we witnessed what appeared to be a brutal attack on peaceful protests.\u201dThe Secret Service, which provides protection for visiting dignitaries, said in a statement it would work with the police and the State Department \u201cto aggressively pursue accountability for those involved in yesterday\u2019s protests.\u201dThe violence came after several hours of peaceful protest staged by a coalition of groups who oppose Mr. Erdogan\u2019s policies on a range of issues, from his government\u2019s stance toward the Kurds and Armenians to his perceived assault on the country\u2019s democratic institutions.The police said two people were arrested Tuesday evening. Ayten Necmi, 49, of Woodside, N.Y., was charged with aggravated assault, and Jalal Kheirabaoi, 42, of Fairfax, Va., was charged with assault on a police officer. Protest organizers said those arrested were part of their group.Several of the protesters said they were caught off-guard when the group rushed through the police and into their ranks, which included some small children. All nine demonstrators who were hospitalized have since been released, but Mr. Hamparian said many left with stitches.Lucy Usoyan of Arlington, Va. was among them. Ethnically Yazidi and raised in Armenia before moving to the United States, she said she had expected a mostly quiet afternoon expressing her displeasure at Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government.Instead, she said, she ended up knocked to the ground and kicked until she was briefly unconscious.\u201cWhen I opened my eyes I saw people all around,\u201d said Ms. Usoyan, 34. \u201cSome were bleeding, and I could not get up.\u201dSayid Reza Yasa, one of the organizers of the demonstration, said he lost at least one tooth and his nose was bloodied as he was knocked to the ground and kicked repeatedly before the police intervened.Mr. Yasa, 60, an American citizen who was born in Turkey and is of Kurdish descent, said he was familiar with the brutality of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s forces, but surprised by their audacity on Tuesday.\u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d Mr. Yasa said. \u201cThis is America. This is not Turkey.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the confrontation. It was on a grassy area in front of the Turkish ambassador\u2019s residence, the former embassy in Washington, not the current embassy several blocks away.Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington and Christopher Mele from New York.

{"Headline": "Crab, Meet Sugar Snap Peas", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteFor all their delicacy and sweetness, peas in the pod are just not the kind of thing you would make a habit of cooking on a weeknight \u2014 not with the shelling that needs to happen before they would yield enough for dinner.Frozen peas are convenient and can be tasty, but you lose the ephemeral satisfaction of cooking something fresh and of the moment.Sugar snap peas split the difference.They have the seasonal appeal of fresh peas in the pod, but are much faster to handle because you can eat the whole thing, succulent green shell and all. Just pull off the stems and they\u2019re ready to go. Raw or cooked, they add their characteristic sweetness anywhere you use them.When I get my hands on good sugar snaps, I usually munch on them straight out of the bag, either all by themselves or paired with something to contrast with their crisp texture and sugar content. Runny and salty cheese, bits of fatty salami or prosciutto, or some soft and briny olives do nicely.Or combine those elements in a salad bowl and toss with a little olive oil, and you have a lively side dish or salad.But this time of year, when the first sugar snap peas are just turning plump enough to pick, I like to let them star (or in this case, co-star) in a main course. In this recipe, I\u2019ve paired them with crab and tossed it all into pasta.The thing about combining peas and crab is that it can be hard to determine which element is sweeter. The peas are earthy, grassy and sweet in a vegetal way, like the spring breeze moving through the baby green leaves in the trees. Crab has a whole other kind of sweetness, a salty, beachy, nearly summer sweetness, like the spray blowing off the sea.Together, these two could make a dish cloying, unless you stop them with a jolt of acid and a smack of heat. Lemon juice and zest and a hit of red chile flakes do the job, aided by a sprinkling of flaky sea salt right at the end.And then there is the mint, whose herbal coolness goes well with both the sweet and savory elements in the bowl.Even better, the whole thing comes together quickly \u2014 a complex, pretty spring dish that satisfies on a weeknight.And to Drink ...Not only does this dish promise to be seasonal and delicious, but it also opens the door to many resonant wines, all ideally white, dry, perhaps a bit herbal and with no obtrusive oak. Let\u2019s start with Chablis, which would be an excellent foil for the crab and peas. So would Sancerre, which, though made from sauvignon blanc rather than the chardonnay in Chablis, can be surprisingly similar in character. A Soave or Etna Bianco, from Italy, would be terrific. Dry rieslings from Germany and Austria are always good with crab. Alsatian Sylvaner, often overlooked, can be a great spring wine. Fino sherry would be lovely, and if you are already drinking nothing but ros\u00e9, pick a dry one. ERIC ASIMOVcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Offers to Provide a \u2018Record\u2019 of Trump\u2019s Disclosures to Russian Envoys", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byMr. Putin, who has a long record of seizing on foreign crises to make Russia\u2019s voice heard, announced during a news conference in Sochi, Russia, the Black Sea resort that has become his equivalent of Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, that he has a \u201crecord\u201d of the American president\u2019s meeting at the White House with two senior Russian officials and was ready to give it to Congress \u2014 so long as Mr. Trump does not object.Referring to reports that Mr. Trump had revealed highly classified intelligence, Mr. Putin said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s offer to release a record of what was said, made after a meeting with the visiting prime minister of Italy, Paolo Gentiloni, suggested less an effort to create clarity over what Mr. Trump actually said in the Oval Office last Wednesday than a headline-grabbing assertion of his own authority and a reminder that he should not be ignored.To that end, the Russian government has been angling for months for a meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, who has met a host of foreign leaders since he took office in January but only spoken with the Russian president by telephone. They are expected to get together during a summit meeting of the Group of 20 nations in Germany in July.As with many of Mr. Putin\u2019s maneuvers, his offer to release a record of the White House meeting with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and its Washington ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, seemed designed to unnerve and confuse.For a start, the offer left everyone guessing about what kind of \u201crecord\u201d Mr. Putin has of his diplomats\u2019 meeting with Mr. Trump. Intentionally or otherwise, Mr. Putin muddied the waters by using a Russian word that can mean both audio recording and a written account. A Kremlin aide, Yury Ushakov, later clarified that Moscow has in its possession a written transcript, not a tape.\u201cI think Putin gets personal pleasure from exploiting the vulnerable position Trump has found himself in,\u201d said Valeriy Solovey, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. \u201cPutin feels superior and this flatters him.\u201dBut, he added, the main target of Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention was domestic opinion, as has been the case with most moves by the Russian president that baffle and dismay foreigners.\u201cThis was a well prepared impromptu move,\u201d Mr. Solovey said. \u201cThe goal is to demonstrate the superiority of the Russian political system, in which major decisions can be made swiftly and effectively. From the Russian point of view, what happens in Washington these days demonstrates the total inability of the U.S. president to make any decisions that are needed in this situation.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s remarks are unlikely to please the White House, which has given conflicting accounts of what Mr. Trump told the Russians and has resisted giving details of their conversation.Aleksei V. Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow research group, said he doubted Mr. Putin had set out to offend Mr. Trump and questioned whether the Russian record would ever see the light of day.\u201cOn the personal level, Trump clearly wants to improve relations with Russia. The problem is that he is also president of the U.S., head of the state apparatus. This makes it much more difficult to make deals with Russia,\u201d Mr. Makarkin said.Mr. Putin\u2019s offer, he added, was \u201cpure rhetoric because the condition is that Trump should sign up to the idea. The American side should give its permission and this is a big problem. How can it give its permission if secret matters were discussed?\u201dAnd even if the White House does assent to the release of the Russian record, making it public is unlikely to clear the air, Mr. Makarkin said. \u201cIf Russia published a transcript, people wouldn\u2019t believe it anyway,\u201d he added. \u201cThe media can say that not everything was published and that this document cannot be trusted,\u201dMr. Trump has acknowledged discussing terrorism but has not specified what he told the Russian envoys.Mr. Putin dismissed the claim that Mr. Trump had revealed any information that could be considered highly sensitive, returning to a favorite Kremlin theme: that the United States is gripped by an anti-Russian fever.\u201cWhat surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation, using anti-Russian slogans. Either they don\u2019t understand the damage they\u2019re doing to their own country, in which case they are simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which case they are dangerous and corrupt,\u201d Mr. Putin said.Making light of the Oval Office episode and the value of Mr. Trump\u2019s disclosure, Mr. Putin joked that he would reprimand Mr. Lavrov because \u201che hasn\u2019t shared those secrets with us.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s fans in Russia reacted with delight to Mr. Putin\u2019s move, with Sergei A. Markov, an analyst close to the Kremlin, rejoicing on Twitter over the Russian president\u2019s assertiveness. \u201cWell done, Putin. He surfed the wave into the U.S. information storm,\u201d Mr. Markov wrote.Mr. Putin and his aides have repeatedly denied allegations that Russia interfered in last year\u2019s presidential election in the United States.At the same time, however, it has reaped great benefit from all the attention focused on Russia, even if most of it is negative. Accusations of Russian meddling have played into a domestic propaganda campaign that portrays all the country\u2019s economic and other problems as a result of Russophobic foreigners intent on vilifying Russia. Moreover, the image of Moscow in the United States as a master manipulator has only reinforced Mr. Putin\u2019s status as a supremely competent leader.\u201cRussian authorities are amused by the greatly exaggerated role attributed to Russia in the America\u2019s internal political life,\u201d Mr. Solovey said. \u201cThis is a very beneficial topic for the Russian propaganda machine.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a much more aggressive mosquito and will feed on people during the day. Last year, the Asian tiger mosquito peaked in the city around mid-to-late July, Professor Harrington said.The Asian tiger mosquito sounds nasty.\u201cIt is,\u201d Professor Harrington said. It feeds on animals but, she added, it \u201creally likes human blood. That combined with a painful, persistent bite makes it a real nuisance.\u201d It is also a potential carrier of the Zika virus.Should I be concerned about Zika?In New York City, we have had no evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika, although last year more than 1,000 New York State residents contracted the illness outside the state, Professor Harrington said. There is a risk, although it is very low, of contracting Zika in the city, she said, because the Asian tiger mosquito could pick up the virus and transmit it to people.Are some people more apt to be bitten by mosquitoes than others?Yes, she said, adding that scientists aren\u2019t sure why. What they do know is that each person has a unique \u201codor profile,\u201d and mosquitoes find some profiles more attractive than others. There\u2019s no evidence that blood type or skin color plays a role in how much you are bitten, but research has shown that ingesting one particular substance \u2014 alcohol \u2014 does attract mosquitoes.How can I prevent bites?How can I ease a bite?\u201cA calamine solution and anti-itch cream are your best bet.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Power through: A streak of radiant weather awaits us, beginning tomorrow.Here are a few tips on how to avoid them, and what to do when bitten:Advertisement"}

Perhaps because I grew up in the same milieu (albeit in a different country) at the same time, I know full well \u201cthe conservative Catholic Church of the 1950s\u201d to which Buchanan pledges loyalty, and its deep anti-Semitism, racism and misogyny.

But that view ignores the disproportionate numbers of black and Hispanic soldiers \u2014 the \u201cfashionable minorities\u201d Buchanan so despises \u2014 who fought and died for that hideous mistake that he still supports.\u2666To the Editor:Damon Linker, reviewing Alvin S.

Board of Education and federal civil rights legislation. For years he promoted and defended that arch-Red-baiter and past master of fake news, Joe McCarthy.Linker, as well as Felzenberg, glosses over the political discord and divisiveness fomented by Buckley as mere right-wing flamboyance \u2014 mostly because of what both credit as an astonishing show of bravery in standing up to Ayn Rand and opposing anti-Semitism.

One can only imagine what items President Trump might try to seed into Winchell\u2019s column or the bons mots Winchell himself would tweet. But Meacham sells his subject short by emphasizing only Winchell\u2019s Red-baiting associations with Roy Cohn and Senator Joseph McCarthy. In the early 1930s, Winchell was one of the first national figures trying to alert the American public to potential dangers posed by the rise of Adolf Hitler. Winchell used his column as a platform to attack Hitler with creative zeal. His outrageous attacks on the F\u00fchrer, politically incorrect by modern standards, are still belly-laugh funny.In 1936, Winchell became one of the first voices to denounce the rising pro-Nazi German-American Bund movement, attacking the group\u2019s leader, the self-styled Bundesf\u00fchrer, Fritz Kuhn. During the Bund\u2019s high point from 1936 through 1939, which culminated in a Madison Square Garden rally some 22,000 strong, Winchell delighted in incessant mockery of Kuhn. At one point, the enraged Kuhn declared that when he rose to power, Winchell would be strung up on a light pole in front of the columnist\u2019s beloved Stork Club. When Kuhn went on trial for embezzlement of Bund funds in November 1939, Winchell showed up to the courtroom, acid pen in hand. After the war, the denaturalized Kuhn was deported to Germany. He demanded his military guards pass along a message to his old nemesis \u2014 which Winchell mockingly reprinted in his column: \u201cTell Herr Vinchell, I will lift to piss on his grafe.\u201d By the time Kuhn\u2019s death was reported in America in 1953, Winchell had moved on to fighting anything he perceived as a Communist menace. Certainly Winchell was no prince when it came to attacking his foes, as Meacham points out, and it led to the man\u2019s self-destruction. But for a few shining years, Winchell used his talents to forge a singular front in the American battle against Nazism in all its forms.The writer is the author of \u201cSwastika Nation: Fritz Kuhn and the Rise and Fall of the German-American Bund.\u201d\u2666Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

Jana refused.On Wednesday, Whole Foods announced a sweeping overhaul:\u2022 Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive (who is married to Arthur O.

{"Headline": "Officials Decline to Call Fatal Stabbing of Black Student a Hate Crime", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byThe police found the white man, a student at the University of Maryland, at around 3:30 a.m. Saturday, sitting on a campus bench a few feet away from the spot where witnesses said he had plunged his knife into a black man\u2019s chest.The victim was pronounced dead sometime after 4 a.m., just three days before he was scheduled to graduate from nearby Bowie State University.And amid inflamed anxieties about a rebranded white-power movement, the question that enveloped both young men\u2019s campuses was why.The authorities charged Sean C. Urbanski, 22, with assault and first- and second-degree murder in the death of Richard W. Collins III, 23, who had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army and was preparing to move to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., for training in defending the country against chemical attacks.On Sunday, officials said they were investigating the killing as a possible hate crime, citing a Facebook group to which Mr. Urbanski had belonged, called \u201cAlt-Reich: Nation.\u201dBut in a news conference late Monday, the Prince George\u2019s County state\u2019s attorney, Angela D. Alsobrooks, said Mr. Urbanski\u2019s motive was unclear, though she did not rule out racial animus.\u201cWe do not have enough evidence to say conclusively whether this is a hate crime,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we can say is that we will leave no stone unturned.\u201dThe F.B.I.\u2019s Baltimore office was assisting the campus police to try to determine whether a hate crime was committed, a spokesman said.On Monday, a judge ordered Mr. Urbanski held without bail. At the hearing, Mr. Urbanski\u2019s lawyer said that alcohol and substance abuse might have played a role in the attack.And on Monday night, students and faculty at Bowie State, a historically black college founded in 1865, held a solemn vigil on the eve of the ceremony at which Mr. Collins would have received his diploma.\u201cRichard was an outstanding individual,\u201d said Lt. Col. Joel Thomas, head of the university\u2019s Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps, in which Mr. Collins was active. \u201cHe was an outstanding cadet. He was an outstanding member of this campus community.\u201dSome new details emerged about Mr. Urbanski\u2019s life, and about the Facebook group of which he was a member.The group\u2019s public profile was inaccessible on Monday. Screenshots showed that its members had earlier trafficked in anti-black and sexist memes. But Alex Goodman, 19, an administrator of the group, said it had been started a few months ago as satire and was in fact partly intended to make fun of the so-called alt-right.\u201cNothing is meant as true; we follow none of the beliefs,\u201d Mr. Goodman, who described himself as pagan, said. \u201cNone of us believe in that philosophy. I condemn those who believe in white supremacy.\u201dMatthew Lamb, 26, who said he had founded the Facebook group, said he and his friends had \u201cspent two days trying to come up with a funny name,\u201d adding: \u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s offensive. It\u2019s supposed to be offensive.\u201d\u201cBut oh God, no,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not white supremacist or a Nazi group, and I\u2019m not a white supremacist.\u201dThe authorities drew no conclusions about the Facebook group. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to speculate about whether or not it was a hate group or a hate page,\u201d said John Erzen, spokesman for the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney in Prince George\u2019s County.Mr. Goodman said Mr. Urbanski was not an active member of the Facebook group. \u201cHe did not list much, and I never saw him comment or like anything,\u201d he said.In an interview on Monday, a friend of Mr. Urbanski\u2019s who has known him for about 10 years described him as a \u201cchill dude and a good dude who I never saw show hate towards any person or any kinds of people.\u201dThe friend, who had worked with Mr. Urbanski at Severna Park Lanes, a bowling alley, over the years, insisted on anonymity to avoid being associated with the case in the eyes of potential employers.Mr. Urbanski started at the bowling alley as a janitor and worked his way up to a position behind the counter, said the friend, who has known him since middle school. He \u201cwas dependable and always reported for his shifts,\u201d the friend said, adding that Mr. Urbanski also held a job at a gym and had talked about becoming a physical therapist after graduating.\u201cI never saw him show any visible signs of an anger problem,\u201d the friend said. \u201cOccasionally, he\u2019d get annoyed at a customer, but we all did.\u201dMr. Urbanski, he said, was \u201cone of the last persons I would imagine doing something like this.\u201dAccording to the University of Maryland Police, Mr. Collins and two friends were standing at a bus stop in front of the Montgomery Hall dormitory when they heard Mr. Urbanski screaming, and watched as he approached them.\u201cStep left, step left if you know what\u2019s best for you,\u201d Mr. Urbanski said, according to the police. Mr. Collins said no, and Mr. Urbanski plunged a three- to four-inch silver blade into his chest, the police said a witness told them.The killing cast a pall over what ordinarily would have been a festive period on both campuses.At the University of Maryland, Regina Lapierre, the mother of two students, laid a bouquet of flowers at the bus stop where Mr. Collins was stabbed.\u201cI feel so sad for the family of this poor man,\u201d she said, saying the crime seemed \u201cvery random\u201d on what she believed was a \u201cvery safe campus.\u201dAt Bowie State, Mr. Collins was known as a focused student, lithe and athletic, and was deeply involved with the R.O.T.C.Colonel Thomas said Mr. Collins had attended college on a military scholarship, excelled at physical training, and often joined his fellow cadets in training students in middle school and high school Junior R.O.T.C. programs.At the student center, he was quick to challenge passers-by to a game of table tennis. \u201cHe was so competitive when it came to Ping-Pong,\u201d said Emanuel Karunwi, a sophomore.Mr. Collins\u2019s Facebook page revealed a young man with wide-ranging tastes, and both a serious and silly side. He wrote about the death of a hamster named Keont\u00e9, and admired the hip-hop group Migos and the composer Philip Glass.\u201cI love all people and hate ignorance but I myself am ignorant so I am still working on loving all people,\u201d he wrote in 2014.Scott Rodd contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Jordan was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat of a car that was driving away from the officer who fired at it, Chief Jonathan Haber of Balch Springs said, adding that the shooting \u201cdid not meet our core values.\u201dIn the aftermath, those who knew Jordan well were quick to laud the person he was.\u201cAwesome parents,\u201d Chris Cano, the father of a friend, told a local television station, WFAA. \u201cHe was not a thug. This shouldn\u2019t happen to him.\u201dThose comments were published in a New York Times article, and readers were critical of the narrative that such a quotation painted.Activists for police accountability have long argued that black people killed by the police are too often the ones put on trial afterward, rather than the officers who shot them. If the shooting was unjustified, does it matter whether the victim had accumulated accolades?Although an array of studies have shown racial disparities in the criminal justice system, the default thinking among many Americans is often to assume that black people killed by the police were up to no good, and that their pasts somehow contributed to their fatal interactions with the authorities, activists and academics say.That is a much easier narrative to swallow than the alternative \u2014 \u201cthat we\u2019re looking at faulty policing,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African-American Studies and English at Duke University.\u201cThere\u2019s a narrative about the kind of activities that young black men engage in,\u201d Mr. Neal said.And the death of black people at the hands of police officers can often set off a defense mechanism among the deceased\u2019s family and friends. They emphasize that those killed were not bad people, that they did not play into society\u2019s jaded expectations.A lawyer for Jordan\u2019s family, S. Lee Merritt, told The Dallas Morning News: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard excuses before in the past: You know why it happens, because the dads aren\u2019t present. That excuse isn\u2019t here.

Finally I wrote, \u201cI like you and I want to be with you.\u201d Then I squeezed my eyes shut and pressed \u201cSend.\u201dSix weeks earlier, Michael and I had met on Bumble, the dating app where women have to make the first move. Our first date had been in a local cafe. Afterward, I told my eager roommate that the date was \u201cjust fine,\u201d but \u201cjust fine\u201d was fine with me. I wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship, let alone love.My female friends, who associate dating apps more with the Grim Reaper than with Cupid, warned me against them, saying, \u201cThe guys just want to hook up and disappear.\u201dAgain, fine with me. I was graduating in a few months, and attachment would mean a hard goodbye, which would mean tears, tissues and snot. No thanks.Michael was also graduating. He was tall, thin, looked as if he loved L.A. and routinely announced, \u201cI love L.A.\u201dEvery Monday night for the next month, I would stuff my contact lens solution into my backpack and walk to Michael\u2019s apartment. He\u2019d lean against my shoulder as we watched movies in his barren living room, which he decided not to decorate because he had signed only a one-year lease. \u201cNo point when it\u2019s so temporary,\u201d he said.Everything about us was temporary. We would talk a little, watch a little and then go to bed. In the morning, I would zip up my coat while he asked, \u201cHeading out?\u201dI would nod and say, \u201cThanks for the toast.\u201dThere was a rhythm to it. Monday night, pack my bag. Tuesday morning, walk home.By asking for more, I knew I was breaking the rules. Dating apps allow you to set obvious parameters: age range, distance radius and so on. But there are also unspoken rules: a deadline for the relationship (in our case, graduation); what feelings shouldn\u2019t be expressed, from affection (\u201cThinking of you!\u201d) to criticism (\u201cIt bothers me when you do x\u201d); and boundaries on what shouldn\u2019t be shared about your personal lives (family details, past loves). And you can regulate how much you want to integrate the person into other spheres of your life (not introducing each other to friends).For a month, I was totally in control. Then one morning, as I returned to my apartment, my hand paused on the doorknob. Instead of considering the warm shower I was about to take, or even dreading the slog of classes that awaited me, I was still thinking about Michael.I started daydreaming about how the moonlight trickled in while he played me his jazz records, how he chuckled and buried his face in his hands after I explained my odd internships, and how he held up a picture of his family and described each of his brothers. Our kiss was interrupted when he started smiling and then I started smiling.I was an idiot. Of course I liked him. It was as if I had been carrying an armful of bricks for the past few weeks but only just admitted, \u201cWow, this is a little heavy.\u201dI tried reciting my mantra. Hard goodbye. Tissues. Snot. Then I gave in and dropped those hints, which he didn\u2019t get. So I said it flat out: \u201cI like you.\u201dWithin an hour of texting him my confession, my phone lit up with Michael\u2019s reply: \u201cI like you too.\u201dFor a second, my future brimmed with Michael: his records, his quiet demeanor but abrasive sense of humor, his shamelessness in recounting the time he was struck with food poisoning at a hostel in San Francisco. Then another text appeared: \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m apprehensive about the commitment.\u201dWhen I clarified that I didn\u2019t expect a long-term commitment, with our coming graduation, he expressed his real concern: \u201cMonogamy.\u201dMy thumbs hovered dumbly over my phone screen. What?I had known there were other girls. Once, while lying in bed with my head against his shoulder, he squinted at his phone and I caught a glimpse of the name at the top of a text message: Sophie.Earlier, I had noticed how he\u2019d become Facebook friends with a Sophie, along with a series of girls from other schools. One had cute glasses and a nose ring, and another looked as if she played guitar better than I did. Michael didn\u2019t share mutual friends with them, so I could only assume he had met them on Bumble or Tinder.I tried to shrug it off. So I was Mondays, and I guessed these girls were maybe Thursdays, Wednesdays or Saturdays. I figured they, like me, were just players of the dating app game, where Michael undoubtedly pressed the proverbial \u201cplay again?\u201d button after each successful connection. I thought I could deal with that.But then Michael started feeling less like a game to me. When he sat across from me, I stopped seeing his face as a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to swipe on. With the months we had left, I wanted to get to know him, the actual Michael, not the Michael that appeared before me like a selection in an online catalog. I wanted to leave the game behind and develop something special, if only for a short time.Yet Michael hesitated.It struck me that the \u201cfling\u201d was dead. Now we have flings, plural, because that\u2019s what dating apps encourage.Dating apps are the courtship equivalent of next-day shipping, where you don\u2019t have to twiddle your thumbs and wait for an adequate romantic prospect to drift by. They release a flood of potential suitors, your inbox notifications flashing red with heartbeats of their own.It\u2019s nice to imagine that Michael liked me the most, but even if that were true, I\u2019m not sure what it counts for in a dating scene of instant gratification with seemingly unlimited choice. After all, dating apps never announce, \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve matched with everyone you could possibly like!\u201dThey tempt you to keep swiping, and as you whiz through tens, hundreds or even thousands of profiles, you can only infer the obvious. Out of all these people, there\u2019s got to be someone better than the person I\u2019m seeing right now.Which means that monogamy requires more sacrifice than ever. If offered free travel, why would anyone settle for one place when it\u2019s possible to tour the entire world?I finally texted Michael back. \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cmaybe it would be best if we called it good.\u201d He said he understood. \u201cGood luck with \u2026\u201d I began, a message I would typically end with \u201c\u2026 your paper\u201d or \u201c\u2026 your test.\u201d But I realized this was the end, so I wrote, \u201c\u2026 everything.\u201dA mere six weeks after our first date, we were over. I\u2019d broken the rules; my glimmer of expressed affection had led to a fatal imbalance in the game.Feeling a little dispensable, I opened Bumble to pause my account. It was the first time I\u2019d opened it since Michael and I met, and the app had clearly been waiting for me with its arms crossed. A notification flashed, indicating that I had been right-swiped by a few people: 1,946 people.As the saying goes, there are plenty of fish in the sea, and it turned out my sea held 1,946 of them. The \u201cplay again?\u201d button glowed brighter than ever. And yet, almost comically, I wanted to date only one particular person.Was Michael the best of my 1,946 choices? I doubt it.

Mr. Michaels noticed her wearing all red from a couple of blocks away and ran to take her picture. \u201cI think that engaging with people on the street is just as important as the photograph itself,\u201d he said. He was also drawn to the color of her outfit. \u201cThematically, I was really attracted to the color red in this series.\u201dMr. Michaels was driving when he saw this man walking down the street. He made a U-turn. When he asked to take this photograph, the man, an actor and busboy from Canada, started posing. \u201cI just thought it was really funny that he already had his classic poses that he was going to do, and he\u2019s not a character that goes on Hollywood Boulevard to make money,\u201d Mr. Michaels said.Mr. Michaels is drawn to people who appear timeless, like this woman at the farmers\u2019 market. She looked \u201clike she hadn\u2019t changed in the last 50 years,\u201d he said, likening the image to a combination \u201cof a family photo and a found photo.\u201d She asked him if she should uncover her hair for the photo \u2014 it had been raining that day \u2014 and he said: \u201cNo, you should leave it on. It\u2019s so beautiful.\u201dMr. Michaels liked this man\u2019s loud shirt and enduring style, and chose to use a metal storefront shutter to highlight all of the lines that were present in the shirt, backdrop and sidewalk.This woman was wearing all white and waiting for the bus after church services. Mr. Michaels focused on her vintage-style shoes that evoke the 1950s pinup era.\u201cI was really inspired by the set in the first place,\u201d Mr. Michaels said of this photo of an extra taking a lunch break on a film set. It was the first photograph he took for this series, and it inspired him to seek out other cinematic photographs that exist in everyday Los Angeles life. \u201cI\u2019ve always been attracted to the classic Hollywood style,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cIn Los Angeles, we kind of fall victim to trends, and I think with my photographs, especially for this project, I kind of looked for more of the classic, timeless aspects of Los Angeles. Things that don\u2019t change.\u201d Mr. Michaels loves photographing people wearing hats, especially hats that evoke other eras. \u201cI think as a culture now we\u2019re kind of on fast-forward about the way we dissect things, from imagery to clothing to culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the idea of these classic hats kind of represent this world that I wish I lived in.\u201dHere is another man wearing a cowboy hat at a downtown parade. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that I would be into cowboy culture outside of a city environment,\u201d Mr. Michaels said. \u201cI think that I\u2019m attracted to things that don\u2019t really belong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because of the ferocious pace with which the current presidential administration generates news, it received little notice; enter the term into a search engine, and the first listing that appears is for a service that aids homeless men and women in Australia.Project New Dawn is an operation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\u2019s homeland security investigations division, and is aimed at dismantling transnational gangs, which President Trump has designated chief among the enemies of public safety. In his dystopian view of the American city, pack violence driven by immigrants, many here illegally, proceeds unreined.So what can be done about urban gang violence? in New York, the Citizens Crime Commission, an independent organization devoted to novel solutions to public safety problems, has seemed to be in the vanguard of tailoring technological innovations to prevention. The organization\u2019s president, Richard Aborn, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, speaks more in the patois of Silicon Valley than in the jargon of policing. With ample philanthropic funding, the commission has developed something called the E-Responder, which automates the process of identifying particularly disturbing or violent social media posts. Interestingly, Mr. Aborn has found that New York gang members, many of whom are affiliated with neighborhood crews rather than international syndicates, prefer obvious channels like Facebook rather than encrypted and out-of-view sites like WhatsApp, making their comings and goings easy to track.Tellingly, they are interested to a great extent in spectacle. \u201cThey want the taunts and the vitriol to be recognized by others in just the same way the graffiti artist wants to be seen,\u201d Mr. Aborn said. \u201cHe is not going to be interested in applying graffiti to a building that will be torn down the next day. This is all about the bravado of confrontation. You don\u2019t do it in a format that can disappear in two seconds. What\u2019s the value in being tough for two seconds?\u201dThe commission is also developing a software program that will teach itself the language of violence as it evolves. This is crucial, because that language is geographically diverse and constantly changing.

{"Headline": "TV Station Owners Rush to Seize on Relaxed F.C.C. Rules", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byThe media industry has been rife with consolidation in recent years: Cable companies, film studios and telecommunications firms have all been bought and sold at a rapid clip.Now, local television stations are at the center of the deal-making frenzy.Last week, a day after the Federal Communications Commission eased regulations over how many stations an owner may have, Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest local broadcast group in the country, said it would buy 14 New York-based stations for $240 million.The timing of Sinclair\u2019s deal may not have hinged directly on the change, but it demonstrated a demand for broadcast station mergers. Sinclair did not reply to requests for comment.And now, a bidding war has begun over Tribune Media, the owner of WGN America and, in New York, PIX 11.The Blackstone Group appears to be working with 21st Century Fox on a bid for Tribune. And Sinclair is also circling that company.\u201cThe F.C.C. has basically said: \u2018Game on. We\u2019re going to let you consolidate further than anyone had imagined,\u2019\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.Consolidation of local broadcast stations could lead to more expensive fees for consumers as providers pass on ever-higher fees from broadcasters and content creators to subscribers. But to media companies, the mantra of late has been that bigger is better.For broadcast station companies in particular \u2014 including Sinclair, Fox and the Nexstar Media Group \u2014 owning more stations increases their power over cable companies, which pay to retransmit the stations.Fox\u2019s motive for pursuing Tribune, which has more Fox affiliates than any other station owner, largely appears to be blocking a deal with Sinclair. It plans to form a joint venture with the Blackstone Group, an investment giant, in which Blackstone would provide the cash for a deal while Fox would provide its own television stations, according to people briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.If successful, Fox would then reduce its direct exposure to local television stations, Mr. Greenfield said, while still holding on to a piece \u2014 and while stymieing a rival.Details of the potential joint venture were unclear, as were the precise reasons that Fox was turning to Blackstone. Tribune is a relatively small company, with a market value of about $3.4 billion.But for companies like Fox and Sinclair, consolidation is also a defensive move, shoring them up at a time when online rivals like Netflix and Hulu are commanding more viewers. Content providers like CBS and the Walt Disney Company are also pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.Getting bigger through station acquisitions, then, is meant to help these companies drive harder bargains. And smaller operators have emerged as potential takeover targets: The stock prices of two other broadcast companies, E. W. Scripps and Gray Television, are both up sharply this year.Underpinning broadcasters\u2019 dreams of expansion is the hope that Ajit Pai, the F.C.C.\u2019s new chairman and a Republican, will let through the kinds of deal making that had been held up during the Obama administration.\u201cCompanies are talking about deals now because they have reason to believe the F.C.C. will relax all the ownership rules,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company.The first tangible step came with a 2-to-1 vote by the F.C.C. last week to reintroduce the so-called UHF discount.Longstanding rules prohibit companies from covering more than 39 percent of American households, but the UHF discount allows station owners to exclude certain stations that operate in ultrahigh frequencies. With the reinstated discount, according to calculations by Fitch Ratings, Sinclair\u2019s household coverage percentage has fallen to about 25 percent, from 38 percent, while Nexstar\u2019s has dropped to 27 percent, from 39 percent, opening the door to new mergers and acquisitions.\u201cThis represents a rational first step in media ownership reform policy allowing free and local broadcasters to remain competitive with multinational pay TV giants and broadband providers,\u201d Gordon Smith, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said in a statement.The F.C.C.\u2019s rule change followed pressure from industry groups. One week before the vote, Mitch Rose, NBC Universal\u2019s senior vice president for government relations, visited the office of the other Republican commissioner on the F.C.C., Michael O\u2019Reilly, urging him to reinstate the UHF discount.And in February, Tribune Media\u2019s general counsel, Edward Lazarus, met with Mr. Pai\u2019s chief of staff, Matthew Berry, and lobbied for the change in rules.Mr. Pai has long been critical of strict broadcast ownership rules. He has said that online media companies such as Google, Facebook and Netflix are competing for audiences that were once served only by television. He has also been skeptical of rules against broadcast ownership limits, given that the agency has approved mergers in competing industries, including Charter\u2019s purchase of Time Warner Cable and AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirecTV.At the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas last week, Mr. Pai announced his intention to re-examine other media ownership rules. Broadcasters hope that one limit that may be removed is a prohibition on owning more than two stations in a local market.Consumer groups and Democrats in Congress and at the F.C.C. warn that the changes will lead to great industry consolidation, giving a few companies great influence over news and public opinion.The action \u201cwill actually harm the public interest, by reducing diversity, competition and localism,\u201d Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat at the F.C.C., said after the UHF discount vote.\u201cThese were mergers that could never have been contemplated a year ago,\u201d Mr. Greenfield, of BTIG, said of the deals that might blossom under the new F.C.C. \u201cYou\u2019re enabling the impossible in many ways, so people are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take a shot at this.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Identity Crisis at Italienne", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Past the bar you enter the polished, expensive Dining Room, where the food is much more French, is arranged with an eye on negative space, and is available \u00e0 la carte or as a six-course, $140 tasting menu, wine pairing optional. On Monday nights, this half of the enterprise switches over to a four-course set menu devoted to the cooking of a single region, which could be French, or Italian.These party-in-the-front, business-in-the-back setups are complex propositions. They\u2019re not hot-dog stands. Mr. Sippel has made a tough job tougher by taking on two countries and more than one style of cooking, and layering the formal-casual split on top. At times, Italienne is like somebody who starts to tell you a joke about a priest, a rabbi and an imam in a rowboat and ends up talking about Maimonidean law.Along the way, he brought together a talented crew. Erica O\u2019Neal, who had been a sommelier at Frasca, stockpiled mostly French and Italian wines for a discovery-packed list that is full of twists and turns even at its cheap end. The desserts and pastries are under Rebecca Isbell, whose work made the end of a meal at Betony something to look forward to. His business partner and general manager is James King, a well-rounded pro who put in time at both Frasca and Brooklyn Fare.Everybody is out to make a good impression. One busy night in the Taverna, when my guests and I had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes past our reservation time, we were handed glasses of prosecco before we had finished our cocktails. When we got to the table, two of the Italian snacks the menu calls stuzzichini were waiting for us: warm arancini with melted fior di latte at their core, and panzerotti, little turnovers filled with bits of warm salumi and scamorza.It was more of an apology than the situation called for. On the other hand, every apology should taste so good.On a quick read, the Taverna\u2019s menu is like the ones at many other casual Italian spots. A deeper look, though, reveals more originality than usual. Scattered among the Italian favorites are a few French ideas, like the subtly curried cauliflower gratin under a tan layer of Comt\u00e9. One of the snacks was a kind of sandwich filled with something like hash browns; crisp fried triangles of cheese take the place of bread. Eating it is like getting a tax refund you weren\u2019t expecting.Under pasta was another big surprise: delicate little cabbage-and-bread dumplings the size of Swedish meatballs. They\u2019re from far northern Italy, where they\u2019re known as canederli. Italienne gave them an Eastern European lilt by serving them with beets, horseradish and applesauce. Mr. Sippel seemed to reach beyond the borders again with the caraway seeds and excellent braised red cabbage he brought to a plate of pork \u2014 tender ribs and a juicy chop that got a little too much finishing salt but were still close to perfect.Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts in the Taverna made some unexpected moves, too. Her lemon tart was wonderful and showed a sense of humor; with a cloak of white lemon icing outside and a soft filling of lemon-poppy seed cream inside, it looked just like a wedge of Camembert. But I don\u2019t know what to make of her baba au rhum, which tasted like a two-day-old coconut doughnut that had been accidentally splashed with liquor at the bar.My first meal in the Dining Room was on a Monday, when the four-course menu was supposedly inspired by the northern Rhone. I had trouble seeing the connection, but I enjoyed it all. There was an exceptional velout\u00e9 of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin. Dessert was a tart of dense, rich chocolate layered over salted caramel. It was an ideal end for a dinner of refined bistro food.When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google\u2019s translator and then back again.The frogs\u2019 legs hidden inside a frizz of kataifi were almost flavorless, and a white garlic sauce had a sharp, raw bite. Snails and strips of prosciutto strewn over buttered pappardelle never came together, and bull\u2019s-eyes of pasta called corzetti stampati were dotted with beet greens and a walnut pesto that was sweet when it should have been savory.Other dishes were better, but the only complete successes were the warm herb fougasse, served on a hook like a Bavarian pretzel, and Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts \u2014 a rhubarb granita with salty candied pistachios, and a weird, inspired oat bavarois veined with chocolate ganache.Some of the food at Italienne made me want to dance on the table. Some of it made me want to hide under the table and wait for the lights to go out so I could leave without making eye contact. My three meals might have come from three different restaurants. I would settle for one where the ideas had been worked out. At the moment, that is the Taverna.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving the Behemoths a Leg Up on the Little Guy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtEvery year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.So the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201dBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201dThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201dMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201dIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.I\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Texas Democrats Are Betting on Beto O\u2019Rourke", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 It\u2019s happening again. The stirring of the heart. The quickening of the pulse. The desire to abandon reality, even if you suspect there\u2019s a world of hurt to come. Love, thy name is Beto.If you haven\u2019t heard, our junior senator from Texas, a.k.a. Darth Vader, a.k.a. Voldemort, a.k.a. Ted Cruz, has a challenger for 2018, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman from El Paso by the name of Beto O\u2019Rourke. Mr. O\u2019Rourke may still be unknown to many, even in the state, but for those searching for a savior of the Turn Texas Blue variety, the crush is blossoming. Among statewide Democratic insiders, Beto is already a member of the First Name Club, with Madonna and Cher.She didn\u2019t. Our right-wing governor crushed her by about 20 points. Yes, there were some dumb campaign choices, and not even the truest believers could blame sexism entirely for the loss, but the bottom line was that the Republican Party was still running Texas.Two years later, Hillary Clinton thought she had a chance to carry the state in the presidential election. There was some evidence she might: Texas\u2019 biggest cities are resoundingly blue, and respectable pollsters were predicting the time had come.It hadn\u2019t. Donald Trump trounced her by 52 percent to 43 percent.Cockeyed optimists in the Democratic Party claimed that Mrs. Clinton lost by less than anticipated, but the basic math between the parties here remains unchanged, as does the conventional wisdom. The best advice for a Democrat running in Texas? Invite the press to watch you set your campaign funds on fire.But then Mr. O\u2019Rourke showed up. This time will be different, or so his proponents say. He is liberal and progressive, but also technologically and economically literate in a way that should appeal to business. He speaks fluent Spanish. He has served his district well, especially by touting the charms and economic opportunities (as opposed to the crime) on the El Paso-Juarez border.Older Democrats like to compare him to the Kennedys, in his politics and looks. (He is handsome and toothy, with a thatch of shimmering brown hair.) Millennials like him because he once played in a punk band called Foss, because he started a software company, and because he has a few things in common with Bernie Sanders. Like him, Beto promises to go it alone, without support from consultants and political action committees.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also knows how to brawl. He pulled off two upsets, the first to become a city councilman, and the second and more important in his 2012 congressional victory against Silvestre Reyes, a 16-year incumbent who is Mexican-American.Then there is the spread of so-called anti-Trump sentiment \u2014 the same one that Democrats in Kansas and Georgia and Montana are also pinning their hopes on. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has shown that he, too, can hold a rally. The crowds that greeted him in Houston, San Antonio and even Midland, once home to the Bush cabal, have been like Elvis concerts.Subsequently, Mr. Castro decided the time wasn\u2019t right \u2014 see Texas Democrats, above \u2014 and never declared his candidacy. Unless someone else decides to run in the Republican or Democratic primaries, that leaves Mr. O\u2019Rourke alone, slingshot in hand, against Mr. Cruz.So that\u2019s the good news, the stuff Democratic dreams are made of.Here\u2019s the bad news: Thus far, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has a $400,000 war chest compared with Mr. Cruz\u2019s $4.2 million, a big deficit to make up when the cost of running a statewide campaign in Texas starts at $1 million a week. There\u2019s the power of incumbency, too. Mr. Cruz may be bruised, but he\u2019s hardly bloodied. He even has 2.6 million Twitter followers to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 25,000, proving once again that social media is not just for hipsters.Some believe that a Democratic primary race, however divisive, would have prepped the victor to withstand Mr. Cruz\u2019s ruthless campaign tactics. (Mr. O\u2019Rourke had two arrests in the 1990s, one for D.U.I. and another for breaking and entering. Though both incidents have been explained away as youthful indiscretions, Mr. Cruz will be sure to turn them into high crimes and misdemeanors.)Finally, there\u2019s the biggest problem of all: Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide race in Texas since 1994. John Cornyn, the senior Texas senator, has described Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s run as \u201ca suicide mission.\u201dMaybe. Probably. But this is Texas: If you can\u2019t dream big, why bother?Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Extras Are the Stars on the Korean Menu at Atoboy", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.When all of the little plates of pickles and vegetables and whatnot land on the table at the start of a Korean meal, it\u2019s like winning a game show. They are called banchan, and they shower down out of nowhere, like balloons. Fermented daikon and wavy cabbage leaves, pink with chile paste. Pinwheels of soy-stained lotus root. Silvery, crunchy stir-fried anchovies no bigger than paper matches.If I\u2019m in a restaurant, I pay close attention to these dishes. The better they are, the higher my hopes for the rest of the meal. They serve as a quick reminder from the outset of how varied Korean cuisine can be, how it can pack both nuance and power. And, of course, I like them because at most Korean restaurants they\u2019re free.After three dinners at Atoboy (ah-TOE-boy) since last fall and one quick snack at the bar, I\u2019m happy to admit that I was wrong. This is no scam. Junghyun Park, the chef, uses banchan as a starting point, then goes on to build smart, surprising dishes around it.Look at what he does with those pinwheels of lotus root, laying them over a bed of tofu in soft, tiny curds like ricotta. It\u2019s a great dish, half crunchy and half creamy, both halves humming along under a dressing of chile oil and sesame oil.Like Jungsik, Atoboy favors the subtler end of the Korean flavor spectrum, but it avoids fussing and tweezing. Mr. Park\u2019s novel and lovely sea bass tartare, under a shimmering pale-green layer of chopped kiwi, mint and fermented spring garlic, could easily slide onto the menu at Jungsik if he decked out the plate with some foofaraw. (I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t.)The low-key atmosphere that the Parks have set down, though, has little in common with the carpeted environs of Jungsik, which affects a formality so stiff around the spine that the servers might be wearing back braces. Atoboy is also a deliberate step away from the controlled chaos of the Korean restaurants a few blocks north on 32nd Street. Between its patched walls of raw concrete, simple wooden tables are arranged in two symmetrical rows with a narrow path to the kitchen down the middle.It looks like a downtown wine bar, and in fact wine is one of the chief attractions. The list is brief but manages to take you to places you wouldn\u2019t expect to visit in a Korean restaurant. There\u2019s a concentration of bottles from Nikolaihof, Gut Oggau and other fine Austrian producers; a small flock of Loire winemakers such as Olga Raffault; Champagnes from Charles Ellner and other independent labels; and some respected West Coast names like Pedroncelli and Dirty & Rowdy. Everything I\u2019ve tried has cohabited amicably with Mr. Park\u2019s food.Although all 18 dishes on the menu can be ordered on their own, servers suggest a $36 meal made of one from each of three categories \u2014 roughly, cold salads, warm appetizers and plates where seafood or meat do most of the work. They\u2019re served more or less in that order but without pauses between the courses, and the plates pile up in the middle of the table.This makes it too easy for nuanced dishes, like fried and braised sunchokes with oyster mushrooms and oranges dressed in a creamy truffle emulsion, to get lost. The servers insist that everything is meant for sharing. Heard that one before? But some dishes, like the delicate egg custard in a smoky dashi with morels and soybeans, were worse for wear and tear after they were doled out to individual plates.It\u2019s almost impossible to get worked up about any of this, though, because the $36 menu is such a fair deal, and because so many of the dishes work so well and do things you didn\u2019t know Korean food could do.Mr. Park\u2019s take on yuk hwe is memorable, the beef tartare cut into long skinny threads that are tossed with soy sauce, dotted with nettle cream and topped with what seem to be julienne potato chips. Braised mackerel, usually cooked in soy sauce, is simmered in a complex green-chile broth. Little drums of octopus leg, a dot of parsley oil in the center of each one, are ringed around a kind of hash of kimchi and chorizo \u2014 two things that were meant to be together, though I never would have guessed.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Journalists at 2 of Australia\u2019s Biggest Papers Strike Over Job Cuts", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Staff members at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, among the most powerful voices in the Australian news media, began a weeklong strike on Wednesday over job cuts at Fairfax Media.The walkout reflects the strains afflicting Australia\u2019s news media, which faces the same digital challenges hurting the industry in the United States and other places.On Wednesday morning, the company sent an email to staff members saying it would cut 125 full-time positions at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne, with cuts also expected at The Australian Financial Review. Last month, Fairfax management said that the company would need to trim 30 million Australian dollars, or about $22.5 million, representing nearly one-quarter of its editorial budget.In his email to staff members on Wednesday, Sean Aylmer, the editorial director at Fairfax Media, said that all editorial sections could be affected but that some jobs would be hit especially hard.\u201cWhile we will be looking across all parts of the newsroom, at the end of the redundancy program we expect there will be significantly fewer editorial management, video, presentation and section writer roles,\u201d he wrote.A Fairfax spokesman said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the journalists\u2019 decision but would continue to publish its titles in print and online as usual during the strike. He declined to say how many workers had walked off the job.The newspapers that make up Fairfax Media have more than 150 years of history in Australia, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing dubious business practices and targeting criminal operations.Staff members interviewed said the latest round of cuts signified the decline of one of Australia\u2019s most powerful media empires.\u201cThe fact that our newsroom is being cut by a quarter at least, some figures suggest more like a third, and they want us out the door in two weeks, is an enormous blow to journalism,\u201d said Michael Bachelard, investigations editor at The Age. \u201cIt really shows the deep and sudden nature of these cuts.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.Revenue from the Fairfax division that includes the papers fell 8 percent during the six months that ended in December, the company said in February.The Brisbane Times also went on strike on Wednesday.The strike would last until Wednesday, a day after the country\u2019s federal budget is released. The budget typically receives heavy attention in the news media.Under Australian labor law, the country\u2019s Fair Work Commission can order striking employees back to work. The Fairfax spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue that option.\u201cThe history of these strikes \u2014 and we\u2019ve done a number over the years as the cuts have progressively gotten worse \u2014 is that management is still able to put out a newspaper,\u201d Mr. Bachelard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a shadow of its former self.\u201dFairfax staff members posted photographs of empty newsrooms on social media after news of the strike. In Melbourne, staff members gathered and waved newspapers.He added, \u201cWe find it really frustrating that after years and years of cuts, still the organization hasn\u2019t been able to come up with a solution which doesn\u2019t require cutting the very thing that we do, which is producing good-quality journalism.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly listed one Fairfax newspaper among those whose workers went on strike. Workers at The Canberra Times issued a statement of solidarity but did not join the walkout.Isabella Kwai contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thomas Keller, an Exacting Chef at a Crossroads", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIn the tight confines of a New York cab, Thomas Keller leaned against his interviewer\u2019s shoulder. It was an intimate move for a chef whose hallmarks are precision, decorum and control.Watching other people\u2019s children gleefully scramble for eggs was both wonderful and sad this year. He and Laura Cunningham, the woman he calls his life partner, were never able to share that kind of pleasure with a child of their own.Mr. Keller thinks, at least for him, a change may be in order. \u201cAt some point you want to say, \u2018I gave, I gave, I gave \u2014 now it\u2019s time for us,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Keller is 61, an age when other successful chefs of his generation have started to plot exit strategies and consider legacies.\u201cEveryone is kind of charting their own course on this,\u201d said Emily Luchetti, a pastry chef and author who is about to turn 60. \u201cWhen we all started out, there were no real mentors to look at and say, \u2018That\u2019s how I want to do it when I\u2019m in my 60s or 70s.\u2019 The only thing we had were old European chefs who could no longer cook anymore because their knees were giving out.\u201dMr. Keller, so meticulous that one imagines he would like to plan the exact moment and nature of his own death, has yet to figure out his course.\u201cI go back and forth on the level of intensity I want to continue to dedicate to my profession, because I\u2019ve done it now for the past 44 years, and that\u2019s a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is taking care of everybody else less important than taking care of yourself?\u201dLike all Keller decisions, what comes next will be carefully considered and very likely won\u2019t come soon. He is in what he calls the seductive stage of his newest venture, a 200-seat restaurant, tentatively called the TAK Room, in the huge Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan. Opening in fall 2018, it will be his first new restaurant in almost 10 years.The menu will reflect a time when the fanciest food in America was called continental cuisine. Imagine, he said, the great restaurants of the \u201cMad Men\u201d era, with someone like Bobby Short at the piano. Mr. Keller is helping select six premier chefs and restaurateurs to join him in the complex.The rest of his portfolio includes several Bouchon bakeries and restaurants around the country, and a plethora of side hustles. He has designed plates and pots, and makes olive-oil-infused chocolate with the Tuscan oil producer Armando Manni.\u201cHe saw it as a wake-up call, certainly \u2014 a defining moment,\u201d said Russ Parsons, the retired food editor of The Los Angeles Times, who does some work for Mr. Keller.The chef\u2019s central focus these days are the final touches on what he envisions as the physical representation of the Keller legacy: a nearly $11 million renovation of the kitchen and property at the French Laundry, which he bought in 1994 and transformed from a beloved local inn into one of the greatest restaurants in the world.With its playful take on classic dishes, casual but refined service and luxe, pristine ingredients \u2014 many from its garden across the street \u2014 the restaurant cemented his reputation and proved, finally, that American chefs had stepped from the shadow of their European elders.There are solar panels and deep geothermal wells and a 16,000-bottle wine cellar. The counters are a few inches taller than before, so cooks don\u2019t have to bend down as much. Mr. Keller has even made extra space to accommodate people who want to see the kitchen and take a picture, which 80 percent of the guests do.Although the grounds are still under construction, the kitchen has been in full swing for several weeks. It looks perfect, but Mr. Keller continues to tinker. On a recent night, even a thread hanging from the toque of a chef on the fish station caught his attention, so he walked down the line and yanked it off.All the changes have affected him more than he had anticipated.\u201cYou spend two and a half years getting to a place, you\u2019re almost there and then you begin feeling the emotional effect of nostalgia,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways it makes me happy, and in other ways it makes me desperately sad. I look at it and I go, \u2018Wow, this is extraordinary.\u2019 But sometimes I look at it and go: \u2018Why did I do this? Did I really set an example for future generations of chefs and what they can achieve?\u2019\u201dThe importance of a generational passing of the baton consumes him. There is no obvious successor, and the French Laundry has yet to establish an identity independent of his. \u201cThe French Laundry is Thomas Keller,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to change that.\u201dAll of this comes at a time when the experience at Per Se or the French Laundry \u2014 nine or more courses of artfully rendered French-influenced food spread over three or four hours at a cost that starts at more than $300 a person \u2014 is being challenged as anachronistic.Even Mr. Keller\u2019s most devoted friends say it may be time to change.In 2004, she visited the French Laundry. At the time, she thought it was the most amazing meal she had ever eaten. She even got to shake hands with Mr. Keller. \u201cI left feeling like I just met Drake or something,\u201d she recalled.But now? She views fine dining as disingenuous, built from a system steeped in oppression and hierarchy in which women, gays and other minorities \u2014 whether customers or cooks \u2014 are not treated the same.\u201cIt\u2019s essentially haute couture, and we know haute couture appropriates from minorities and urban communities,\u201d she said. Chefs as powerful as Mr. Keller, she said, have a responsibility to address those issues. \u201cYou need to go on your woke journey.\u201dMr. Keller smiled when presented with that lens on his profession.\u201cI pushed against convention when I was young,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you realize there is no reason to push against things. There is no value in it.\u201d Hard work and dedication to craft, he said, will right all wrongs.The day before the competition in January, Mr. Bocuse was sick. Mr. Keller visited him and wrapped a red, white and blue scarf around his neck as the old chef rested in bed. Mr. Keller promised to return a few days later with the first-place trophy, a golden effigy of Mr. Bocuse.\u201cYou get to a certain age and you realize your own mortality, and realize those who paved the way are gone,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThere is a great sadness to that.\u201dThat great sadness can creep in, too, when he surveys the new French Laundry kitchen at the peak of a busy dinner service. If he could, he would still be cooking there every night. It\u2019s where life is simple and he is the happiest. But he knows he has a different job now.\u201cI have to prepare myself to let go, which is a very, very difficult thing for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt breaks my heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sharapova, Foot in Door at Wimbledon, Awaits Approval to Play French Open", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byBy winning her first-round match at the Italian Open, 6-4, 6-2, against Christina McHale, Sharapova will move far enough inside the top 200 of the WTA rankings to at least secure direct entry into the qualifying draw of Wimbledon in June.But Sharapova still needs a wild-card entry to the French Open, the coming Grand Slam event on the calendar. She will learn her fate for that event on Tuesday in an announcement that will be streamed live on Facebook by the French Federation of Tennis at 1 p.m. Eastern. Thirty minutes later, she will take the court for her second-round match against Mirjana Lucic-Baroni.But Sharapova is not painstakingly tracking her progress toward being able to qualify \u2014 far from it, actually. \u201cWill I?\u201d she said after her victory Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the Wimbledon qualifying works or the rankings \u2014 I\u2019m not really aware of that.\u201dOnce the math was explained, Sharapova showed some sign of appreciating her achievement.\u201cListen, winning matches will get me places,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if that\u2019s where it got me today, then I will take it.\u201dShe added, \u201cI think maybe you guys assume that I know these things, but I genuinely want to take care of each and every single week, and every single match is a priority for me.\u201dAlthough Sharapova said she was unaware of her status for Wimbledon, the tournament\u2019s officials have apparently been highly aware of her potential presence at its qualifying event. Since 1925, qualifiers have been held not at the All England Club but at the small Bank of England club in the nearby suburb of Roehampton, with open admission. This year, the qualifying tournament will be a ticketed event, with attendance capped at 1,000 people.Wimbledon\u2019s chief executive, Richard Lewis, said the possibility of Sharapova\u2019s descending onto the small facility in the same year was a mere coincidence.Sharapova could still avoid Wimbledon qualifying altogether by reaching the semifinals here and landing inside (or close to) the top 100. To get there, Sharapova might have to face top-seeded Angelique Kerber in the third round and sixth-seeded Simona Halep in the quarterfinals.Her second-round opponent, Lucic-Baroni, whom Sharapova beat in three sets in the opening round of Madrid last week, will be the first player to face Sharapova twice since her comeback. The 35-year-old Lucic-Baroni, who made a surprise run to the semifinals of the Australian Open in January, made it clear how she feels about Sharapova\u2019s continued presence at tournaments via wild cards.\u201cI\u2019m kind of tired answering these questions; she can answer questions for herself,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel the same way everybody else feels: You know the drill, you know what happened, you know what it is. Some people are forcing us to say everything is great, and blah blah, but it is what it is. I don\u2019t much care for it.\u201dLucic-Baroni declined to say who was forcing her to say everything was \u201cgreat.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m not going to say those things because then I\u2019m going to get in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, no \u2014 nobody is pressuring us to say anything.\u201dBut Lucic-Baroni said she understood why players like Kristina Mladenovic have been repeatedly critical of Sharapova.\u201cShe should be,\u201d Lucic-Baroni said of Mladenovic. \u201cEvery player who isn\u2019t doping is against it. I mean, it\u2019s not surprising. I don\u2019t care for these things. I know the way the real world works, and this is the way the real world works. Money and everything speaks for itself. Maybe they should give a wild card to Lance Armstrong, too? He\u2019s won the Tour de France a few times. How is it any different?\u201dLucic-Baroni was making a comparison between Armstrong, who was banned from Olympic sports for life for a sophisticated and extensive doping scheme, and Sharapova, whose doping violation was ruled unintentional because she was not aware the drug Meldonium had recently been banned.\u201dI have had to face a lot of, as you say, distractions or opinions or judgment since I was 17 years old,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cAnd, you know, I play tennis for a lot of things, and those are just not them anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Sharapova Will Play in Qualifying Rounds for Wimbledon", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Three days after being denied entry to the French Open by the French Tennis Federation, Maria Sharapova announced she would not ask for a wild card into the main draw at Wimbledon. Sharapova will instead play in the qualifying rounds, which are held the week before the tournament in the suburb of Roehampton.The decision allows Sharapova to avoid an awkward showdown with Wimbledon and to assert more autonomy. She was not able to gain enough ranking points in time to enter next week\u2019s qualifying draw of the French Open, falling one victory short when she lost in the semifinals of Stuttgart, her first tournament back.Sharapova is believed to be the first former Wimbledon women\u2019s singles champion to subsequently compete in its qualifying draw.The facilities at Roehampton have never hosted a spectacle quite like a Sharapova appearance. The playing conditions do not meet Wimbledon\u2019s sterling reputation, and players seeking a bathroom break or change of outfit often line up for a lone portable toilet.The qualifying tournament had long been free to attend. But in what Wimbledon officials insisted was coincidental timing, this year\u2019s event will charge admission of five pounds, and cap attendance at 1,000.Sharapova had a chance to guarantee a spot in the Wimbledon main draw by reaching the semifinals in Rome, but she sustained a left thigh injury in the third set of her second-round match against Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, and retired from the match.\u201cI have already started getting treatment on the injury I sustained a few days ago in Rome, and will begin my preparation as soon as I get better,\u201d Sharapova wrote Friday.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a decision we took lightly and we recognize not everyone will agree with it,\u201d said Michael Downey, chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association, which is the sport\u2019s governing body in Britain. \u201cHowever, Maria has served her ban in full and is now back playing high quality tennis.\u201dIn exchange for the wild card, Sharapova also committed to play in Birmingham in 2018.

{"Headline": "\u2018We Have to Repudiate It\u2019: A City Confronts White Nationalist Protests", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byIn an interview, Mr. Signer discussed the weekend\u2019s protests, his response to the anti-Semitic Twitter posts, and the steps forward in a city seeking to re-examine its history.The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.What was going through your mind as the rally unfolded on Saturday?Well, it\u2019s important to keep in mind, it was very short. I got there just after it had been disbanded.When I first saw the photos, which is what I think struck so many people, it immediately hearkened back to images of visual intimidation, visual terror. And I thought: We have to speak out against this immediately. We have to repudiate it.You wrote on Facebook that it \u201chearkens back to the days of the KKK.\u201d Can you explain your concerns further?When I think about visual displays meant to intimidate and shock, I was thinking about cross burnings. But so many torches all together in a public park next to a Confederate symbol is reminiscent of that approach.Since the weekend, you\u2019ve been on the receiving end of anti-Semitic tweets and online abuse. What do you make of these, and how do you respond to it? I think that this is similar to the torches, in that they\u2019re both efforts to intimidate and silence people.What I witness nowadays with the demonstration and the anonymous trolls is a bullying, simplistic approach meant to silence anyone who has views they don\u2019t agree with through intimidation. The key thing is not to be intimidated and to stand up for American principles like freedom of speech, religious toleration, checks and balances, and civic dialogue. Does this feel personal?I don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s personal \u2014 I think it\u2019s a pattern that goes back thousands of years. It has rightly been relegated to the trash heap of history.As painful as it is for people to read these tweets, I see them as the last gasps of a failing, retrograde, toxic element in American politics that knows that it\u2019s failing. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re so angry. But that doesn\u2019t absolve us of the responsibility to speak out against it, which is one of the reasons I\u2019ve been calling out the cowardice in these anonymous tweets selectively.The Charlottesville City Council voted last month to sell the Robert E. Lee statue and rename Lee and Jackson Parks. How did you vote, and why?We had a 3-to-2 vote on whether to move it and a 3-to-2 vote on whether to sell it, and I was in the minority of both of those votes. We had a unanimous vote to put two new memorials in both the Lee and the Jackson parks. We also had a unanimous vote to rename the parks.Through many events here in Charlottesville in the black community, I heard grave concerns about the proposal to move statues, grounded in a worry that if we don\u2019t remember the past, then we\u2019ll be condemned to repeat it. I came to conclude that we would do better to add new context, to publicly rebuke the meaning of these statues, and thereby to create a dynamic present that truly reflected who we are today.The decision to sell or remove monuments has generated controversy around the country, most recently in New Orleans. How has this played out locally? Did the tenor of things change on Saturday?This issue has divided the community very deeply for over a year. I\u2019ve held two town halls at African-American churches here and heard extremely different opinions from a wide range of folks, including many who believe the statues should stay and many who believe they should go. When I announced my decision, I said the one thing I know with certainly is that many people will be angry with me no matter what I do.I certainly am very uncomfortable with the fact that overt white nationalists have seen fit to make this a symbol for their cause. On the other hand, I\u2019m not in the habit of letting extremists dictate my decisions, and I don\u2019t think we should be doing that as a country, either.What is the status of the effort to sell the monument now? The sale has been enjoined by court order, so that\u2019s just stalled until the judge makes his decision on the underlying lawsuit. Everything else is moving full steam ahead. I\u2019m going to press to move full steam ahead on renaming the parks. We\u2019re going to issue this request for proposals for these two new memorials in the parks in a matter of weeks.Advertisement"}

He was 101.His death was confirmed by Roxanne Meadows, his partner, who said he had Parkinson\u2019s syndrome and had recently broken a hip.About two hours south of Orlando, he and Ms. Meadows constructed domed buildings and other structures to showcase his ideas for energy-efficient cities that would be built in circular arrangements. They supported the project with $200 tours of the compound and by selling books and videos.He wanted all sovereign nations to declare the world\u2019s resources \u2014 clean air and water, arable land, education, health care, energy and food \u2014 the \u201ccommon heritage\u201d of all people. In his so-called resource-based economy, he said, people would get what they want through computers. He looked upon his plan as a practical, even inevitable response to the inequities rampant in the modern world. But he conceded that only a catastrophe would lead to the adoption of his concept.\u201cEconomic collapse,\u201d he said, would demonstrate to people that elected politicians \u201caren\u2019t competent enough to get us out of these problems, and they will look to possible solutions.\u201dRobert Murphy, an associate scholar at the Mises Institute, which promotes the teaching of Austrian economics, wrote in 2010 that idealists like Mr. Fresco were \u201cwrong to blame our current dysfunctional world on capitalism or money per se.\u201d Instead, Mr. Murphy wrote, if property rights were respected by all, \u201chumanity would become fantastically wealthy.\u201dMr. Fresco\u2019s abiding faith in computers led him to say that they would someday run nearly everything, including government.\u201cComputers don\u2019t have ambition,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t say, \u2018I want to control people.\u2019 They don\u2019t have gut instincts.\u201dJacque Fresco was born in Brooklyn on March 13, 1916, to Isaac Fresco, a horticulturalist, and the former Lena Friedlich, a homemaker. His parents wanted him to be a sign painter, like his uncle, but he was devoted to studying mathematics, conducting science experiments in the family bathroom and building advanced models of ships and aircraft. At 13, he designed a fan with rubber or fabric blades after a relative was hurt when he stuck his hand into a metal fan.He did not like attending school and was often a truant. By his early teens, he was on his own.At some point, he said, he went to Florida, where he caught poisonous snakes in the Everglades and sold them to circuses. He never attended college and occasionally fretted in later years that his lack of academic credentials might have limited his impact.After hitchhiking to California, he started a career as an aircraft and architectural designer, research engineer, creator of rocket models for science-fiction films and designer of prefabricated aluminum homes that were displayed at the Warner Bros. studio. During World War II, he said, he served in the Army Air Forces\u2019 design and development unit at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio.He predicted in 1956 that there would be \u201csaucerlike\u201d space stations, elevators that moved horizontally as well as vertically and, presciently, driverless cars.Cars, he said, would have \u201cproximity control\u201d that would render collisions \u201cimpossible.\u201dMr. Fresco had been thinking of a planned city, like the one laid out in Project Venus, since at least the 1950s. His work on it intensified after he moved to Florida, where he sketched out \u201cProject Americana,\u201d a scheme in which \u201csensitive machines\u201d would react to the environment to cool and clean the city, direct traffic and close floodgates, he told Florida Living magazine in 1961.For the Venus Project, he and Ms. Meadows built 10 steel and concrete structures on their compound, half of them domed, using processes that would be models for the architecture of the project\u2019s proposed cities. Inside one dome, Mr. Fresco\u2019s workshop was filled with hundreds of models and renderings of futuristic houses, apartment buildings, helicopters and cars.Ms. Meadows, the co-founder of the Venus Project, said that Mr. Fresco understood how improbable it would be for his vision to be adopted.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d she said Wednesday in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I think people are na\u00efve to think that the current system would work for the betterment of people. We\u2019re heading toward annihilation in many areas.\u201dAnd, she added, \u201che came up with many positive solutions for the future.\u201dMs. Meadows is Mr. Fresco\u2019s only survivor. His two marriages ended in divorce, and his son, Richard, and daughter, Bambi, are dead.Mr. Fresco, who believed fervently in science\u2019s power to transform life for the better, said on Facebook: \u201cWe have the technology to build a global paradise on earth, and at the same time we have the power to end life as we know it.

Roma soccer jersey ended, and the fans at the Roma Club spilled onto the street in a sour mood.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day,\u201d said Luigi Carinci, 65, who had sat in the front row in Testaccio, the neighborhood that is the club\u2019s spiritual home, and dabbed his eyes whenever the screen showed Totti stretching his legs or sipping water on the bench. \u201cRome is a mess. The bus never comes, they don\u2019t pick up the garbage and the cops do nothing. Now Totti\u2019s leaving. It\u2019s the last thing we need.\u201dThe past decade or so has not been kind to Rome. Garbage piles up in the piazzas. The parks look like littered Iowa cornfields. The city\u2019s sputtering economy hemorrhages jobs, and the mayor\u2019s name has become a national byword for urban disaster.But at least it had Totti.The Golden Child. The Phenomenon. The Captain. The Legend. The greatest player who ever wore the Roma jersey, and one who grew up not far from the Colosseum, as a die-hard fan. He refused to leave Rome \u2014 the team or the city \u2014 no matter how much money bigger clubs threw at him. Fans, including some supporters of the rival Roman club, Lazio, called him \u201cthe symbol of Rome,\u201d \u201cthe emblem of Rome,\u201d \u201cRome.\u201d\u201cRome is a city of symbols, the pope, the Colosseum. And Totti is part of this,\u201d said Maurizio Crosetti, a sportswriter for La Repubblica, who considered Totti essential for beleaguered Romans who struggled to tell a good story about themselves. \u201cHe was something not to be ashamed of.\u201dAnd so Romans, both fans and citizens, took his departure especially hard.\u201cToday it\u2019s hard to live in Rome,\u201d said Giulio Lucarelli, whose Core de Roma restaurant, on Totti\u2019s childhood street, is essentially a shrine to the \u201cyellow and red,\u201d as the Roma team is often called because of its colors. \u201cThe image of Rome has yellowed from the vivid yellow and red of the glory days.\u201dTotti\u2019s career spanned more than 25 years. He first caught the notice of soccer aficionados at age 12 as a junior player on Roma\u2019s youth teams. He broke into the first team in 1993 at age 16, dazzling the city with his skill and imagination.And then, in 2001, he visited a miracle upon the city. With Rome already spick and span after preparations for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s Jubilee year celebrations in 2000, Totti led his club to a long elusive national championship.The city basically lost its collective mind.Totti, disguised in a bandanna and red and yellow face paint, went with Mr. Lucarelli to parties in Testaccio and at the Circus Maximus, where a million people showed up and a famous actress, in attendance at Totti\u2019s last game, performed a strip tease.\u201cRome was a more joyous city. There was enthusiasm, fun. Now it is darker, melancholy,\u201d said Alessandro Vocalelli, the editor of Corriere dello Sport. \u201cNow that Totti stops playing, many people will feel a little older, suddenly grown up.\u201dAged 40 and weathered, with a famous showgirl wife and three children, Totti had found his role diminished this season: He was usually playing as a substitute. The team\u2019s management had decided his time had come.The holder of so many records wasn\u2019t happy about it, and he made sure, with a sour Facebook post, that everyone knew he was being forced out. Mostly, however, he handled the situation with grace and humility. The papers speculated that he might move to another club in the United States or Asia, but never in Italy.\u201cWe\u2019d kill him,\u201d said Lorenzo Ciliberti, 23, who wore a No. 10 Totti jersey as he stood in a circle drinking beers in Piazza Vittorio, now overrun with homeless men and vagabonds, some of whom used its palm trees as toilets.Crimson Totti jerseys were everywhere on the afternoon of the game, as fans sidestepped pizza crusts and broken beer bottles to make pilgrimages to a 2001-vintage mural of the player pointing to the sky. They marched across the Circus Maximus, now only partly mowed, like a half shaven face.As game time approached, Sergio Rosi, 80, opened the gates of the Roma Club in Testaccio. The walls were covered in pictures of the club and of Totti through the ages. Here he was raising trophies, posing for the national team, getting married.\u201cWe Romans are all in mourning,\u201d Mr. Rosi said, pausing to yell \u201cForza Roma!\u201d (\u201cLet\u2019s go, Roma!\u201d) at the people yelling \u201cForza Roma!\u201d to him. The state of the city, he said, had made the loss that much more bitter. \u201cFor two months they didn\u2019t clean this street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe filthy animals!\u201dThe game started, with Totti on the bench. Roma, in the hunt for the second-place slot, gave up an early goal to lowly Genoa. The screen showed Totti\u2019s anguished face. Mr. Carinci dabbed his eyes in the front row.The second half started and \u2014 to some surprise, and applause \u2014 Totti entered not long after the break. Roma soon scored a go-ahead goal and Mr. Rosi rose to blast a deafening siren and pump his fists.The club members then waved disgustedly at the screen and Totti shook his head on the field after Genoa tied the match at 2-2. Then Roma scored the winning goal. With only minutes left, Totti kept control of the ball, eating up the clock by kicking the ball off the shins of his opponents and out of bounds.\u201cHe\u2019s a maestro at this,\u201d the television commentator said.After the game, Totti took a victory lap around the stadium accompanied by his wife and children, including his son, Cristian, 11, who many hope might carry his father\u2019s torch.As the theme from \u201cGladiator\u201d gave way to Elton John\u2019s \u201cCircle of Life,\u201d Totti started weeping. Bawling. So did the members of the Roma Club, old and young, men and women. They sang the chorus of the team song \u2014 \u201cRoma Roma Roma\u201d \u2014 and wept. They held their children and wept. They screamed \u201cmortacci loro\u201d and wept. One man, wearing a \u201cThere\u2019s Only One Captain\u201d shirt, wrote his son at the stadium and asked for an update.\u201cWeeping,\u201d his son\u2019s reply read.As Totti read out a letter (\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to switch off the light. Now I am afraid.\u201d) the faces of thousands of fans contorted with tearful anguish. In the club, Mr. Rosi started pouring white wine with an A.S. Roma label. \u201cI feel awful, awful,\u201d he said, from behind a small plaque that referred to Totti as the \u201cKing of Rome.\u201d \u201cNow we will realize it. That he is gone.\u201dBut not just yet. A couple of hours later, Totti and his family arrived at La Villetta, a favorite restaurant. There was a barrage of kisses from loved ones, several of whom said they had spent the game in tears.As homeless men made their beds on the sidewalk in front of Totti\u2019s old haunt, a handful of fans in No. 10 jerseys peered through the windows. Like them, Totti still wore shorts, but he had traded in his jersey for a red polo shirt.slide showAdvertisement"}

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Cheesy, Oniony Gratin That Brings a Family Together", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteThe members of the allium family can be a confusing lot.What is the difference between spring onions and regular onions? Is it still green garlic if it\u2019s purple at the bottom? And why, exactly, are leeks so much grittier than their oniony cousins?It all seems particularly perplexing in late spring, when just-plucked alliums hit the markets, arriving as verdant, more tender versions of their mature selves. This is the time to take full advantage of their youthful attractions. Treat them as vegetables rather than as seasonings, and make them the stars of the plate.In this recipe, I layer onions, leeks and green garlic into a cheesy, golden gratin covered with anchovy-laden bread crumbs. To accentuate the vegetables\u2019 sweetness, I brown them in butter before adding cream and cheese to the pan. More browning happens in the oven as the bread crumb and Parmesan topping toasts.But before you head to the market, here is what to look for:Spring onions, also called new onions, are freshly dug bulbs with taut skins, their green shoots still attached. When their skins become dry and brittle and their greens fall off, they mature into the familiar onions we find year round. While still young, they are sugary and very juicy.Green garlic, which can have a purple cast, is still just a child \u2014 a skinny, leggy stalk without the pungent head of its adulthood. Think of it as garlic lite, and use it raw or cooked, in salads, soups or saut\u00e9s, where it adds a more delicate bite than its elders.Spring leeks are dirty at heart, filled with more soil than other leeks because they\u2019ve been overwintered in the field. Farmers leave them in the ground, piling on more soil to protect them from the cold. Then, they harvest the leeks in spring, when they\u2019re sweet, richly flavored \u2014 and laced with soil. Give the leeks a thorough wash by halving them lengthwise and running them under a vigorous tap, letting the water swish away the soil trapped in their layers.And, just to set the record straight, I\u2019ve added another member of the allium clan to the pan: scallions, also called green onions. They are not the same thing as spring onions, but rather a lovely vegetable in their own right. (Don\u2019t you hate it when someone confuses you with your sister?) Everything works beautifully in this bubbling gratin, where family dynamics are at their best.cookingAdvertisement"}

He correctly asserts that there\u2019s a bias in most workshops for \u201cshowing\u201d and against \u201ctelling,\u201d but neglects to say that for most would-be writers such cautionary advice is useful.I\u2019ve taught workshops for over 35 years (albeit as a white male) and begin each class by saying a good poem or story is a very difficult thing to write, that what I hope for are forays into that murky area of excellence, and that each poem or story will create the terms by which it will be judged. A good workshop leader should be able to identify those terms and make suggestions for improvement accordingly. A bad workshop leader will likely make only cosmetic suggestions (change this word, move this line, etc., or as Nguyen suggests, be insensitive or unaware of the political or philosophical exigencies of the subject). This is not to say that a good instructor would be without biases. Nguyen certainly has his. He seems to favor the kind of writing that has the \u201ccapacity to save lives and change the world.\u201d My bias is that agenda-writing of this kind tends to lack the freshness and vitality of discovery.My larger worry is that Nguyen\u2019s thinking will justify a lot of well-intentioned yet poorly executed writing. I wish he had acknowledged that most poems and stories that emerge from a workshop, not to mention from the world beyond it, are mediocre at best. And that women and minority writers, even in hostile cultures, have burdens similar to those the rest of us have: to discover what they didn\u2019t know they knew, and to make something memorable out of whatever it is that\u2019s important to them, whether it\u2019s an act of revenge or a walk in the woods.The writer is the winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize in poetry.\u2666To the Editor:I read David Gregory\u2019s review (April 30) of \u201cMy Jewish Year,\u201d by Abigail Pogrebin, on Saturday, when I receive the Book Review. I wanted to write a response, but I couldn\u2019t until 8:37 p.m., when Shabbat ended this week here in Cherry Hill, N.J. Until then, the computer stayed off, just as it does every other week, as did the TV, the phone, the car \u2014 you name it. But what we observant Jews don\u2019t do on these days is not what makes them holy. It is what we do \u2014 and what others like us do \u2014 today and every day going back millenniums that matters most.That is what I think Gregory misses in his review, and clearly is what is missed by Pogrebin in her book. Shabbat and the Jewish holidays are punctuation marks in the sentences and paragraphs of our lives and the lives of our people. But they are not the whole story of what makes us Jews. And following a few of them for a year does not tell our story; for that, you need to commit a lifetime.The writer is Carter and Fran Pierce term chair for the liberal arts, College of Science, Health and the Liberal Arts, Philadelphia University.\u2666To the Editor:Jeanette Winterson, in her review of Harold Bloom\u2019s \u201cFalstaff: Give Me Life,\u201d cites Bloom\u2019s claim that Falstaff, in her words, \u201cexcessive, loving, outrageous, overblown, but true, stands against Hal\u2019s counterfeit,\u201d and concludes that \u201cthis new manifesto will not appeal to \u2026 ones who prefer Hal/Henry to Falstaff, the ones on the side of authority\u2026 who drain the energy out of a text and offer it back as a pale imitation of itself\u2014 a counterfeit.\u201dFalstaff is clearly the superior wit. We would be bitterly disappointed to attend a production that cut Falstaff\u2019s time on stage to provide more of the prince. But Bloom, as Winterson presents him, is claiming some sort of moral superiority, or authenticity (whatever that means), for Falstaff. This is nonsense in at least two different ways.First, the history plays, in their arc and purpose, trace the development of the wastrel prince into the hero king. And, as part of that development, Henry V rejects his old drinking buddies. We many not like Henry much (and his brother John even less) but the role of a ruler is incompatible with tolerating his old corrupt companions. We have plenty of examples in the modern world of rulers who let their families and friends play by their own rules, and it\u2019s not a pretty picture.Second, Falstaff is a liar, a thief, a sponge, a coward and, if occasion demanded, a murderer. In the wonderful monologue quoted in the review, Falstaff says a corpse is a counterfeit of a man and, for himself, he says, \u201cgive me life.\u201d But he also tells us that he took money from his yeoman soldiers as a bribe to put in their place a bunch of \u201cbeggarly\u201d \u201cscarecrows,\u201d of whom he says, \u201cThey\u2019ll fill a pit as well as better.\u201d So much for \u201clife,\u201d except for his own.We enjoy Falstaff despite his manifest faults. Bloom seems to feel it necessary to turn the faults into an overriding virtue. This does not fly.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

But he had \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about seeing the frog in a coffin.\u201cThis meme is almost like Elvis,\u201d he said. \u201cElvis lives on, and Pepe is going to live on regardless of whether we put him in a casket in a cartoon.\u201dBut by that point, Pepe had already begun to lose his chill. His image had been shared widely in 2015, and in October of that year, Donald Trump tweeted a cartoon that appeared to be a mash-up of himself and Pepe.\u201cBut as the meme proliferated in online venues such as 4chan, 8chan and Reddit, a subset of memes came into existence promoting anti-Jewish, bigoted and offensive ideas. And those have spread virally on Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere.\u201dThe statement noted that Pepe was sometimes depicted with a mustache like the one worn by Adolf Hitler, and in a white hood like those worn by members of the Ku Klux Klan.\u201cIt\u2019s completely insane that Pepe has been labeled a symbol of hate, and that racists and anti-Semites are using a once peaceful frog-dude from my comic book as an icon of hate,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare, and the only thing I can do is see this as an opportunity to speak out against hate.\u201dApparently, that didn\u2019t work. So Mr. Furie went for the kill.\u201cI can\u2019t lose hope that this is not the final resting place for this character,\u201d said Mr. Segal of the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cI would hate to think that the last word is one of hate.\u201dIn the single-page strip released on Saturday, Pepe is shown in an open coffin, with his three friends standing over him.Landwolf twists open a small bottle of alcohol and pours some over Pepe\u2019s inert face \u2014 an irreverent tribute for a character Mr. Reynolds described as \u201ca laconic stoner frog who just wanted to hang out and enjoy his friends and snack.\u201dAll of the artists featured in the Fantagraphics anthology were asked to contribute statements, and Mr. Furie\u2019s was brief. \u201c \u2018Boy\u2019s Club\u2019 is about friendship,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are all going to die, so remember to treat your friends nicely and give them lots of hugs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has an interest (directly or indirectly) in a large number of tech companies \u2014 including several firms to which he refers, and those that both partner with and compete against them.Advertisement"}

Speaking to the BBC, she also said the bomb \u201cwas more sophisticated than some of the attacks we\u2019ve seen before.\u201dChief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said, \u201cThere\u2019s an extensive investigation going on, and activity taking place across Greater Manchester.\u201dAt least 64 people were wounded, a third of them critically. Many victims were teenagers and young girls, with parents in tow, who idolized Ms. Grande.She officially canceled all concerts on her \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d European tour through June 5 and asked fans to support \u201call those families affected by this cowardice and senseless act of violence.\u201dIn Libya, Mr. Abedi\u2019s father was arrested by a militia, the Special Deterrence Forces, which said it also had detained Mr. Abedi\u2019s younger brother, Hashem Abedi, 20.The militia said that Hashem Abedi had traveled from Britain to Libya on April 16, that he had been planning an attack in Tripoli and that he had been in daily contact by phone with his older brother.The militia\u2019s claims about the younger brother could not be immediately verified. The militia is affiliated with the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord, one of three administrations vying for control of Libya, but it has been accused by human rights groups of abusing prisoners.A look in and around the scene of the terror attack.In Washington, a senior American official said Mr. Abedi had links to a radical preacher in Libya identified as Abdul Baset Ghwela, whose son had joined the Islamic State in Libya and had died fighting in Benghazi. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose intelligence information, said Mr. Abedi had not left Libya until May 17.In addition, officials were looking into reports that people who knew Mr. Abedi \u2014 including an imam at his mosque \u2014 had contacted the authorities as early as 2015 with concerns that he may have been recruited by extremists.The heightened warning of additional, possibly imminent attacks was visible nationwide. The government suspended public tours of Parliament and canceled the guard-changing ceremony at Buckingham Palace, a tourist favorite. Soldiers patrolled locations including Downing Street, where the home and office of the prime minister are, and foreign embassies.Many Libyan expatriates are clustered in Manchester, creating one of the largest Libyan communities outside Libya, according to Nazir Afzal, who until 2015 was the chief prosecutor for northwest England, based in the city.Among them was the Abedi family, which moved to Britain in 1993. Salman Abedi was born there a year later.Reached by phone in Libya on Wednesday, Ramadan Abedi, his father, expressed shock and denied that his son was the bomber.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it was him,\u201d he said. \u201cHis ideas and his ideology were not like that.\u201dThe father\u2019s account was contradicted by several people who knew the family, including one quoted by the BBC who said Salman Abedi had expressed approval of suicide bombers a few years ago, leading neighbors to call an antiterrorism hotline.The French interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, said on Wednesday that Mr. Abedi had \u201cmost likely\u201d gone to Syria and that he had \u201cproven\u201d links to the Islamic State.Mr. Abedi\u2019s parents, who moved back to Libya after Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s downfall, had become worried about their son\u2019s radicalization, and they had even seized his British passport, according to a friend in Manchester who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety.Mr. Abedi had told his parents that he wanted to visit the holy city of Mecca, so they returned his passport. But instead he returned home, the friend said.The father denied that account. \u201cHe was a man and I trust the man that he was,\u201d he said. A short while later, the father was arrested in Tripoli, according to the same Islamist militia that announced the younger brother\u2019s arrest.A number of Libyans from Manchester have waged jihad abroad, according to Raffaello Pantucci, a terrorism expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The Qaeda-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group had a contingent in Manchester, Mr. Pantucci said. And in 2010 and 2011, as the anti-Qaddafi uprising in Libya intensified, a number of Libyan-Britons left Manchester for Libya as foreign fighters, he said. More recently, he said, a cluster left for Syria.In Fallowfield, a neighborhood south of the Manchester city center, residents recalled Mr. Abedi as quiet, respectful and passionate about soccer, often wearing a T-shirt with a Manchester United emblem.\u201cThe horrific atrocity that occurred in Manchester on Monday night has shocked us all,\u201d a mosque trustee, Fawzi Haffar, told reporters.In 2015, according to a neighbor who spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about safety, an imam at the mosque, Mohammed Saeed, delivered a sermon condemning terrorism for political causes. The sermon prompted a heated discussion among congregants and some, including Mr. Abedi, objected to it.\u201cHe was angry,\u201d the neighbor said. \u201cHe scared some people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted one of the given names of a Libyan preacher who knew the Manchester bomber.

That led to lawsuits, boycotts and the cancellation of conventions and concerts in Arizona.Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the same would come of the Texas law.By signing the bill, Mr. Abbott has \u201csubjected Texas businesses tied to trade or tourism to incalculable losses and exposed the state\u2019s taxpayers to substantial costs related to multiple statewide and local challenges to this inhumane law,\u201d Mr. Saenz said in a statement.Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said in a statement that the organization planned to fight the law.Republican officials in Texas have spoken out for months against local law enforcement officers who fail to cooperate with federal immigration guidelines.Mr. Abbott, in particular, has been critical of two Hispanic sheriffs, and he canceled state criminal-justice grants to Travis County over the issue.Under Texas\u2019 law, jurisdictions and officials that fail to comply could face fines of up to $25,500 per day, ejection from office and a misdemeanor charge.

The analysis, which was based on a review of millions of Twitter messages related to the election since last summer, showed that more than one-third of posts linked to certain political hashtags originated from the United States, although few went viral in France.Their efforts have fallen flat in France, with memes often written in English and extremist photos and images that do not resonate with the French electorate. American-style fake news and other digital misinformation have also failed to gain traction in France, where its own domestic issues and ways of campaigning still dominate.The muted response in France could portend a similar response by voters in Britain and Germany when they head to the polls later this year in their own national elections.While international activists have found it difficult to break into the French political discourse, local campaigners, often from the country\u2019s own far right, have had more success.While muted, American-style fake news has also made an appearance.Still, for many in France, such outright fake news stories have been met merely with Gallic shrugs. And the digital tactics of international campaigners have been even less effective.In part, that is because alt-right activists from the United States and beyond have copied the movement\u2019s American extremist images and language without tweaking them to entice the French electorate.In the last two weeks, far-right activists have created multiple memes attacking Mr. Macron \u2014 complete with captions and hashtags written in English.

He suggested raising the curbs and putting in speed bumps.Osama Khattan, 62, a sketch artist from the Upper West Side who works in the area, said the city should close the area to cars completely. But in general, he said, he felt safe.As does Maria Cruz, 56, of Washington Heights, who hands out fliers in Times Square for Lazzara\u2019s Pizza.\u201cYou can\u2019t be scared and live here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you did, you would never get out of bed.\u201dHow safe do you feel walking around Times Square?

In March, he was found guilty on multiple charges.Mr. Temer has confirmed meeting at his official residence in March with Joesley Batista, the magnate at the helm of the JBS food processing company who was said to have made the recording and delivered it to prosecutors as part of a plea deal. But Mr. Temer denied authorizing hush payments.In a televised address on Thursday, Mr. Temer was defiant in rejecting calls to resign. He raised his voice and appeared under stress as he contended that efforts to mend Brazil\u2019s economy could be put at risk if he stepped down.\u201cI will not resign,\u201d Mr. Temer said emphatically. \u201cI did not buy anyone\u2019s silence.\u201dBut the newest scandal around Mr. Temer appears to be more destabilizing, raising the possibility of even greater turmoil in Brazil. The Supreme Court authorized on Thursday an investigation of the president. Adding to the pressure on Mr. Temer, the country\u2019s economy remains weak after enduring a harrowing decline and surging unemployment, despite tepid signs of recovery.Critics of the beleaguered president have been organizing street protests calling for direct elections, a prospect feared by some allies of Mr. Temer over the potential for figures like Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a leftist and former president, to capitalize on the political tumult.Mr. Neves, a top ally of Mr. Temer, was a key figure in the latest revelations, with Globo describing how Mr. Neves asked for about $600,000 in bribes to pay for legal fees.

But his affinity for what looks best didn\u2019t stop him from falling for a man who showed up on his East Village doorstep one night dressed as the country singer Reba McEntire.Mr. Moeller had been on two dates with Tobin Summers in fall 2010 when Mr. Summers, fresh from a Halloween party, rang his East Village doorbell late at night.\u201cI opened the door and there he was, dressed as Reba,\u201d Mr. Moeller said. \u201cI said, \u2018How about you change?\u2019 He said, \u2018Is that how you greet a country music legend?\u2019 To this day he makes me laugh hysterically.\u201dIf a sense of humor was essential in bringing together Mr. Moeller, 37, and Mr. Summers, 32, a shared sense of what the future should look like has kept them together. That and maybe some duct tape, drywall adhesive and the sort of patience that comes with renovating a very old house.Mr. Summers made the first move. \u201cI was making eyes at Michael across the bar, and Michael averted his eyes,\u201d he said. But Mr. Summers, a boyishly handsome Texan, was not easily discouraged: \u201cI came up to him and asked him if I could buy him a drink.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Mr. Moeller responded.That \u201cwhy\u201d represented a wariness that had built up over the last few years from a series of one-off dates and a few long-term, but ultimately unsatisfying, relationships.\u201cYou know, I had just turned 30, and I had spent all of my 20s in New York working in different jobs and living in different places with roommates,\u201d said Mr. Moeller, who grew up in a large family in Westtown, N.Y. But now, \u201cI had a good job and was in my own apartment, without roommates, and I was really happy with myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI was done trying so hard at dating. I wanted to do things my way.\u201dMr. Moeller and Mr. Summers eventually left the party together, and they agreed to meet for a first date at a West Village restaurant a few days later.It went terribly.\u201cHe proceeded to talk business the whole time, and specifically mentioned some companies he\u2019d love to work for that I had worked for in the past,\u201d Mr. Moeller said. That caused him to worry that Mr. Summers was just interested in making use of his design-world connections.\u201cI was convinced this guy was all about networking,\u201d Mr. Moeller said, \u201cso we left with a cordial, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll see you around.\u2019\u201dThe next day, Mr. Moeller left with a friend for what he called \u201ca big gay cruise\u201d around Mexico. \u201cI forgot all about Tobin on that cruise,\u201d he said. When he returned, Mr. Summers\u2019s Facebook friend request awaited him.He suddenly realized that, before the awful first date and the party in Brooklyn, he had internet-stalked Mr. Summers after reading his profile on social media. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This is the kind of guy I need to date,\u201d Mr. Moeller said. \u201cHe had a good job, a nice family, and he seemed really normal.\u201dMr. Moeller accepted the friend request and agreed to a second date, which did not go terribly.\u201cI quickly called him out on how my connections to the places he would love to work for were long gone,\u201d Mr. Moeller said. \u201cHe laughed at me, told me he\u2019d never seen \u2018Design Star,\u2019 and that he was sorry he came across the way he did. I felt like a narcissistic ass. But we brushed it off, and it turned into a romantic, sweet, getting-to-know-each-other night.\u201dThen came Reba. Nine months after that, Mr. Summers, who was then living with a roommate in Chelsea, again showed up unannounced on Mr. Moeller\u2019s doorstep, this time with a bunch of boxes and an ultimatum.\u201cEither I\u2019m moving in with you or I\u2019m breaking up with you,\u201d Mr. Summers said.\u201cI remember him sitting me down,\u201d Mr. Summers said, \u201cand saying he didn\u2019t want to go forward. I thought it was over, that he didn\u2019t want to get married. I was devastated.\u201dMr. Moeller quickly explained that they could cut costs by making use of their own design skills, both with the house renovations and wedding.Mr. Summers was reassured: \u201cI trust him so much and know that he makes everything he touches beautiful. So we made the decision.\u201dThey closed on the house in August 2016, and drove from Manhattan to Hudson many weekends to work on a variety of projects, not limited to removing old linoleum and wallpaper and applying fresh coats of paint.Just before Mr. Summers\u2019s parents, Mary and Ed Summers, were expected to arrive from Houston for the holidays last year, the pipes froze and a leak sprouted in the kitchen ceiling.The couple took days off work, found a friend who could drywall the ceiling and regrouped. By the time Mr. Summers pulled up to the house with his parents and their suitcases, a Christmas tree was in place and Mr. Moeller was freshly showered after a rapid-fire cleanup job. \u201cI was wearing a towel and holding a Swiffer in my hand when they walked in,\u201d he said.A new wedding date was set for April 29 at the Greenpoint Loft in Brooklyn, a former rope factory with exposed pipes and brick walls.When Mr. Moeller called his mother, Cathie Lane, who lives in Milford, Pa., he told her that they now planned a do-it-yourself wedding. She took a deep breath and asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cMichael and Tobin are so stubborn,\u201d Ms. Lane said. \u201cThey have to have everything just perfect. And I liked the idea of them being able to just write a check at the end of their wedding instead of having to figure out every tiny detail themselves.\u201dThe couple welcomed 154 guests to the wedding and reception, having made all the arrangements themselves: from the flowers and garland to the chairs and tables that friends had helped them haul up to the space. As a finishing touch, they put a white sheet over the altar, attaching it to the factory\u2019s original pulleys. After the ceremony, the sheet was lifted to reveal a sweeping view of Manhattan at dusk.Instead of the traditional ceremony first, party after, friends and family mingled over a cocktail reception before the service, officiated by Julia Lange-Kessler, a friend of the couple.Their vows touched on their year of renovations.\u201cThis past year renovating our house together was a crazy bonding experience,\u201d Mr. Summers said. \u201cTo me, it symbolizes a key lesson of marriage: There will always be something to work on!\u201dBut during the entire reception, nary a note by Reba McEntire was heard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Town Gathers to Grieve for Teenager Fatally Shot by Officer", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byMESQUITE, Tex. \u2014 Many of those who filed into a church here on Saturday for the funeral of Jordan Edwards wore suits and formal attire. But some of the teenagers \u2014 classmates and teammates of Jordan, the unarmed black 15-year-old shot and killed a week ago by a white police officer in nearby Balch Springs \u2014 wore white and maroon Skeeter football jerseys.Jordan was a Skeeter, too \u2014 a freshman on the football team at Mesquite High School, home to its mosquito-themed mascot.For Balch Springs, a working-class suburb of 25,000 southeast of Dallas, the shooting has threatened to widen the divide between the majority-white police force and the community\u2019s black and Latino residents.In recent years, a number of black residents have accused officers of using excessive force and have sued the department in federal court for civil rights violations, but many of those cases have been dismissed. And although the city is majority black and Hispanic, only a handful of the department\u2019s nearly 40 police officers are either black or Hispanic.\u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Cedric W. Davis Sr., 50, who served as the city\u2019s first black mayor from 2008 to 2009 and is a former school-district police chief. \u201cYou can\u2019t represent a community as diverse as this one if you don\u2019t have anybody that can relate. They do some good work. But a lot of the people are afraid of them. They need to be more customer friendly. The persona is, \u2018I\u2019m not approachable.\u2019\u201dMr. Davis recalled, from his time as mayor, a conversation he had with the white police chief about a newly hired black officer. \u201cHe said, \u2018Man, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it. He speaks ebonics. You need to take him under your wing and show him how to talk.\u2019\u201d Mr. Davis said he was stunned.Still, Mr. Davis said he did not believe the shooting of Jordan was about race. He said he had met Mr. Oliver at community events and found him to be a deeply religious person. \u201cYou only have two seconds to make a life decision,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cHe made the wrong decision in two seconds.\u201dThe current police chief, Jonathan Haber, has praised the conduct of his other officers after the shooting.\u201cThey didn\u2019t go hide,\u201d the chief said. \u201cThey went to go interact with the community. That\u2019s who they\u2019re here for.\u201d He added, \u201cWe have an honest relationship with our community.\u201dA police spokesman, Officer Pedro Gonzalez, said the department has had difficulty recruiting black and Hispanic officers because of a lack of resources, and because of better pay offered by nearby departments.\u201cWe\u2019re a 35-, 37-man department, and we don\u2019t have money to recruit,\u201d Officer Gonzalez said. \u201cWe recruit through Facebook. Our top-out pay is like $68,000. Mesquite, which is right next door, makes $78,000. It\u2019s very difficult to recruit.\u201dRelatives who spoke at the funeral were joined by the mayor of Balch Springs, Carrie Marshall, who is black and who expressed support for the family.One of Jordan\u2019s schoolmates who attended the service, 16-year-old Anton Smith, talked with reporters afterward, and said his peers have little trust in the police.\u201cNobody in the community trusts the police because of what they have been doing,\u201d the teenager said, standing outside the church. \u201cAny small incident with them can just escalate from zero to 100 real quick.\u201dS. Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing the Edwards family, also spoke after the funeral and said: \u201cThe charges were big relief for the family.\u201dAlthough the family said that they do not see Jordan as a martyr, Mr. Merritt said the parents do believe his death has become part of the nation\u2019s struggles and debates over police shootings.\u201cThey actually do believe that he is a symbol of police brutality in the country,\u201d he said.Patrick McGee reported from Mesquite, Tex., and Manny Fernandez from Houston.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foot Soldiers in a Shadowy Battle Between Russia and the West", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byMELNIK, Czech Republic \u2014 Working at his computer, as he does most weekends, on an anti-Western diatribe for a Czech website, Ladislav Kasuka was not sure what to make of the messages that began popping up on his Facebook page, offering him money to organize street protests.\u201cDo you need help?\u201d read the first message, written in Russian, from a person he did not know. This was followed, in a mix of Russian and garbled Czech, by gushing encouragement for street demonstrations and increasingly specific offers of cash.An initial payment of 300 euros ($368) was offered for Mr. Kasuka, a penniless Czech Stalinist, to buy flags and other paraphernalia for a protest rally in Prague, the Czech capital, against the NATO alliance and the pro-Western government in Ukraine. Later, he was offered \u20ac500 ($558) to buy a video camera, film the action and post the video online. Other small sums were also proposed.\u201cIt was all a bit unusual, so I was surprised,\u201d Mr. Kasuka recalled in a recent interview at a shopping mall north of Prague where he works on security and maintenance.He decided the cash \u201cwas for a good cause\u201d \u2014 halting the spread of NATO and capitalist Western ways into the formerly communist lands of Eastern Europe \u2014 so he accepted.The strange relationship that followed, consisting of passionate social media exchanges about politics and a total of \u20ac1,500 in cash transfers, was one of many forged across Eastern and Central Europe in summer 2014. They were part of a frenetic, though often clumsy, influence campaign financed from Moscow and directed by Alexander Usovsky, a Belarus-born writer, Russian-nationalist agitator and ideological hired gun in a shadowy battle for hearts and minds between Russia and the West.Compared with Russia\u2019s supposed meddling in the recent presidential elections in France and the United States, the activities of Mr. Kasuka and those like him are of little consequence. He belongs firmly to the fringe of Czech politics, and has never aspired to any higher office than local councilor in Melnik, the town north of Prague where he lives with his girlfriend in a graffiti-smeared housing block.Mr. Usovsky\u2019s focus was on marginal political players in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, and his efforts mostly fell flat. The protests organized by Mr. Kasuka and others attracted only handfuls of people. Pro-Russian websites that Mr. Usovsky helped to set up all fizzled. A Polish politician he was in touch with, Mateusz Piskorski, was arrested last year on suspicion of spying for Russia.None of that seemed to deter Mr. Usovsky, who was still pitching wild plans and detailed budgets to potential backers in Moscow early this year.After Mr. Usovsky managed to orchestrate only a few tiny demonstrations in Prague, Warsaw and other cities, an assistant to Mr. Malofeev demanded in October 2014 that Mr. Usovsky produce \u201ca clear, concrete and realistic plan for the coming to power of pro-Russian forces.\u201dMr. Malofeev declined to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman, Nadezhda Novoselova, said the billionaire and his staff had nothing to do with Mr. Usovsky.Mr. Malofeev has acquired a reputation as the Kremlin\u2019s version of George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire whom pro-Western forces across Eastern Europe often turn to for money. Unlike Mr. Soros, though, the wealthy Russians who support activists abroad generally try to keep their roles and spending secret. That allows the Kremlin to keep its distance as well.Mr. Malofeev has in the past insisted he supported only humanitarian work, not political trouble-making.Reports that Russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to meddle in the American election have persuaded many that Moscow runs a sophisticated influence machine. But interviews with several of Mr. Usovsky\u2019s collaborators, and the contents of his hacked computer, suggest that it was at times a more shambolic affair, hampered by money squabbles, intramural rivalries and absurdly distorted views of how politics works outside Russia.Jakub Janda, deputy director of European Values, a Western-financed research group in Prague that has tracked Russian influence campaigns, said that Mr. Usovsky seemed so far out of touch with reality that he might even be \u201ca decoy\u201d meant to make people say, \u201cLook, this whole Russia threat thing is just not serious.\u201dOthers, though, see Mr. Usovsky as evidence of Russia\u2019s mastery of plausible deniability and its willingness to bet on opportunists, no matter how slim their chances of success.Mr. Usovsky \u201cis a good case study in Russian methods,\u201d said Daniel Milo, a former official of the Slovakian Interior Ministry who is now an expert on extremism at Globsec, a research group in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. \u201cHe is a small cog in a big industry,\u201d Mr. Milo said. \u201cThere may be dozens more.\u201dMr. Usovsky declined to be interviewed for this article without being paid. But in response to emailed questions, he confirmed that his computer had been hacked, and he did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked messages.A resident of Vitebsk, near the Russian border with Belarus, Mr. Usovsky started his operation in 2014, riding a wave of nationalist fervor in Moscow after the annexation of Crimea and the widespread belief among Russia\u2019s political and business elite that united European backing for sanctions against Russia could be quickly dissolved.He set up a network of websites in various languages to promote Slavic unity, rented an office in Bratislava and established a sham foundation nominally dedicated to promoting culture.Asked by email how much money he had received from sponsors in Moscow, Mr. Usovsky initially denied receiving any. Then, when he was sent a copy of a message he had written in October 2014 detailing \u20ac100,000 he received to finance the \u201cpreparatory stage\u201d of his work in Eastern Europe, he stopped responding to inquiries.Other messages taken from his computer by hackers suggest that the money came from Mr. Malofeev. Mr. Usovsky badgered Mr. Malofeev\u2019s assistant for hundreds of thousands more euros in late 2014 and 2015, to finance pro-Russian candidates in Polish elections.Though he never even came close to bringing any pro-Russian groups to power, Mr. Usovsky was able to identify partners in Eastern and Central Europe ready to accept his help. He also showed a grasp of the internet\u2019s power to amplify fringe voices and make thinly attended demonstrations seem like major dramas. He worked closely with state-controlled Russian news outlets to ensure that the activities of his Czech, Slovak and Polish collaborators received extensive coverage.\u201cIt is totally crazy,\u201d said Roman Maca, an analyst based in Prague. \u201cPerviy Kanal presents as serious news a protest by 10 or so people who are mostly ready for the psychological hospital.\u201d He said Mr. Kasuka had become \u201cone of the best known Czechs in Russia, after our hockey players.\u201dOne person Mr. Usovsky did not want in the limelight, however, was himself. When a Slovak group, Peaceful Warrior, wanted to thank him publicly at a rally for his financial support, he swiftly vetoed the idea.After Mr. Malofeev, his main backer, cooled on his ambitious but unrealistic political plans, Mr. Usovsky grew increasingly desperate for money. He told Mr. Malofeev\u2019s assistant in March 2015 that his \u201cPolish friends\u201d needed \u20ac292,700 ($327,000) to win seats in Parliament. He also asked for \u20ac10,000 ($11,175) for Jobbik, a far-right Hungarian party, and \u20ac3,000 more for a neo-fascist paramilitary group called the Hungarian Guard.Apparently rebuffed by Mr. Malofeev, he peppered other prospective Russian donors with detailed plans for a \u201cpro-Russian fifth column,\u201d claiming that he could destroy \u201cEurope\u2019s anti-Russian front\u201d by channeling money to politicians who opposed NATO and the European Union. Among them were the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, headed by a former intelligence officer, and Konstantin Zatulin, a hard-line member of the Russian Parliament.Short of funds, Mr. Usovsky looked to Mr. Kasuka, the Czech Stalinist, as a low-cost project that could keep him in the game. Unlike Mr. Usovsky\u2019s Polish partners, Mr. Kasuka was not constantly asking for money, and had even turned some down when he ran for a seat on the Melnik town council in 2014.But Mr. Kasuka lost interest in street politics. Though he is still in touch with Mr. Usovsky on social media, he says he now concentrates on his writings about the risk of war, Stalin\u2019s achievements and the misery caused by capitalist exploitation.\u201cIt does not matter to me whether money comes from the Kremlin or from America, so long as it helps the cause,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the idea.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about Russian proxy support for fringe political figures in Central and Eastern Europe referred incorrectly to requests made to the office of a Russian billionaire for money to finance pro-Russian politicians in Polish elections. The requests came directly from Alexander Usovsky, a Belarus-born writer and agitator, not from an assistant.An article on Monday about Russian proxy support for fringe political figures in Central and Eastern Europe misstated the surname of an analyst who criticized extensive Russian media coverage of a small pro-Russia demonstration in Prague. He is Roman Maca, not Mica.Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow, Hana de Goeij from Prague, and Miroslava Germanova from Bratislava, Slovakia.Advertisement"}

Not that here\u2019s a whole lot \u2014 we\u2019re in the spring doldrums. Everybody has one foot in vacation, so basically very little is happening in the industry we cover.If he is running for office (maybe, probably, not) then we still have no idea what his platform would be. I saw some people tweeting (cough, Mike) that it seemed as though he wanted to say more. I think this seemed pretty standard for Zuckerberg, in that he limits his public comments to what will offend the least number of people. It would be fascinating to see him take a strong political stance.At this point, Facebook arguably has the wealth and political sway of a medium-size country (in which Zuckerberg never has to worry about getting re-elected). It\u2019s standing at the center of a lot, and yet its users rarely get insight into what its managers are thinking about the world.But I wonder if the car companies are getting a little too paranoid about self-driving tech. I think the tech will come, but it is, at best, in the research stage now, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many years it will take to go mainstream. I suspect we\u2019re at the top of the hype cycle right now, and soon we\u2019ll all begin to see the limits of self-driving \u2014 and the story will change to one of pessimism rather than optimism. What do you think?All that being said, I think the technology is inevitable, at least here in the U.S. It\u2019s going to be a long time until the developing world sees the widespread use of self-driving cars.Last year, when I was in Indonesia, I spoke to Google engineers about how hard it is to get accurate maps in much of the rest of the world, where streets don\u2019t really have standard names, and directions are given through landmarks, rather than blocks and feet. Until they sort that out, I can\u2019t see self-driving cars realistically getting rolled out.I like to go through life assuming that everything \u2014 from my Facebook messages to my emails and photos \u2014 will one day get hacked into. If I don\u2019t want it public, I don\u2019t write it down, photograph it, or otherwise save it to any system that is hooked up to the big bad world through the internet. I\u2019m willing to accept that I\u2019m paranoid, but the way that the rate and scale of hackings are exponentially increasing, I think it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.To me, the big issue is that the rules of the game are changing. Nation states are experimenting more with what they can get away with in the world of cyberespionage, disinformation campaigns and overall mischief-making online. That\u2019s what I\u2019m paying the most attention to.Advertisement"}

Last Sunday, no other temples turned up at a meeting intended to encourage others to become sanctuary congregations. Even within their own temple, only a few undocumented immigrants have come forward to begin talking about their status, though more worship there, members said.\u201cI\u2019m positive it\u2019s the fear,\u201d said Davanie Singhroy, who is helping lead the temple\u2019s efforts. \u201cNo one wants to come forward for fear they are making themselves more visible.\u201dSanctuary congregations pledge to protect and stand with immigrants facing deportation by providing legal, emotional and practical support and, as a last resort, by sheltering them in their basements and rectories. Yet nearly all of the publicly declared congregations are Christian and Jewish.\u201cThe reality is that among mosques and temples, and immigrant-led congregations as a whole, there is oftentimes more hesitancy, because of the concern that they may become targets themselves, whether for ICE or hate groups,\u201d said the Rev. Noel Andersen, the national grass-roots organizer for Church World Service and an organizer of the movement, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Ms. Schaper called the temple\u2019s stance \u201cvery brave.\u201dFor mosques, the challenge of joining the movement has been particularly intense, given the persistence of suspicion about Islam nationally and the targeting of Muslims by law enforcement and immigration orders.\u201cThe other imams feel that if they shelter a criminal, they could be treated by law as hiding a terrorist,\u201d Cheikh Ahmed Mbacke, the executive director, said. \u201cThey are very vulnerable and one of the biggest targets of law enforcement. It\u2019s not that easy for anyone to bring that heat on themselves.\u201d\u201cThere are many mosques working with local immigrant communities and undocumented folks,\u201d said one of the public signatories, Imam Omar Suleiman, the founder of the Yaqeen Institute of Islamic Research near Dallas. \u201cBut for issues of safety, mosques are being cautious about public declaration for good reason.\u201d\u201cWithin 48 hours, I received myself about 75 death threats, via text messages and Facebook,\u201d said Imam Ismaeel Chartier, the mosque\u2019s spiritual leader. The declaration in January, and accompanying fear, caused an internal conflict and soon led to the election of a more conservative, older board.\u201cWe are a community largely comprised of immigrants and undocumented immigrants, and we were worried that this step would bring attention to our congregants who are undocumented,\u201d said Ms. Singhroy, 22, a temple and Sadhana member. \u201cBut in the end we decided those are the very people we were going to help by taking this step.\u201dPandit Manoj announced the temple\u2019s decision on March 19 in front of a packed sanctuary, a glittering array of idols and a photograph of his late guru, Shree Prakash Gossai. \u201cLet the mandirs, the temples, be a place where people can come to feel comforted, protected and feel some sense of worth within their life,\u201d he said.Because the temple\u2019s space is small and can accommodate only about 150 worshipers, there is no room to physically house an undocumented immigrant, members said. So for now, sanctuary means they will serve as a safe space and resource hub for any undocumented immigrants seeking assistance.Last Sunday, the temple\u2019s leaders expressed some frustration that no other temples had turned up at their outreach meeting, which was attended by about 20 people. Six speakers, including Ravi Ragbir, an organizer of the New Sanctuary Coalition, were there for the occasion.\u201cHow do you think we can get other temples to jump on the boat with us, and hold hands with us?\u201d asked Ravina Jadubans, 34, the pandit\u2019s wife. \u201cBecause we are having a very hard time to have other community members step up. Our mandir is small right now, but we are filled with lots of love. There are temples who are huge who do not want to step up with us.\u201dMr. Ragbir said: \u201cYou have to answer the question of fear, because the first thing they are going to say is, \u2018If I join this, are my members going to be targeted?\u2019 And do we have an answer for that?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she said.\u201cWe do,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe at New Sanctuary, we do.\u201d\u201cAnd we are together now,\u201d said Sunita Viswanath, a founder of Sadhana and the moderator of the meeting.Advertisement"}

While it may not yet have achieved the popularity of the taco or the pizza, the Jamaican beef patty is expanding its reach.It has made its way out of Jamaican kitchens and bakeries, to immigrant enclaves and bodegas, and into major retailers like Walmart and Costco. The New York City school system served more than three million during the 2016 fiscal year.Mr. Logan, who is from Lawrence, was introduced to Caribbean cuisine long before he opened his restaurant in September, but it is relatively new to many of his customers, so his menu also includes Caribbean tacos and jerk chicken egg rolls \u2014 the \u201cAmericanized items,\u201d he calls them.\u201cMost of my experience from Jamaican food comes from George,\u201d Mr. Logan said. He recalled the first time he tried the island food. It was seasoned red snapper, a baptism of the taste buds. \u201cI fell in love,\u201d he said.The chain\u2019s menu includes meals typically found in Jamaican dining rooms \u2014 rice and peas, brown stew chicken, curry chicken \u2014 but the biggest sellers continue to be the beef patties.About 10 years ago, Golden Krust was producing around 30 million patties annually. Now, having expanded into the retail market, it produces more than 50 million a year and supplies patties to around 20,000 outlets across the United States.\u201cWe believe in the power of the patty,\u201d Mr. Hawthorne said.Customers can add mozzarella and pepperoni for an additional 50 cents a topping. \u201cSome people ask us to put tomato and lettuce, and I won\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a burger.\u201dThe beef patty may have stayed a household secret if it weren\u2019t for Zoe Bruce, who was raised in Manchester, a parish in Jamaica.\u201cPeople would gather there after work,\u201d Mr. Bruce said of his family\u2019s business, which built its reputation on having the best beef patties in Jamaica.\u201cWhen you pull it open, it was full of meat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could eat it with a fork.\u201dHe would not disclose his family\u2019s secret recipe, but he said annatto, beef suet and all-natural beef were basic ingredients of all beef patties of the time.The annatto, a red seed boiled in butter or oil before being folded into the minced meat, gave the spices an earthy balance.\u201cBruce\u2019s was the trailblazer,\u201d he said, adding that until his family\u2019s shop, most beef patties were made in home kitchens.\u201cBruce\u2019s commercialized it,\u201d he said. \u201cBruce\u2019s stood out.\u201dAfter some time, larger competitors like Tastee and Juici Patties began to take hold of the market and industrialized the process. While a shop like Bruce\u2019s could produce 2,000 handmade patties a day, a machine could produce that number within an hour. Unable to get the money for new equipment, Bruce\u2019s faded into the background, closing its doors in 1992.\u201cAfter another 10 years, you won\u2019t hear the name Bruce,\u201d he said. \u201cThe name has died, or is dying quick.\u201dMr. Bruce\u2019s voice filled with pride as he spoke of a time long ago, when the Jamaican beef patty was arguably tastier, the dough was more pliable and less flaky, and the island nation was economically stronger, before the violence and upheaval of the 1970s.\u201cThese were people of means, not poor people coming to look for any job,\u201d Mr. Bryan said at his home in Boynton Beach, Fla.Earlier Jamaican immigrants were largely farmers and domestic workers, he said. But this newer group, he pointed out, had more money and resources, and had an appetite for its comfort foods.\u201cThey tried to get their jerk seasonings, the scallions or the thyme, the spices from Jamaica,\u201d he said. An economic pipeline between America and Jamaica began to emerge, this time with a population that could support it.When the bakery opened, it was the only beef patty shop in the area. Now, several competitors sit within a two-mile radius. A Golden Krust is a mile north.For now, his typical customers are first- and second-generation Jamaicans who want a beef patty that not only tastes homemade, but is also like the ones made back at home.\u201cThe younger generation will see a patty at a gas station or at school, and they\u2019ll eat it,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a patty, like a burger, they\u2019ll eat it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On Wednesday afternoon, it reported another quarter of huge growth, with nearly 2 billion people actively using the service and revenue up 49 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago.But with the company\u2019s vast reach has come another kind of problem: Facebook is becoming too big for its computer algorithms and relatively small team of employees and contractors to manage the trillions of posts on its social network.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner \u2014 whether that\u2019s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.\u201d He offered no details on what would change.Despite Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s pledge to do a better job in screening content, many Facebook users did not seem to believe that much would change. Hundreds of commenters on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s post related personal experiences of reporting inappropriate content to Facebook that the company declined to remove.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at University of North Carolina who studies online speech issues, said that Facebook designed Live to notify your friends automatically about a live feed \u2014 something guaranteed to appeal to publicity seekers of all sorts.\u201cIt was pretty clear to me that this would lead to on-camera suicides, murder, abuse, torture,\u201d she said. \u201cThe F.B.I. did a pretty extensive study of school shooters: The infamy part is a pretty heavy motivator.\u201dFacebook has no intention of dialing back its promotion of video, including Live, telling investors on a conference call Wednesday that it would continue to rank it high in users\u2019 news feeds and add more advertising within live videos and clips.Advertising is Facebook\u2019s lifeblood, accounting for most of the company\u2019s revenue and profit. In the first quarter, the company earned $3.1 billion, up 76 percent from the previous year.Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, said that all the negative publicity about Facebook\u2019s problems with horrific content and fake news appears to have hurt user satisfaction levels. Adding more content monitors is aimed at reassuring Facebook\u2019s 1.94 billion users, she said.\u201cIf people feel safe on Facebook, they will be more engaged and will use it more often,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cAnd if they use it more often, there will be more inventory for advertising.\u201dThe company is trying to strike a balance between censorship and free speech. Facebook video has been used to share millions of personal stories and to document events of immense public interest, such as a series of police shootings of unarmed black men that sparked a national conversation about race and law enforcement.\u201cAll policies need to recognize that distressing speech is sometimes the most important to a public conversation,\u201d said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who works on free speech issues.She said that the decision to hire more moderators can only help the company make better judgments, especially about live events where fast decisions can be critical. \u201cHumans tend to have more nuance and context than an algorithm,\u201d Ms. Rowland said.But Ms. Rowland said Facebook must also be more clear to the public about its rules on making those calls.Mr. Zuckerberg called the recent episodes of violence \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said the company wanted to make it simpler and faster for reviewers to spot problems and call in law enforcement when needed.In the conference call with investors, he said that artificial intelligence tools would eventually allow reviewers to do a better job of reviewing content. \u201cNo matter how many people we have on the team, we\u2019ll never be able to look at everything,\u201d he said.Facebook is not the only internet company to wrestle with these problems. Google has struggled with similar issues involving its YouTube video service and an automated advertising system that sometimes places marketers\u2019 ads next to questionable content.Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said in an interview this week that like Facebook, his company believed the internet was so vast that machine learning had to work hand-in-hand with human reviewers to improve vetting.\u201dWe don\u2019t think the problem over time should involve humans, because of the scale of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are definitely using humans. We have invested pretty heavily in humans because they are training the machine learning.\u201dJim Kerstetter contributed reporting from New York.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}

Such an investigation could lead to criminal charges for Mr. Levandowski.Keith A. Noreika, the newly appointed head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, comes from the prominent law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, where he represented several banks.Many of his former clients are regulated by the agency he now heads, including at least one lender that may need regulatory approval for a merger, a matter on which Mr. Noreika worked.A spokesman for the Treasury Department, which houses the agency, said Mr. Noreika would face \u201cthe same strong ethics laws that apply to all officials serving in the O.C.C.,\u201d including recusing himself from \u201cany specific matters involving his clients from over the past year.\u201dBut the White House used an administrative quirk to appoint Mr. Noreika to the job on an acting basis as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d who is expected to work at the agency for no more than 130 days, rather than through a Senate confirmation.As a result, Mr. Noreika does not need to sign the pledge, allowing him to face fewer restrictions on lobbying and lawyering when he returns to the private sector.\u201cThese stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGreat things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Georgia Wonders: Will Newcomers Dye the Suburbs Blue?", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byJOHNS CREEK, Ga. \u2014 At first blush, this bedroom city of 83,000 a half-hour north of Atlanta might be mistaken for the perfect example of a white-flight Sun Belt suburb.But something has been happening in Johns Creek \u2014 and, indeed, across much of the vast archipelago of cul-de-sac communities north of Atlanta that served as the launchpad for Mr. Gingrich\u2019s 1994 Republican revolution. The promise of a suburban idyll has been increasingly attracting all kinds of people \u2014 many of whom are not white, and not Republican.Today, 24 percent of people in Johns Creek are of Asian heritage. Indian-Americans shop for saris at the Medlock Crossing strip mall and flock to the latest Bollywood hits at the multiplex. Chinese-Americans and food lovers of all stripes head to the Sichuan House, near the Target and Home Depot stores, for sliced pork ears in chili sauce and \u201ctearfully spicy\u201d mung bean noodles.Indeed, the northern Atlanta suburbs, once considered bastions of Republicanism, are experiencing an identity crisis \u2014 one that became acute with the success of a Democrat, Jon Ossoff, in a special House of Representatives election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District, which last sent a Democrat to Congress in the Carter administration.Many Republicans remain confident that Ms. Handel will prevail in a 70 percent-white district where even liberals concede that conservative culture dominates. Big churches and golf courses still do much to set the social tone, and homegrown conservative talk-radio personalities like Herman Cain and Erick Erickson help commuters assuage the increasingly painful slog through traffic.At the same time, Republicans here reject the idea that demography is political destiny. Instead, they envision a future in which the charms of suburban life, and the conservative politics that made it possible, will rub off on everyone. Instead of the newcomers changing the suburbs, they say, the suburbs will change the newcomers.\u201cYou move to Cobb, you\u2019ve got a good job and cheaper property taxes, and you say, \u2018Hey, maybe this is a better way,\u2019 \u201d said Michael Altman, 58, a former vice chairman of the Cobb County Republican Party.Low taxes, cheap homes and sunshine indeed helped fuel the rise of Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs beginning in the 1950s \u2014 along with a heavy dollop of racism.During integration the Klan presence was strong in Cobb County, and in later years, it was home to the former segregationist governor Lester Maddox and the white supremacist and convicted church bomber J. B. Stoner. But Cobb also became home to a large group of transplants decoupled from local history, many of them professionals transferred to metro Atlanta from elsewhere who were looking for good public schools.Mr. Gingrich, who served as House speaker from 1995 to 1999, used language in his heyday that liberals saw as racially coded, railing against the \u201cwelfare state\u201d of Atlanta. But for the most part he appealed to newcomers and old-timers alike, extolling free markets, technology and traditional values as a means of answering \u201cthe cries of the baby boom generation for a new politics responsive to the future\u2019s needs.\u201dMaddox and Stoner are long dead, but the high-performing schools in places like unincorporated East Cobb County still serve as a magnet. Eight years ago, they attracted Jen Cox, a dyed-in-the-wool Democrat who had been living in Denver.Ms. Cox described the social pressure to conform here that pervaded dinner parties and play dates, influencing the politics of even newcomers. \u201cIt\u2019s something really palpable here, like, \u2018You\u2019re in the Deep South. This is the way it is, and if you don\u2019t like it, we don\u2019t want to hear from you,\u2019 \u201d she said.But now, with the volunteers pushing Mr. Ossoff into the runoff, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear explanation to what\u2019s going on out here. I think everyone\u2019s trying to figure it out.\u201dSome feel threatened by the new liberal activism. On Election Day in East Cobb, a man pulling out of a polling place parking lot in a Jeep asked Ed Neubaum, a man with an Ossoff sign, whether he was a fan of Nancy Pelosi.Certainly, replied Mr. Neubaum, a 57-year-old real estate agent. The other man replied with a vulgarity, called Mr. Neubaum a socialist and said he was responsible for \u201cthe burning of America.\u201d\u201cThe burning of America, my God!\u201d\u201cYeah, the violence that you propagate \u2026\u201d\u201cHow can I propagate violence? Wow.\u201dThe man found an opening in the afternoon traffic. The Jeep roared off.Mr. Ossoff\u2019s supporters mention a number of incidents like these: hostile, but not violent. And in recent years, the suburbs\u2019 changing racial realities have created their own tensions. In 2015, a Cobb County councilwoman who is black accused a county police officer of harassment and intimidation when the officer followed her home, aggressively she said, in an unmarked car. In January, a Gwinnett County commissioner, a white Republican, referred to Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon, as a \u201cracist pig\u201d in a Facebook post, infuriating many Democrats and African-Americans, who called for the commissioner\u2019s resignation.Others note the small daily acts of interracial harmony on the neighbor-to neighbor-level that do not make headlines.At the same time, at the level of regional planning, the Cobb and Gwinnett county governments have remained staunchly opposed to expanding Atlanta\u2019s bus and rail passenger system, Marta, even as the road system has failed to keep up with the influx of drivers. The rejection of public transit has long been caught up with fears of minority incursions and crime and a philosophical disinclination to fund big government. But some here say that this, too, could be changing.\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about whether Marta should, or mass transit should, come to Cobb County as much as we\u2019re talking about it being done smartly,\u201d said Jason Shepherd, chairman of the Cobb County Republican Party.In Johns Creek, the Asian-American residents came not for rail lines but for the schools, just as whites had before them, said Anjali Enjeti, who moved to the city 10 years ago from Pennsylvania. Many also work in the numerous tech companies stuffed in the surrounding office parks.As the number of Asian-Americans has grown, Ms. Enjeti, a freelance writer, has noticed a different kind of white flight, in which people are leaving for neighboring Forsyth County not because minorities are lowering the standards in public schools \u2014 but because they are perceived to be raising them.Ms. Enjeti said she assumed most of Johns Creek\u2019s minorities leaned Democrat, based on the get-out-the-vote efforts she has made on Mr. Ossoff\u2019s behalf.But in November 2015, voters elected Jay Lin to the Johns Creek City Council in a nonpartisan race. He is a Taiwanese-American, the owner of a home remodeling business \u2014 and a Republican.An earlier version of a picture caption misidentified the county in which Roswell, Ga., is located. It is Fulton County, not Cobb.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Service to Both Al Qaeda and U.S., With Fate Hanging in the Balance", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 No one knew it at the time, but Al Qaeda\u2019s ability to strike in the West was severely damaged when a skinny onetime altar boy who grew up on Long Island stumbled into a Pakistani checkpoint in 2008, attacked a police officer and was detained.Within days, F.B.I. agents had flown to Pakistan and were grilling the young man, Bryant Neal Vinas. He told them that he had consulted for Qaeda leadership on spectacular plans to blow up the Long Island Rail Road. Osama bin Laden wanted to turn him into a recruiting poster.Mr. Vinas kept talking to the F.B.I. agents, and to federal prosecutors back in New York. He talked for the next eight years, taking part in 100 interviews, reviewing 1,000 photographs and assisting in more than 30 law enforcement investigations. Mr. Vinas, who had once volunteered to become a suicide bomber, turned on Al Qaeda with devastating effect.The extraordinary assistance from Mr. Vinas, now 34, created a dilemma for the federal judge deciding his fate last week. The judge had to decide how to punish a criminal who had demonstrated such a capacity for evil but who had also helped deliver a crushing blow to the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\u201cThe juxtaposition of Mr. Vinas\u2019s atrocious crimes and his remarkable postarrest cooperation is what makes the task of sentencing Mr. Vinas so difficult,\u201d the judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis, said during sentencing.For prosecutors, an overly harsh sentence would signal to other potential cooperators that agreeing to talk had no upside. Lawyers for Mr. Vinas, who faced a life sentence for pleading guilty to conspiring to murder United States nationals, providing material support to Al Qaeda and receiving military training from the group, argued that the nearly eight years he had spent locked up was sufficient.\u201cThe seriousness of the offense is among the most serious you can imagine,\u201d said David Bitkower, a former Justice Department national security official and prosecutor in Brooklyn, who was not directly involved in Mr. Vinas\u2019s case. \u201cOn the other hand, the value of the cooperation is among the most valuable you can imagine.\u201dHe added, \u201cHow do you balance one off-the-chart factor against another?\u201dMr. Vinas is a remnant of an era in the war on terrorism when Al Qaeda was the main threat and Americans under the spell of Bin Laden traveled to Pakistan to swear loyalty to him.Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis had to decide how to punish a criminal who had demonstrated a capacity for evil but who had also helped deliver a crushing blow to the terrorists responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Syria was not yet at war, and the Islamic State did not exist. Neither did social media outlets like Twitter, nor a bevy of easy-to-use encrypted chat services that terrorists have exploited in recent years to sway potential sympathizers.\u201cBack then, A.Q. was the only game in town,\u201d said Jeffrey Ringel, a former F.B.I. agent with extensive counterterrorism experience. \u201cIt was a different model.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t have all these 18-year-olds going on Facebook and getting radicalized,\u201d said Don Borelli, a former F.B.I. supervisor who oversaw Mr. Vinas\u2019s case. \u201cHe was one of the first guys we saw who did that.\u201dMr. Vinas traveled an unremarkable path to notoriety.He was born in Queens in 1982 and raised in Medford, Long Island, where he attended Catholic church regularly. His parents divorced, and he lived with his mother after that. According to court documents, he was abused as a child, though at whose hands is unclear.He enlisted in the Army as a petroleum supply specialist six months after Sept. 11, but washed out weeks later. He was given a Chapter 11 discharge \u2014 a failure to adapt to the military. His superiors were also concerned that he was suicidal.By then 19, Mr. Vinas jumped from job to job, working at a carwash, a greenhouse and trucking company. Rudderless, he found Islam in 2004 through a friend, converting at a Queens mosque that other extremists had embraced.As the United States invasion of Afghanistan dragged on and Iraq plunged into a catastrophic civil war, Mr. Vinas, prosecutors say, fell under the sway of Mr. Zarqawi\u2019s videos and other propaganda. With little else to lose, he set off for Pakistan.In September 2007, he flew to Lahore, a city near the Indian border known as a center of arts and literature, figuring he would arouse less suspicion there than in a city, like Peshawar, that was swarming with militants.Mr. Vinas eventually traveled to North Waziristan, a remote region that was home to many militants, and wound up in a four-month Qaeda boot camp. There, he learned to handle small arms and explosives and make suicide vests.After training, he was issued an AK-47 assault rifle by Al Qaeda, and he played minor roles in a pair of unsuccessful attacks on an American military base in Afghanistan.But Mr. Vinas had more to offer Al Qaeda than being a low-level fighter: He had ideas. According to court documents, he considered establishing a Qaeda training camp in Peru and was involved in creating Qaeda communication systems. One of the few in the terrorist group who knew New York, Mr. Vinas proposed targeting the Long Island Rail Road \u2014 traveled by hundreds of thousands of commuters each day \u2014 and a Walmart.Mr. Vinas acquired a nickname among his fellow fighters. They called him Bashir al-Ameriki, \u201cthe American who brings good news.\u201dIn October 2008, Mr. Vinas headed for Peshawar in search of a wife. He never found one. At a checkpoint, he was pulled off a bus and questioned. Trying to escape, he attempted to stab a police officer. He was arrested and turned over to the American authorities. The F.B.I. took custody of Mr. Vinas and flew him back to New York.He started to cooperate immediately. He disclosed the plot against the Long Island Rail Road; people living in New York who he thought would be of interest to the F.B.I.; how to join Al Qaeda; and its structure, communications systems, planning, training and tactics.Al Qaeda felt the effects of his decision almost as quickly, as C.I.A.-operated drones obliterated the places where he had trained and lived.Bryant Neal Vinas was given a Chapter 11 discharge \u2014 a failure to adapt to the military. His superiors were also concerned that he was suicidal.\u201cHe was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Borelli said. \u201cHe allowed the government to gain critical insights into Al Qaeda. Having that insight allowed the U.S. government to mount disruption operations.\u201d\u201cTo say that the defendant provided substantial assistance to the government is an understatement,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a memorandum in March, calling Vinas the \u201csingle most valuable cooperating witness\u201d about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Before he was sentenced on Thursday, an emotional Mr. Vinas stood and addressed the court.\u201cI understand that there is no excuse that would justify what I did; I accept full responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI blame no one but myself.\u201dHe said he would like to \u201cturn a bad thing into a good thing\u201d and become a paid counterterrorism expert. If that didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d like a job in construction.Judge Garaufis listened to lawyers on both sides and then announced his decision.\u201cI am cautiously optimistic that Mr. Vinas has learned the error of his ways and will never again commit another crime of this nature,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one, that is, no one, even Mr. Vinas himself, has a crystal ball and can know for certain whether Mr. Vinas will re-offend. However, he is in control of his destiny.\u201dHe then sentenced Mr. Vinas, giving him just three more months in prison. He\u2019ll spend the rest of his life under tight supervision.Even agents and prosecutors couldn\u2019t have predicted such a light sentence, though his lawyers praised the decision.\u201cHe got the sentence he deserved,\u201d said Steve Zissou, who represented Mr. Vinas. \u201cHe really did become the instrument of Al Qaeda\u2019s destruction.\u201dMatt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brooklyn Prison Supervisors Charged With Sexually Assaulting Inmates", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byAs prison officials and reformers have stepped up efforts to reduce rape behind bars, they have looked to the supervisors who keep watch over prisoners \u2014 and prison guards \u2014 to help curb the scourge of sexual abuse.On Thursday, federal prosecutors charged two of those supervisors, lieutenants at a federal jail in Brooklyn, and another guard with sexually abusing female inmates.In the case announced on Thursday, prosecutors say one lieutenant repeatedly raped an inmate shortly before she was scheduled to be turned over to immigration authorities and deported. Another lieutenant is accused of repeatedly sexually abusing inmates assigned to clean his office, or the hallway nearby. A third man, a rank-and-file corrections officer, who was also charged on Thursday, is accused of receiving oral sex from three inmates.In all, court filings by prosecutors mention nine victims, all female inmates. In one case, prosecutors wrote, \u201cthe defendant warned Jane Doe not to tell anyone what had happened, telling her that she could receive additional time in prison if anyone found out.\u201dIn court filings, prosecutors noted that the two lieutenants, Carlos Richard Martinez and Eugenio Perez, were responsible for educating their subordinates about their duties under the Prison Rape Elimination Act, a 2003 law. Prosecutors said that one of the lieutenants made light of the law, known as P.R.E.A., in a posting on Facebook.\u201cNotwithstanding these responsibilities,\u201d prosecutors wrote, Lieutenant Martinez posted a photograph of two men, most likely prison officials, \u201chugging each other at a bar with the caption \u2018It\u2019s only P.R.E.A. when you don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u201dBringing criminal sex crime charges against corrections officers is rare and difficult. Inmates, fearful of retaliation, often wait weeks, months or longer to make an allegation, if they do so at all. When an inmate delays reporting, physical evidence has often disappeared, making the allegation a matter of the inmate\u2019s word against the guard\u2019s.For example, inmates at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex made 131 allegations of sexual abuse against staff members in 2015, the last year for which data are available. Only one allegation was substantiated.This month, New York City agreed to pay $1.2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by two female inmates who accused a guard at Rikers Island of repeatedly sexually abusing them. That guard was never criminally charged and remains employed by the city Correction Department.The Metropolitan Detention Center holds some 1,800 federal inmates, many of whom are awaiting trial. Only about 3 percent of the inmates are women.F.B.I. agents and investigators with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Inspector General have been investigating sexual assault allegations by staff at the Metropolitan Detention Center for nearly a year.\u201cBy using their authority and power to prey upon and abuse female inmates in their care, these defendants violated their oaths of public service as well as numerous criminal laws,\u201d the acting United States attorney in Brooklyn, Bridget M. Rohde, said in a statement.The three defendants were arraigned Thursday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and entered not guilty pleas through their lawyers. Lieutenant Martinez was held without bail and a bail hearing was pending for Lieutenant Perez. The other guard was also held without bail.Prosecutors have accused Lieutenant Martinez, who served in the Marines, of \u201cusing physical force and fear to repeatedly rape\u201d a female prisoner between December 2015 and April 2016, according to court papers. Prosecutors suggested that Lieutenant Martinez, 47, may have selected his victim in part because she was a foreign national who would be deported at the conclusion of her sentence, just five months after the sexual abuse began. \u201cThe defendant chose as his victim a sentenced prisoner who spoke minimal English, who he knew had virtually no visitors, and would be sent to I.C.E. custody following her release from B.O.P. custody,\u201d prosecutors wrote.In court on Thursday, the prosecutor, Nadia Shihata, said that Lieutenant Martinez\u2019s criminal behavior was not confined to the Metropolitan Detention Center. In April 2016, she recounted a \u201croad rage incident,\u201d in which, she said, Lieutenant Martinez had gotten out of his vehicle on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and punched a female driver twice before fleeing. Lieutenant Martinez was ultimately convicted of a minor violation, disorderly conduct, for that episode, according to prosecutors.As deputy marshals led Lieutenant Martinez from the courtroom after he was ordered held without bail, he could be seen blowing a kiss to family members and silently mouthing a reassuring message.Michael Schwirtz contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Instagram Obituaries of the Young Manchester Victims", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byOpinionIt\u2019s a natural urge to try to understand the lives of the people who die senselessly, deaths rooted in the agony of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and little more. The internet has provided a surprisingly intimate glimpse into the lives of many of the victims of the Manchester attack. A handful were teenage girls or young women. Because that\u2019s who goes to see Ariana Grande in concert; there\u2019s no subtlety in who the bombers were targeting.The violence of the attack, or even the mental gymnastics required to think deeply about it, is sometimes too heavy and dark to address head-on. Looking through the lives of seemingly content young people is an indirect way to engage with an otherwise unapproachable evil. Going through these accounts feels routine, like when you find an attractive stranger on your Instagram Discover page. The difference is they\u2019re not going to post anything else. You\u2019re seeing a through line from beginning to end, all cataloged for you by a platform intended to celebrate existing and doing and liking and living.Interest in young girls killed or affected by tragedy isn\u2019t a new phenomenon \u2014 we\u2019ve always tried to mine their lives to understand who they were before their tragedy. We do this with girls killed in domestic assaults, or kidnapped, or almost anyone who died before we think it was their time. Now we have more and more access into their personal lives in the age of near-perpetual documentation. If you want to know what version of themselves they put forward publicly, it\u2019s easy enough: Several of these girls posted about themselves, gave you selfies and Facebook posts and tweets. Indeed, the only one of them who left nearly no trace of herself online is Saffie Rose Roussos. She was only 8.Teenage girls rarely get control, not in life and certainly not in death. Teenagers document their lives \u2014 and, frankly, so do adults \u2014 because it gives them a kind of agency over their own narratives. No one gets to tell you what your story is if you tell it yourself. The very things we throw back at teenage girls as noxious self-indulgences, from selfies to the recording of daily minutiae, are the things we look for when unexplainable tragedy hits.No one is better equipped to speak for you, even after your death, than you. Through photos and posts and inside jokes, these people born in the 1990s and 2000s who died far, far sooner than anyone could have predicted wrote their eulogies for us. The details are often slim and seemingly irrelevant \u2014 and ultimately, only represent a curated version of themselves \u2014 but they\u2019re a reminder that these were real people we lost.Ms. Callander liked \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d Ms. Campbell liked \u201cFamily Feud.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s just curiosity: We have the end of a story, so we want to get the beginning as well. Our mourning can get more specific, so they\u2019re not just girls killed in a public space but girls who had goals and friends and interests. Girls who were funny or bubbly or eager or smart. It doesn\u2019t exactly make us feel better, but if we can\u2019t have answers for the why, we can at least answer the who.Death leaves people feeling panicked and powerless. It\u2019s easy, then, to use someone\u2019s final published moments as proof of something: That they were a good person, or that they were troubled, or that there\u2019s any meaning to be mined from the wreckage of loss. After Manchester, we\u2019re doing the same to the young victims who left us a record of their lives. It\u2019s not solely to let them regain some control of their own narratives, but it\u2019s also for us: Maybe, by looking at what they spun out into the world, we can get some respite from the chaos, too.Scaachi Koul, a culture writer for BuzzFeed, is the author of the book \u201cOne Day We\u2019ll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Defends Sharing Information on ISIS Threat With Russia", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byAsked about the conversation by reporters during a later appearance with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Mr. Trump again did not deny providing the information, but he instead cast it as an attempt to collaborate with Russia in the war against the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of great success over the coming years, and we want to get as many to fight terrorism as possible,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he\u2019s engaged,\u201d General McMaster said.General McMaster suggested that Mr. Trump did not violate any confidentiality agreement with the country that provided it, which he did not name. In fact, General McMaster said: \u201cThe president wasn\u2019t even aware where this information came from. He wasn\u2019t briefed on the source or method of the information either.\u201dMoreover, he said, the president did not give away secrets by discussing the city the information came from, as reported, because it would have been obvious. \u201cIt was nothing that you would not know from open source reporting in terms of a source of concern,\u201d General McMaster said. \u201cAnd it had all to do with operations that are already ongoing, had been made public for months.\u201dWhile General McMaster did not deny that White House officials had reached out to intelligence agencies after Mr. Trump\u2019s revelations to contain any potential damage, he said he could not explain why. \u201cI would say maybe for an overabundance of caution,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dThe general\u2019s briefing came hours after Mr. Trump went on Twitter to defend his actions. \u201cAs president,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cI wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts on Tuesday morning appeared to undercut the carefully worded statements made by his advisers Monday night to try to dispute the original news reports without taking issue with specific facts in them. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said in a statement that the president \u201cdid not discuss sources, methods or military operations\u201d with the Russians.But The Post and the other news organizations did not report that he had done so. Instead, they focused on the breach of espionage etiquette, and on the possibility that American allies might be discouraged from sharing intelligence with the United States. They also noted Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to go off script, at times to the chagrin of his advisers.In his briefing on Tuesday, General McMaster suggested that there was no distinction between his quasi denial and the president\u2019s seeming confirmation. \u201cI stand by my statement I made yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is really the premise of that article is false.\u201dAdministration officials were blindsided by the president\u2019s messages early Tuesday and scrambled to reconcile the gap between them and General McMaster\u2019s comments. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides realized that not having General McMaster answer questions Monday night was going to prolong the story into a new day. But they believed they had been hamstrung by administration lawyers about exactly what could be said.The firestorm comes at a challenging time for Mr. Trump\u2019s besieged team. His national security and foreign policy staffs have been spending much of their time planning for his coming eight-day trip to the Middle East and Europe \u2014 his first overseas trip as president, and an opportunity, they thought, to reset the narrative of his presidency after the lingering controversy of Mr. Comey\u2019s sudden dismissal last week.That came to a crashing halt with the revelations on Monday, with staffers being forced, yet again, to go into damage-control mode. At least one member of Mr. Trump\u2019s team assigned to defend him said the president\u2019s shifting stories and impulsiveness were making it hard to recruit talented outsiders needed to staff the still short-handed West Wing.The story touched off a flurry of condemnations from Democrats who recalled how Mr. Trump had called for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned for mishandling classified information by using a private email server. Even a number of Republicans expressed varying levels of concern and called for an accounting of what had happened.\u201cIf the reporting is accurate, in one fell swoop, the president could have unsettled our allies, emboldened our adversaries, endangered our military and intelligence officers the world over, and exposed our nation to greater risk,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said on the Senate floor.Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC that General McMaster\u2019s statement was not actually a denial. \u201cWhen I look at McMaster\u2019s quote, it\u2019s a pretty technical quote,\u201d Mr. Sasse said. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually something quite different from a full rebuttal of the story.\u201dBut other Republicans said they were willing to reserve judgment. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday morning that he was inclined to believe the White House version of events over the news media, which he said had no way of knowing the entire story. \u201cThey were not in the room,\u201d he said in an interview on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show.\u201cI suspect the administration will brief the Congress more fully on exactly what transpired,\u201d Mr. Cotton said during the interview. \u201cBut I have much greater confidence in the word of H. R. McMaster on the record, in front of cameras, than I do anonymous sources in the media.\u201dThe episode fueled questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Moscow at the same time that the F.B.I. and congressional committees are investigating whether his associates cooperated with Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election. Mr. Trump has repeatedly dismissed such suspicions as false stories spread by Democrats to explain their election defeat. But his friendly approach toward President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in spite of Moscow\u2019s intervention in Ukraine and other actions has stirred controversy.Last week, American officials said they might move to ban laptops from carry-on baggage on all flights from Europe to the United States \u2014 a change that would inconvenience many business travelers, who would be forced to check computers in their luggage.The issue is scheduled to be the subject of a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon in Brussels between Elaine C. Duke, the deputy secretary of Homeland Security, and Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for migration, home affairs and citizenship.Russia dismissed the reports on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry denied that Mr. Trump had given classified information to Russian officials, and she denigrated American news reports of the disclosure as \u201cfake.\u201d\u201cI just landed in Madrid,\u201d the spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova, wrote on Facebook during a work trip to Spain. \u201cI turned on the phone, and there were dozens of messages. \u2018Maria Vladimirovna, is it true Trump revealed the most important secret?\u2019\u201dMs. Zakharova called the report \u201cthe latest fake\u201d and disparaged the newspapers that published it: \u201cGuys, you are again reading American newspapers? You should not read them.

{"Headline": "Commissioner Says Miami Marlins\u2019 Sale Is Moving Forward", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday that a pending sale of the Miami Marlins is moving forward, and that the two bidders known to be in contention to buy the franchise from the owner Jeffrey Loria \u2014 one headed by the former Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter and the former Florida governor Jeb Bush and the other by Tagg Romney, the eldest son of the former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2014 \u201care in relatively the same place in terms of price.\u2019\u2019\u201cThere are maybe minuscule differences,\u201d Manfred added at a news conference after the conclusion of the quarterly owners meetings at Major League Baseball\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. He also said the two bidders were \u201cin the price range that Mr. Loria was looking for.\u2019\u2019Loria bought the franchise in 2002 for $158.5 million from John Henry, now the principal owner of the Boston Red Sox, and is believed to be seeking in excess of $1 billion for it.\u201cThe process is moving forward; it\u2019s really between the Marlins and the bidders,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cAt this point, two things need to happen. There needs to be a solidified financial structure presented to us so that we\u2019re sure that we actually have a transaction that can move ahead, and there are certain documents, the most important of which are a purchase and sale agreement that need to be negotiated between the buyer and the seller. And we\u2019ll be ready to process the transaction when those two things are completed.\u201dIn his update, Manfred did not rule out the notion that other bidders could emerge, but for the moment the competition seems to be between two bidders.For his part, Jeter has declined to discuss his involvement in the potential sale.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to report on that,\u201d Jeter said on Sunday at Yankee Stadium after a ceremony to retire his number and unveil his plaque in Monument Park. \u201cAbsolutely nothing. I think sometimes stories, people get ahead of themselves.\u201dAmong other subjects addressed by Manfred was the restructuring of baseball\u2019s competition committee, which considers all aspects of the game, including rules changes. Manfred announced the addition of more than a dozen new members, including four current managers, two former players in the Hall of Fame and two general managers.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi and Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson are among the new members, as are the Hall of Famers Roberto Alomar and John Smoltz, and Managers Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Buck Showalter of the Baltimore Orioles and Mike Matheny of the St. Louis Cardinals. Theo Epstein, the president of baseball operations for the defending world champion Chicago Cubs, has also been named to the committee.\u201cThe competition committee was restructured to put us in a position that we had a more diverse group of people giving us input on various changes we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d Manfred said.Manfred said that among the issues the committee would consider were baseball\u2019s pace-of-game problems, which have proved difficult to address. Despite recent efforts to speed up play, the average length of a nine-inning game this season is 3 hours 5 minutes, up from three hours in 2016 and 2:56 in 2015.\u201cI\u2019d have to acknowledge a lack of progress at least on time of game, if not pace of game,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we\u2019ve probably gone backwards a little bit.\u201dOn a separate issue, Manfred said a study of injuries sustained by players during the World Baseball Classic showed \u201cthere is no statistical difference for injury rates between players who participate in the W.B.C. and those who don\u2019t.\u201dThe Yankees lost shortstop Didi Gregorius for the first 20 games of the season, and Mets starting pitcher Seth Lugo has yet to return to action after being injured in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\u201cYou can pick out individual players who were injured in the W.B.C., but if you look at the body of players, the rate of injury for those who participate is not significantly statistically different from those who did not participate,\u201d Manfred said.He added: \u201cThe players can do one of two things. They can go to spring training and do what they do in all non-W.B.C. years, or they can participate in the event. They are two different things. But the fact that you do different things does not seem to result in a different rate of injury.\u201dManfred also said baseball would start live streaming of games on Facebook, beginning with Friday\u2019s meeting between the Cincinnati Reds and the Colorado Rockies. Baseball already has an arrangement to stream games on Twitter. Those games, formerly streamed on Friday nights, will move to Tuesday to accommodate the deal with Facebook.Manfred also said baseball was exploring the possibility of playing some games in Europe, possibly as soon as 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019d really like to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you we are going to do it. But we do think it\u2019s time, whether its 2019 or shortly thereafter, that we play in Europe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At some point during the 10 to 15 minutes that she was gone, a Honda Civic pulled up and someone jumped out and got into the Camry, taking the car and the boy, Kingston Frazier.Ms. Archie notified a law enforcement officer at the grocery store, who began filing a report for a missing car before realizing later that Kingston had been taken, too, the authorities said at a news conference.About 9:30 a.m., however, the authorities found Kingston dead with a gunshot wound to the back of his head, Mr. Hall said. His body was left in the back seat of the car, which had been abandoned behind a warehouse on a dead-end dirt road in rural Madison County, about a dozen miles from the Kroger, the authorities said.Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies coordinated throughout the day. By Thursday night, the authorities had arrested three suspects, Dwan Wakefield, D\u2019Allen Washington, and Byron McBride, Mr. Hall said. (The police initially identified all three suspects as 17 years old. An inmate listing later identified Mr. McBride as 19.)All three will be charged with capital murder, a crime punishable by death, and were being held without bail, the authorities said.\u201cAll they had to do is let this kid off on the side of the road, at a grocery store, at a church, anywhere else, but they chose to kill the kid,\u201d Mr. Hall said.On Thursday, family members expressed their sorrowful disbelief.His uncle, David Archie, said the boy \u201cjust liked to have a lot of fun.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing out there worth taking a 6-year-old\u2019s life,\u201d he told the newspaper.\u201cThe innocence and life of a 6-year-old child have been taken by a horrific crime,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt is time this senseless violence end.

{"Headline": "Cuts to AIDS Treatment Programs Could Cost a Million Lives", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 At least one million people will die in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, researchers and advocates said on Tuesday, if funding cuts proposed by the Trump administration to global public health programs are enacted.The United States currently spends more than $6 billion annually on programs that buy antiretroviral drugs for about 11.5 million people worldwide who are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The Trump administration has proposed slashing those programs by at least $1.1 billion \u2014 nearly a fifth of their current funding, said Jen Kates, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u201cThese are lifesaving interventions, and these levels of reductions will significantly curtail service delivery,\u201d Ms. Kates said.In a briefing for reporters, Hari Sastry, director of the State Department\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources, said that everyone now receiving drug treatments under the programs would be allowed to continue, even if the funding cuts were approved.\u201cWe will currently maintain those patients on the treatment,\u201d Mr. Sastry said. He did not explain how that would happen if funding dropped by roughly 20 percent, but the programs have wide bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, where they may be shielded from the proposed cuts.Much of the success of anti-AIDS efforts in Africa has come from a guarantee in many countries that people who test positive for H.I.V. can immediately receive treatment.With a huge share of Africa\u2019s population reaching sexual maturity in the next four years, the virus could again imperil much of the continent if fewer people are treated, said Brian Honermann, deputy director at amfAR, a foundation that invests in AIDS research.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.AIDS treatment not only keeps people alive but prevents them from spreading the virus to others, Mr. Honermann noted. \u201cIf you cut the funding by this much, I think there\u2019s a real risk we will backslide, and a whole lot more people will become infected,\u201d he said.Much of the United States government\u2019s funding for AIDS treatment and research is funneled through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, which was established in 2004 by President George W. Bush in an effort to save Africa from an epidemic that threatened to kill much of the population of entire countries, like Botswana and Namibia.Pepfar funds anti-AIDS activities in more than 60 countries. But in the briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Sastry said the Trump administration planned to ensure that the United States was \u201cfocusing our efforts in the 12 high-burden countries to achieve epidemic control.\u201dThe Trump administration has also proposed eliminating $524 million in funding for contraceptives and other family planning efforts that mostly benefit women in developing nations.\u201cThis budget threatens to trap millions more families in a cycle of poverty,\u201d she said.\u201cAll of these programs have multiplier effects beyond just those immediately served by them,\u201d said J. Stephen Morrison, who directs global health work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cFor the first time ever, after 15 years of steady growth, we\u2019re going to see a radical regression that will have huge effects.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hackers Hide Cyberattacks in Social Media Posts", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It took only one attempt for Russian hackers to make their way into the computer of a Pentagon official. But the attack didn\u2019t come through an email or a file buried within a seemingly innocuous document.A link, attached to a Twitter post put out by a robot account, promised a family-friendly vacation package for the summer. It was the kind of thing anyone might click on, according to the official hit by the attack, who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.That is exactly the problem, Pentagon officials and cybersecurity experts said. While corporations and government agencies around the world are training their staff to think twice before opening anything sent by email, hackers have already moved on to a new kind of attack, targeting social media accounts, where people are more likely to be trusting.Pentagon officials are increasingly worried that state-backed hackers are using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to break into Defense Department computer networks. And the human error that causes people to click on a link sent to them in an email is exponentially greater on social media sites, the officials said, because people are more likely consider themselves among friends.Once one person is compromised, attacks can move quickly through that person\u2019s friend network, leading to what the officials described as a nightmare situation in which entire departments at the Pentagon could be targeted. And while officials know about the problem, training about how to spot an attack that comes through Twitter and Facebook remains limited.Another official, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, described the problem as teaching an entire department to be wary of anything that was sent to it \u2014 even if the message appeared to come from family or a friend.While last year\u2019s hacking of senior Democratic Party officials raised awareness of the damage caused if just a handful of employees click on the wrong emails, few people realize that a message on Twitter or Facebook could give an attacker similar access to their system and that accounts can be spoofed or imitated so it appears that attackers are a trusted friend.Cybersecurity companies said spear phishing through social media was one of the fastest-growing methods of attack.\u201cIt\u2019s something that you don\u2019t hear as much about, but the problem is pervasive,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, a former Defense Department cybersecurity expert and senior cyberanalyst at the National Security Agency who is now the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Synack. \u201cSocial media gives a number of indicators to an attacker, on a state-sponsored level, that you couldn\u2019t get through email.\u201dOutside of simply using a spear phishing email to gain access to a network, attackers could use an account to gather intelligence. By watching a group of soldiers posting online, attackers could watch location changes to discern troop movements or engage directly in conversations to try to ferret out military decisions.\u201cMost people don\u2019t think twice when they are posting on social media. They don\u2019t think about people using the information against them maliciously,\u201d Mr. Kaplan said. \u201cThey also don\u2019t assume people on their network might be attackers.\u201dIn the Defense Department attack, for example, 7,000 employees took the first step toward being compromised by clicking on a link, said Evan Blair, a co-founder of ZeroFOX. \u201cThe attacks are so much more successful because they use your personal timeline and the content you engaged with to target the message to you,\u201d Mr. Blair said.Simply by looking at public posts, attackers can easily see if an account has mentioned a certain band or sports team often, then tailor a message pointing to tickets going on sale for an event. On Facebook, an attacker can see which groups have been joined, or which public pages have been liked.Mr. Blair said that in the case of the Defense Department, the links had carried the malware. Once people clicked on the link, they were infecting their computer networks. In many cases, the attackers targeted members of Defense Department employees\u2019 families, who were less likely to be suspicious.The Defense Department employee who told The Times that he had been part of the recent breach said he had been targeted through his wife\u2019s Twitter account. She was the one to click on a link to a vacation package, after exchanging messages with friends over what they should do with their children over the summer.Once the hackers got into her computer, the official said, they got to his computer through a shared home network.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Los Angeles Restaurant Scene Is on the Move and Mixing It Up", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported by14 PhotosYet the other night, Salazar was bustling. A young crowd gathered in a low-lit, gravel-filled courtyard, many sipping a house drink known as La Paloma \u2014 a boozy slush of mezcal and grapefruit juice, with a punch of ancho chile \u2014 as they waited for one of the tables scattered under the canopy of palm and African sumac trees, warmly illuminated against the night sky.Salazar, which opened last June, does not have a telephone. Wine is poured into juice glasses, water into tin camping mugs. Firewood is stacked outside the kitchen, where food is prepared over an open flame: mesquite-grilled pork chops, hanger steak and branzino. There are carne asada tacos, and bowls of potatoes pur\u00e9ed with green chorizo, a reminder that Salazar is a project of one of this city\u2019s more accomplished Mexican chefs, Esdras Ochoa.It\u2019s an impulse spurred, in part, by this city\u2019s bounty of space, produce and ethnicities, but also by people willing to drive 45 minutes in search of the latest restaurant.Chefs are hunting for places with cheap \u2014 well, relatively cheap \u2014 rents in up-and-coming neighborhoods, away from communities like Santa Monica, Venice, Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, which offer established, thriving and satisfying restaurants.The energy in Los Angeles restaurants is very much in keeping with what is taking place in other spheres across this city, from museums to music to architecture.They have discovered here what other chefs have found after crossing the country: a sunny place where strawberries are in season 10 months a year, and where Ms. Kramer can grow vegetables and herbs for her restaurant in her backyard.\u201cIt\u2019s nice not to be forced to change the menu because you don\u2019t have the availability of certain products,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, there\u2019s something nice about the seasonability of New York.\u201d\u201cTomatoes!\u201d Ms. Hymanson said, another local product that can be found more often than not at the farmers\u2019 market. \u201cIn New York in the winter, you just have root vegetables and dried things. You\u2019d better get really creative.\u201dTheir cooking is inspired by the daily bounty of farmers\u2019 markets and by the Middle East: hen-of-the-woods mushrooms with chickpeas and pea shoots, steeped in almond broth spiced with green chile.And Kismet celebrates the informal in all its east-side glory. The other night, glasses of farmhouse ale and bowls of spiced cashews with kaffir lime leaf were lined up on the bar as the crowd waited for seats at blond-wood tables neatly stacked with plates and napkins. At Kismet, you set your own table and pour your own coffee.\u201cWe are trying to apply a higher-level restaurant ethos to a much more casual experience,\u201d Ms. Kramer said as she picked through a basket of chervil that would go into a cucumber salad made with persimmon and rose-water labneh, a strained yogurt. \u201cAnd I think the same thing goes with the technique and the cooking. We are constantly applying real, high-level technique to a casual experience.\u201dMs. Hymanson picked up the thought. \u201cWe want it be fun,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want it to be messy. We don\u2019t want people to feel too buttoned up. Everything is intentional, even if it appears to be casual. Casual and approachable makes a lot of sense in this town.\u201dNew restaurants are appearing every week, but good ones are closing as well: Pok Pok LA, the much-anticipated Thai restaurant that Andy Ricker opened in 2015, succumbed in March to slow business.The sheer number of new restaurants can discourage chefs trying to find a foothold with what can be a fickle clientele.\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last 10 places I\u2019ve gone to here because there are 10 more places I want to go,\u201d he added. \u201cL.A. is very much a what\u2019s-next town. People used to tell me, \u2018You\u2019re in the restaurant business, that\u2019s really hard.\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s not that hard.\u2019 But I feel it now.\u201dStill, the same forces that have long propelled restaurants here are as powerful as ever, and account for why this city has come so far from the well-documented days when food trucks and strip-mall restaurants defined the food scene.\u201cEach city has their hardship,\u201d Ms. Koslow said. \u201cI think the idea of \u2018If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere\u2019 is true in New York. The kitchens there are for the most part very tight. The walk-ins are down stairs. You\u2019re constantly in tight spaces and making every little inch count.\u201d\u201cHere we have space,\u201d she added, sitting in a storefront she took over next to Sqirl that she uses for food preparation. \u201cWith the addition of this space, we are able to evolve a menu and explore what food is in a way that is harder to do on the East Coast. Our walk-in is quite large. Which means we are able to fit in more from the farmers\u2019 market.\u201dThat Mr. Stone settled on the Hollywood location suggests how the restaurant scene\u2019s center of gravity is shifting. Gwen has a butcher counter in the front of the house and a changing assortment of charcuterie and high-grade steaks, and its menu is endlessly varied, with dishes like cured salmon with shiso, grapefruit and wasabi.In Koreatown, Here\u2019s Looking at You strikes a surprising note in a neighborhood where the dining options were once mostly limited to Korean restaurants. There are shelves of books above the bar \u2014 you don\u2019t often find that at restaurants here \u2014 a soothing backdrop one recent evening as patrons dipped blistered shishito peppers in tonnato sauce.The bold spirit of the place is reflected by the black barley risotto, cooked in a tea made from garlic that turns black after six weeks of fermentation, then topped with a disk of toasted Fiscalini, a Parmesan cheese produced in California. \u201cIt gives the dish an umami kick in the face,\u201d said Kevin Meehan, the chef and owner. And it seems almost tame next to a drink called the New Pad Thai: green chile vodka, Aqua Perfecta and lime over coconut ice, resting under a tangle of bean sprouts, with a carrot poking out of the top.Mr. Kuh, the critic, said places like Kali captured what has entranced him about restaurants since he first began reviewing them 16 years ago. (Before that, he was a restaurant cook.)\u201cWhen I look back at early Spago, the idea that you could have a guy who had worked at Maxim\u2019s, using almond wood to grill, at a restaurant above the Tower Records store on Sunset Boulevard, and reimagine what the state of California would represent culinarily \u2014 that was Spago in 1982,\u201d he said.In the same way, the Los Angeles of 2017 is the kitchen at Salazar cooking tacos behind a plate-glass window over an open mesquite fire in Frogtown, as a procession of Ubers and Lyfts drops off customers in a neighborhood that was barely on the map back in those early days of Spago.Advertisement"}

But to the people of this southern region, this is Tunisia\u2019s second revolution.Tired of waiting for the government to relieve their poverty and create jobs, thousands of young people have been camping here and demonstrating in the main town, Tataouine, for weeks.This past week, the protesters shut the main oil pipeline at El Kamour and clashed with units of the National Guard who tried to burn down the camp on Monday. A police station and a National Guard post were burned in turn. One protester was killed, and at least two others were gravely wounded.Six years after the revolution that brought down Tunisia\u2019s dictator of 23 years, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, the protests reflect mounting frustration at the broken promises of the country\u2019s new democratic leaders to bring tangible improvement to poorer regions like this one.Yet the protesters are themselves a sign of change in the country, as are the challenges confronting the government. The demonstrators are representative of a new generation that has come of age in relative freedom, only to face the prospect of long-term unemployment.A large number are university graduates, organized and articulate. All out of work, they have forged a united movement out of protesters from a swath of towns and villages across the area.There was no particular spark that started the protests, the first of which began in Ksar Ouled Debbeb, a small town just outside Tataouine, on March 14. The protesters\u2019 core demand is simply more jobs.\u201cWe were fed up,\u201d Ali Ghaffari, 24, an English student, said. \u201cWe were young people in our 20s. We made a list of 260 people who are jobless.\u201dOther protests soon followed in surrounding towns. In April, protesters began camping in front of the governor\u2019s office, and a month ago they set up the camp in the desert.The government recently handed out new oil concessions in the region, a step that only served as a reminder of how little the region benefits from the resource. The oil companies hire people generally from outside, and little is invested back.The protesters\u2019 demands have steadily solidified: a quota of jobs for local people at the oil companies drilling in the region, the creation of jobs in an environmental agency and an investment fund for job creation programs.The government has denounced the leaders of the unrest as having links to terrorists or being the tools of mafia bosses. But it has steadily raised its response to their demands.In the desert camp, about 125 miles south of Tataouine, 200 protesters were keeping watch Thursday, and the pipeline remained shut.Resting up in the shade of their tents from the harsh Saharan sun, they said they would remain until the government accepted 17 demands they hadput forward.\u201cEveryone came for our rights and for jobs,\u201d one of the protesters, Walid Abdelmollah, 27, said. \u201cWe are here to the end. No going back!\u201d he added, using a phrase that has become the signature chant.The governor resigned Tuesday and left town, and the police and army were absent from view. A handful of police officers in civilian clothes emerged from the charred shell of the main police station to talk to reporters. The situation was still uneasy, they said, and they were not wearing uniforms, in order to keep a low profile.\u201cThis is the second revolution,\u201d said Ahmed Wafi, a retired civil servant whose daughter, Sabrine Wafi, is a leading women\u2019s activist in the town. \u201cAnd this one is more serious.\u201d\u201cThere is a problem of confidence in the mainstream media, so everyone goes on social media,\u201d said Youssef Zorgui, who has been running a Facebook page in his hometown, Bir Lahmar, and covered the protests in the camp. \u201cWe can share everything on Facebook, whereas the media have censors or show only one or two minutes of the events.\u201dThe protesters have pointedly chosen not to elect leaders of the movement. \u201cIt is a democratic movement. We decide altogether,\u201d as one said. He asked that only his first name, Naim, be used.The movement has rejected any involvement of political parties \u2014 in the camp, the protesters are not allowed to discuss politics \u2014 and they have kept civil society groups and much of the Tunisian news media, whom they accuse of bias, at arms\u2019 length, banning them from the desert camp.The government has made efforts to respond to their demands \u2014 if unevenly. The prime minister, Youssef Chahed, traveled to the region to talk to the protesters in April and has sent his employment minister for negotiations.It is not clear who ordered the National Guard to intervene forcibly on Monday. The governor had insisted publicly that there would be no use of force only minutes before the National Guard moved on the camp. Aides suggested that his resignation was due, in part, to his having been undermined.In addition to jobs and investment, the protesters are now demanding an apology for the police violence; they accuse the National Guard of deliberately running down protesters in the camp.Witnesses said Mr. Sakrafi had been knocked down from behind by a racing police vehicle. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs, head and torso and died on the spot, his cousin Mustafa Sakrafi said. Protesters said they had handed videos of the event to the military investigator the next day.It remains unclear who set fire to the police station and the National Guard post in Tataouine. Many protesters claim it was outsiders set on looting. The movement has vowed to start a volunteer action to clean up and repair the buildings.\u201cOur objective is legitimate,\u201d said Tarek Haddad, 33, an unemployed laborer from Tataouine and a spokesman of the movement. The new Constitution recognized the right to work, he said, adding, \u201cWhether we have done studies or not, we are still not working.\u201dLilia Blaise contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World Is Getting Hacked. Why Don\u2019t We Do More to Stop It?", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe path to a global outbreak on Friday of a ransom-demanding computer software (\u201cransomware\u201d) that crippled hospitals in Britain \u2014 forcing the rerouting of ambulances, delays in surgeries and the shutdown of diagnostic equipment \u2014 started, as it often does, with a defect in software, a bug. This is perhaps the first salvo of a global crisis that has been brewing for decades. Fixing this is possible, but it will be expensive and require a complete overhaul of how technology companies, governments and institutions operate and handle software. The alternative should be unthinkable.Just this March, Microsoft released a patch to fix vulnerabilities in its operating systems, which run on about 80 percent of desktop computers globally. Shortly after that, a group called \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d released hacking tools that took advantage of vulnerabilities that had already been fixed in these patches.It seemed that Shadow Brokers had acquired tools the National Security Agency had used to break into computers. Realizing these tools were stolen, the N.S.A. had warned affected companies like Microsoft and Cisco so they could fix the vulnerabilities. Users were protected if they had applied the patches that were released, but with a catch: If an institution still used an older Microsoft operating system, it did not receive this patch unless it paid for an expensive \u201ccustom\u201d support agreement.The cash-strapped National Health Service in Britain, which provides health care to more than 50 million people, and whose hospitals still use Windows XP widely, was not among those that signed up to purchase the custom support from Microsoft.They were out in the cold.On May 12, a massive \u201cransomware\u201d attack using one of those vulnerabilities hit hospitals in Britain, telecommunication companies in Spain, FedEx in the United States, the Russian Interior Ministry and many other institutions around the world. They had either not applied these patches to systems where it was available for free, or had not paid the extra money for older ones.Computer after computer froze, their files inaccessible, with an ominous onscreen message asking for about $300 worth of \u201cbitcoin\u201d \u2014 a cryptocurrency that allows for hard-to-trace transfers of money. Ambulances headed for children\u2019s hospitals were diverted. Doctors were unable to check on patients\u2019 allergies or see what drugs they were taking. Labs, X-rays and diagnostic machinery and information became inaccessible. Surgeries were postponed. There was economic damage, too. Renault, the European automaker, had to halt production.The attack was halted by a stroke of luck: the ransomware had a kill switch that a British employee in a cybersecurity firm managed to activate. Shortly after, Microsoft finally released for free the patch that they had been withholding from users that had not signed up for expensive custom support agreements.But the crisis is far from over. This particular vulnerability still lives in unpatched systems, and the next one may not have a convenient kill switch.This isn\u2019t all Microsoft\u2019s fault though. Its newer operating systems, like Windows 10, are much more secure. There are many more players and dimensions to this ticking bomb.During this latest ransomware crisis, it became clear there were many institutions that could have patched or upgraded their systems, but they had not. This isn\u2019t just because their information technology departments are incompetent (though there are surely cases of that, too). Upgrades come with many downsides that make people reluctant to install them.For example, the more secure Windows 10 comes with so many privacy concerns that the Electronic Frontier Foundation issued numerous alerts about it, and the European Union is still investigating it. My current Windows 10 machine is more secure but it advertises to me in the login screen. (Are they also profiling me to target advertisements? A fair question in this environment.)Further, upgrades almost always bring unwanted features. When I was finally forced to upgrade my Outlook mail program, it took me months to get used to the new color scheme and spacing somebody in Seattle had decided was the new look. There was no option to keep things as is. Users hate this, and often are rightfully reluctant to upgrade. But they are often unaware that these unwanted features come bundled with a security update.As an added complication, the ways companies communicate about upgrades and unilaterally change the user interface make people vulnerable to phishing, since one is never sure what is a real login or upgrade message and what is a bogus one, linking to a fake website trying to steal a login.The next crisis facing us is the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d: devices like baby monitors, refrigerators and lighting now come with networked software. Many such devices are terribly insecure and, worse, don\u2019t even have a mechanism for receiving updates. In the current regulatory environment, the people who write the insecure software and the companies who sold the \u201cthings\u201d bear no liability.If I have painted a bleak picture, it is because things are bleak. Our software evolves by layering new systems on old, and that means we have constructed entire cities upon crumbling swamps. And we live on the fault lines where more earthquakes are inevitable. All the key actors have to work together, and fast.At a minimum, Microsoft clearly should have provided the critical update in March to all its users, not just those paying extra. Indeed, \u201cpay extra money to us or we will withhold critical security updates\u201d can be seen as its own form of ransomware. In its defense, Microsoft probably could point out that its operating systems have come a long way in security since Windows XP, and it has spent a lot of money updating old software, even above industry norms. However, industry norms are lousy to horrible, and it is reasonable to expect a company with a dominant market position, that made so much money selling software that runs critical infrastructure, to do more.Microsoft should spend more of that $100 billion to help institutions and users upgrade to newer software, especially those who run essential services on it. This has to be through a system that incentivizes institutions and people to upgrade to more secure systems and does not force choosing between privacy and security. Security updates should only update security, and everything else should be optional and unbundled.The United States government has resources and institutions to help fix this. N.S.A.\u2019s charter gives it a dual role: both offensive and defensive. That the agency discloses software vulnerabilities it finds to companies more quickly may be a good idea, but doing so doesn\u2019t solve this problem, since finding bugs is not limited to the N.S.A. \u2014 criminals and other nations can keep finding them. Nor are bugs in limited supply, so we cannot get to the bottom of the problem by fixing them one by one. There are, however, many technical measures that can be taken to build operating systems that are structurally less vulnerable to bugs. In other words, we can\u2019t eliminate bugs, but with careful design, we can make it so that they cannot easily wreak havoc like this. For example, Chromebooks and Apple\u2019s iOS are structurally much more secure because they were designed from the ground up with security in mind, unlike Microsoft\u2019s operating systems.It is past time that the N.S.A. shifted to a defensive posture and the United States government focused on protecting its citizens and companies from malware, hacking and ransomware \u2014 rather than focusing so much on spying. This isn\u2019t just about disclosing vulnerabilities, a hot-button topic that often distracts from deeper issues. It also means helping develop standards for higher security \u2014 something an agency devoted to finding weaknesses is very well suited to do \u2014 as well as identifying systemic cybersecurity risks and then helping fix them, rather than using them offensively, to spy on others.There is also the thorny problem of finding money and resources to upgrade critical infrastructure without crippling it. Many institutions see information technology as an afterthought and are slow in upgrading and investing. Governments also do not prioritize software security. This is a sure road to disaster.As a reminder of what is at stake, ambulances carrying sick children were diverted and heart patients turned away from surgery in Britain by the ransomware attack. Those hospitals may never get their data back. The last big worm like this, Conficker, infected millions of computers in almost 200 countries in 2008. We are much more dependent on software for critical functions today, and there is no guarantee there will be a kill switch next time.It is time to consider whether the current regulatory setup, which allows all software vendors to externalize the costs of all defects and problems to their customers with zero liability, needs re-examination. It is also past time for the very profitable software industry, the institutions that depend on their products and the government agencies entrusted with keeping their citizens secure and their infrastructure functioning, step up and act decisively.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Boko Haram Releases Nigerian Girls, an Anguished Wait for Parents", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byWhile Mr. Mark was thrilled with hearing some of the girls were safe, his joy was mixed with the awful, gut-wrenching torment of not knowing if his own two daughters were among those released.\u201cWe are hoping God will do something for us,\u201d Mr. Mark said.By midday Sunday, the released schoolgirls \u2014 some of the nearly 300 who were initially captured \u2014 had been handed over to intermediaries, taken from a town in the northeast near the border with Cameroon and flown to the capital, Abuja, where they met with Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria.The names of Mr. Mark\u2019s daughters did not appear on the unofficial list.Nigerians were anxious not only about the well-being of the Chibok girls on Sunday, but also the health of the president. Immediately after his meeting with the girls, Mr. Buhari announced he was going to London to visit with doctors.The release of the girls was a victory for Mr. Buhari, who has promised to secure the freedom of all of them.The handover began about 7 a.m. Sunday. Talks to free them had been going on for several months. The Nigerians worked with the government of Switzerland and the International Committee of the Red Cross to secure the release.On Sunday, some parents quickly departed from Chibok by road on a long journey to the capital to see if their daughters were among the freed. Others stayed behind, joyful but anxious about whether their girls had been liberated.For those in Abuja, the strain of not knowing the status of their loved ones was particularly acute. One mother of a missing girl sat at a rally in the capital, uncertain whether her daughter was across town, safe and in the custody of the government, or still in the bush in the clutches of the Islamic militants.When she combed the list made available late on Sunday, the mother, Esther Yakubu, did not find name of her daughter, Dorcas, on the list.Yet it was the singular act in Chibok that trained the world\u2019s sights on this war in Nigeria. Images broadcast by Boko Haram not long after the kidnapping of the veiled girls sitting on the ground in captivity resonated with celebrities and everyday people alike and spread across social media, where a #BringBackOurGirls hashtag became popular.The newfound freedom of so many of the kidnapped girls is a major victory in the war and is a lift for Mr. Buhari, who vowed when he took office in 2015 to destroy Boko Haram.While hundreds, if not thousands, of people have been kidnapped by Boko Haram, many of those have been rescued in recent months by military operations that have liberated entire areas from militant control.On Sunday, it was unclear precisely which or how many Boko Haram suspects had been traded in exchange for the girls\u2019 freedom. Government officials declined to identify the suspects even as some media reported they were high-ranking Boko Haram commanders. Western diplomats said as many as six may have been handed over.With their forces now scattered throughout the countryside, Boko Haram\u2019s most effective strategy recently has been launching suicide attacks. They have strapped bombs to dozens of young girls and children as young as 7, sending them into crowded markets or camps for people displaced by the war. The group has also attacked military outposts and convoys and still is regarded as a threat to soldiers and civilians in the region.But with many of their hide-outs gone, fighters can no longer gather in huge groups and instead exist in pockets in Nigeria and in bordering countries. Fighters are suffering from a lack of supplies and food, just like many of the residents, in an area that is experiencing famine-like conditions.Boko Haram has also suffered infighting that has split the group into factions, one of which has been recognized by the Islamic State.Another faction, run by Abubakar Shekau, known for his YouTube rants and vicious battlefield activity, was the one holding the 82 girls. Mr. Shekau\u2019s brutality led to a major split in the group last year.Over the weekend as news of the girls\u2019 release circulated, speculation was rampant that the government had paid a steep ransom in exchange for the girls. Government officials did not respond to a request for comment.Ransom money has fueled the war chests of Al Qaeda offshoots operating elsewhere in West Africa and of the Islamic State. The American and British embassies recently issued a warning that Boko Haram intended to kidnap foreign workers in northeast Nigeria. The move would be a new strategy for a group that for the most part has targeted locals.Advocates for the kidnapped girls were pushing to make sure the more than 100 still held captive were not forgotten. At a rally, a few dozen people, including several parents of the girls, chanted, \u201cBring back our girls now and alive!\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about the release of 82 girls abducted by the terrorist group Boko Haram misidentified the organization that worked with the Nigerian and Swiss governments to secure their release. It is the International Committee of the Red Cross, not the International Federation of the Red Cross.Ibrahim Sawab contributed reporting from in Abuja, Nigeria.Advertisement"}

On the House floor, Representative Matt Rinaldi, a Republican, then turned to several Democratic lawmakers and told them he had reported the people to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.One of the Democrats, Representative C\u00e9sar J. Blanco, said that Mr. Rinaldi told him and others, \u201cWe are going to have them deported,\u201d and then used an obscenity.\u201cWe were in shock,\u201d Mr. Blanco said. \u201cHe assumed that because they were brown, in the gallery and protesting that they were here illegally.\u201dThe exchange led to a confrontation among lawmakers, with some pushing and pointing at one another. Some legislators had to be restrained. Mr. Rinaldi got into a face-to-face argument with Representative Poncho Nev\u00e1rez, a Democrat, and threatened to shoot him.Mr. Nev\u00e1rez and Mr. Rinaldi did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Mr. Rinaldi said on Facebook that he called federal immigration authorities after seeing signs in the gallery that read, \u201cI am illegal and here to stay.\u201d He accused Democratic politicians of encouraging the protesters.Mr. Blanco said he saw no such signs among protesters.A spokeswoman with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency did not immediately respond when asked whether law enforcement officials responded to the Capitol in Austin.The last regular day of the four-month legislative session drew more than 1,000 protesters to the Capitol. The demonstrators who packed the House chamber were speaking out again a bill that Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed into law this month banning so-called sanctuary cities.The legislation, among several highly divisive bills on the agenda, subjects law enforcement agencies to steep daily fines if they fail to cooperate with federal immigration guidelines. Some opponents to the law have called the law racist.It was not clear on Monday whether Mr. Rinaldi or other lawmakers could face disciplinary action.

{"Headline": "New Graphic Novels Detail Personal Journeys and Twists of Fate", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported bySummer ReadingSet in Chicago in the 1960s, the book is narrated by 10-year-old Karen Reyes, who imagines herself as a wolf-girl with a fanged underbite. When her beautiful upstairs neighbor, Anka Silverberg, dies under suspicious circumstances, Karen naturally wants to solve the mystery, but it involves deeper and sadder complications of adulthood than she can yet understand. A lot of those complications involve her beloved but rage-prone older brother, Deeze, short for Diego Zapata, who takes her to museums to show her classic paintings (which appear throughout the book, rendered in Ferris\u2019s intricately crosshatched pen lines). Deeze, Karen recalls, told her that Henry Fuseli\u2019s \u201cThe Nightmare\u201d is effectively \u201chistory\u2019s first horror comic cover \u2026 and considering the whole arithmetic of boobs + monsters = horror, I guess he\u2019s probably right.\u201dKaren flits from strand to strand of her story: her mother\u2019s rapid decline from cancer, her painful crush on another monster-loving girl, the racial tensions that clawed at Chicago\u2019s social fabric at the time, and several long, wrenching digressions into Anka\u2019s experiences as a child prostitute in Nazi Germany. The terrible experiences she\u2019s processing are punctuated by flashes of simpler horrors \u2014 drawings of the covers of her beloved Dread, Ghoulish and Ghastly magazines (dead ringers for the real-world Creepy and Eerie, whose frequent contributor Richard Corben seems to have had as much of an impact on Ferris\u2019s artwork as his polar opposite, Lynda Barry). The book ends with something like a cliffhanger \u2014 a second and final volume of Karen\u2019s story is due this fall \u2014 but the incompleteness of a serial episode is appropriate for the way she tries to understand disaster as a promise that something else will follow it.As the story begins, Jimmy Yee, the Everyman protagonist of many of Shiga\u2019s comics, is writing a suicide note. He hangs himself, and promptly wakes up alive and well in the same grotty motel. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a second chance,\u201d he declares before slitting his wrists, with the same result. After a few more attempts to kill himself end similarly, this version of Jimmy, a psychopathic actuary with a gift for mental computation, figures out what\u2019s going on: He\u2019s actually a demon who possesses whoever is closest to him whenever his host body dies.Naturally, the government wants to use Jimmy as a weapon, and his path to freedom involves committing suicide over and over in increasingly ingenious ways (with a lot of homicide thrown in, too). The result is a bit like Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata\u2019s \u201cDeath Note\u201d \u2014 escalating mayhem based on a plot gimmick with very specific rules \u2014 except that Shiga delights in letting the simple cuteness of his visual style sugarcoat horrific gross-outs. At the climax of the first volume, Jimmy has to figure out a way to kill his current host body, armed only with \u201cnearly an entire square of toilet paper \u2026 double ply.\u201d His solution is hilariously original, and so far beyond the pale that it has practically forgotten what the pale was.When Maggie\u2019s house, a four-hour drive north of San Francisco, burns down, Bell steels herself to help her find a new place to live. (\u201cCan you put me on something that will keep me on my best behavior?\u201d she asks a psychiatrist.) Through the six square, neurotically overstuffed panels on each page, Bell shows us the landscape of her mother\u2019s life, populated by feral animals and possibly dirty dishes. There\u2019s clearly some horribly painful family history, but we see it only in glimpses and elisions; Bell and her mother are more concerned with the business of getting a new little house delivered, getting a stove and plumbing put in, and figuring out whether the ex-con who lives in a trailer on the property is a danger to her or not.The subtext of it all is Bell\u2019s ceaseless struggle with her own depression and anxiety, which she frames as black comedy. \u201cSometimes it feels like I\u2019m carrying some invisible, unwieldy object, like, say, a bicycle, with both hands over my head, while continuing to try to function normally,\u201d she notes (and draws herself doing just that). The bleakest section of the book memorializes the dead cats of her youth, several of them killed by Freya, a dog owned by her abusive stepfather, Jeff. \u201cOne day, when I came home from school, Freya was gone and Jeff was looking mournful,\u201d Bell writes. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything, but I\u2019d learned to fake it.\u201dIn some ways, this story, translated by Helge Dascher, is a bizarre choice to present as comics: Andr\u00e9 spends 300 straight pages as a captive, with very little change of scenery and almost no other identifiable characters in sight. (Delisle\u2019s thin pen lines are submerged in a bare handful of flat tones of gray and gray-green.) But the location captured here is less Andr\u00e9\u2019s grim little room than his mind, as he tries to ward off existential despair \u2014 a battle that lets Delisle transmute tedium into compelling suspense. We see the captive narrator struggling to keep track of the passing days, and to keep his mind sharp by playing memory games about the Napoleonic Wars. He makes tiny jokes, like naming the man who brings him his soup Th\u00e9nardier, after the innkeeper from \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables.\u201d A heroic effort on Day 80 yields him a clove of garlic. Delisle presents Andr\u00e9\u2019s eventual escape less as a daring exploit than as a panicked, fumbling victory over his interior monologue \u2014 the psychological prison that months of darkness, immobility and uncertainty had imposed on him.If Tamaki (the illustrator of the Book Review\u2019s By the Book feature) has a favorite storytelling strategy, it seems to be dreaming up some kind of odd artifact of mass culture and then examining the way people react to it. \u201cBody Pods\u201d concerns a cult movie adored by some of the narrator\u2019s friends, and their reactions as its stars begin to die. \u201cDarla!\u201d is an oral history of a (nonexistent) short-lived pornographic sitcom from the \u201990s. (\u201cIt was a different time,\u201d the narrator deadpans. \u201cYou could never make something like it now.\u201d) And the Borgesian \u201c1. Jenny\u201d begins by imagining a \u201cmirror Facebook\u201d whose users\u2019 profiles begin to diverge from their real-world counterparts,\u2019 and goes on to follow one woman\u2019s obsession with her alternate self\u2019s love life.The book\u2019s highlight, \u201cSexCoven,\u201d is a showcase for Tamaki\u2019s mercurial style. Nominally, it concerns a mysterious six-hour-long audio file with druglike properties and the communities that successively accrued around it in the early 2000s. The story starts off like a documentary whose narrator is looking back on the phenomenon, but in the course of its 30 pages, it drifts through a sex scene, a psychedelic depiction of a SexCoven trip, \u201cscreenshots\u201d of a digital video and more, with each sequence presented in a different visual idiom. The task of culture is to connect people in the world, Tamaki suggests, but the kinds of connections it creates are weirder than anyone could guess.\u201cA Contract With God\u201d was a departure, not just for Eisner but for comics in general. (Booksellers were puzzled about where to display it.) It\u2019s a suite of four stories about the inhabitants of a tenement in the Bronx of the 1930s, where Eisner grew up. \u201cCookalein\u201d involves the fraught erotic awakening of a young man named Willie. In retrospect, the book seems like a pretext for its bitterly melodramatic, rageful title story \u2014 drawn from the author\u2019s own life \u2014 in which a devout Jewish survivor of pogroms, shattered by the death of his daughter, becomes convinced first that God has violated the terms of their agreement, and then that the contract simply wasn\u2019t airtight enough.Eisner\u2019s writing here, by modern standards, is ham-handed. The book is overpopulated by ironic twist endings, overcooked dialogue and villainous specimens with wretched sexual urges. As an artist, though, the Eisner of \u201cA Contract with God\u201d was a master arriving at his mature style.

{"Headline": "Deadly Bombing in Kabul Is One of the Afghan War\u2019s Worst Strikes", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 A truck bomb devastated a central area of Kabul near the presidential palace and foreign embassies on Wednesday, one of the deadliest strikes in the long Afghan war and a reminder of how the capital itself has become a lethal battlefield.In one moment, more than 80 lives ended, hundreds of people were wounded and many more were traumatized, in the heart of a city defined by constant checkpoints and the densest concentration of Afghan and international forces.President Ashraf Ghani, whose palace windows were shattered in the blast just as he had finished his morning briefing, called it \u201ca crime against humanity.\u201d President Trump called him to offer condolences.The bombing happened just as the United States is weighing sending more troops, deepening its entanglement, to try to slow or reverse government losses to the Taliban insurgency this year.\u201cThe attack demonstrates a complete disregard for civilians and reveals the barbaric nature of the enemy faced by the Afghan people,\u201d Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement.He applauded the Afghan security forces for having prevented the truck from entering the Green Zone, the area that houses the headquarters of the coalition forces as well as several foreign embassies.But Kabul\u2019s vulnerability to such an attack spoke volumes to the frustrations of stabilizing the country despite 15 years of American-led military intervention to thwart the Taliban, coupled with hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid to a population that for the most part has known only war.Security has steadily worsened since 2014 and the end of the main NATO combat mission, which at its peak featured more than 100,000 American troops and tens of thousands more from alliance partners like Britain. The current international force in Afghanistan numbers about 13,000 \u2014 about 8,400 of them are American \u2014 mostly tasked with training and advising the Afghan forces.The deputy interior minister, Gen. Murad Ali Murad, said that besides the more than 80 people killed, with the death toll sure to rise, at least 463 had been wounded. Still, the general said the attacker had actually failed to get all the way to his most likely target: Security cameras showed the truck stopped by police officers who guarded the entrance to the street housing the German and Indian Embassies, as well as compounds for the coalition forces.But for an explosion that shattered windows within a mile, a few steps off target made little difference.With most of the city fasting to observe the holy month of Ramadan, residents urgently took up what has become a routine: sweeping broken glass, calling loved ones and calling others in search of news.In different corners of the city, workers and relatives dug graves for the ones who, with life having become a game of chance, just were not lucky. Parents arrived to escort panicking children home from school, holding their hands and cautiously walking close to walls \u2014 as if walls could protect against such violence.For more than two hours, smoke rose from the blast site, a 13-foot crater centered on a vast circle of destruction. The German Embassy, where officials said employees had retreated deeper into the compound after an earlier warning of a threat against them, was extensively damaged, with dozens of windows blown in.\u201cThere was a big tremble, and then we heard a massive explosion,\u201d Ramin Sangar, a cameraman at a television channel near the bombing site, said as he was loaded into an ambulance. \u201cAll the windows are broken. Our studios collapsed.\u201dAs security forces established a wide cordon and ambulances whizzed between hospitals and the street, dozens of people gathered on each side of the cordon, inching closer in hopes of hearing any good news at all about their missing.There was a heavy security presence, including forces from the United States-led coalition, and helicopters circled overhead. Emotions were running high, as the Afghan security forces and emergency medical workers, too, were working while fasting.Intelligence officers closely checked the paperwork of emergency workers, fearing that they might have been infiltrated by militants planning a follow-up attack. At one point, after a senior police official tried to pass the cordon with a large entourage of guards, a scuffle broke out, and the police and intelligence officers faced off with their weapons ready. But the situation was quickly defused.For the residents, much of the search for their loved ones then shifted to the hospitals, and crowds began to grow around the city\u2019s treatment centers.More than 300 people anxiously waited outside the Emergency Hospital, one of the main trauma centers in the city. Some were weeping and wailing, while others were trying to look up names of loved ones on the lists that employees handed out. Inside the hospital, where the windows had also been shattered by the force of the blast, doctors were attending to dozens of wounded.Outside Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, the main government hospital, a white-bearded man in his 60s named Azizullah searched for news of his 22-year-old son, Abdullah, who worked at a telecommunications company near the site of the blast.\u201cI searched all hospitals. He is nowhere,\u201d said Mr. Azizullah, who would crouch and then get up to pace. \u201cAbdullah has two children, a wife and an old mother. What will I tell them?\u201dMr. Azizullah received a call from someone who appeared to be inside the hospital, telling him about unrecognizable bodies.\u201cCan you search the person whose body is cut up?\u201d he asked the caller. \u201cHe may be my son. Try to find his documents.\u201dBy the morgue in the hospital, a group of men tried to figure out whether the badly burned body in the back of an ambulance was their friend Ahmad Reshad, an employee of a telecom company in his 30s. One of the men was on the phone with Mr. Reshad\u2019s wife, as others searched the body to try to make out details that could identify him: How much money was carrying? What color tie did he have on? The body had pills in one of his pockets \u2014 was Mr. Reshad carrying pills?They could not identify the body, so it was shipped off for a forensic examination. The men continued their search at another hospital.In a televised address as the city was preparing to go to sleep, President Ghani came out with a resolute message, calling for unity in the face of attackers who he said were receiving help from outside intelligence forces \u2014 frequent shorthand here for Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, which has long maintained ties with the Haqqani network.The year\u2019s traumatic news began piling up even before the spring fighting season took off: massacres at a fortified army hospital and then an even more heavily fortified army base, another district fallen to the Taliban as stretched security forces collapsed, a city overrun two times on verge of falling again, more civilians killed.In Germany, the Kabul blast was sure to fuel a debate over the government\u2019s efforts to repatriate Afghans whose applications for asylum had been rejected.German officials have been at pains to insist that parts of Afghanistan are safe, despite the deteriorating security of the countryside. But hours after the blast, the government in Berlin said that a flight carrying deportees bound for Afghanistan scheduled for Wednesday had been postponed.About 1,000 German soldiers are stationed in Afghanistan as part of the NATO force, and Germany has invested billions in the military and aid to stabilize the country.Most of the victims appeared to be civilians on their way to work during the morning rush hour. Among those killed were a BBC driver, Mohammed Nazir, and an information technology worker for the Afghan television channel ToloNews, Aziz Navin.Lotfullah Najafizada, the director of ToloNews, described a painful search for his colleague\u2019s remains. He and his co-workers examined seven mostly unrecognizable bodies at the military hospital before heading over to the civilian side, where the 44th body had just arrived.\u201cWe found Aziz in a large, dirt-colored sack, and his relatives were trying to transport him home,\u201d Mr. Najafizada wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe ambulances were busy, and Aziz waited in the hall of the hospital for his final trip home.\u201dAs such routines usually wrap up in Kabul, funeral processions made it to the different corners of the city. In the Karte Naw neighborhood, the body of Mr. Nazir was lifted from his modest two-story home, its outside walls freshly plastered, as women wailed inside. More than 500 people packed into the small yard of the orange mosque for a final prayer half a mile from his home, and then he was driven up the hill for his burial.Mr. Nazir\u2019s oldest son, Mohammed, 9, was accompanied by a weeping relative. Mohammed, wearing turquoise shorts, did not quite grasp what was happening.In the northeast of the city, in the sprawling Panjsad family cemetery, Tawab Temuri, a 25-year-old travel agent, was the third victim to be buried on Wednesday.A fourth grave was dug, and about 60 men waited just below Mr. Temuri\u2019s grave for the body to arrive.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Dianne Wiest, Half-Buried and Heartbreaking, in \u2018Happy Days\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byWho is Winnie?Whether Winnie is a symbol of a despoiled Mother Earth or just an Everywoman trapped in the wasteland of life, this production, directed by James Bundy, does not decide. What we do know is that she has suffered. The circumstances of her semiburial are not revealed, but we can see for ourselves the unhappy result. Several of her teeth are in jeopardy. It is often, she says sadly, the wrong time for singing.Worse may be the solitude. No one even passes the mound anymore, leaving Winnie with only her decrepit husband for companionship. Not that Willie (Jarlath Conroy) is much of a companion. Because he lives in a kind of gopher hole behind the mound, Winnie cannot see him except when he makes one of his infrequent incursions into her peripheral vision. Even then, he is usually a disappointment, with his bad manners and near-muteness. The closest they come to touching is when she clobbers him with her parasol.Life is terrible and yet, as played with ineffable gentleness by Ms. Wiest, whose alto flute of a voice has never seemed so gay and vulnerable, Winnie is no whiner. (In the wrong hands, the character can come off as a harridan.) Heeding the clangorous bell that awakens her each morning, she greets the scalding sun with unlikely good cheer: \u201cAnother heavenly day,\u201d she declares.Doing so, she shows us what a deeply womanly role Beckett has written, albeit one whose tragedy is refracted through a distorting comic lens. She finds laughs not only in the words but also in the gaps between. Wherever the script offers ellipses (as it does hundreds of times) she fills them, however fleetingly, with puzzlements, peeves or flashes of memory.At the same time, she engages her environment and few possessions in a specifically girlish way. That parasol is not just a prod but also a must-have accessory for a once-glamorous lady. Lavishing affection on her big black shopping bag, she sets out its contents on the rubble around her as if they were treasured tchotchkes. When she kisses her particular favorite, her revolver, you may be reminded of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Winnie, we discover, is a cosmic sister to Laura Wingfield, at least as she is played in the current Broadway revival by Madison Ferris, who has muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair.Great performances open outward, encouraging unexpected connections like that, but they don\u2019t on their own make definitive revivals. It\u2019s not that there is anything notably wrong with Mr. Bundy\u2019s dutiful staging, aside from some clumsy blocking that prevents us from seeing Mr. Conroy\u2019s expressive face at the one moment we could and most need to. And to the extent the production supports and frames Ms. Wiest so she can excel, it need not be better than it is. But it could be.Without liberties, though, we have museum pieces, and museum pieces tend to decay. It detracts nothing from an often-performed work like \u201cHappy Days\u201d to see what else it holds, or doesn\u2019t. Some critics and fidgety theatergoers already ask why, if Winnie is merely an extended metaphor for the irrational optimism of mankind, we need a two-hour play, with built-in longueurs, to unpack it. Happily, Ms. Wiest\u2019s extraordinary performance makes the question irrelevant. For now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scaling the World\u2019s Most Lethal Mountain, in the Dead of Winter", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Sports of The TimesFor reasons of history and culture, Polish climbers are among the world\u2019s most audacious. This winter, a group will attempt K2, the world\u2019s most dangerous mountain.Supported byThe mountain rises glistening from an encasement of glaciers in the far reaches of the Karakoram. Pyramid-shaped, an austere link to eternity, K2 yields only to Everest in height and is deadlier. Its walls are vertiginous no matter the approach.Only the most experienced climbers attempt ascents, and for every four who crawl to its peak, one dies.And then there is winter. Fourteen of earth\u2019s mountains exceed 8,000 meters (26,246 feet), and climbers have reached the peak of 13 in winter. K2 is the forbidding exception. Ten Polish climbers hope to make history by reaching the summit next winter.These men will hike through knee-deep snow to a base camp at 18,645 feet, surpassing all but one mountain in the United States. Atop K2\u2019s near-vertical slopes, glacial icefalls dislodge car-size hunks of ice. Winds at the summit reach hurricane strength, and temperatures can fall as low as minus 80 Fahrenheit.The climbers could wait two months in their tents, in hopes the gales relent for a few days. They have no margin for error; K2 routinely kills those trapped on its flanks.This is the way of the Polish climbers, who for reasons of history and culture have earned reputations as the greatest climbers of the Himalayas in winter. They are prisoners of their dreams.Janusz Golab is a long-limbed lion of a climber with curly hair that goes here and there like an ethereal nimbus. He is 49, still in his prime for a great climber, and he will be one of those charged with making it to the summit of K2 next winter. We talk as he stands in the darkened attic of a lodge in the Morskie Oko valley in Poland, looping purple rope in preparation for a training climb in the subzero of the Tatra Mountains.To scale K2 in winter is not such modest madness. He has children and at least one girlfriend, and he appears filled with a love for life. It so happens he enjoys its deadly challenges. He has climbed in Antarctica, Greenland and the Himalayas. \u201cWinter is the best season.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging. It\u2019s obvious it\u2019s the best.\u201dThere\u2019s so much to unpack about this climb to the most hostile tip of the planet, a mountain that is 28,251 feet high and sits in the Karakoram range on the border of Pakistan and China. There are the technical and strategic challenges, and the task of picking a team in the individualistic world of high-altitude climbing. These men will live and work in the worst possible conditions for months. Each knows he may not return.Four climbers will make the final push to the summit without oxygen. Each has lost partners on climbs.There is, too, the power that history exerts on the Poles. A decade ago, what remains of the old guard challenged a younger generation to test limits of flesh, endurance and creativity in the Himalayas. Their story, embedded in the urge of free spirits to slip the unsmiling bonds of a Cold-War communist government, offers our starting point.Generations of Poles flocked like homing pigeons to the dark and jagged peaks of the Tatra Mountains, which rise on Poland\u2019s southern border with Slovakia. Men and women scaled its granite walls in summer heat and in the belly of winter. When the photographer Max Whittaker and I accompanied five Polish Himalayan climbers to the Tatras in January, snow piled swollen on steep mountainsides and the temperature hovered near zero.After World War II and its slaughters, the Communists imposed a controlling regime. Its bureaucrats held all passports. Whether factory worker, engineer or mathematician, everyone scuffled for money. The mountains offered freedom from all that.Poland\u2019s climbing clubs swelled with members. The most famous was found in Katowice, a steel town a few hours drive from the Tatras.The Katowice club overlooked Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Street; its coat of arms is an eagle and an ice pick. Many dozens of climbers each night talked mountains, life, and more mountains, and sang songs and drank vodka. To gain admission at that time, a young climber had to demonstrate technical prowess, sleep outside on a mountain ledge (known as a bivouac), pass written tests and show a command of mountaineering history, art and literature.The blue-eyed Krzysztof Wielicki, who at 67 is among the most accomplished Himalayan climbers alive, will lead the K2 expedition. He remains limber and lively in his seventh decade, with a second wife and young children. He has climbed three Himalayan peaks in winter, including Everest, and has the bowlegged amble of a man with little left to prove. His eyes glisten when asked about his youthful hunger. \u201cWe climb here, and here, and here,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd if you climb O.K., they say, \u2018O.K., you have passed summer Tatra.\u2019\u201dHe lifts his finger high in imitation of the hardened club members. \u201c\u2018Now you have to do winter Tatra.\u2019\u201dWhen Polish climbers obtained permission to climb the peaks of Western Europe, they discovered another problem: The West was terrifically expensive.One night in January, I sit in the village home of Janusz Majer, 70, a burly climber who is working to obtain the $335,000 in government and private financing needed to underwrite the assault on K2. His friend and climber, Wojciech Dzik, joins us.Over salamis and cheeses and a prodigious amount of wine, we talk of long-ago mountaineering adventures. They had finished a climb in the Dolomites in the 1970s when they saw a sign for cappuccinos. Dzik, a mathematician, did the mental currency conversion. \u201cMy God! It was one-tenth of my salary,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAfter that, we lived like Jesus, on bread and wine.\u201dThe Poles turned to the mountains of Asia, where the technical challenge was magnitudes greater and the cost magnitudes less. In search of money, they walked into factory offices in Katowice and pointed to towering industrial chimneys. We\u2019ll paint these at half your usual cost.The factory managers winced. A scaffold, they said, costs more than your price.We work Alpine-style, the climbers replied. Soon engineers and mathematicians and electricians rappelled down chimneys from dawn to dusk.Then they hopped into old vans, Jack Keroaucs all, and set off for the Hindu Kush. No fancy equipment, no endorsements, no publicity; just freedom from the strictures of life in Poland. \u201cBack then, to leave a job was O.K.,\u201d Wielicki tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re making just $50 a month. No big deal. Bye-bye.\u201dBy the time the Poles reached Asia in great numbers, climbers from other nations had scaled all the 8,000-meter peaks.The Poles decided to find fame Tatra-style and climb those peaks in winter or by risky new routes. The audacity of their ascents was legendary. Their ranks produced Wanda Rutkiewicz, the first woman to summit K2, and the first man to scale three giant peaks in winter, Jerzy Kukuczka. That climber and a partner scaled K2 in summer along a route so dangerous, even suicidal \u2014 it passed beneath unstable ridges of ice \u2014 no one else has attempted it. To this day, it is known as the Polish Line.Some climbers were artists who specialized in free climbs, with as little gear as possible. Others were expeditionary geniuses who plotted climbs like military assaults. Polish newspapers chronicled this as American newspapers do baseball.To sit now with the Polish mountaineers, old and young, is to hear voices rise and laughter roll in like ocean breakers. They tell tales of supplies piled atop camels and flirtations with entrancing local women and negotiating with turbaned mechanics to eke a few more miles out of wizened vans. They recall Silesian dumplings and vodka in base camp and frozen bivouacs at 22,000 feet and fogged brains and hallucinations (they do not use oxygen when climbing). Always there were other worldly vistas.\u201cUp there at night, to hear glaciers calve: Boom. Boom. Boom. My God,\u201d recalls Dzik, the white-haired mathematician. \u201cI was just a poor bored lecturer in Poland. It was like going to heaven.\u201dAnother visitor accompanied them: death.The grand climbers perished at a frightful rate. They were trapped by swirling tempests; died of altitude sickness; slipped and catapulted into the abyss. There is no field of athletic achievement where death rides so insistently on your shoulder.It is tempting to wonder if these men harbor a romance with two lovers, life and death. Wielicki, the leader of the upcoming expedition, was renowned for his solo ascents of Himalayan peaks. His stamina was unmatched. (As expedition leaders must, he will remain at base camp during the ascent of K2.)I put the question of death\u2019s allure to him and he shakes his head. He wanted to live, always, even if along the serrated edge of a knife. He noted an axiom of climbing: A young climber is the most endangered, as he does not know enough to worry. To that, he adds another: An older climber should not draw too much comfort from mastery of technique. That can prove a frail shield in the high Himalayas.\u201cYou need luck,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes.\u201dRough sleep precedes a climb. It\u2019s as if the dark imaginings of Hieronymus Bosch scamper through the cranium. A climber clings to a crumbling wall. Another sees a friend fall past him. Another feels creatures pulling at his feet.On the mountain, climbers escape into concentration as pure as a monk\u2019s repose. Life becomes detail: Click into the rope and unclick; secure boot crampons and dig for footholds. There is a whack of the ice pick and another one, and one after that. They scale 27,000-foot-high puzzles. Sometimes climbers go a day or two without food; sometimes they fail to notice.Kacper Tekieli is one of the climbers whom Max and I accompany to the Tatras. He has a tangle of dark curls and a mischievous smile, and is a philosophy major with a love of mountain literature. At 32, he has built a considerable mountaineering reputation, although he cannot afford to give up working as a barista in the old quarter of Krakow. He watched a friend slip to his death last year in the Himalayas; he\u2019s not sure he needs K2.Tekieli talks of the singular focus needed to summit a Himalayan peak in the maw of winter. The universe narrows to a meter or two. \u201cThere\u2019s something mystical. It\u2019s not about the mountain, which is inert. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s what you discover about yourself in all those hours of concentration.\u201dSix K2 climbers gather on a winter afternoon in a Warsaw gym under the eyes of a trainer, Karol Hennig, who works with state health institutes. He invites me to join. I decline, pleading a sore Achilles and a severe attack of common sense.The climbers range from their 30s to 63, and most are of modest build. They fill backpacks with iron bars and work stair-climbers. They do tortuous lifts and pull-ups.Their fingers and toes are as adhering as those of a gecko. They retain one-third more oxygen than a well-conditioned adult. After the workout, their heart rates return to baseline as easily as an elevator descends from one floor to the next.Two nights later, the Himalayan climbers are deep in the Tatras, taking a conditioning climb up the Monk, a saw-toothed 6,781-foot peak. Max the photographer is a skilled climber and accompanies them; I hike to an ice fall and wave goodbye. Janusz Golab is a force unto himself, climbing with precision and economy of motion, a strong-limbed cat.Marek Chmielarski, 40, is one of the Tatra climbers and will join the K2 team. He paints oil platforms from the North Sea to Azerbaijan. He chuckles at the mention of their oxygen-retention scores: \u201cJanusz scores pretty much at the bottom. And he has been to the top of K2 and is the best climber in Poland.\u201dThe climbers also monitor levels of vitamin D and iron, which help stave off hypobaric hypoxia, the process by which thin air deprives the body of replenishing oxygen.No one can be certain how a body will react at the top of the world. At K2 base camp, the air has half the oxygen found at sea level. At 26,000 feet, climbers enter the Death Zone; it is devilishly difficult to draw a breath, and the heart strains to pump blood. When climbers reach the summit, their breathing will be a shallow, fast pant. They will vomit and suffer dehydration and begin to hallucinate.Wielicki recalls a past-exhaustion night on a solo Himalayan climb. He huddled inside a tiny tent and made tea for two: himself and his companion, whose presence was no less intense for being imaginary. \u201cI felt him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, he was not there.\u201dK2 is a northern loner; it sits 800 miles northwest of Nepal\u2019s grand Himalayan peaks, exposed to winds that gust from the Arctic Circle. In February, its walls are colder and more wind-blasted than those of Everest.All of which brings us to climbing strategy.The favored mountaineering style today is Alpine, which is to say, going solo or with a partner, and without fixed ropes. A premium is placed on daring routes or the speed of the climb.None of that would work on K2 in February.The Poles mastered the dominant expedition style a half-century ago. It requires a willingness to subsume ego in the collective. If a team numbers 10 climbers, six will take the role of worker bees, laying pitons and ropes and tents at camps higher on the mountain.These men will scale cliffs of pre-collisional granite to 25,000 feet, even as K2 threatens a rain of avalanches. The summit team will pull up those ropes and sleep in those tents. As they draw within 3,000 feet of the peak, they will go forward without oxygen.How to prepare excites debate. I talk about this with Adam Bielecki, a tall drink of water with dreadlocks and a boyish ebullience. Age 33, married with a toddler and another baby on the way, he began climbing as a teenager. He is one of the elite, and a candidate to join the summit team.He overflows with ambition and chafes at old ways. Bielecki favors a bottom-of-the-world strategy to prepare: Send summit climbers to Chile, where it is summer, and climb a 22,000-foot Andean peak. Stay put until bodies accommodate to the thin air. Then fly to Pakistan and trek quickly to base camp.\u201cAll we need is three days of good weather and we will get to the top of K2,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a revolution in high-altitude climbing.\u201dBielecki attempted that strategy during a winter ascent of Nanga Parbat, a 26,660-foot mountain in Pakistan that goes by the self-explanatory nickname Killer Mountain. The climbers arrived acclimated, but a winter storm front descended and would not lift.The younger generation of climbers view Bielecki\u2019s strategy as a good gamble. When I put the question to Wielicki, the old legend sounds distinctly unconvinced. He sees a young climber too sure of himself. \u201cYou need super luck to come from South America and find the weather to your liking,\u201d he says.He offers a thin smile. \u201cYou cannot rely on super luck.\u201dPolish Himalayan exploration all but ended in 1989. Its greatest climber, Jerzy Kukuczka, fell to his death, and an avalanche on Everest swept away five other well-known Polish climbers.The Communist government collapsed. As that wounded nation rebuilt, an age of entrepreneurs dawned. The life of a vagabond climber seemed frivolous.Artur Hajzer was among the prematurely retired. Intense, a man of many faces, he had been a partner of the famed Kukuczka. After his friend died, he could face no more mountains. He opened a chain of climbing and outdoor stores.Restlessness welled; he yearned for the Himalayas. He began to run and lost his pot belly. He and Wielicki issued a manifesto: \u201cYoung, angry, ambitious\u201d Polish climbers should embrace \u201cpositive suffering\u201d and return to winter Himalayan climbing.Wielicki speaks of daily life as drained of excitement. \u201cJob, home, eh, O.K.,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to feel great emotion, you must write a story.\u201dThey offered traditional training: winter in the Tatras, then the Alps, then the Himalayas. Their obsession was very Polish: to conquer K2. They were not hand-holders. Bielecki courted Hajzer, emailing a list of his ascents, including climbs up 20,310-foot Denali in Alaska.\u201cYour list does not impress me at all,\u201d Hajzer wrote back.Bielecki sent a longer list. Hajzer relented, a little: \u201cO.K., it looks better than I thought.\u201dBielecki had found a mentor. \u201cHe could get angry really fast. He never said he was sorry, but he was fair,\u201d Bielecki says of his teacher. \u201cWe were generational orphans and he introduced us to Himalayan climbing.\u201cI loved him.\u201dGenerational tensions bubbled. The younger climbers had trained less and came of age in a time of individual branding. When apprentices returned from a Himalayan foray with severe frostbite, veteran mountaineers scoffed at the \u201cpreschool\u201d climbers.Success came rapid-fire, as did sorrow.In the winter of 2013, Bielecki and three others set out to ascend the 26,414-foot Broad Peak. Two grew exhausted near the top, and Bielecki noted that nightfall and still more crushing cold approached. Perhaps they should retreat. The others disagreed.Bielecki and his partner made it back to their tents, badly frostbitten. The slower duo perished.A Polish mountaineering commission assailed Bielecki: You violated the brotherhood of the rope and deserted comrades. This was a too-harsh indictment. To wait for others at 25,000 feet in minus-25 degree temperatures is deadly. Ice forms thick on nostrils and goggles. Water and power gels freeze solid. Hands, feet and arms go numb.A tomb forms around you.Bielecki\u2019s voice is plaintive. \u201cOn top of a mountain in Karakoram in winter, your state of mind eludes words,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are beyond the edge of what people call fatigue.\u201dMountain deaths are dominoes; one precipitates another. Soon after, Hajzer flew to the Himalayas intent on finding peace by climbing. He carried the weight of too many deaths.A storm coiled like a snake around a mountain. Hajzer lost sight of his young partner and descended quickly, looking for him. He lost his balance and fell 1,800 feet to his death.He was 51. His body remains in a Himalayan crevasse.\u201cIt was Artur\u2019s last lecture,\u201d a climber said at his funeral in a grand cathedral in Katowice. \u201cPeople die in the mountains, even the best ones.\u201dWielicki is the remaining master. He must choose among their climbing children, and his eye is unsparing. For the summit, he must choose the elect of the elite. There is Golab, the climber who was with us in the Tatras.Bielecki, the man-child with the otherworldly endurance near the summit, is another natural choice. But his hunger for fame is a bonfire, and that worries the older man. Wielicki defended the young climber after the deaths on Broad Peak. To listen to him is to wonder if he harbors doubts.\u201cHe is a very good climber, but he has climbed for himself,\u201d the older climber says. \u201cHe is pursuing me, I. Maybe it is a little strange on our team because we all must work together.\u201dIf a storm approaches, if darkness descends, the climbers must turn back, even if within sight of that fabled summit. \u201cIf I say, \u2018No, come down\u2019, they must listen,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone wants to be the best, and that is how we die.\u201dHe gives to ambition a nod of self-recognition.\u201cLogic competes with emotion. Everyone wants to write their own story.\u201dWe wander the medieval streets and bars of Krakow with the Himalayan climbers. The question of K2, to risk all for history, falls unevenly across their shoulders. Marek Chmielarski, that painter of oil platforms, will go, although his wife, a teacher, worries.\u201cThey think we are crazy.\u201d he says. \u201cThey are right, of course.\u201dGolab is in: \u201cSometimes I wonder why I am doing this. I don\u2019t like to connect nationalism and climbing. But these are my friends and we are on a mission.\u201dWe run into Kacper Tekieli, the other Tatra climber, making cappuccinos in a coffee bar off Krakow\u2019s grand square. He could join the elite four who summit K2. That mountain, mythical and moody and deadly, once consumed him.\u201cI was captivated,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the Polish specialty is suffering.\u201dHe grew up in Gdansk, a shipyard city, and came to climbing as a philosophy student. He took solo trips (known in Polish as the lonely style) across the high Tatras in winter. He climbed Alpine and Himalayan peaks. Last summer he lost a friend in the Indian Himalayas, watching him slip away as rescuers neared.\u201cI was very, very close to him when he fell.\u201d Tekieli\u2019s dark eyes flicker and he fingers his wedding band, which hangs on a leather cord around his neck. \u201cI will keep climbing, but I think I don\u2019t know the result of that yet.\u201dAnd K2? He shrugs. \u201cMountains are very important to me, it\u2019s the original world, a place of passion. I want to keep finding beautiful paths up mountains.\u201dHe pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I need K2 in winter.\u201dDays later, Wielicki, the old legend, and I watch snow fall on a frozen lake. He acknowledges the age of winter climbing could draw to a close. Danger weighs on him as it did not decades ago. His wife is adept on cliffs, and he twitches as she moves up a rock face. He is pleased his children have not inherited his passions.And yet, God, that mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the problem of the people in the Katowice club, but of the people of Poland. Always they ask: \u2018You go? Why not? You should write something historic. Finish your story\u2019.\u201dThose who stand within the shadow of that monolith in winter describe a sensation akin to having landed on an extraterrestrial world. All is black and white and gray with periodic wild flashes of razor-blue sky and sun. K2 sits 70 miles from the nearest village, at the end of a path that threads across the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers. Periodically these ice flows disgorge the bones of dead climbers.K2\u2019s fastness is so complete, it acquired no dependable name from the Balti tribes, who for millenniums did not know of its existence. A British geographer making a trigonometric survey gave the mountain its name, a clipped abstraction capturing its indifference to life and time.The Polish mountaineers will arrive in late December and will wait days and weeks and months in hopes that incessant winds do not rend their tents. Here and there, they will climb that fantastically steep mountain and lay rope lines on its sides. Then they will slip into sleeping bags in 30- and 40-below temperatures. They will update expedition pages on Facebook and send emails to wives and girlfriends and children.They will pray for a three-day break in the weather.Why climb it? I put the question to Bielecki. He knows better than most that glory is not the inevitable reward of the Himalayas.\u201cClimbing is about pleasure and pain \u2014 in winter that balance is lost,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no pleasure to be found in Karakoram in winter. You are uncomfortable every minute of every day. But the great emotion of making history, of making an accomplishment no one else did, that is immense, almost spiritual.\u201dIt\u2019s the allure of that diamond-hard and deadly pyramid in the deepest reaches of the Karakoram range.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Fight Back Against Revenge Porn", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byHolly Jacobs says her \u201cliving nightmare\u201d began in 2009.That year, she was the victim of a uniquely modern attack, having discovered intimate photos and a video, along with her personal details posted online.The material proliferated and the images were sent to a co-worker and her boss. She feared losing her job and being kicked out of graduate school, and she spent years on damage control.\u201cI can\u2019t really say that it ever ended. I\u2019m pretty sure that my images are still being posted, but I just stopped searching my name,\u201d she said.Ms. Jacobs is far from alone.For victims, fighting against such attacks can take years and prove costly. In Ms. Jacobs\u2019s case, the ordeal came to an end of sorts when she reached a legal settlement last summer, more than six years after it began.Here\u2019s a brief look at the advice she and others offer to women and men who find, or are threatened with, their most intimate images and videos being shared without their permission.The toll of nonconsensual porn can be severe, causing depression and post-traumatic stress. That\u2019s why advocates say victims should seek out support from a trusted friend, partner, family member, teacher, counselor or therapist.Ms. Jacobs had access to free counseling through her school, but many victims are not so fortunate. For them, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative maintains a 24-hour crisis hotline, (844) 878-2274, that can serve as a starting point.\u201cWe have counselors that are on the other end of that line to offer immediate counseling for the victim and then we take them through their options,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said.Many victims want nothing more than for their intimate photos and videos to be destroyed. But advocates encourage them to preserve the information in case they plan future legal action.(The group, a pro bono project of K&L Gates, the global firm where Ms. D\u2019Amico works, is not related to Ms. Jacobs\u2019s organization.)Some companies may, by request, retain information for future legal proceedings, while some law enforcement agencies may be able to collect forensic evidence, too. Ms. Jacobs recommends consulting a lawyer to better understand what evidence might be useful.And while the decision to prosecute lies with the government, victims can help by providing documentation. \u201cIn order to have a successful prosecution, you\u2019ve got to have evidence,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Amico said.But even when legal representation is free, there are emotional costs to pursuing civil action, said David Bateman, a K&L Gates lawyer who co-founded the pro bono group with Ms. D\u2019Amico. Going to trial can mean months or years of legal entanglement and public exposure, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a good tool if you need it, but 95 percent of the people we see just really want to get this stuff down and move on with their life,\u201d he said.After victims have considered their legal options, and, ideally, consulted a lawyer, they can focus on having the photos and videos taken down.Many major websites and online services, including Google, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter and Yahoo, ban nonconsensual porn and have processes for reporting it.For those daunted by the process, takedown services can do the work for a fee, or free.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Chooses a Leader, and Takes a Step Into the Unknown", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byInternal emails and other documents, some real, some fake, according to the campaign, were posted on 4chan, an online message board favored by white nationalists, in an apparent effort to aid his rival, Marine Le Pen, 48, the far-right leader.Saturday was a surreal day in France. The dramatic timing of the leaks, coming just as French law mandated a 44-hour media blackout before and during Sunday\u2019s critical presidential runoff, jolted the final hours of the race.Government officials warned that there could be charges filed against those who violated the law. The French media largely observed the blackout, offering little about the content of the hacking, which so far appeared to involve mostly mundane exchanges.Le Monde, the influential daily newspaper, posted a note explaining to readers that it had obtained the leaked documents but would not be publishing any of them before the vote, saying that they had been released \u201cwith the clear goal of harming the validity of the ballot.\u201dBut the hacking attack succeeded in sowing still more confusion in a race that was already among the most unpredictable in memory. Even before the last-minute attempt at sabotage, the election represented a big step into the political unknown for France \u2014 the first time in more than 50 years that neither of the establishment parties will be represented in the final round.Instead, voters will choose one of two starkly different candidates who have each pledged to change the system, though in radically different ways.Ms. Le Pen, a fierce nationalist, wants to take France out of the European Union and restore the franc. Mr. Macron, a centrist who formed his own party, En Marche!, wants to push market and labor reforms to make France more competitive and deepen its ties to the European Union.\u201cThe experienced politicians were rejected and now we have a new category of candidate,\u201d said Dominique Bussereau, a member of the mainstream right party Les Republicains.But for all the turmoil, whether either candidate will be able to muster broad legislative or popular support is in doubt \u2014 raising the real possibility that an election intended to shake the status quo could still result in stasis. Can either candidate, as an outsider, really be effective as president?Neither has ever held national elected office. Each lacks any real base of support in Parliament and will be trying to build one from the ground up. The president of France is powerful only if he or she has a majority in Parliament to help push through his or her party\u2019s program.That uncertainty may ripple through Europe, which will be watching closely to gauge both the strength of far-right forces in France and the depth of the anti-European Union sentiment.The differences between the candidates are so deep that the winner will surely be seen as a harbinger of Europe\u2019s future. Resentment of European Union rules and the failure of the bloc to wrestle with immigration and border controls were major issues in the campaign.Beyond France, the election will be critical in determining Europe\u2019s openness to the world and the fate of its generous social welfare benefits. It is being especially closely watched in Germany, which holds parliamentary elections in September, as well as in Italy, which could also hold elections this year.In particular, a close eye will be kept on Ms. Le Pen\u2019s share of the vote, which will serve as a gauge of the current strength of the populist tide that last year ushered Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump to power in the United States.In the final polls, Mr. Macron was heavily favored to win \u2014 by as much as 20 percentage points. Still, the polls come after a long season of staggering electoral upsets around the world and in the face of the last-minute hacking of Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign accounts.Analysts were unsure what the impact of the hacking might be. Thomas Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, a political-science professor at Sciences Po, one of France\u2019s best universities, said the hacking was part of a larger trend in France toward \u201can Americanization of French politics,\u201d citing scandals, leaks and fake news, as well as increased focus on the images of the candidates.But he said that if the attack was meant to benefit Ms. Le Pen, it could backfire by putting \u201ca very ugly shadow on the far right.\u201dIt is still unclear how the attack will be viewed by voters. On French social media, the tone of tweets and Facebook posts was more mocking than outraged, and many French people seemed unaware of the hacking.\u201cI didn\u2019t know about the leaks but now that I know about it, it won\u2019t change my vote,\u201d said Audrey Payet, a 33-year-old day care worker, in central Paris. She said she planned on abstaining because she did not want to choose between \u201ca racist party and a banker party.\u201dNo matter who wins, the country will be abandoning a political order that has shaped it for the last 59 years, when it was dominated by the country\u2019s two mainstream parties \u2014 the Socialist Party and the center-right Republicans. This election has been shaped by new issues and resulted in an electorate effectively divided into quarters across the political spectrum, including left and right extremes and Mr. Macron\u2019s new centrist movement, En Marche! (\u201cOn Our Way!\u201d).\u201cWe are changing into a four-party system that has never existed before in France in the Fifth Republic, and that does not exist elsewhere in large European countries,\u201d Mr. Bussereau said.A big question now is where those voters will turn \u2014 to the center with Mr. Macron or farther to the right with Ms. Le Pen. Also in play are the 19 percent of voters who went in the first round with the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. Many of his voters may abstain, in effect aiding Ms. Le Pen.Both the far left and the far right were animated by their deep resistance to globalization \u2014 be that economic, cultural or related to immigration \u2014 and it became a clear dividing line in the campaign. The issue has become a new and increasingly important political fissure in France and in Europe more broadly, and is breaking down traditional left-right political divisions. Instead, the political spectrum is being divided among winners and losers.\u201cIt\u2019s a consequence of the social-economic impact of globalization,\u201d Mr. Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, the political scientist, said. \u201cMore and more people are feeling precarious.\u201dThat much was clear in the outcome of the first round of voting.Ms. Le Pen and her far-right National Front hewed to a hard protectionist, anti-European line and took a strongly nationalist position on French identity. She depicted herself as a \u201cpatriot.\u201d Mr. Macron openly embraced the European Union, calling for more integration, saying that France was already part of the global community, its immigrants inextricably a part of the nation\u2019s fabric.\u201cThere is not a French culture \u2014 there is a culture in France and it is diverse,\u201d Mr. Macron said at a rally in Lyon.Even if Mr. Macron wins handily, as projected, his victory will chiefly reflect voters\u2019 opposition to Ms. Le Pen and the National Front. The party remains anathema to large parts of the French electorate, in view of its history of anti-Semitism, racism, and apologias for France\u2019s collaborators with the Nazis.Yet the lines that now fissure French politics mean that neither of the two candidates facing each other in the runoff Sunday received even a quarter of the votes in the first round. Mr. Macron took 24 percent and Ms. Le Pen took 21 percent. That suggests that no matter who wins, their overall support will be relatively narrow.\u201cEven if he wins 60 percent of the vote, that does not mean that 60 percent of the French have voted for Emmanuel Macron,\u201d said Alexis Massart, director of the European School of Political and Social Science at the University of Lille. \u201cA part of that 60 percent voted against Marine Le Pen,\u201d he said.That will leave Mr. Macron, if he does succeed Sunday, in a vulnerable position. While the outcome of the first round was a political earthquake for France, just how big remains to be seen.For now, the French electorate seems more divided than at any time in recent memory. Much will hang on parliamentary elections in June \u2014 an electoral one-two punch that gives voters yet another chance to consider the direction of the country, with the potential to either thrust France forward or prolong the ongoing paralysis.Pamela Rougerie and Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Computer Coding Classes Swell, So Does Cheating", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byFor a simple assignment, writing code that would allow one computer to visit web pages located on another, two students in H. E. Dunsmore\u2019s class at Purdue University turned in nearly 100 identical lines of code. Was it a fluke? Or had they cheated?As he looked over their work, Mr. Dunsmore, a veteran computer science professor, saw what he called the smoking gun:boolean done = true; while (!done) {\u201cThis is pretty strong evidence that one had copied the other,\u201d Mr. Dunsmore said. \u201cThey later both confessed to collusion.\u201dCollege students have flooded into computer science courses across the country, recognizing them as an entree to coveted jobs at companies like Facebook and Google, not to mention the big prize: a start-up worth millions.The exploding interest in these courses, though, has coincided with an undesirable side effect: a spate of high-tech collegiate plagiarism. Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internet.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,\u201d said Randy H. Katz, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying code.Computer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course, and, like colleagues in other subjects, deploy software to flag plagiarism. They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheating.At Brown University, more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer science.At Stanford, the alma mater of the founders of Google, Snapchat and countless other internet wonders, as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheating.In interviews, professors and students said the causes were not hard to pin down.\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option to copy from the internet,\u201d said Jackson Wagner, who took the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why people cheat.\u201dComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers, which encourages code-sharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class. Professors also frequently allow students to discuss problems among themselves, but not to share actual code, a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheating.The executive committee at Yale, where five students were accused of copying code last fall, though a couple had charges withdrawn, acknowledged as much.\u201cIt is often such a complex task to read these guidelines,\u201d wrote the committee chairman, Paul North, a professor of German, \u201cthat the code to be written seems simple in comparison.\u201dPenalties can be as small as a zero on an assignment, which is what the Purdue students received; they were also docked a letter in the course\u2019s final grade. (Dr. Dunsmore credits awareness of such penalties with a reduction in cheating in his courses over the last decade.) More serious or repeated infractions can lead to failing the course, or even suspension.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly that a lot of computer science professors actually check,\u201d said Alex Aiken, who heads the computer science department at Stanford.Though coding is a foreign language to most people, the principles of plagiarism are the same as with papers written in English.Sometimes it is acceptable for lines of code to be identical, if the code is performing a routine task or one that cannot be done a different way. But other times it is a red flag.struct visit_list node; node.row = row; node.col = col; node.next = NULL;Someone copying the code, he said, might render it this way:struct rooms_visited room; room.r = r; room.c = c; room.link = 0;At Harvard, David J. Malan, the CS50 professor, introduced a \u201cregret clause,\u201d letting students who cheat and admit it within 72 hours receive an unsatisfactory or failing grade on the assignment, and avoid further discipline \u2014 unless they do it again.Professor Malan said one reason for the large number of cases was that instructors were scrutinizing students\u2019 work more carefully than before. He also said that since students could use the regret clause, instructors felt more comfortable going to the honor council when students had passed up that chance.He referred questions about the outcomes of the cheating complaints to a university spokeswoman, who said she could not discuss the cases because of student privacy.Two Harvard students who said they were familiar with some of the violations, and who wanted to be anonymous for fear of repercussions from the university, described one of the more blatant examples: A student submitted code using a computer language, PHP, that had been taught in a previous year, but not last fall.Some students suggested that in other cases there was a fine line between reasonable sharing and improper copying, particularly because the professor encourages students to discuss problems with one another.\u201cThere is a gray area as to how much help one can get,\u201d said Javier Cuan-Martinez, the president of the Harvard Computer Society, who took the course two years ago.Professor Malan, in an email, said the guidelines in the course syllabus were clear. One rule says that when asking for help, you may have your code viewed by others, but you may not view theirs. \u201cWhenever a line is actually crossed,\u201d Professor Malan wrote, \u201cit\u2019s often that one.\u201dStephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fat Start-Up", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn 2003, Keith Rabois, a longtime Silicon Valley investor and executive, had an ambitious idea: He wanted to start a website that would instantly offer a fair price for your home. If you accepted the offer, the site would agree to buy your house immediately, closing the deal in a matter of days.To Mr. Rabois, the plan seemed obvious: Homes are the most expensive possession many of us own, and yet they are also the most difficult to trade on \u2014 to sell in a hurry if you need to relocate or are otherwise looking for quick cash. But tech could solve that. By analyzing lots of sales data, a company could come up with an accurate price for most homes; then the start-up could buy houses quickly, charge people a convenience fee and sell the homes over a longer period of time.There was just one problem: Back then, Silicon Valley was in the middle of a post-dot-com bust and nobody would fund such an expensive plan. So Mr. Rabois sat on the idea for more than a decade. Then in 2014, amid flusher times, he and several partners opened the home-buying company, called Opendoor. Opendoor has since raised more than $300 million in equity and has also taken out more than $500 million in debt. It plans to be in 10 markets by year\u2019s end.In the process, Opendoor also has become a model for a new kind of tech upstart: Call it the fat start-up.But modern capital markets have since unlocked far grander opportunities for tech entrepreneurs. They are blessed with essentially unlimited access to money, and ideas that once seemed too expensive, too risky or just too crazy are now getting off the ground. These start-ups are fat \u2014 with capital, with industry-altering ambition and, to their critics, often more than a little hubris.Opendoor fits that mold. Its plan is precarious: It faces rising competition, high operating costs and \u2014 because we are talking about the market that caused the global financial crisis \u2014 the possibility of an unforeseen blowup. But if it works, Opendoor could be transformative; by making buying and selling houses as easy as buying and selling cars, it might thoroughly alter the American economy and change how we think of homeownership.\u201cReal estate is a $25 trillion asset class \u2014 people spend more on housing than food, transit, health care and education,\u201d said Eric Wu, a founder and the chief executive of Opendoor. \u201cWe think we can make it work much better than it does now.\u201dSo far, Opendoor is growing quickly. In broad strokes, the service works exactly like Mr. Rabois\u2019s original vision. If you want to sell a home in Opendoor\u2019s price range, you go to the site, type in your address, answer a few questions and then wait for an email.The company has data scientists who have developed a sophisticated system for modeling home prices. Opendoor focuses on the middle of the market, and will neither buy distressed homes nor luxury homes, for which pricing dynamics aren\u2019t predictable. If your house meets its criteria, it will send you an offer meant to reflect the best estimate of your home\u2019s value.The offer comes with costs. If you use a traditional real estate agent, you pay a commission of around 5 percent to 6 percent of the sales price (the commission is split between the buyer\u2019s agent and the seller\u2019s agent). Opendoor charges an average commission of around 7.5 percent (it pays a portion of it to real estate agents).For the extra fee, you get certainty: Opendoor will close on the sale of your house in three days, clearing the way for you to relocate, buy a new house or, who knows, leave the country in case of political instability. It will also let you lease back your house if you need extra time, a convenient feature if, say, your new house needs some work.A surprising number of people are saying yes to Opendoor\u2019s offer. Mr. Wu said that about 30 percent of people who request an offer decide to take it. Opendoor declined to provide revenue or growth numbers, but because housing sales data is public, outside analysts have been able to track the company\u2019s progress. Once it buys your house, the company makes necessary repairs and then puts it up for sale. On average, it sells the house within about 90 days.The company has been streamlining other parts of the real estate process. The houses it sells are fitted with internet-enabled cameras, sensors and door locks, allowing potential buyers to unlock the home with Opendoor\u2019s app and come and go as they please. (I tested this on a visit to Phoenix in December; it was quite handy.) It also started a mortgage brokerage operation, so buyers can speed up their access to capital \u2014 a potential precursor to offering home financing on its own.Opendoor is aiming to stay ahead by offering a more customer-friendly service and by rapidly expanding. Mr. Wu argues that as the company grows, Opendoor will be able to unlock more efficiencies in its business, allowing it to reduce its commission much further \u2014 even approaching parity with the traditional sales process.\u201cThere is obviously substantial appeal for this product,\u201d Mr. Mahapatra said. \u201cBut my question would be, \u2018Is there a way that other players in this space might reproduce this seamlessness, but be less expensive?\u2019\u201dFinally, there\u2019s the nightmare scenario: a real estate crash. Part of the reason Opendoor is expanding to new markets is to avoid the vicissitudes of the business. Opendoor\u2019s biggest liability is all the houses it owns; if some kind of disaster were to befall Phoenix and home sales cratered there, Opendoor would find itself holding hundreds of houses it couldn\u2019t sell. By operating in several markets, Mr. Wu said, the company could insulate itself from local crashes.What if there\u2019s a nationwide correction? Mr. Wu said his team had run simulations on previous crashes, including in 2008, and had found one of two scenarios: On the one hand, the business might slow down for a few years, then pick up as the market does. Or it might even do better, because sellers would decide to pay a higher premium to get a certain offer.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that we might thrive in times of volatility,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Sound crazy? Yeah, well, we\u2019re talking about a website that will make an offer on your house, sight unseen. Everything about it is crazy. But that\u2019s the tech business these days, and who knows \u2014 it could work.An earlier version of this column misstated Opendoor\u2019s operating procedure. It will make an offer on your house sight unseen, but it will not close the deal without seeing it.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Viewers Drift Online, Advertisers Hold Fast to Broadcast TV", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byTV ratings are collapsing. Media stocks are falling. Cord cutting is accelerating.There has been no shortage of bad headlines for television networks over the last few months, as investors grow concerned over dropping viewership and as people increasingly find new ways to entertain themselves.Yet while audience attention has drifted toward platforms like Netflix, Facebook and YouTube, there is one group of stubborn holdouts who are not ready to give up on broadcast television: advertisers.This week, as ad buyers cram into New York institutions like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall to watch the broadcast networks talk up a new TV season, they will again prepare to spend as much as $9 billion to be a part of it. Though the market may be cooling this year, a significant drop is not expected.A reasonable person might ask how, in 2017, is that remotely possible?\u201cIt will continue to move forward this way as long as it works,\u201d said Lyle Schwartz, the president of investment for North America at GroupM, the ad buying arm of the advertising conglomerate WPP.But isn\u2019t buying a 30-second spot on television a little, well, out of date?As a media analyst at Pivotal Research, Brian Wieser, put it, advertising on TV is \u201cas archaic as water flowing through pipes.\u201d\u201cYou could set up a drone to take water from a reservoir and use fascinating technology and cutting-edge approaches to deliver it, but there\u2019s a good reason we use these systems,\u201d he said.In interviews, ad buyers and television executives pointed to a variety of reasons that advertisers remain attracted to ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS. Ratings aside, television still reaches more people and provides a reliable way for an ad to be seen on a full screen with sound. There is a limited amount of inventory, in contrast to the endless reach of the web, and marketers know rates will spike if they wait to buy airtime.It also does not hurt that Facebook and YouTube have had trouble in recent months with ads showing up next to objectionable content.\u201cSales directors at the networks are going to say, \u2018We have premium content that is professionally produced, and it\u2019s been vetted and won\u2019t be an issue for your brand to be associated with it,\u2019\u201d said Brad Adgate, a veteran media analyst. \u201cWith Google and Facebook, you\u2019ve seen stuff where they\u2019ve had to say that they have to do a better job.\u201dStill, there are serious questions about how sustainable all of this is. Trend lines certainly suggest things could go in the other direction. Networks are having trouble showing how many people are watching their content across a wide variety of platforms, audiences are growing accustomed to platforms where they can watch shows without commercials, and marketers are eager to find better ways to target potential customers.And at present, broadcast television is holding an edge thanks to an older audience. The median age for scripted TV\u2019s No. 1 show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and one of its top reality shows, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d is 55. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, ratings in broadcast television fell by 11 percent this season.\u201cIf you just look at where the business is going, we\u2019re in a transitional phase now where to a large degree, boomers are keeping television as we define it today afloat,\u201d said Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment.Advertisers are aware that this may not last forever.GroupM predicted that digital platforms would be taking a growing share of new advertising dollars. Still, even though digital players are surging, television remains the established elder statesman for advertisers. GroupM noted that television accounted for 42 percent of advertising investments last year, compared with 31 percent for digital.The sophistication of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s ability to target ads is no small matter, though, and TV networks have been scrambling to find ways to compete in that arena.Digital companies are capable of targeting audiences so narrow that they can pinpoint, say, Idaho residents in long-distance relationships who are contemplating buying a minivan. (Facebook\u2019s ads manager says that description matches 3,100 people.)As attractive as that slicing and dicing can be, television appears to have an advantage in terms of the actual commercial time it can offer marketers.\u201cIt\u2019s great if I can target someone I know is a truck driver who searched for the word \u2018truck\u2019 who visited my site a lot, but where do I get them to watch my ad?\u201d asked Joe Marchese, the newly named head of ad sales for Fox Networks Group. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make him or her watch it?\u201dAnd television still offers an enormous audience.\u201cThe number of minutes we show commercials is way more than YouTube or Facebook on a video basis \u2014 many multiples more,\u201d Mr. Marchese said.Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s largest advertising companies, said the millions who saw commercials on a hit show like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d could also be more valuable.\u201cIf you basically put that same advertising, say a million dollars, within Facebook and Google, the reality of it is that people are going to see those things in a very splintered fashion,\u201d he said.The so-called upfront season offers advertisers a chance to buy the bulk of their ads before marquee shows return in September. This creates a level of competition that advertisers cannot help but participate in.It also fosters a power dynamic that probably sounds foreign to a generation of consumers who tend to see automatically placed ads on YouTube content that could have been made a day earlier by anyone.\u201cWhat the networks do say is: \u2018Great, I\u2019m going to invite all my potential clients and clients to a room at the same time on the same day where I\u2019m going to show my shows that I may or may not actually put up this fall and may not keep for two episodes,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201c\u2018And I\u2019m going to make you sit next to your competitors and basically say here\u2019s the price of it, and if you don\u2019t pay this price now, it\u2019s going to cost you 30 percent more in six months.\u2019\u201dMass marketers aiming to drive people to, say, their stores or car dealerships rely on long-held TV plans to align with their product launches, and pulling out could be both expensive and risky.\u201cThe reason it\u2019s priced high and reason you have to buy in advance is because your competitors might buy it out,\u201d Mr. Morgan continued. It\u2019s like the Cold War but for brands, he said, adding, \u201cIf they have a bunch of missiles, you need a bunch more missiles.\u201dAnd so, for a week in mid-May, the networks still have the upper hand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Possible to Resist Deportation in Trump\u2019s America?", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "FeatureLiving under draconian state laws, Arizona activists honed an effective strategy for keeping undocumented immigrants in the country. Can the same tools still work today?Supported byGarc\u00eda Aguilar and her family \u2014 her husband and two children \u2014 squeezed together with four Puente staff members into the cramped little office that the group uses for private consultations. Carlos Garcia, Puente\u2019s executive director, had bought a fresh pack of cigarettes right before the talk; he needed nicotine to carry him through the discomfort of telling Garc\u00eda Aguilar that she would almost certainly be deported on Wednesday. Until that moment, she and her family had not wanted to believe that the executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 25 had made her expulsion a priority. She had been living in the United States for 22 years, since she was 14 years old; she was the mother of two American citizens; she had missed being eligible for DACA by just a few months. Suddenly, none of that counted anymore.Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s troubles with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began in 2008, after police raided Golfland Sunsplash, the amusement park in Mesa, Ariz., where she worked. She spent three months in jail and three months in detention. (ICE booked her under the last name \u201cGarc\u00eda de Rayos.\u201d) In 2013, an immigration court ordered her removal. Yet under pressure from Puente, which ultimately filed a class-action lawsuit contending that Maricopa County\u2019s work-site raids were unconstitutional, ICE allowed Garc\u00eda Aguilar (and dozens of others) to remain in Arizona under what is known as an order of supervision. ICE could stay her removal because the Obama administration\u2019s guidelines for the agency specified terrorists and violent criminals as priorities for deportation. But Trump\u2019s January orders effectively vacated those guidelines; one order specifically instructed that \u201caliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed.\u201d Garc\u00eda Aguilar, who had a felony for using a fabricated Social Security number, was unlikely to be spared.Orders of supervision are similar to parole; undocumented immigrants who have them must appear before ICE officers periodically for \u201ccheck-ins.\u201d Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s next check-in was scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 8. She had three options, Garcia explained. She could appear as usual and hope for the best. She could try to hide. Or she could put up a fight, either from a place of sanctuary or by appearing for her check-in amid media coverage that Puente would organize on her behalf. Whatever she decided, he said, she would be wise to spend Tuesday preparing for separation from her children.The family was devastated. Garc\u00eda Aguilar left the meeting red-faced with tears.The next day a dozen activists gathered at Puente to strategize for Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s case. After reviewing the logistics for the usual public maneuvers \u2014 Facebook post, news release, online petition, sidewalk rally, Twitter hashtag, phone campaign \u2014 they debated the pros and cons of using civil disobedience. In the final years of the Obama administration, activists in Arizona had come to rely on \u201cC.D.,\u201d as they called it, to make their dissatisfaction known. Puente members had blocked roads and chained themselves in front of the entrance to Phoenix\u2019s Fourth Avenue Jail. Yet Francisca Porchas, one of Puente\u2019s organizers, worried about setting an unrealistic precedent with its membership. \u201cFor Lupita we go cray-cray and then everyone expects that,\u201d she said. What would they do if Puente members wanted them to risk arrest every time one of them had a check-in?Ernesto Lopez argued that they needed to take advantage of this rare opportunity. A week earlier, thousands of people had swarmed airports around the country to protest the executive order barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the ban, but for everything else it\u2019s dead,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cNobody is talking about people getting deported. In a couple of months, it won\u2019t be possible to get that media attention.\u201dGarcia wasn\u2019t sure a rally for Garc\u00eda Aguilar would work. \u201cWe\u2019re literally in survival mode,\u201d Garcia told me that week. It was too early to tell how ICE would behave under Trump, but they were braced for the worst. Nobody had a long-term plan yet. Even as he and his staff moved to organize the news conference, his mind kept running through the possibilities: Would it help Garc\u00eda Aguilar stay with her family? Would it snowball into an airport-style protest? Would it cause ICE to double down on her deportation? He decided it was worth trying.That night a handful of protesters tried to block several vans as they sped from the building\u2019s side exit. More protesters came running from an ICE decoy bus that had initially distracted those attending the vigil out front. Manuel Salda\u00f1a, an Army veteran who did two tours in Afghanistan, planted himself on the ground next to one van\u2019s front tire, wrapping his arms and legs around the wheel. The driver looked incredulous; if he moved the van forward now, he would break one of Salda\u00f1a\u2019s legs. Peering through the van windows with cellphone flashlights, protesters found Garc\u00eda Aguilar sitting in handcuffs. The crowd doubled in size. \u201cThose shifty [expletive],\u201d Ybarra Maldonado said as he stared at the van. ICE, he said, had never notified him that her stay of deportation had been denied.Four hours later, Garc\u00eda Aguilar was gone. After the Phoenix Police arrested seven people and dispersed the crowd, ICE took her to Nogales, Mexico. By then images of Garc\u00eda Aguilar and the protest were already all over television and social media. She and her children became celebrities within the immigrant rights movement. Carlos Garcia, who was with her in Nogales, told me that Mexican officials stalked her hotel, hoping to snag a photo. \u201cEveryone wanted to be the one to help her,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wanted a piece.\u201d Later that month, her children \u2014 Jacqueline, 14, and Angel, 16 \u2014 sat in the audience of Trump\u2019s first address to Congress, guests of two Democratic representatives from Arizona, Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Ruben Gallego.During the Obama years, most immigrant rights organizations focused on big, idealistic legislation: the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform, neither of which ever made it through Congress. But Puente kept its focus on front-line battles against police-ICE collaboration. For Garcia, who was undocumented until a stepfather adopted him at 16, the most important thing is simply to contest all deportations, without exception. He estimates that Puente has had a hand in stopping about 300 deportations in Arizona since 2012.Ever since Arizona passed Senate Bill 1070, one of the toughest anti-undocumented bills ever signed into law, the state has been known for pioneering the kind of draconian tactics that the Trump administration is now turning into federal policy. But if Arizona has been a testing ground for the nativist agenda, it has also been an incubator for resistance to it. Among the state\u2019s many immigrant rights groups, Puente stands out as the most seasoned and most confrontational. In the weeks and months following Election Day 2016 \u2014 as progressive groups suddenly found themselves on defense, struggling to figure out how to handle America\u2019s new political landscape \u2014 Garcia was inundated with calls for advice. He flew around the country for training sessions with field organizers, strategy meetings with lawyers and policy experts and an off-the-record round table with Senators Dick Durbin and Bernie Sanders in Washington. A soft-spoken man with a stoic demeanor and a long, black ponytail, Garcia was also stunned by Trump\u2019s victory. But organizers in Phoenix had one clear advantage. \u201cAll the scary things that folks are talking about,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen before.\u201d On Nov. 9, he likes to say, the country woke up in Arizona.That year Arizona\u2019s undocumented population reached roughly half a million people. In Maricopa County, Sheriff Joseph Arpaio aimed to make that number plummet. He directed police to conduct \u201ccrime suppression\u201d sweeps in predominantly Latino neighborhoods and to raid businesses. During sweeps, police would often detain Latinos for minor offenses like honking a car horn, then demand proof of legal residence.Maricopa County voters appeared delighted with his tactics; for a time, \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d was the most popular elected official in the state. Support for him may have been abetted by Arizona\u2019s dismal economy. Phoenix had been one of the centers of the building boom; in 2006, business owners in the state said they needed a Mexican guest-worker program to meet the demand for cheap manual labor. But in the spring of 2007, Arizona\u2019s housing market began to crater. In 2008, the state had 117,000 foreclosures, the third-\u200bhighest number in the country.For readers of Mexican-American history, this sudden hardening of attitudes toward the undocumented was unsurprising: America has long maintained a love-hate relationship with Spanish-speaking labor. During the Great Depression, at least one million Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans were forcibly repatriated. The following decade, the United States began importing 4.6 million Mexicans to satisfy labor shortages in agricultural fields. But even as that program continued in the 1950s, President Eisenhower\u2019s administration sent another one million back to Mexico by truck, train and ship in a roundup known as \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201dNear Miami, Ariz., a young Alfredo Gutierrez and his family escaped capture by camping in the mountains. \u201cOne of the reasons they got away with repatriation and they got away with Wetback was because there was no resistance,\u201d Gutierrez, who later became an Arizona state senator, told me. \u201cEveryone of that era will tell you how they hid.\u201d But when Arpaio came for the undocumented, many of them argued for their right to stay. This transformation was due, in great part, to Puente.During its early years, Puente planned protest marches, organized boycotts against local businesses that supported Arpaio and ran know-your-rights classes in Spanish. When Arizona Republicans passed S.B.1070 in 2010, Puente and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network began a national boycott that was estimated to cost Arizona over $200 million in canceled business conferences; 100,000 people marched against the bill in Phoenix. T-shirts with the slogan \u201cLegalize Arizona\u201d popped up in places like Chicago and New York.But after S.B.1070\u2019s \u201cpapers please\u201d law overcame court battles and went into effect in September 2012 \u2014 three months after the Obama administration created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 collaborations between Puente and ADAC increased. In Arizona, the police were now obligated to question anyone that they had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to believe was undocumented. As a result, a new wave of undocumented residents, including many Dreamers\u2019 parents, found themselves snared in deportation proceedings.Andiola\u2019s own mother, Maria Guadalupe Arreola, was stopped while driving in Mesa in September 2012; the police passed her information along to ICE. Three months later, ICE agents appeared at the family\u2019s home and took Arreola away in handcuffs. Andiola responded by flipping open her laptop and filming a video that she posted to social media. Within hours of her mother\u2019s arrest, the hashtags #WeAreAndiola and #SomosAndiola were rousing people over Facebook and Twitter. ICE\u2019s office in Phoenix was flooded with calls. Messages also poured into the Department of Homeland Security from Washington; hours before ICE had banged on her door, Andiola was hired by an Arizona congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema.The next morning, as Arreola sat on a bus headed for Nogales, protesters rallied outside of ICE\u2019s Phoenix office, drawing television crews. The bus driver received a phone call. The bus turned around. A few hours later, Arreola was released with an order of supervision signed by ICE\u2019s field-office director, Katrina Kane. Jose Luis Pe\u00f1alosa, the lawyer who represented Arreola at the time, believes the directive to reverse the deportation must have come directly from Washington.Under Obama, Andiola told me, the primary strategy had been to create a well-publicized \u201cmoral dilemma\u201d between Obama\u2019s pro-immigrant rhetoric and his aggressive immigration enforcement \u2014 exactly what she had done with her mother. Such dilemmas could provoke ICE to use prosecutorial discretion to stop a removal.By 2014, however, such maneuvers rarely worked. After Obama won re-election and Democrats lost the midterms, Washington was less susceptible to public shaming. Phone campaigns and news conferences no longer resulted in release. \u201cWe got to a point where the legal strategy, the political strategy wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Andiola said, \u201cso we had to begin using our bodies in civil disobedience.\u201d In August 2013, ADAC stopped an ICE bus full of deportees in Phoenix, delaying their removal. In 2014 Andiola and Garcia were arrested together during a hunger strike outside ICE\u2019s field office.By then Andiola had left her leadership position at ADAC, whose board at that time disapproved of its members\u2019 involvement in non-Dreamer cases. She also abandoned the job as a congressional staffer, frustrated by the lack of movement on comprehensive immigration reform. When people facing deportation petitioned her for help, as scores did through Facebook, she sent them to Puente, which her own mother joined. \u201cPuente and us were trying to do the same thing with parents,\u201d Andiola said. ADAC could no longer help them, but Puente would.But after what happened with Garc\u00eda Aguilar, Andiola knew that the tactics she used to stave off her mother\u2019s deportation in 2013 would no longer work. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen,\u201d Andiola said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to care.\u201d The week ICE deported Garc\u00eda Aguilar, more than 600 undocumented immigrants were picked up in raids across the country. This in itself wasn\u2019t unusual: ICE surges had occurred many times during Obama\u2019s presidency, including, notoriously, over New Year\u2019s weekend 2016. Yet because Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had promised millions of deportations, the surge could now be spun as a change in federal policy. Trump himself basked in the news. \u201cThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise,\u201d he tweeted that Sunday. \u201cGang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve always had these really broad laws so what the history really is about is what the executive wants to enforce,\u201d Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at U.C.L.A., told me, recalling the Palmer Red Raids of 1919 and 1920 and the Japanese internment camps of the 1940s. \u201cRight now, we see the swing of the pendulum back to the harshest possible interpretation.\u201d The velocity of this swing is possible because most of the victories achieved by the undocumented during Obama\u2019s administration depended upon the use of prosecutorial discretion.Until the 1970s, immigration officials staunchly denied that they ever allowed any illegal immigrant to remain in the country with their approval. Prosecutorial discretion was exposed only after President Richard Nixon tried to throw John Lennon, the former Beatle, out of the country before the 1972 elections. (Nixon feared that Lennon, who opposed the war in Vietnam, might turn younger voters against him.) In the course of defending Lennon \u2014 as the Penn State law professor Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia details in her book, \u201cBeyond Deportation\u201d \u2014 his lawyer, Leon Wildes, unearthed a trove of documents proving the existence of a hidden \u201cdeferred action\u201d program, which allowed immigration officials to use prosecutorial discretion to grant \u201cnonpriority\u201d status to individuals on humanitarian grounds. After Wildes spotlighted the program, he won deferred action for Lennon, allowing one of the world\u2019s most famous musicians to stay in the United States long enough to gain lawful permanent residence.Until Obama came into office, gaining \u201cdeferred action\u201d or \u201cnonpriority\u201d status required the help of a savvy immigration lawyer. \u201cI used to call it the invisible sword,\u201d Wadhia told me, noting that, outside the DACA program, there has never been any official form to fill out or fee to pay in order to win deferred action. Obama did not invent prosecutorial discretion, but he did make it more transparent and accessible, standing in the Rose Garden to announce how his administration had used it to create a deferred-action program for Dreamers. Trump cannot destroy prosecutorial discretion \u2014 it\u2019s what allows a district attorney to ignore shoplifting so she can focus on murders \u2014 but his administration can pressure ICE officials to resist appeals to exercise it favorably.And that\u2019s exactly what many believe has happened. In the past, when Washington-based officials pressured ICE supervisors to reverse decisions, as seems to have happened in Arreola\u2019s case, ICE agents had little recourse. Even immigration judges could find their orders for deportation halted by prosecutorial discretion, as in the case of Garc\u00eda Aguilar. But those roadblocks have been undone. \u201cSome 60,000 agents, they have been chafing at prosecutorial-discretion memos,\u201d Paromita Shah, the associate director of the National Immigration Project, told me in November.In fact, Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation was just the first of many cases in which undocumented residents who were granted nonpriority status found themselves deported when they appeared for routine check-ins. ICE now commonly instructs people to appear for check-ins with passports, which makes their deportation easier. With prosecutorial discretion held out of reach, Garcia told me, \u201conce ICE decides to deport someone, it\u2019s nearly impossible to get them out of their grasp.\u201dAfter Arpaio fully lost his 287(g) status in 2011 amid allegations of abuse, he allowed ICE to install an agent inside central booking at the Fourth Avenue Jail in Phoenix. Because that agent could question anyone charged with any offense right after fingerprinting, Castro told me, most undocumented people who are arrested in Maricopa County have an ICE hold on them by the time they are arraigned. Last year, ICE requested the detention of 3,483 people in Maricopa County jails. The signs lying around the room were for Puente\u2019s May Day march, the theme of which was \u201cICE out of Fourth Avenue.\u201dLast fall many assumed that Trump would instigate huge roundups of the undocumented, \u00e1 la Operation Wetback. Yet so far, the process for deportations in Arizona has mostly followed the pattern set by Arpaio; the undocumented are first caught by the police. (Nationally, however, ICE\u2019s noncriminal arrests have increased 157 percent compared to the first four months of 2016.) \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have to do much to deport anyone he wants to because Obama has already built this machinery for him,\u201d Garcia told me. Under Obama, 287(g) agreements proliferated. In 2006, ICE was allocated $5 million to implement such agreements. A year into Obama\u2019s first term, that number shot up to $68 million, though it was reduced to $24 million in 2014.Obama deported nearly three million undocumented immigrants, more than any president in American history. For Puente, one of the stranger outcomes of Trump\u2019s election is that, for the first time, they stand a chance of dismantling some police-ICE collaborations. Fighting individual deportation cases has become harder, but policy battles have gained traction in Phoenix, where Democrats still hold significant power. \u201cNow it\u2019s convenient for Democrats to shame a deportation,\u201d Garcia told me.Under Obama, he speculated, many Democrats were reluctant to oppose any of the president\u2019s policies. Under Trump, they saw political advantage in talking about deportations, sanctuary cities and immigrant rights \u2014 especially now that the undocumented had found new allies. When Garcia helped assemble the coalition United Against Hate after Trump\u2019s victory in November, 56 groups signed up. That same month, Paul Penzone defeated Joe Arpaio at the polls. For Garcia, who began his activism under President George W. Bush, one great lesson of the past eight years is that Democrats are unreliable allies, willing to place other policy goals, like the Affordable Care Act, above the needs of the undocumented. \u201cNeither party is our friend,\u201d he said. But the two-party system, he knew, could be played to Puente\u2019s advantage as it pushed for Phoenix to do more cite-and-release actions instead of arrests and as it argued for school boards to reduce the number of police officers in schools.I heard anecdotal accounts that more people were, in fact, choosing the option that his wife had declined. Some were moving to new addresses. Others were looking for sanctuary in churches or simply shutting themselves up in their homes, essentially becoming fugitives when their check-ins passed. The full extent of these changes won\u2019t be clear until this summer, said Petra Falcon, the executive director of Promise Arizona (PAZ). During past crises in Arizona, she said, undocumented parents had often waited for classes to end before moving with their children. But a recent report from the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System showed that the percentage of Hispanics participating in Arizona\u2019s state health care system had fallen by more than half between October 2016 and April 2017. Some Hispanics, it appeared, might be trying to retreat into the shadows again.Legomsky said that the sweep of Trump\u2019s priorities has also given ICE cover for the use of targeted deportations against activists. The agency doesn\u2019t need to explain why the deportation of a DACA activist or an undocumented organizer is consistent with their announced priorities, he said, \u201cif the announced priorities cover almost everybody.\u201d In February, the Department of Homeland Security seemed to give its blessing for such retaliations when it issued a memo that gave ICE officers the authority to prioritize the deportation of anyone they believed posed \u201ca risk to public safety.\u201d Andiola, who is now the political director of Our Revolution, the 501(c)(4) that sprang from Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential bid, didn\u2019t know if her mother had been targeted or if the letter ordering her to report for removal was simply a consequence of Trump\u2019s redefined priorities.After Arreola received the letter, Andiola worked her extensive professional network, calling organizers, lawyers and activists to gather opinions about what she should do. \u201cIt\u2019s great that there are so many perspectives,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s difficult to sort through all the differing kinds of advice.\u201d Eventually, she realized there was no single solution. With a diversity of tactics in her pocket, she would deploy one after another in hopes of reaching success. What she needed first, she decided, was a legal strategy.Even though Arreola fled to the United States to escape domestic abuse, it never occurred to either woman that Arreola might be eligible for asylum. In Andiola\u2019s mind, asylum seekers came from Central America or the Middle East, places with extreme political turmoil. After Garc\u00eda Aguilar\u2019s deportation, though, Andiola began to take the option seriously. She knew it was a long shot: It has never been easy for Mexicans to gain asylum in the United States. And though several lawyers told me that asylum applications are now rising, the process is likely to become even more difficult soon. The Jan. 25 order on border security includes an entire section declaring Trump\u2019s intention \u201cto end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same political agenda that is behind banning Muslims and refugees from coming to the U.S.,\u201d says Marielena Hincapi\u00e9, the executive director of the National Immigration Law Center.A successful asylum application, Andiola learned, depended upon documentary evidence. Arreola recalled that a newspaper in Durango once published her ex-partner\u2019s photograph, noting that he had been charged for the kidnapping and rape of a minor: her. In Durango, Arreola\u2019s brother-in-law found a copy of a 1991 police report detailing one of her ex-partner\u2019s rages. These two documents formed the backbone of the asylum application Arreola used to request an interview with U.S.C.I.S. in April. Within a week, she had an appointment for a \u201creasonable fear\u201d interview to determine if her case merited serious consideration. Three days after the interview, Arreola received good news: ICE had canceled her scheduled removal on May 3. She had passed the interview, the first of many steps in gaining asylum. Her lawyer, Ray Ybarra Maldonado, who also represents Garc\u00eda Aguilar, says there is still a fair chance that Arreola\u2019s application for asylum may be denied, but she was now safe to report for her check-in on May 23.On May 3, the day Arreola was to have been deported, Arreola and Andiola gathered with friends, family and supporters for a prayer breakfast at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Phoenix, which had offered to house Arreola if she chose sanctuary. Pastor James Pennington had been active in the fight for gay rights. The patio of First Congregational was decorated with several flags, including a rainbow flag, an Arizona state flag and an American flag. Inside the church, members of Puente and former members of ADAC formed a circle with several non-Hispanics who had only recently allied themselves with the undocumented. Standing together they recited Psalm 30 in Spanish:Te ensalzar\u00e9, oh Se\u00f1or, porque me has elevado, y no has permitido que mis enemigos se r\u00edan de mi.Yet their enemies remained hard at work. A week later, Marco Tulio Coss Ponce, who had been living in Arizona under an order of supervision since 2013, appeared at ICE\u2019s field office in Phoenix with his lawyer, Ravindar Arora, for a check-in. ICE officers, Arora said, knew that Coss Ponce was about to file an application for asylum \u2014 several of his relatives had been recently killed or threatened by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico \u2014 and they had assured Arora several times that Coss Ponce would not be removed. They said he simply needed to wear an ankle monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t disappear. The fitting was delayed several times until finally Arora had to leave to argue a case in court. After he departed, ICE officers handcuffed Coss Ponce and put him in a van, alone. Three hours later, he was in Nogales.An article on May 28 about the deportation of undocumented immigrants misstated the year that Marco Tulio Coss Ponce, a deportee, began living under an order of supervision. It was 2013, not 2012.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Sees New Front in Climate Change Battle: Agriculture", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byMILAN \u2014 Michelle Obama has long been one of the world\u2019s best-known advocates for healthier food production and better eating, but it was her husband who showed up here on Tuesday to talk about climate change and the challenges it presented to feeding the world\u2019s growing population.His brief speech was devoted to agriculture\u2019s role in climate change, noting that after energy, agriculture is the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Now, he said, those emissions are starting to take their toll on food production itself. \u201cOur changing climate is already making it more difficult to produce food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen shrinking yields and rising food prices.\u201dHe said the costs would be borne most by the poor, noting that many of the refugees seeking sanctuary in Europe are driven not by conflict but by famine.\u201cWhen we think about issues like food security or climate change, ultimately politicians can help guide policy, but the energy to bring about change is going to come from what people do every day,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come from parents who are concerned about the impact climate change may have on their child, from business people who say how can we use less energy or waste less resources in making our products. It\u2019s millions of decisions made individually that have the ability to make changes.\u201dMr. Obama responded with his trademark tutorial in rising ocean waters and temperatures, before addressing the concern that the rest of the world has about the United States\u2019 commitment to the deal.\u201cObviously, the current administration has differences with my administration in terms of energy policy, and that\u2019s part of what happens in democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a useful debate in America, but I think the good news is that, in part because of what we did over the last eight years, the private sector has already made a decision that the future is in clean energy.\u201dThe former president also noted that the Paris agreement focused on damage to the environment from the energy sector, leaving the role of food production largely unaddressed. \u201cWe are actually seeing a continuing increase in emissions coming out of the agriculture sector,\u201d he said, \u201cand a lot of that has to do with changing diets around the world.\u201dHe said that even as the developed world works to reduce its consumption of meat, developing nations are eating more meat. \u201cThis offers a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs, businesses, scientists and thought leaders to make progress in an area where we have not made as much progress,\u201d he said.Mr. Obama observed that most people do not think of food as a source of pollution. \u201cBecause food is so close to us and is part of our family and is part of what we do every single day, people, I think, are more resistant to the idea of government or bureaucrats telling them what to eat, how to eat and how to grow,\u201d he said.The powerful agriculture lobby in Washington, he said, can also hinder change. \u201cHistorically in the United States, the one area where Democrats and Republicans agree is on the agriculture committees, because the members usually come from agricultural states and they\u2019re very good at joining across party lines to protect the interests of food producers,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt makes for a difficult political dynamic for us being able to shape rational policy.\u201dMr. Kass asked his former boss to speak about the developing field of personalized health and the part food plays in it. Mr. Obama mentioned that his daughter Malia has a peanut allergy and is participating in a Stanford University program that tailors treatment to the individual.\u201cHow that translates into people\u2019s eating habits, we don\u2019t yet know,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause a lot of people don\u2019t just eat for health \u2014 we eat because it tastes good, too.\u201dMr. Obama recently came under criticism for reportedly accepting a $400,000 fee to speak at a Cantor Fitzgerald health care conference next fall. A spokeswoman for Seeds & Chips would not say what the organization had paid him to speak.Advertisement"}

There are forces at work that separate us and say we are equal. Forces at work that build jails based on our third-grade state tests. Forces at work that tell us that this is the land of opportunity and you can be whatever you want, only ... you can\u2019t.To whom it should concern,I had to build myself ... myself. The education environment that I was in did not necessarily assist me. It served only to challenge me, and it was not with a worksheet. It was with trying to answer a dire question of what I was doing there.To whom it should concern,Your fear that my better tomorrow will be the tomorrow that will undermine you ... is not a noble fear. Your fear is this same fear that makes it harder for students to thrive. It is the same fear that does not allow us an adequate education. It is the same fear that creates segregation in NYC schools. The same fear that makes you refuse our humanity.Haby Sondo, 17, BronxSenior, Manhattan Center for Science and MathematicsWill attend Boston UniversityTo whom it should concern, \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d has always sent chills to my body. The lights, the excitement, the way the characters swiftly moved their bodies, gliding through the hallways of their marble white high school floors. The clean white locker rooms and the picturesque white cafeteria with the blood-red trays and the well-prepared meals always made me envious.This was not my reality.My reality is an AP teacher who tells her students who don\u2019t feel prepared enough to take the AP exam that their only job is to not disturb those who are.My reality is a teacher telling me that I plagiarized a paper due to the sophistication of my writing language.My reality is a set curriculum in which teachers are restricted to only teaching for a Regents exam, as if a three-hour test is enough to sum up what a student has retained from the entire school year, as if a student\u2019s complex intelligence can be accurately assessed by bubbling A, B, C, or D. \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d and its false hopes are an unreachable dream.\u201cHigh School Musical\u201d no longer sends chills to my body.\u201cHigh School Musical\u201d is not my reality.A public school in desperate need of reform is my reality.Jazmine Williams, 17, BronxSenior, Manhattan Center for Science and MathematicsWill attend Goucher CollegeTo whom it should concern, In my dilapidated middle school \u201cgifted and talented\u201d classes, I was praised for being one of the only passing students.But my freshman year at Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics was an academic shock. I finally met my match when I was thrust into Geometry and Chemistry classes. I barely passed Chemistry, and ended up failing Geometry and had to take the class over again. My academic career at M.C.S.M. has been a bumpy road of not being able to get a grasp on just how rigorous the courses in a selective public high school actually are, and not being able to cope with the constant failure I encountered. To whom it should concern, Preparing students for the future should begin in middle school because lessons implemented at a young age stick with us for a very long time. Though public schools in N.Y.C. are all governed by the Department of Education, why is it that schools have such different instructional quality and rigor? To whom it should concern, All students in N.Y.C. public schools need to have the same academic standards in order to give all students a fighting chance when conquering school.Brianna Lackwood, 18, QueensSenior, Midwood High School, BrooklynWill attend Brandeis UniversityTo whom it should concern,As school became my priority, I grew to learn what to expect from most of my classes: tests. My own curiosity always drove me to learn, but I noticed that my school neglected to instill in its students a love for what they were being taught.I am not alone when I say that a standardized test does not reflect the elements of my being. No score can judge my intellect, yet this is how the education system is designed if you wish to move on beyond high school. Instead of being taught to love and understand math and literature, some are programmed to remember how to integrate a function and recognize context clues in an essay. We are taught to act as machines whose main goal is to ace exams and make teachers and the school look outstanding. With so much emphasis placed on testing, I question how much room is truly left over for genuine learning.The biggest problem I have deals with the growing divide standardized tests create between the rich and the poor. Students from more affluent backgrounds perform better because of their access to greater opportunities and resources. Allow students to show that they are intelligent through much more than a comprehensive score and G.P.A. I wish I could just say \u201cdo better\u201d and have the education system release its heavy reliance on testing. The problem is that a lot of administrators seem driven by test scores, and not by the potential and success of their students. When did the former become more important than the latter? William, 18, BronxSenior, Beacon High School, ManhattanWill attend The City College of New YorkI ended up in a public high school 11 miles away from my home in the northeastern Bronx. The long commute was worth it because my high school offered so much more than my zoned school. With a 52 percent graduation rate and only 1 in 4 students going to college, my zoned school did not promise the academic wealth I saw in my American Dream. I have made the most out of my high school experience by working hard and holding tight to my dreams in a school full of rigor and academic enrichment.Yet it hurts when a school denies you admission because you lack legal standing in the country of freedom and optimistic dreams. It hurts when you apply to more than 20 private colleges that you are more than qualified to attend and get a pile of rejections, few wait lists, and no acceptances. When this happens, you feel as though the plethora of opportunities you imagined when you first moved to the country have dissolved. You feel as if all your hard work has been torn to pieces.Even though I am constantly told that it has nothing to do with me as a person or student, I feel powerless and completely vulnerable. After crying for weeks, I have decided to let my story to be heard, because it is stories like mine that burden many undocumented students like me in the United States of America.Only 5 to 10 percent of undocumented students in the United States go to college. By having outside support from my community, I have been privileged to receive preparation for college. I urge and dream for the communities across this city and this country to be more supportive of undocumented students; to provide necessary counseling services and resources for applying to college. To help undocumented students deal with bullying due to their legal status, and being attacked by ignorant stereotypes. Many of us have dreams of bringing change to our families and the communities we left behind. Many of us need love and emotional support in a situation where those in the highest elected offices abhor our presence in this land of freedom and opportunities.Here are some of the stories that we\u2019re talking about, beyond The Times.The Times publishes many stories that touch on race.

Should have happened sooner. Comey was a mess. He was totally in the wrong job.\u201d\u201cI always thought [Comey\u2019s] behavior in announcing the termination of the Clinton investigation while editorializing on her judgment was improper. His October surprise was beyond the pale. He should have been fired as soon as Trump took office. However, the timing of this firing is very suspect.\u201dReaders said that President Trump made a mistake in firing Mr. Comey and suggested that the president\u2019s vanity led him to the decision.\u201cI think Comey\u2019s remark about being \u2018mildly nauseous\u2019 about swaying the election is what sealed the deal. Trump lost face, and this is something he cannot allow. His pride and vanity will be his undoing.\u201d\u201cTrump played it wrong, If he was truly innocent of any wrongdoing, he should have allowed the investigations to play out proving it, then asking for Comey\u2019s resignation afterwards.\u201d\u201cIt is clear at this point that Trump is not a shrewd tactician and politician. I am increasingly confident that we are approaching a \u2018Pride comes before the fall\u2019 solution to this sad chapter in our political history.\u201dReaders praised Mr. Trump\u2019s efficiency and hoped that the administration will turn its attention to other concerns. \u201cNothing to see here folks. Director got fired for doing a poor job. Nothing else. Go back to work. Health care on its way to Senate and tax reform (cuts) on the way. Stay on point.\u201d\u201cExcellent. Now the FBI can finally investigate Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. Great leadership shown by our President and his administration.\u201d\u201cLiberals have been calling for Comey\u2019s head ever since he said he was reopening the investigation into Clinton. Well, today you got what you wanted, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cWe had the Saturday Night Massacre. Now we are having the \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 Massacre.\u201d\u201cPlease stop saying that Trump\u2019s firing of Comey is Nixon\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre all over again. At that time back in 1973, there had already been an independent Watergate special prosecutor in place for months, who had made great strides toward bringing the President to justice.And the U.S. Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General both resigned in protest over Nixon\u2019s decision, while Sessions and Rosenstein are complicit in Comey\u2019s firing.Our current predicament is not the Saturday Night Massacre 2.0. It is much more bleak.\u201d\u201cThis is not \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019 This is a man who has given decades to the service of our country. What does it say to others who serve?\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the last few months, journalists, academics, technology experts, civic-minded foundations and well-intentioned politicos have devoted decades of collective brain hours to an all-hands effort to stanch the conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods roiling our democracy.But as the Seth Rich story shows, we\u2019re going to need a bigger algorithm.You can see the partisan appeal. If you don\u2019t want to believe American intelligence assessments that the Russians were behind the breach \u2014 supposedly to help the electoral prospects of President Trump \u2014 and if you don\u2019t like all the news about the investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, well, there\u2019s an alternative fact set to grab onto: Mr. Rich did it and paid for it with his life.The problem, of course, is that there\u2019s no real evidence for the notion.The Rich story has been kicking around since July, but flared anew last week, when FoxNews.com and the Fox affiliate in Washington, WTTG, quoted an investigator working with the Rich family as saying that Mr. Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks before his death.Still, the story lived on as a meme flowing through conservative media, which seemed to relish the chance to change the subject from the torrent of news spilling forth last week on the president\u2019s Russia troubles.But if you thought that would chasten people pushing the story and lead them to drop it, think again.Like water, conspiracy theories find their own level. So, where Fox News issued its retraction, The International Business Times put up a Facebook post that carried the headline, \u201cBREAKING: Kim Dotcom claims he has evidence that proves murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was involved in the WikiLeaks hack.\u201dSo what is new is the speed of the internet and the especially fertile soil of our angry political divide.Take heart, there are optimists. Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family (who is open about his work as a liberal political consultant), said in an interview that the developments of this week, capped by Fox News\u2019s retraction, \u201cshould not just serve as a cautionary tale but it should also serve as a message that in the end, truth does prevail. But we need to be vigilant.\u201d\u201cAll the viral rumors, conspiracy theories and hoaxes were a wake-up call for at least some people, and certainly some institutions that are now moving to address this, including news organizations, social media organizations and educational institutions,\u201d he told me.But no matter what the media ecosystem does to stop uncorroborated conspiracies and false information, they will continue to live on as long as there are people eager to spread it and viewers and readers eager to believe it.

{"Headline": "Emmett Till\u2019s Coffin, a Hangman\u2019s Scaffold and a Debate Over Cultural Appropriation", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byBoth works, made by artists who are white, recall historical acts of racial violence and have been viewed by many as painful and insensitive to communities that have suffered directly from those injustices.Central to both cases are issues of cultural appropriation and artistic freedom. Should white artists, no matter how well intentioned, represent harrowing stories that are not their own to tell? Conversely, should any subject matter be off-limits to artists because of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or other life experiences?Calls to remove the works from public view have drawn different responses from the institutions, with the Walker and the artist agreeing to dismantle and burn the sculpture, and the Whitney keeping the painting in place.Ms. Schutz\u2019s 2016 painting is based on a photograph of the beaten body of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American murdered after speaking to a white woman in 1955. Till\u2019s mother requested an open coffin at his funeral so that the world could witness what had been done to her son.On Saturday, some 100 members of Minnesota\u2019s Native American communities gathered outside the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden to protest what they perceived as the insensitivity of Mr. Durant\u2019s sculpture to their personal traumatic history and demand that it be removed.On March 17 and 18, a small group of protesters blocked Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting from view at the Whitney gallery, objecting to a white artist\u2019s using and potentially profiting from an image of violence against a black person. An open letter on Facebook by the artist Hannah Black, and signed by other artists, curators and critics, called for the painting to be removed and destroyed. In the debate that quickly went viral, a counterwave of voices denounced the censorship and destruction of artworks.The reaction from African-American artists was not monolithic. Kara Walker noted that \u201cthe history of painting is full of graphic violence and narratives that don\u2019t necessarily belong to the artists own life,\u201d but may inspire \u201cdeeper inquiries and better art. It can only do this when it is seen.\u201dMr. Durant, in a statement on Saturday, wrote that he made \u201cScaffold\u201d to speak out about \u201cthe racial dimension of the criminal justice system in the United States, ranging from lynchings to mass incarceration to capital punishment.\u201d He intended the work \u201cas a learning space for people like me, white people who have not suffered the effects of a white supremacist society and who may not consciously know that it exists.\u201d But, he added, \u201cyour protests have shown me that I made a grave miscalculation in how my work can be received by those in a particular community.\u201dIn an interview in March with artnet, Ms. Schutz said that she made the painting last summer, after a series of shootings of black men by the police, in part out of empathy for Emmett Till\u2019s mother. \u201cI could never, ever know her experience, but I know what it is to love your child,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problematic painting, and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all.\u201dThe contexts of the two pieces, with Mr. Durant\u2019s sculpture displayed outdoors in a public park and Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting indoors in a temporary exhibition, have different parameters and may have had an impact on how each institution reacted. The Walker\u2019s executive director, Olga Viso, expressing deep regret at the \u201canger and sadness\u201d that \u201cScaffold\u201d had brought to local Native Americans, quickly agreed with Mr. Durant to remove the gallows structure from the sculpture garden \u2014 a space where children often play.On Wednesday, Dakota elders led a private mediation with leaders from the Walker, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Mr. Durant. The artist transferred the intellectual property rights of his work to the Dakota Oyate. The entire sculpture will be dismantled in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden in a four-day process beginning Friday. The wood will then be taken to the Fort Snelling area, a site that is sacred to the Dakota people, where they will ceremonially burn the wood at a date yet to be determined.At the Whitney, Ms. Schutz\u2019s painting remains on view through the run of the Biennial, ending June 11. The Biennial has long served as a barometer of the most controversial issues of the day. \u201cArtists have to be free to pick their subject matter; otherwise, we end up in a role of being a censor,\u201d said Adam Weinberg, the director. \u201cChristopher Lew and Mia Locks, as the Biennial curators, selected Dana\u2019s work as part of the broader themes of the exhibition dealing with race, inclusion and violence.\u201d The controversy has prompted the museum to initiate an open forum on Saturdays called \u201cEthics of Looking,\u201d with the next session on Saturday. \u201cIt addresses who is allowed to speak for whom and what is appropriate,\u201d Mr. Weinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers Kept the Heat on Studios to Win Their Contract", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cVictory!!!\u201dWith that single aggressively punctuated tweet, Phillip Iscove, a creator of the Fox drama \u201cSleepy Hollow,\u201d summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday, after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios.A tentative agreement for a new three-year, master contract with the producers\u2019 alliance and unions representing more than 12,000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight, and the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to attract advertising.The unions declared in an email to members that they had won \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d Leaders added: \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dOne thing writers wanted and did not get was uniform pay for writing done across platforms, whether that be a traditional broadcast network, cable channel or streaming service.Still, the celebratory whoops of union members were warranted, said Miranda J. Banks, a professor of film and media at Emerson College in Boston, who followed the talks closely. Ms. Banks is the author of the 2014 book, \u201cThe Writers: A History of American Screenwriters and Their Guild.\u201d\u201cThe union was extremely tactical in these negotiations, and it shows in the outcome,\u201d she said. \u201cThey came in with a plan and expertly executed it.\u201dThe guilds, with David Young serving as their chief negotiator, did seem to approach the talks in a strategic fashion. Bargaining started on March 13, with writers asking for a long list of contract enhancements. After breaking off on March 24 \u2014 each side blamed the other \u2014 Mr. Young and his cohorts immediately ratcheted up the pressure, sending letters to TV advertisers promising a strike if no deal was reached by Monday and asking members to authorize a walkout.On Sunday, studios made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday afternoon made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.\u201cCalm, cool, honest and authentic every step of the way,\u201d Damon Lindelof, a member of the union\u2019s negotiating committee, wrote in an email on Tuesday of the guild\u2019s leadership. Mr. Lindelof, whose credits include \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cWorld War Z,\u201d and \u201cLost,\u201d also gave credit to studio negotiators for \u201cbeing true to their word in hearing our membership\u2019s concerns about the dramatic shifts in the way our business now functions.\u201dOne big sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long television writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering far fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode often make less while working more.To some degree, studios were concerned about setting a precedent for negotiations with other Hollywood unions. The actors\u2019 contract with producers expires on June 30.Share prices for most major entertainment companies were either unaffected or slightly down in trading on Tuesday. Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a research note that the deal with writers was \u201cpositive\u201d for media conglomerates, \u201cas a strike invited several serious risk factors,\u201d including \u201cpermanent acceleration of audience loss away from traditional TV and ad dollars from TV to digital.\u201dAs the entertainment capital waited for word on down-to-the-wire talks on Monday, union loyalists posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201dSome prominent politicians joined them. \u201cI stand with the Writers Guild of America for fair pay and decent health care because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and because Bruce and I can\u2019t wait for the next season of \u2018Ballers\u2019 to start,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook, referring to her husband, Bruce Mann.In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out for 100 days over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $200 Million Bet on Brazilian Tech Start-Ups Amid Political Upheaval", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The Latin American venture capital firm Kaszek Ventures has raised a $200 million fund, its largest, a major vote of confidence for internet start-ups in Brazil amid the political upheaval there.The new fund, which the firm is expected to announce this week, is about 48 percent larger than the firm\u2019s second and most recent fund, which was $135 million and was marketed in late 2013.Kaszek is based in Buenos Aires, but it made about two-thirds of its investments in start-ups in Brazil in its first two funds, and that is expected to continue.\u201cWe believe that Brazil will still be the largest recipient of our capital and where we invest the most,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Szekasy, one of the firm\u2019s two founding partners, said in a recent interview.American investors in the new fund include Sequoia Heritage, the fund of funds linked with the Silicon Valley stalwart Sequoia Capital, and the Dietrich Foundation, based in Pittsburgh.Kevin Efrusy, a partner with Accel, responsible for its early investment in Facebook, also put in capital. He said that he had done so in all three Kaszek funds in an individual capacity apart from Accel, even as that firm had continued to be active in Brazil under his stewardship.Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, faces fresh corruption allegations and his survival is in doubt.That uncertainty has also jeopardized Brazil\u2019s economic recovery, which until recently was taking root in small ways but depends on the enactment of major economic changes.Kaszek though is bullish on internet entrepreneurs in Brazil, as are other firms.The firm expects use of the internet to increase in fields like banking and agriculture and greater mobile penetration. Some of its companies have grown between 50 and 100 percent in revenue in one of Brazil\u2019s worst recessions, its partners said.Kaszek\u2019s first two funds focused on marketplaces, financial technology and software as a service. Now it will add agriculture technology, education and health care.The other founding partner, Hern\u00e1n Kazah, said that the crisis in Brazil has resulted in \u201cmore committed entrepreneurs,\u201d or those starting companies because they really want to.Kaszek\u2019s backers similarly take the long view.Sequoia Heritage, whose funds include money from Sequoia Capital\u2019s partners and outside investors, largely Sequoia entrepreneurs, increased its investment in the new fund compared with the second fund, according to Keith Johnson, Sequoia Heritage\u2019s chief investment officer.\u201cI still think more people will be buying goods and services online in 10 years in Brazil than are today regardless,\u201d he said.The asset manager Hall Capital Partners, which backed Kaszek\u2019s Fund II, also increased its contribution in absolute dollars in the new fund, according to Laura Andron, a principal at the firm, which is based in San Francisco.For these limited partners, this is the right time to invest.Edward J. Grefenstette, president and chief executive of The Dietrich Foundation, said that although Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic and political environments are volatile, \u201cif you wait for the \u2018all clear\u2019 sign, then you\u2019ve probably missed an attractive entry point. \u201cKaszek is the first venture capital firm in Latin America backed by the foundation, a charitable trust made possible by William S. Dietrich II, which has roughly $800 million in assets under management, with 47 percent of that in venture capital funds. It also invested in the firm\u2019s second fund.Even as Brazil remains the focus, Kaszek\u2019s partners say they plan to increasingly look at Mexico and Colombia, too.

Some European governments, notably in Germany, are considering hefty fines against the company and other social media giants if they fail to crack down on hate speech and misinformation on their networks.The French regulator, the Commission Nationale de l\u2019Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, or CNIL, said that it had fined Facebook 150,000 euros, or about $164,000, for failing to meet France\u2019s data protection rules. The CNIL chairwoman, Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, also leads a Pan-European group of privacy officials. The fine represents a relatively small amount for Facebook, which generates tens of billions of dollars a year in online advertising. The Dutch authority, which could still reach a settlement with Facebook, did not impose a financial penalty.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cFacebook proceeded to a massive compilation of personal data of internet users in order to display targeted advertising,\u201d the French watchdog said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. \u201cIt has also been noticed that Facebook collected data on browsing activity of internet users on third-party websites without their knowledge.\u201dDespite the financial penalty, the agency has not ordered Facebook to alter how it handles data on people in France who use the service.Facebook said that it was complying with European data protection rules, which are among the most stringent in the world. The company added that it had simplified its online privacy tools in recent years to give people more control over how their data was used.\u201cFacebook has long complied with E.U. data protection law through our establishment in Ireland,\u201d Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement, referring to the company\u2019s international headquarters in Dublin. \u201cWe remain open to continuing to discuss these issues with the CNIL.\u201dFacebook, which said it had not decided whether to appeal the most recent data protection rulings, has battled Europe\u2019s privacy laws before.

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}

Amorosa, said in an email that his client would \u201cplead not guilty and defend himself against the charges.\u201d Both charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.She was called a \u201ctotal degenerate\u201d and \u201cstupid, stupid lady\u201d in emails, according to the complaint. She later received a call from a man who identified himself as a police officer and said that OpticsFast had filed a \u201ccivil harassment suit\u201d against her.Another customer, identified in the complaint as Victim-8, clicked on an OpticsFast link that generated a shipping label to mail in glasses for repair. When he decided against using the label and refused to pay for it, OpticsFast sent him hundreds of emails, including 456 in a single day. Hundreds of them had \u201cI WIN!!!\u201d in the subject line.Mr. Borker appears to have toned down his previous approach, according to the complaint. None of the victims identified by the government, nor any of the dozens of OpticsFast customers who posted complaints on Yelp, mentioned physical threats.A call to OpticsFast in March, as complaints on Yelp piled up, was answered by a woman who said she had never heard of Vitaly Borker. Asked where the company was based, she snapped \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cClearly, I don\u2019t want to pay for this upgrade,\u201d he wrote, in what by his standards qualified as a charm offensive. \u201cPlease give me money.\u201dThe government\u2019s complaint also states that Mr. Borker recently posted a photo collage on his Facebook page showing him atop an enormous pile of eyeglasses. Next to the photos was what sounded like a job posting.\u201cI am looking for a responsible fast paced person who can assist me at my Brighton Beach office doing various projects for my eye wear e-Commerce business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProject one will be to help me sort this mess.\u201dMr. Borker, a 41-year-old immigrant from Ukraine, stands about 6 feet 5 inches tall. In 2010, when he was terrifying customers of DecorMyEye, which was based in Brooklyn, there was a method to his noxious technique: He believed that Google\u2019s search algorithm could not distinguish between positive and negative feedback. The more people griped about his company, his theory went, the more prominently his site appeared in Google search results.In essence, Mr. Borker believed that the internet allowed him to turn upside down long-cherished verities of commerce, most notably that treating customers well enhances one\u2019s bottom line. Using aliases such as Stanley Bolds and Tony Russo, he threatened to chop off the legs of one customer. He threatened to rape another. He wrote a letter to the office of yet another in which he said the customer was gay and sold drugs.At his sentencing, in 2012, Mr. Borker told Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, \u201cAs I stand before you today, I am genuinely and deeply sorry for the threats that I made. To say that I am ashamed of myself is an understatement.\u201dBut the sense of remorse may have been short lived. There were complaints about OpticsFast while Mr. Borker was still imprisoned. The volume of online groans only seemed to increase when he was freed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Folks: Tell the Truth About Your Tax Plan", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byLast Wednesday, President Trump unveiled his huge tax cut, unmistakably geared to helping business and the wealthy.A few days later, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a business conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that there would be no net tax cut for the rich because it would be offset by closing loopholes and deductions.That was hardly the first time Mr. Mnuchin made that patently absurd assertion nor the only occasion on which he and other members of the Trump administration had similarly misled the public about the nature of the tax plan.In fact, when Mr. Mnuchin first offered his unequivocal pronouncement, at his confirmation hearing in January, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, quickly called the commitment the \u201cMnuchin rule.\u201dA few weeks later, in his first television interview as secretary, Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cWe\u2019re primarily focused on a middle-income tax cut and simplification for business.\u201dWhen the first dribblings of specifics arrived, they included lowering the top rate on earned income, eliminating a 3.8 percent levy on investment income, and doing away with the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.Yes, some deductions are to be eliminated, most notably for state and local taxes, but I\u2019ll bet a lot of money that when the Trump administration provides enough details for the experts to \u201cscore\u201d the proposal, the rich will be the big winners.And that\u2019s not even counting the trickle-down effect of the business tax cuts, which appear to total about two-thirds of the package.I guess Mnuchin rules are made to be broken. But he is not alone.\u201cThis is a targeted tax deduction for the middle class,\u201d the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d in another huge misstatement of what the Trump bill would do. (He meant \u201creduction,\u201d not \u201cdeduction.\u201d)In an interview Monday on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is now director of the National Economic Council, argued that the increase in the standard deduction qualified Mr. Trump\u2019s plan as a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut.\u201dThe problem, as David Kamin quickly pointed out in Democracy, is that a family of two or more pays less tax under current law than it would under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan because of the availability of both a standard deduction and personal exemptions, which Mr. Trump said in the campaign he would end.All told, the Trump tax initiative to date has been a tale of broken promises and obfuscation about its true impact.Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Misleading the public about the true nature of its policies has become a hallmark of this administration. In recent days, Mr. Trump has been routinely misstating the effect that the current draft of a new health care law would have on those with pre-existing conditions.What\u2019s particularly odd about Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to taxes is that the plan he announced as president is far less detailed than what he put forward as a candidate. Typically, when a president makes a proposal, it has more specifics than a campaign agenda item.Whether this unusual behavior has been driven by his arbitrary nature (the 100-day mark loomed) or by cleverly trying to be sufficiently vague to prevent the costs and impact from being assessed remains a mystery.When the plan was unveiled in the White House briefing room, not a word was said about the fate of the carried interest break enjoyed by hedge-fund and private equity managers, even though abolishing it had been a hallmark of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.After strong pushback, the administration began saying that it would be dealt with in details still to be revealed \u2014 but will it?Similar vagueness has enshrouded a campaign proposal for a child care credit, while a plan to eliminate corporations\u2019 ability to deduct interest payments has disappeared, at least for the moment, as has the campaign plan to limit the amount of interest payments that business can deduct.As for the cost of the plan, Mr. Mnuchin said Monday at the business gathering, the Milken Institute Global Conference, that \u201cwe expect to pay for this through economic growth.\u201d Another wild misstatement.By Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s own math, if the economy expands by 3 percent instead of the current rate of roughly 2 percent, about $2 trillion of revenue would be created.But there are two problems with that assertion. First, achieving that growth level is highly unlikely. And second, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump plan would cost about $5.5 trillion over the next 10 years.All told, some transparency and honesty about its tax plans would be a welcome change for the Trump administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Journey Through Indonesian Favorites at Awang Kitchen in Elmhurst, Queens", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byHungry City8 PhotosEvening in Elmhurst, Queens, and the windows of Awang Kitchen were awash in purple light. Inside, a party about 30 strong was winding down at tables pushed together along the wall, with balloons tugging upward from chairs and a woman on guitar leading the crowd in what sounded, in Bahasa Indonesia, like a hymn.It was a gentler soundtrack than the hiss of cars outside on Queens Boulevard, and a lulling accompaniment to the plates that streamed steadily from the kitchen to my table in the corner.Awang Kitchen opened in March in a new condominium built on the half-block lot where the Cantonese restaurant Harbor City once stood, flanked by golden lions. The chef, Siliwanga, known as Awang, grew up in Jakarta on the island of Java. (Like a number of Indonesians, he has only one name, confounding Western bureaucracy; in official records, his surname is listed as Nln, short for \u201cno last name.\u201d)The menu is long and rambling, but the waiters are patient guides. One steered me toward tempeh, cakes of whole soybeans fermented until they stick together, which from past experience I had sworn to shun. Here, the cakes are cut into flat squares, divested of heaviness, dusted in coriander-laced tempura flour and fried briefly, so the inside stays soft. Their flavor lies somewhere between roasted chestnut and scorched earth. The cakes need no more than a dab of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), dark and viscous, pulling slightly at the spoon.Tahu isi are craggy hulls of fried tofu with hidden caches of shrimp, carrots and cabbage. The hot peppers on the plate are not for show; you\u2019re meant to take a bite of tofu, then chile. It\u2019s clarifying.More long hots are broken down into a sambal for dendeng balado, flank steak sliced thinly and piqued with lime before a quick fry; and for duck, boiled to render the fat and then pan-fried so the skin crackles.At first, I thought my favorite dish was calamari, airy from a dredging in tapioca flour and gilded by salted duck egg yolks, powerfully fatty and further enriched by butter. They\u2019re buried under a thousand shards of crispy garlic and shallots; the people at my table chased down every one.Then came nasi tim ayam jamur, which Awang described as \u201cwhat you make when you visit people\u201d in the hospital. It begins with chicken and mushrooms, garlicky and soy-dark, layered at the bottom of a bowl and topped with rice half-cooked in chicken stock, then steamed so the liquids and spices run. This is inverted on a plate like a pineapple upside-down cake. A bowl of chicken broth is presented on the side with a slick of sesame oil, the better to heal you.Goat skewers, nicely chewy, are paired with nubs of lontong, rice rolled inside a banana leaf and steamed until it takes on a faint woodsy flavor, like water drunk from a bamboo cup. Chicken is poached in coconut water for tenderness and a hint of sweetness. Catfish is saturated for hours in lemon and lime, then fried and smacked with the back of a spoon, so the sauce can find crannies and soak through.Some dishes celebrate the animal parts that the West often snubs: beef tendon and liver in a tangle of flat rice noodles; gizzard and heart submerged in congee; creamy cow brain curry. But funk also appears in unexpected places, like an intensely marine fish cake with a batter of flaked Spanish mackerel and tapioca flour, sealed around a raw egg, boiled, fried and dunked in a sweet-sour soup of tamarind and brown sugar.Awang spent years cooking at Japanese restaurants, and he has installed a sushi bar. I planned to politely ignore it \u2014 I came for Indonesian food, much more of a rarity in this city \u2014 until a plate arrived at my table unbidden, with dainty curls of fluke around strands of cucumber, light and refreshing.On my visits, I saw Awang stop by every table, often with gifts, like es blewah, a sweet soup of cantaloupe, scraped into skinny strands with a special knife from Indonesia. One night, he brought us a small bowl of what he had made for a staff meal: a West Javanese version of laksa, heady with coconut milk and the color of crushed marigolds.For a moment, my table was silent with happiness. But Awang shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m missing two spices,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cThe original is more delicious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Taking Tougher Stance in Fraternity Hazing Deaths", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byAfter downing a dangerous amount of alcohol and suffering severe internal injuries during a fraternity hazing, a 19-year-old college sophomore died. Not long ago, the story might have ended there, except for some hand-wringing and litigation.\u201cGo back a generation or two, and hazing was accepted conduct, part of the fraternity experience, part of the football experience,\u201d said David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, a national group that offers training for prosecutors. \u201cNow it\u2019s no longer \u2018boys will be boys, and why is the prosecutor getting involved in this?\u2019 I think there is much more acceptance out there that this is unlawful behavior.\u201dWhat is less clear is how much of a difference their actions make.\u201cThis is a huge challenge because we don\u2019t own the houses, we don\u2019t own the property, we aren\u2019t the national\u201d organization governing fraternities, Penn State\u2019s president, Eric Barron, said Monday in an interview.Dr. Barron said university presidents around the country had been expanding educational programs to discourage drinking, creating stronger rules and, when all else failed, revoking fraternity charters. But fraternities have found creative ways to avoid new restrictions, he said; some whose charters have been revoked have simply \u201ccreated underground organizations and just changed their names.\u201dDouglas E. Fierberg, a lawyer who specializes in suing fraternities and universities, said that while a few colleges had changed, most were unwilling to alienate alumni donors who belonged to fraternities.\u201cThe central problem is that in a fraternity house, kids, most of whom cannot legally drink, are in charge of getting and serving alcohol,\u201d he said.He noted that Mr. Piazza was left unconscious for hours before anyone sought help. \u201cThat would not have happened in an on-campus dorm,\u201d Mr. Fierberg said.Experts say the increase in prosecutions stems not only from a shift in attitudes but also from the ubiquity of electronic evidence. Security cameras in the fraternity house provided crucial information about Mr. Piazza\u2019s last hours, and in other instances, text messages and Google searches have contributed to criminal cases.The Penn State prosecution is one of the largest ever brought in a fraternity misconduct case, and it is unusual in that eight defendants face felony counts.Despite the adverse publicity, Penn State remains a coveted destination, with applications up about 30 percent from before the Sandusky case broke.The parents of two former Penn State students, Adam and Denise Lipson, say that they warned administrators in 2014 and 2015 of fraternity hazing that included coercing first-year students to drink to excess, but that their concerns were ignored. Dismayed by that atmosphere, their sons transferred to other universities, where they found less emphasis on alcohol and less pressure to drink.\u201cOur sons are not prudes, they\u2019re not anti-frat, they\u2019re not anti-alcohol, but they couldn\u2019t believe how far it went,\u201d Ms. Lipson said. \u201cThere was this underlying acceptance of it.\u201dDr. Barron said concerns about drinking had been taken seriously for some time.While some fraternity houses are known trouble spots, Dr. Barron said, Beta Theta Pi was considered a model.Mr. Fierberg was skeptical. \u201cThe Greeks will be around long after everyone has turned their attention elsewhere,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

President Trump takes action that stuns the country, eliciting indignation and disbelief from Democrats and leading them to conclude that the vitality of American democracy is under assault.More clearly than other recent Trump-induced uproars, the reaction to the Comey firing illustrated how many conservatives now justify their defense of the president as part of a fight against a rising tide of overreaction and manufactured hysteria by the left. Mr. Trump, who has long understood the political power of demonizing his opponents as crazed and irrational, has helped stoke those resentments.\u201cIn a word, they see him as their voice,\u201d said Frank Luntz, the Republican consultant and pollster. \u201cAnd when their voice is shouted down, disrespected or simply ignored, that is an attack on them, not just an attack on Trump.\u201dMany conservatives see not just a reactionary left, but menacing forces in the form of an anti-Trump movement that uses hype as a pretense to undermine their political power.

And the more conservatives perceive the president as under siege from his political enemies \u2014 enemies they also see as their own \u2014 the more willing they seem to accept his version of events.In this version of events, the \u201calternate facts\u201d emanate not from the mouths of Mr. Trump or his aides but from the \u201cfake news\u201d mainstream media.The way the Comey story played out in the conservative news media was a telling illustration of this divide.Even conservatives who have repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump leapt to his defense. Erick Erickson, the writer and radio host who has called for an independent investigation into Russian ties to the Trump campaign, also called the cries of constitutional crisis \u201chysterics.\u201d\u201cRussiaism is the new Birtherism,\u201d he added, an ironic comparison given that Mr. Trump was a primary promoter of the false claim that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya.Ever since he began his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has portrayed his political opponents as unhinged, radical and sometimes as paid professionals of the left. And while that may have been true in some instances, Mr. Trump often makes the case that these represent the bulk of the people working against him.\u201cThey don\u2019t represent the center of gravity in the resistance movement, but he tries to suggest that they do,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.Many conservatives, even those who are not necessarily fans of the president, are willing to see his detractors in this light. And Mr. Trump understands that better than most, Mr. Garin added. \u201cTrump artfully uses protest movements to drive wedges between people,\u201d he said.Much as Republicans did when they painted Al Gore supporters as sore losers after the disputed 2000 election \u2014 waving signs that read \u201cSore Loserman,\u201d wordplay on the Gore-Lieberman ticket \u2014 the party is again creating a sense among its supporters that the left is bitter about its loss and resorting to histrionics as a result.Democrats should recognize that reaction. For years, they accused Republicans of resisting Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda at every turn, of being spiteful and even hateful as they refused to accept the results of the presidential election. And now, Republicans seem to relish the opportunity to turn the tables.Rush Limbaugh told his listeners on Wednesday, \u201cThis kind of irrational hate \u2014 this all-consuming hate and derangement, delusion \u2014 it isn\u2019t healthy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

After those two had grown and moved out, Ms. Baptiste learned that she had colon cancer.\u201cI asked God to give me a second chance, and he gave it to me,\u201d Ms. Baptiste said of her recovery, \u201cso I thought I should give back to my community. My choice was to do this.\u201d\u201cThis\u201d is being a foster parent, something she has been doing for 18 years.Jamie, who came from an abusive home, entered the foster system at age 2. His sister, Cheyenne, who was born into foster care, has Asperger\u2019s syndrome.\u201cI could not have seen them go from home to home because no one wanted to adopt them,\u201d said Ms. Baptiste, who took in the siblings 12 years ago.Jamie, now 24, and Cheyenne, now 21, share their mother\u2019s home with three foster children whose names are being omitted here for privacy reasons.\u201cI\u2019ve been in five homes, and I think this is the best one because I can be who I want to be,\u201d said the elder foster son, 18, who has been living there for two years. \u201cI could be gay. I could be me. In my other homes, it was like I was trapped.\u201dHe said he tries to visit his mother, who lives in a shelter in Midtown, once a month, and that she attended his high school graduation last spring.Ms. Baptiste\u2019s foster daughter, also 18, has been living with her for a year. Her mother died in April. And the younger foster son, 17, has moved from home to home since age 6, with his mother being in and out of jail.Despite their different backgrounds, \u201cthey are like real siblings,\u201d Ms. Baptiste said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m the mother forever.\u201dThey share family dinners, attend church together and abide by the same rules. \u201cNo cursing, no drugs, no alcohol and no fighting at all,\u201d the elder foster son said. \u201cAnd make sure you clean.\u201dMs. Baptiste will spend her Mother\u2019s Day at church.\u201cAll the kids are welcome to be there with me, but if they have to go to their biological parents, I let them go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they want to come back, I meet them. Whatever they want to do, I let them be themselves on Mother\u2019s Day.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Can you feel it? It\u2019s the calm before the storm.A nor\u2019easter is expected to hit on Saturday and possibly drench us with rain through Sunday.Sorry moms, brunch may end up soggy.Saturday Sunday Teenagers are taking the Met by storm today.They can experience virtual reality with the New York Film Academy; see a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRomeo & Juliet\u201d reimagined for modern-day East Harlem; explore the Rei Kawakubo Costume Institute exhibition; and hang out in the newly opened roof garden.T.G.I.F.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s in our relationships with each other that we find our will to live, our capacity to love, and the power to make lasting change in the world.\u201d_____Hello Hokies!President Sands, esteemed faculty, proud parents, devoted friends, wet siblings\u2026 congratulations to all of you. But most importantly, congratulations to the Virginia Tech class of 2017!I am honored to be with you and this San Francisco summer day feels just like home, just like it does with anything with \u201cTech\u201d in its name.I\u2019m so delighted to be here with my friend, Regina Dugan. As you just heard, Regina used to run Darpa \u2013 for real! \u2013 and now she is developing breakthrough technologies at Facebook. In Hokie terms, she\u2019s our Bruce Smith. And she is just one of so many alums doing amazing things around the world.Today, class of 2017, you join them. And I\u2019m thrilled for you. And thrilled for all of the people who are here supporting you \u2013 the people who have pushed you, dried your tears and laughed with you from your first day to this day. Let\u2019s show them all of our thanks.Commencement speeches can be pretty one-sided. The speaker \u2013 that\u2019s me \u2013 imparts her hard-earned wisdom\u2026 or at least tries to. The graduates \u2013 that\u2019s you \u2013 you sit in the rain today and listen like the thoughtful people you are. Then you hurl your caps in the air, hug your friends, let your parents take lots pictures of you \u2013 (post them on Instagram, just one idea) \u2013 and head off into your amazing lives\u2026 maybe swinging by Sharkey\u2019s for one last plate of wings before you go.Today\u2019s going to be a little bit different because I\u2019m not going to talk about something I know and you don\u2019t. I want to talk about something the Virginia Tech community knows all too well. Today, I want to talk about resilience.This university is known for so many things. Your kindness and decency\u2026 your academic excellence\u2026 your deeply felt school spirit. I\u2019ve spent time at a lot of time at colleges \u2013 yes for work, but also because I might want to relive my 20s just a little.Few people talk about their school the way Hokies talk about Virginia Tech. There is so much pride and unity here \u2014 such a deep sense of identity, and I am going to prove it by asking you one simple question:What\u2019s a Hokie? [I am!]That\u2019s it!What you might not realize is that that Hokie spirit has made all of you more resilient. I\u2019ve spent the last two years studying resilience because something happened in my life that demanded more of it than I ever would have thought possible.Two years and 11 days ago, I lost my husband, Dave, suddenly and unexpectedly. Sometimes I still have a hard time saying the words because I can\u2019t quite believe it actually happened. I woke up on what I thought would be a totally normal day. And my world just changed forever.I know, important day \u2014 it\u2019s raining, and I\u2019m up here talking about death. But I promise you there\u2019s a reason \u2013 and even one that\u2019s not even sad.Because what I\u2019ve learned since losing Dave has fundamentally changed how I view this world and how I live in it. And I want to share it with you, on this day because I think it\u2019s going to help you lead happier, healthier, and more joyful lives. and you deserve all of that.Each of you walked a very unique path to reach this day. Some of you faced real trauma. All of you faced challenges. disappointment, heartache, loss, illness \u2013 all of these are so personal when they strike \u2013 but they are also so universal.And then there are the shared losses. The Virginia Tech community knows this. You\u2019ve stopped for a quiet moment by the 32 Hokie stones on the Drillfield, as I did with President Sands just this morning. You\u2019ve joined your friends for the \u201cRun in Remembrance.\u201d You know that life can turn in an instant. And you know what it means to come together, to pull together, to grieve together, but, ultimately, to overcome together.After Dave died, I did something I\u2019ve done at other hard times in my life: I hit the books. With my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist who studies how we find meaning in our lives, I dove into the research on resilience and recovery.The most important thing I learned is that we are not born with a certain amount of resilience. It is a muscle, and that means we can build it.We build resilience into ourselves. We build resilience into the people we love. And we build it together, as a community. That\u2019s called \u201ccollective resilience.\u201d It\u2019s an incredibly powerful force \u2013 and it\u2019s one that our country and our world need a lot more of right about now. It is in our relationships with each other that we find our will to live, our capacity to love, and our ability to bring change into this world.Class of 2017, you are particularly suited to the task of building collective resilience because you are graduating from Virginia Tech. Communities like this don\u2019t just happen. They are formed and strengthened by people coming together in very specific ways. You\u2019ve been part of that here, whether you knew it or not. As you go off and become leaders \u2013 and yes, you will lead, you are destined to lead \u2013 you can make the communities you join \u2013 and the communities you form \u2013 stronger.Here\u2019s where you start.These ties do more than connect \u2013 they support. Nearly 30 years ago, a very talented young man made it from a very underprivileged background all the way to college, but then he didn\u2019t finish. And when he dropped out, he said, \u201cIf only I had my posse with me, I would have graduated.\u201d That insight led an amazing woman named Deborah Bial to create the Posse Foundation, which recruits high-potential students in teams of 10 to go from the same city to the same college. Posse kids have a 90 percent graduation rate from some of the best schools in the country.We all need our posses \u2013 especially when life puts the obstacles in our path. Out there in the world, when you leave Virginia Tech, you\u2019re going to have to build your own posse \u2013 and sometimes that\u2019s going to mean asking for help.This was never easy for me. Before Dave died, I tried to bother people as little as possible \u2013 and yes, \u201cbothering people\u201d is what I thought it was. But then my life changed and I needed my friends and family and colleagues more than I ever could have thought I would. My mom \u2013 who along with my dad is here with me today just like yours are here with you \u2013 stayed with me for the very first month, literally holding me as I cried myself to sleep. I had never felt weaker. But I learned that it takes strength to rely on others. There are times to lean in and there are times to lean on.Building a posse also means acknowledging our friends\u2019 challenges. Before I lost Dave, if a friend was going through something hard, I would usually say I am sorry \u2013 once. And then I wouldn\u2019t bring it up again because I didn\u2019t want to remind them of their pain. Losing my husband taught me how absurd that was \u2013 you can\u2019t remind me I lost Dave. But like I had done with others, when people failed to mention it, it felt like there was a big, old elephant following me around everywhere I went.It\u2019s not only death that ushers in the elephant. You want to completely silence a room? Say you have cancer, that your father went to jail, that you just lost your job. We retreat into silence just when we need each other the most. Now, not everyone is going to want to talk about everything all the time. But saying to a friend, \u201cI know you are suffering and I am here with you\u201d can kick a very ugly elephant out of any room.If you are in someone\u2019s posse, don\u2019t just offer to help in a generic way. Before I lost Dave, when a friend was in need, I would say, \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d And I meant it kindly \u2013 the problem is, that question kind of shifts the burden to the person in need. And when people asked me, I didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. \u201cCan you make Father\u2019s Day go away?\u201d Here\u2019s a different approach. When my friend Dan Levy\u2019s son was sick in the hospital, a friend texted him and said, \u201cWhat do you not want on a burger?\u201d Another friend texted from the lobby and said \u201cI\u2019m in the lobby of the hospital for a hug for the next hour whether you come down or not.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to do something huge. You don\u2019t have to wait for someone to tell you exactly what they need. And you do not have to be someone\u2019s best friend from the first grade to show up. If you are there for your friends, and let them be there for you \u2013 if you laugh together until your sides ache, if you hold each other as you cry, and maybe even bring them a burger with the wrong toppings before they ask \u2013 that won\u2019t just make you more resilient, it will help you lead a deeper and more meaningful life.We also build collective resilience through shared narratives. That might sound light \u2013 how important can a story be? But stories are vital. They\u2019re how we explain our past and they are how we set expectations for our future. And they help us build the common understanding that creates a community in the first place.Every time your friends tell their favorite tales \u2013 like, I don\u2019t know, when Tech beat U.V.A. in double overtime \u2013 you strengthen your bonds to each other.Shared narratives are critical for fighting injustice and creating social change. A few years ago, we started LeanIn.Org to help work towards gender equality \u2013 helping women and men form Lean In circles \u2013 small groups that support each other\u2019s ambitions. There are now more than 33,000 Circles in 150 countries. But It wasn\u2019t until I lost Dave that I understood why Circles are thriving \u2013 it\u2019s because they build collective resilience.Not long ago, I was in Beijing and I had a chance to meet with women from Lean In Circles across China. Like in a lot of places, it\u2019s not always easy to be a woman in China. If you\u2019re unmarried past age 27, you\u2019re called sheng nu \u2013 a \u201cleftover woman.\u201d And I thought the word \u201cwidow\u201d was bad! The stigma that comes from being a leftover woman can be intense. One woman \u2013 a 36-year-old economics professor \u2013 was rejected by 15 men because \u2014 wait for it \u2014 she was . . . too educated. After that, her father forbade her younger sister from going to graduate school.But more than 80,000 women have come together in Lean In Circles to create a new narrative. One Circle created a play, \u201cThe Leftover Monologues,\u201d which celebrates being \u201cleftover\u201d and tackles the topics too often unspoken, like sexual harassment, date rape, and homophobia. The world told them what their stories should be, and they said, actually, we\u2019re writing a different story for ourselves. We are not leftover. We are strong and we will write our own story together.Building collective resilience also means trying to understand how the world looks to those who have experienced it differently \u2013 because they are a different race, come from a different country, have an economic background unlike yours. We each have our own story, but we can write new ones together \u2013 and that means seeing the values in each other\u2019s points of view and looking for common ground.Anyone here a little bit anxious about your future? Not sure where the future is taking you? Sometimes me, too. And you know what helps you combat that fear? A very big idea captured in a very tiny word: hope.There are many kinds of hope. There\u2019s the hope that she wouldn\u2019t swipe left. Sorry. There\u2019s the hope that as you sit here your stuff will magically pack itself. Sorry. There\u2019s the hope that it would stop raining. Double sorry. But my favorite kind of hope is called grounded hope \u2014 the understanding that if you take action, you can make things better.We normally think of hope as something that\u2019s held in individual people. But hope \u2013 like resilience \u2013 is something we grow and nurture together. Just two days ago, I visited Mother Emanuel church in Charleston. We all know about the shooting that took place there just two years ago, claiming the lives of a pastor and eight worshipers. What happened afterwards was extraordinary. Instead of being consumed by hatred, the community came together to stand against racism and violence. As a local pastor Jermaine Watkins beautifully put it: \u201cTo hatred, we say no way, not today. To division, we say no way, not today. And to loss of hope, we say no way, not today.\u201dThat was the theme of maybe the most touching Facebook post I\u2019ve ever read \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, I\u2019ve read a lot of Facebook posts. This one was written by Antoine Leiris, a journalist in Paris whose wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was killed in the 2015 Paris attacks. Two days later \u2013 two days \u2013 he wrote an open letter to his wife\u2019s killers. \u201cOn Friday night, you stole the life of an exceptional being, the love of my life, the mother of my son. But you will not have my hate. My 17-month-old son will play as we do every day, and all his life this little boy will defy you by being happy and free. Because you will not have his hate either.\u201dStrength like that makes all of us who see it stronger. Hope like that makes all of us more hopeful. That\u2019s how collective resilience works \u2013 we lift each other up. This might seem very intuitive to you Hokies because these qualities of collective resilience \u2013 shared experiences, shared narratives, and shared hope \u2013 shine forth from every corner of this university. You are a testament to courage, faith and love \u2013 and that\u2019s been true, not just for these past 10 years, but for over a century before then. This university means a lot to you, graduates\u2026 but it also means a lot to America and to the world. So many of us look to you as an example of how to stay strong and brave and true.This is your legacy, Class of 2017. You will carry it with you \u2013 that capacity for finding strength in yourselves and building strength in the people around you.Virginia Tech has given you a purpose, reflected in your motto, \u201cThat I May Serve.\u201d An important way you can serve and lead is by helping build resilience in the world. We have a responsibility to help families and communities become more resilient \u2013 because none of us get through anything alone. We get through it together.As you leave this beautiful campus and set out into the world, build resilience in yourselves. When tragedy or disappointment strike, know that deep inside you, you have the ability to get through anything. I promise you do. As the saying goes, we are more vulnerable than we ever thought, but we are stronger than we ever imagined.Build resilient organizations. Speak up when you see injustice. Lend your time and your passion to the causes that matter. My favorite poster at Facebook reads, \u201cNothing at Facebook is someone else\u2019s problem.\u201d When you see something that\u2019s broken and there is a lot that is broken out there, go fix it. Your motto demands that you do.Build resilient communities. Virginia Tech founded the Global Forum on Resilience four years ago, and it\u2019s doing outstanding work in this field. Be there for your friends and family. And I mean in person \u2013 not just in a message with a heart emoji. Even though those are pretty great, too. Be there for your neighbors; it\u2019s a divided time in our country, and we need you to help us heal. Lift each other up and celebrate each and every moment of joy. Because one of the most important ways you can build resilience is by cultivating gratitude.Two years ago, if someone had told me that I would lose the love of my life and become more grateful, I would have never have believed them. But that\u2019s what happened. because today I am more grateful now than I ever was before \u2013 for my family and especially my children. For my friends. For my work. For life itself.A few months ago, my cousin Laura turned 50. Graduates, you may not appreciate that turning 50 happens soon and feels old \u2013 but your parents do. I called her that morning and I said, \u201cHappy birthday, Laura. But I am also calling to say in case you woke up this morning with that \u2018oh my God, I\u2019m 50\u2019 thing. Don\u2019t do that. This is the year Dave doesn\u2019t turn 50.\u201d Either we get older, or we don\u2019t. No more jokes about growing old. Every year, every moment \u2013 even in the pouring rain \u2013 is an absolute gift.You don\u2019t have to wait for special occasions \u2013 like graduation \u2013 to feel and show your gratitude to your family, your friends, your professors, your baristas \u2013 everyone. Counting your blessings increases them. People who take the time to focus on the things they are grateful for are happier and healthier.My New Year\u2019s resolution last year was to write down three moments of joy before I went to bed each night. This very simple thing has changed my life. Because I realize I used to go to bed every night thinking about what I did wrong and what I was going to do wrong the next day. Now I go to sleep thinking of what went right. And when those moments of joy happen throughout the day, I notice them more because I know they\u2019ll make the notebook. Try it. Start tonight, on this day full of happy memories \u2013 but maybe before you hit Big Al\u2019s.Graduates, on the path before you, you will have good days and you will have hard days. Go through all of them together. Seek shared experiences with all kinds of people. Write shared narratives that create the world you want to live in.

{"Headline": "How to Protect Your Privacy as More Apps Harvest Your Data", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byIn the real world, your personal life is a private space. But in tech, your personal data is a ripe resource for businesses to harvest in their own interests.In addition, Uber was involved in some deception of its own: It participated in fingerprinting, a process in which iPhones were tagged with permanent identities that were detectable even after the Uber app was erased from the devices. The practice violated Apple\u2019s terms of service, which could have resulted in Uber\u2019s being banned from the App Store. Uber eventually revised the app to remove the fingerprinting code.For consumers, giving up some data has become part of the trade-off of receiving compelling, personalized services. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be caught by surprise. Here are some tips from privacy experts on protecting yourself from tricky data collection.When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. To avoid a privacy pitfall like the one involving Unroll.me, start perusing the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, opt against using the service.\u201cPeople quickly run into the challenge that there\u2019s so much legalese that it\u2019s up to you to envision how your data may be used,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. Still, it\u2019s better than reading nothing.For many companies, the path to monetization is anonymized, aggregated user data. That means while your name will not be attached to the information, your age, gender, shopping activities and location will all be rolled up with other users\u2019 data. Altogether, that becomes incredibly valuable information to many retailers looking for market research.So before subscribing to a free app or online tool, take a moment to do a web search for the company\u2019s business model.It\u2019s worthwhile to periodically check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d Ms. Sandvik recommended pruning apps that you don\u2019t recognize or have not used in the last six months. Once you have narrowed down the list, take a deeper dive on the ones that remain and read up on how they use your personal data. If their data-sharing practices sound offensive, remove the apps.Do this audit at least once a year: The number of connected apps on your online accounts can pile up over time. On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.Deleting your app from your phone or computer often isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ll remove data from the device itself, but not from the company\u2019s servers.Even after doing that, you will have to reconcile with the idea that the company will probably hold on to the information you have already shared.

{"Headline": "A Vocal Defender of Ethics Has Fans \u2014 and Foes", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Walter M. Shaub\u2019s term as the government\u2019s top ethics watchdog does not expire until next January, but his corner office here, just a few blocks from the White House, looks unoccupied.No diplomas line the wood-paneled walls. No family photos or mementos. Just standard government-issue furniture, his humming computer and four large paintings. Mr. Shaub wanted to get rid of those, too, but his chief of staff warned that it might scare the 70 other employees in the Office of Government Ethics.\u201cI wanted to not be so attached to this office that I\u2019d be afraid to lose it,\u201d Mr. Shaub said on Friday, surveying the room he packed up shortly before Inauguration Day.\u201cThe story of Walter Shaub is to some extent the story of our American system of checks and balances that has stepped up beyond expectation to defend the Constitution and the law when Trump oversteps,\u201d said Norman Eisen, the Obama administration\u2019s first ethics counsel. Mr. Shaub, he added, might well be \u201cthe unlikeliest star of 2017.\u201dFor Mr. Shaub, who has spent the better part of 15 years in the ethics office \u2014 mostly as a career civil servant \u2014 the experience has been as confounding as it is exhausting.\u201cIf you really look at things, all I\u2019ve done is stand still. It\u2019s the world that is moving around me,\u201d Mr. Shaub said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s seen as some radical act.\u201dIf he has become more outwardly vocal than directors past, he said, it is because this particular White House has shown little interest in an ethics program that both Republicans and Democrats have long supported. His public remarks, he added, came only after he felt the usual private channels of communication with the Trump team were not working.\u201cI\u2019m not fighting against him. I\u2019m fighting for the ethics program. And there is a difference,\u201d Mr. Shaub said. \u201cBecause if I succeed, he\u2019ll benefit.\u201dMr. Shaub has had some success. Though Mr. Trump ultimately put his assets into a so-called half-blind trust that Mr. Shaub has called ineffectual, the ethics office has worked closely and productively to steer the president\u2019s nominees through necessary financial disclosures and ethics agreements.The White House declined to comment on Mr. Shaub.The Office of Government Ethics is not usually a breeding ground for political stardom \u2014 or conflict. Set up in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, its job is to work with a network of ethics offices in federal agencies to oversee ethical standards for 2.7 million civilian government employees. This means examining financial disclosure reports issued by political employees, to help these new hires decide which assets they must sell to avoid a conflict of interest. The office also helps ensure that once new political employees are hired, they honor restrictions from participating in deliberations over topics they handled for paying clients.Though the president is not strictly beholden to those laws, the ethics office has always relied on support from the top to send a message to the rest of the federal work force that its program needs to be taken seriously. The office, agency veterans say, has long prided itself on being nonpartisan, not least because its effective operation depends on strong relationships with whichever party is in the White House.The son of a government chemist, Mr. Shaub grew up in the Washington suburbs with a sense that whatever he chose to do, it ought to entail public service. An interest in ethics only came later, after degrees in history at James Madison University and law at American University. (Two decades later, his own financial disclosure forms show, Mr. Shaub is still paying off student debt.)In a city where the line between work and socializing often blurs, Mr. Shaub has mostly kept his worlds separate. His interests tend toward the geeky, friends say, like zombie stories and film noir. \u201cHe would enjoy puns, especially ones where people would just groan,\u201d said Don Fox, a longtime top agency official. Pop culture, with the possible exception of Harry Potter stories, less so.\u201cHe speaks loudly. He tells funny jokes. He rushes up and down the hall,\u201d said Marilyn Glynn, who hired Mr. Shaub in 2001 and helped recruit him back to the agency in 2006 after a brief stint in the private sector. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss him. It\u2019s like a little bit of a hurricane in the office.\u201dIt was in 2006 that Mr. Shaub first began formally working on ethics issues, overseeing the office\u2019s program guiding 1,100 or so presidential nominees through legally required financial disclosures. He turned the program around, writing standardized handbooks to speed up a typically ornery process and developed a reputation among Democrats and Republicans in the White House as a stern, but highly proficient, steward.\u201cI\u2019d call him up on a Thursday or Friday night and say we need to get this done over the weekend, and he would get the ethics lawyers and the agencies to stay and get it done,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, who served as ethics counsel for the George W. Bush White House. He has vocally defended Mr. Shaub\u2019s approach in recent months.When Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Shaub for the agency\u2019s top job and its only politically appointed post four years later, Congress approved him by voice vote, a rare sign of shared confidence from an otherwise sharply divided Congress. The first four years of his tenure have borne that out, colleagues say. Mr. Shaub has spent the bulk of his time pursuing prosaic bureaucratic reforms like file digitization and developing an online training program for the government\u2019s varied ethics officers.\u201cThis is not a guy who came from the outside and sees this as a great platform for becoming famous,\u201d said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. \u201cThis is a guy who has been working quietly for a long time on ethics issues.\u201dIn the ethics office\u2019s fifth-floor suite here, though, those days feel like a distant memory. Presidential transitions always bring a tsunami of work, but the spotlight trained on the agency this time around has only added stress. Employees have taken to meeting for 10 minutes a day to meditate in a dimly lit conference room.Rick Thomas, a close friend who helped recruit Mr. Shaub to the agency almost two decades ago, said Mr. Shaub had more or less made his peace with his role, even if it means he may be fired before his term\u2019s end. He recalled that when Mr. Shaub was first weighing whether to speak out in opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s conflict of interest plan, the director turned to a line from Albus Dumbledore, the sagacious wizard who tutors Harry Potter in the ways of the world.\u201cSomething to the effect that, \u2018There will be a time when we must choose between what\u2019s easy and what\u2019s right,\u2019\u201d Mr. Thomas recalled Mr. Shaub saying over the phone.\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was a lot of angst over that.\u201dEric Lipton contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My So-Called (Instagram) Life", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byModern LoveHe meant it as an intimate observation, the kind you can make only after spending a lot of time getting to know each other. You flip your hair to the right. You only eat ice cream out of mugs. You always wear a black leather jacket. I know you.And he did know me. Rather, he knew the caricature of me that I had created and meticulously cultivated. The me I broadcast to the world on Instagram and Facebook. The witty, creative me, always detached and never cheesy or needy.That version of me got her start online as my social media persona, but over time (and I suppose for the sake of consistency), she bled off the screen and overtook my real-life personality, too. And once you master what is essentially an onstage performance of yourself, it can be hard to break character.There was a time when I allowed myself to be more than what could fit onto a 2-by-4-inch screen. When I wasn\u2019t so self-conscious about how I was seen. When I embraced my contradictions and desires with less fear of embarrassment or rejection.There was a time when I swore in front of my friends and said grace in front of my grandmother. When I wore lipstick after seeing \u201cClueless,\u201d and sneakers after seeing \u201cRemember the Titans.\u201d When I flipped my hair every way, ate ice cream out of anything, and wore coats of all types and colors.Since then, I have consolidated that variety \u2014 scrubbed it away, really \u2014 to emerge as one consistently cool girl: one face, two arms, one black leather jacket.And so it was a validation of sorts when Joe fell for her, the me in the leather jacket. He was brilliant, the funniest guy in our TV writing program, and my ideal cool counterpart. I could already see us on screen; we made sense.Best of all, he thought he liked me more than I liked him, and that was perfect too, because it gave me the upper hand. I was above love, above emotional complication, dedicated to higher pursuits.Periodically Joe would confront me about this imbalance. We would meet at a park on Second Avenue and 10th Street, and he would tell me that I drove him crazy, that he couldn\u2019t be as removed as me.And, of course, the truth was that I wasn\u2019t removed at all. Over the many months we were together, as we went from being friends to more than friends, I had fallen for him completely. The singular syllable of his name had started to feel permanently tucked between my molars and was always on my mind.But I was reluctant to change my character midseason and become someone who was more open and, God forbid, earnest about love. He had fallen for the cool, detached me, so that\u2019s who I remained. And he got bored.That\u2019s the way it goes with half-hour TV shows. Consistency can become boring. The will-they-or-won\u2019t-they characters have to get together, and at that point the show is closing in on its finale. It\u2019s all in the build, and when that becomes tired, the show gets canceled.The likes I got from my followers did little to quell my crushing need for Joe\u2019s cyberapproval. \u201cLike me again, like me again,\u201d became my subconscious mantra.But he didn\u2019t like me, and each time he didn\u2019t, the heartache felt like a warm bullet exploding in my gut. I would lie on the couch and clutch my stomach so tightly it was as if I were trying to expel the shrapnel from my throat. I knew no one else could extract it for me because no one knew it was there.I was embarrassed for the people I saw who pined publicly on Instagram, but I also envied them. They were showered with support, with reassurance. If they were not completely cured, at least the illness seemed to run a shorter course.Meanwhile, every time I twisted my spine, I felt that warm bullet scraping my insides. I was scared it might fossilize there and become permanently embedded.In an effort to self-soothe, I wrote letters to Joe \u2014 actual, physical letters, pen to notepad \u2014 that felt like some ancient ritual, using my whole hand and not just my thumbs. Staring at his cowlick in class, I would write down everything I wanted: for him to critique my writing, to stroke my hair while we watched \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d on his ugly futon, to read his plays and believe I was moving ever closer to his core.Rather than give him any of these letters, I burned them, trying and failing to cremate that side of myself.Day by day, hour by hour, my Instagram feed became more manic, nasty and petulant. Posts that were once meant as romantic gestures became tiny, pixelated middle fingers.Joe began to notice, but instead of magically falling back in love with me, he became hurt and angry. I was inexplicably cold to him, posting photos of parties I threw that he wasn\u2019t invited to, pictures of me abroad where I hadn\u2019t told him I was studying, and pieces of art I made but hadn\u2019t shared with him.In return, he sent me messages of unvarnished honesty: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you invite me?\u201d \u201cWhy are you being like this?\u201dOh, it\u2019s just who I am. I am fun, I feel nothing and I have completely forgotten you.And so it went, and I kept at the beautiful box I was crafting for myself. A shoe box covered in stickers and fake jewels. The kind you would make for a pet parakeet you have to bury. I would dream about Joe at night, and in the morning I would post something silvery and eye catching. It was always just tinfoil, though, not truth. And I prayed no one would notice.I posted a photo of me standing next to a shirt that said \u201cThe World Shook at Adam\u2019s bar mitzvah, 1995,\u201d with a witty caption about simpler times, before global warming. A girl who follows me, with whom I\u2019ve spoken only a handful of times, told me it was so \u201con brand.\u201dMy brand, specifically: funny, carefree, unromantic, a realist.I\u2019m like the chief executive of my own company, so I\u2019m familiar with my branding, but its success doesn\u2019t thrill me the way it used to. Instead of feeling validated by her comment, I felt deflated. I barely know this girl, and yet she knows me, knows my \u201cbrand,\u201d and I am overwhelmed by the desire to tell her that I am fake, that I am heartbroken.I can\u2019t say for certain that being more honest with my friends or broadening my \u201cbrand\u201d to include a bit of depth, romanticism and pain would have helped. What I can say is that clinging to continuity has made my skin crawl and itch, as if I super-glued a mask over my face. I thought every day about peeling back that mask, but I couldn\u2019t; the girl it represented was everywhere, and I feared that her insides were completely mechanized.This year, Joe and I are in a class together, and he\u2019s unsettled by my presence. I haven\u2019t spoken to him in forever.\u201cWhat\u2019s good, man?\u201d I say with the signature casualness of cartoon me. \u201cIt\u2019s been a minute.\u201dThis is not the me who changed her outfit five times before arriving, who coughed repeatedly until her voice had acquired the perfect amount of rasp, who dug into her pores the night before, trying to rid her body of all signs that he was still buried there, thick and toxic under her skin.If you spend eight years building a house (no matter how uncomfortable or ugly it may be, no matter how impractical or poorly lit), it becomes nearly impossible to knock it down. That is about how long I put into building my social media presence, into becoming the cool girl I showcase on Instagram and Facebook.I built her without blueprints, not knowing that she would become a wall with no doors. She has stopped me from online dating, because that would mean I care about romance. She has stopped me from wearing pink, because that would mean I\u2019m too feminine. She has stopped me from being publicly heartbroken, from sobbing on the orange subway seats, from showing up on Joe\u2019s doorstep with the letters I wrote, because that would mean I\u2019m not cool.Most recently, she tried to stop me from writing this essay, from admitting to everyone that I am hurting.I wrote it anyway, though, and that\u2019s a start.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Through a little window he saw a dark blue continent, sparkling with golden stars and the aurora borealis in the background. He could pick out most of the cities by their lights.Alone among the sea of star-shaped cities, one country glowed as a whole: Belgium. Paris may be the City of Light, but France as a whole, compared to its northern neighbor, seems to have been cast into darkness.Belgium has a dense road network with near-total streetlight coverage. In contrast to neighboring countries, it keeps most of its streetlights on at night, even those along small country roads. About 2.2 million bulbs illuminate Belgium\u2019s roads, and with 186 bulbs per square mile, the country is the unrivaled leader in Western Europe.Mr. Pesquet, a French astronaut with the European Space Agency, is on a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station. The low-orbit station can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. Inside, he runs a weightless research laboratory and carries out scientific experiments for hundreds of researchers. Mr. Pesquet, 39, is accompanied by four other astronauts \u2014 two Americans and two Russians \u2014 and is set to return to Earth on June 2.\u201cHe works 10 hours a day and then does sports exercises,\u201d said Jean Coisne, a European Space Agency spokesman.\u201cBut he has a lot of free time too,\u201d Mr. Coisne added. \u201cAfter work he doesn\u2019t need to take the M\u00e9tro, or cook food in the kitchen, so in his free time he enjoys the most spectacular show there is, and takes pictures of home \u2014 France and Europe \u2014 but also of the rest of the world, and the United States.\u201dThe pictures were posted on Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Instagram, where people praised their beauty and symbolism, but some also raised questions about energy and the environment.\u201cI hope the Belgians will stop lightening up their roads in this way, if they don\u2019t want the extraterrestrials to come and land there,\u201d Caroline Guillot wrote on Mr. Pesquet\u2019s public Facebook page. \u201cBut seriously these pictures are a denunciation of wastefulness.\u201dIn recent years, some efforts to reduce streetlight use have been stopped because of public complaints, Belgian officials said.Contacted by email and asked which was his favorite picture, Mr. Pesquet responded from space on Thursday: \u201cThe one with the aurora. Because auroras are one of the most beautiful things you can see in a lifetime. And also because Europe looks like a carpet of lights on this picture, which it also does in real life.\u201dAn earlier version of a caption for a picture supplied by the European Space Agency misidentified the city visible at the bottom of one of Mr. Pesquet\u2019s photographs.

{"Headline": "Beloved Burrata Finds a Springtime Match", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenFresh Italian cheeses, such as mozzarella di bufala, fior di latte and ricotta, are best eaten as soon as they are made, when they taste utterly pure, sweet and milky. Or at least that\u2019s the wished for, if seldom experienced, ideal.In a village in southern Italy, I visited a family-run cheese shop. Every morning, a variety of fresh cheeses are produced on site, mainly mozzarella in all sizes and shapes, and burrata, mozzarella\u2019s luscious creamy-centered cousin. All of the cheeses are displayed in a pristine stainless-steel basin, bobbing in a light brine, when the store opens for business at 10 a.m. By noon, all of the cheese is sold, and the shop closes. That is the epitome of freshness.Burrata, a once relatively unknown regional specialty, has gained immensely in popularity outside Italy. Now, twice-weekly shipments from Puglia meet the needs of consumers in the United States. That is a lot of burrata. There is also excellent domestically produced burrata, from California, New York, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin.Everyone loves it \u2014 and why not? The filling, a mixture of fresh heavy cream and cheese curd, is spooned onto a quivering, thinly stretched layer of mozzarella and wrapped into a bundle. My mouth waters just thinking about it. Burrata is an affordable temptation, all the more valuable for its delicate, fleeting beauty. It demands to be devoured.The truth is, these cheeses have a short shelf life, two or three days, before they begin to sour, so it\u2019s worth asking when shipments arrive and checking dates for the freshest possible specimens.Fresh burrata needs no adornment, just good bread, or perhaps a drizzle of olive oil and a few arugula leaves.To make it more festive, you can add a quickly made topping of seasonal vegetables, and serve the gilded burrata as a salad or an antipasto. Bright-green fava beans, celery and fennel make a striking rendition for spring, flecked with mint or basil. I wowed my guests when I served this recently.Consider other pairings throughout the year: slices of grilled eggplant or roasted red and yellow peppers, daubed with basil pesto; a salad of heirloom tomatoes; chanterelle mushrooms saut\u00e9ed with rosemary and garlic; grilled radicchio.Good with drinks or as an impromptu meal, burrata, with your accompaniment of choice, makes for easy entertaining.And to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}

My apartment would instead become a glorious pleasure den from which I would enter the brightly colored world of my favorite game: The Legend of Zelda.Zelda is a gaming series set in a fantasy world, where the main character must complete a mission, solving puzzles, munching on bat wings and fighting terrestrial jelly monsters on the way. The newest installment, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, is world class, apparently. If I had a Switch, and Zelda, I\u2019d traverse forest ranges on horseback, while my bills would go unpaid, my dogs would die of hunger and my work deadlines would fade into the background, secondary to what\u2019s really important: defeating an evil boar king.Each morning, I look at the news and want to flush my head down the toilet. Lucky jerks around the nation are meanwhile firing up their Nintendo Switches. Facebook is full of photos snapped by annoyed spouses: prone adults on couches with controllers in their hands, home on the weekends playing Switch, on a break from the real world.I have an online shopping alert set to notify me the second the new Nintendo Switch stock arrives (retail price $299.99). But I\u2019m not going to get one. I\u2019m just a curious observer is what I tell myself.There is a history to my Nintendo fanaticism. When I was 12, my family lived in Australia. We\u2019d emigrated from Yugoslavia (now Serbia) when the wars began. I was in charge of looking after my 7-year-old sister, and all we did was play games in the dining room we had renamed the \u201cNintendo Room.\u201dRather than deal with real life, my sister and I escaped into Zelda. There, our actual circumstances became minor details. There were no immigrants in the world of Nintendo. Being different wouldn\u2019t get us teased, our social status was irrelevant, and anyway we had a more important task to focus on: rescuing a princess from a dungeon.I have not actually touched a Nintendo Switch with my own hands or even been in the same room as one, but from my sophisticated online snooping, I can tell you that the controller vibrates and can be detached, and the graphics are elaborate, unlike the pixelated eight-bit renderings of my memories, punctuated by a primitive synthesizer score. In the several decades I\u2019ve been out of the game, the Nintendo has grown up. What a reunion it would be, the two of us together again as adults, I often think.I\u2019m at a point in my life when a lot of big decisions need to be made. My partner, Michael, annoyingly wants to talk about them. I want the opiate release of a Nintendo Switch.I\u2019ve dropped Michael many hints to this effect. I\u2019ve signed him up for the notification, too. If he is the one who actually buys it, then I am absolved of responsibility, and my life of lying on the couch absorbed in escapist gameplay can begin.\u201cYou know, people are selling Switches on eBay for a couple hundred dollars more than the retail price!\u201d I say, leaving my computer open to the purchase page, as I conveniently disappear to \u201cget some air.\u201d But my hints fall on (sensible) deaf ears.

{"Headline": "ESPN Is Betting on Big Personalities to Restore Its Fortunes", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byAnd in a world where viewers can catch a must-see play on Facebook or stream an entire football game on Twitter, who needs a traditional highlight show like \u201cSportsCenter\u201d that focuses on highlights and updates like player injuries and roster moves?\u201cWe at ESPN are optimists,\u201d John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, said on Tuesday at the network\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers. \u201cOf course, the current environment forces us to be realists as well as optimists.\u201dSo ESPN is shaking things up.The theme was a bet on the power of the network\u2019s personalities. ESPN formally announced several new shows \u2014 including a three-hour morning block with the longtime ESPN host Mike Greenberg, and one that will feature the commentators Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre. In an apparent effort to draw viewers to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d its crown jewel since 1979, ESPN has retooled the show, tying time slots to specific anchors, including Kenny Mayne, one of the network\u2019s best-known personalities. The show will not air at all from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. on ESPN\u2019s main channel.The network has also signed new deals with other ESPN veterans, including Sage Steele and Hannah Storm, who will have a new role that includes hosting prime-time specials. Ms. Steele will host a three-hour morning version of \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on ESPN2.In an effort to meet viewers on their various devices, the network announced SportsCenter Right Now, short news updates online and twice hourly on ESPN during the day. During the presentation, Mr. Skipper highlighted ESPN\u2019s inclusion in television packages offered by the likes of Sling TV and Hulu.ESPN\u2019s efforts to adapt to the digital age are indicative of broader challenges facing cable television. Cord-cutting has accelerated sharply in the last quarter, with traditional cable and satellite providers losing 732,000 subscribers compared with a loss of 102,000 in the same period a year ago, according to research by Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. Lower-priced \u201cskinny\u201d online packages of channels have not made up the slack.National television advertising fell 1 percent in the last quarter, the most in nearly two years.The shifting media landscape has been particularly hard on ESPN. The network has dropped subscribers in the last several years even as sports programming rights have become more expensive. ESPN, for instance, recently paid $12 billion for a nine-year deal with the N.B.A.Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, has staked some hope on an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service that it plans to introduce by the end of the year. But at least initially, the service will mostly stream sporting events for which ESPN owns the programming rights but does not televise, like certain tennis matches, cricket matches and various college sports.Wall Street, however, has looked mostly askance at Disney\u2019s plans for ESPN. During the conference call, analysts bombarded Mr. Iger with questions about the network. The company\u2019s share price is down 7 percent since the last week in April, mirroring an industrywide decline that was driven by fears of cord-cutting and weak ad sales.At the presentation on Tuesday, ESPN acknowledged its troubles, but did not let them detract from the over-the-top ritual of television\u2019s yearly pitch to advertisers. As they nibbled on breakfast sandwiches and avocado toast, the network paraded stars across the stage at a Broadway theater in Midtown Manhattan. Serena Williams sat for a short interview with Mr. Greenberg to promote his morning studio show that will start next year. Paul Pierce, the former N.B.A. star, appeared (\u201cI\u2019m still pulling for the Celtics,\u201d he said), as did many of the network\u2019s biggest names, including Scott Van Pelt, Suzy Kolber, Jon Gruden and Mr. Mayne.Absent, of course, was the talent the network laid off last month, including the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, the former baseball general manager Jim Bowden, and the longtime N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder. Mr. Skipper was not available to talk to reporters after the presentation.But while the network threw out the occasional statistic \u2014 Mr. Skipper said ESPN\u2019s prime-time audience was up 15 percent in the first quarter and digital products reached more than 100 million people \u2014 the program lacked the torrent of sliced-and-diced numbers that often invade such presentations.ESPN was, for the most part, in sell mode, at times poking fun at the notion that television advertising was outdated.\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for the strength of cable,\u201d he said, as he freed himself. \u201cLook at it that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here, Try Some Mezcal. But Not Too Much.", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byEspita Mezcaleria, a new bar in Washington, stocks more than 130 kinds of mezcal. But Megan Barnes, the beverage director, has a surprising sales technique when customers ask for certain brands.\u201cA lot of people come in and say, \u2018I only want something that\u2019s grown in the wild,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe try to steer people away from those, because if you\u2019re constantly drinking these wild agaves, you\u2019re depleting the wild agave fields in Mexico, and then there\u2019s nothing left. We try to teach our customers to be responsible, and we\u2019re responsible ourselves.\u201dYet it\u2019s also potentially troubling, because mezcal may have long-term sustainability issues. Like tequila, it is distilled from the agave plant, which can take anywhere from seven years to decades to grow and harvest. (Mezcal can be made from a wider array of agaves than tequila, which must be made from the blue agave plant.)So on one hand, owners of mezcal bars are spreading the gospel, trying to educate the drinker about the spirit. On the other hand, many are chewing the nails on that first hand wondering if they\u2019re doing the right thing.That scarcity, however, is part of the spirit\u2019s new appeal.\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many tequila fans say that once they discover the diversity of mezcal, it\u2019s hard to go back to only drinking tequila, because the latter is more one-dimensional,\u201d Ms. Janzen added.Just as bartenders are inspired by the aura of authenticity and history that surrounds mezcal, so, too, are young drinkers. \u201cThey are always eager to try a new mezcal,\u201d said Ms. Barnes, of Espita Mezcaleria. \u201cSome people even keep diaries.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely shocking how we\u2019ve touched every bottle,\u201d Mr. Freeman said.Good mezcal isn\u2019t cheap \u2014 prices begin around $35 a bottle, and many brands are more than $100 \u2014 but devotees don\u2019t seem to mind. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense that this is something worth way more than what they\u2019re paying,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s the idea that it is artisanal, helping farmers.\u201dBecause of the buzz surrounding the spirit, more mezcal is being imported into the United States. According to a 2017 report by the Mezcal Regulatory Council, a Mexican organization that oversees mezcal production, exports rose to more than two million liters in 2016 from just under 650,000 liters in 2011, with 63 percent of those exports going to the United States.Those who take this point of view worry that the mezcal boom will endanger the agave plants, mezcal tradition and the liquor itself. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to have to feed the mezcal margarita crowd,\u201d Mr. Freeman said. \u201cWhat if Chili\u2019s starts serving one? It\u2019s not out of the question.\u201dExperts say they know of no group or agency that keeps track of the agave supply in Mexico. And others caution against alarmism. Esteban Morales Garibi, the founder of the Mezcal Derrumbes brand, which has six bottlings, each from a different Mexican state, fears that Americans don\u2019t have the whole picture of the mezcal business.\u201cMexico is so big, and every region has its own reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIn every article I read about this, they are talking in general. I don\u2019t want to put more stress on the consumers of mezcal. They are so worried about what they are drinking. \u2018Should we stop drinking mezcal? Should we stop drinking wild expressions?\u2019 That is not the way. Every bottle you buy is money for families down in Mexico.\u201d\u201cThere are so many brands now, more gimmicky things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it more difficult. The best thing is to explore the terroir and the history of mezcal, the diversity of the different regions.\u201dBut maybe do it in small sips.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the name of a mezcal bar in the East Village. It is Ghost Donkey, not Ghost Monkey.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Powerful, and Provocative, Voice for Southern Food", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byLike the South itself, John T. Edge is complicated. He is part scholar and part kingmaker, a conscientious white man in a Billy Reid sport coat who makes his living wrestling with the food legacy of a region built on slavery.Of the many voices that have risen in the past couple of decades to tell the story of Southern food, his is the loudest. With not much more than a few kind words over a bourbon, John T. (as he will remind you to call him; the T stands for Thomas) can fill seats in a restaurant, snag media attention for a promising chef or jump-start the academic future of a bright acolyte.\u201cIt is the moment in our history I find most compelling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a hopeful Southerner who tells truths about the South. That\u2019s at least what I intend.\u201dIf you become the nation\u2019s most quoted authority on Southern food, you are sure to collect critics, and Mr. Edge, 54, has his share. Even some fans find his take on Southern history wrapped in too much romance, his style too ego-driven or his perspective sometimes skewed by his race, gender and power.\u201cEarly on, he treated the South and its food seriously and removed all the hokey-jokey stuff,\u201d said Kathleen Purvis, the food editor of The Charlotte Observer, \u201cbut he has some blind spots.\u201dMr. Edge took the name potlikker \u2014 the nutrient-rich broth left at the bottom of a pot of greens \u2014 from his dissertation, which he wrote in 2002 after he left a corporate sales job and headed to the University of Mississippi to study race relations.He was an unlikely candidate to unpack the South\u2019s rich but brutal history through food. A middle-class, small-town boy born in Clinton, Ga., the same year federal marshals had to escort the University of Mississippi\u2019s first black student onto campus, Mr. Edge was a high school fullback who went on to pledge a fraternity at the University of Georgia. He dropped out because of what he calls \u201ca lack of focus.\u201dLike many progressive white Southern men of his generation, he struggled. \u201cI wanted to reconcile my profound love of the South with the deep anger that boiled in me when I confronted our peculiar history,\u201d he writes in the book.Mr. Edge landed at Ole Miss in 1995, when farmers\u2019 markets and the internet were gaining speed. A new Southern food movement was bubbling to the surface, lifted by cookbook authors like Edna Lewis and a group of academics pushing to better tell the story of enslaved Africans.Its budget has grown to $1.8 million, much of the money raised from corporate and individual donors swayed by Mr. Edge\u2019s persuasiveness and good humor.Nowhere is his personality better expressed than at the organization\u2019s version of a Burning Man festival, a fall symposium whose themes have included barbecue, beverages and corn, all presented with a wry twist and academic scaffolding, and always with an eye on larger social issues.The Southern Foodways Alliance is sometimes jokingly referred to as the Southern food mafia, and Mr. Edge its boss.\u201cBeing perceived of as \u2018the one\u2019 means there are 15 million people ready to take potshots,\u201d said Dr. Harris, an authority on the food of the African diaspora, who encouraged Mr. Edge to court the poet and artist Blair Hobbs, who would become his wife.Mr. Edge dedicated his new book to Dr. Harris, who was genuinely surprised. \u201cThis is the first time he claimed me as a mentor,\u201d she said.The telling of Southern history through food, they argued, simplifies history in a way that creates a distorted, unrealistically happy view of the region, without enough academic rigor.Mr. Edge concedes that some of the organization\u2019s early work might have been more celebratory and less cleareyed than it should have been. But he pushes back against the charge. \u201cIf you think the S.F.A. or I exist to tell you confirming stories about Southern identity, that\u2019s a misread of our intent and my intent,\u201d he said.Nathalie Dupree, the Southern cooking doyenne and a founder of the foodways alliance, put it another way.\u201cHe has indisputably done a great deal for Southern food, but it has been primarily directed at his concept of Southern food, which is by definition male,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is little emphasis on familial food, the stuff of everyday living, what it is like to fix three meals a day for one\u2019s family as many women did, both black and white.\u201dMr. Edge, whose new book includes Ms. Dupree in a chapter on the cooking teachers of the New South that emerged in 1980s, tried to remedy matters with a 2013 symposium centered on women at work. (I was a paid participant, arguing in favor of cake over pie in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate against the noted pie advocate Kat Kinsman.)Mr. Edge has also been chided for paying too little attention to the story of poor whites in the South, notably by the Appalachian food writer Ronni Lundy, another founder of the alliance.He takes all of it to heart, and the alliance\u2019s programming has improved as a result. But, as he says often, Southern food is first and foremost black food. \u201cIf you are going to think and write about Southern food,\u201d he said, \u201cthe first thing to apprehend is the debts of slavery and the imprint of slavery on this place.\u201dMr. Wey both delights in the attention Mr. Edge receives and takes him to task for it. \u201cWhite privilege permits a humble, folksy and honest white boy to diligently study the canon of appropriated black food, then receive extensive celebration in magazines, newspapers and television programming for reviving the fortunes of Southern cuisine,\u201d Mr. Wey wrote in the column.The article and Mr. Edge\u2019s response \u2014 a pledge to listen more and talk less \u2014 generated waves of debate. And it helped Mr. Wey.\u201cYes, he is a polarizing figure,\u201d Mr. Wey said. \u201cYes, he is a demigod. But people know my name because they read the John T. piece.\u201d Mr. Wey received a fellowship from the alliance this year and now considers Mr. Edge a friend.\u201cIf you\u2019ve done your work right, there are people out there who are going to pick fights,\u201d he said.Mr. Edge knows that like anyone else who has ideas about how to tell stories, he can be hardheaded. But he is always trying to learn more and to grow.The best thing he can do, he said, is something he learned from his wife: \u201cBe vulnerable and be open, and I\u2019m not necessarily good at that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Water: 10 Favorite Places on European Rivers, Lakes and Coastlines", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "The Palace Pier embraces its colorful history as wholeheartedly as it does its formidable stockpiles of kitsch, and visitors \u2014 as at Coney Island, or in parts of Las Vegas \u2014 are advised to do the same. For those whose constitutions have aged out of \u201cdodgems\u201d (bumper cars) and the \u201cWild River\u201d ride (on the edge of a pier, its slogan is \u201cLet\u2019s Get Wet!\u201d), the main attractions may be culinary.This far from land \u2014 the pier is around 1,700 feet long \u2014 your umbrella doesn\u2019t stand a chance. But don\u2019t forget your camera. The pier\u2019s distinctive lines, if not the temporary tattoos on offer (\u201cNo pain! Honest opinions! No regrets!\u201d), have appeared in photo shoots for Vogue and Marie Claire (a previous Brighton pier was painted by both Constable and Turner).Like me, you might love the pier best at night. And if its crowded promenade, pulsing music and nearly 70,000 light bulbs overwhelm, step to the side and press your waist against the elegant wrought-iron railing. Look out over the dark sea, where reflections of the pier\u2019s storied past and bright present are easy to spot on the waves, and then head back to the party.MARK VANHOENACKEREstablished in 1949 and named a Unesco World Heritage site in 1979, this chain of 16 lakes, 80 miles south of Zagreb, is the crown jewel of the country\u2019s oldest and largest national park. Click on nearly any blog referring to the Balkans and you will find a cascade of posts from every season, describing the roaring falls and interlocked turquoise lakes crisscrossed with boardwalks and surrounded by beech and spruce forests.The park, nearly 115 square miles, sits atop a giant cave-riddled karst field in the rolling hills of the Dinaric Alps. This sievelike topography provides a unique canvas for hydrologic artistry. Rivers and streams rush above and beneath the earth\u2019s surface. They bob and weave through porous limestone carrying calcium carbonate sediment that creates the millenniums-old travertine barriers responsible for Plitvice\u2019s Upper and Lower Lakes and waterfalls, which foster more than 1,200 plant species, 161 bird species, brown bears, lynx, deer, otters and wolves.For many Croats, however, the park\u2019s importance is more than just physical. Near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Plitvice is a symbolic and strategic fulcrum at the crux of the country\u2019s boomerang shape, with one arm thrust east to the Pannonian Plain and the other south along the Adriatic coast. \u201cFor centuries, the lakes literally sat on the front lines of history,\u201d said Vjeran Pavlakovic, a history professor at the University of Rijeka in Croatia. \u201cBut even as regimes and borders changed, there was always respect paid to the fragility of this one-of-a-kind ecosystem. Very few places in the world can claim that.\u201dALEX CREVARAmsterdam has been my home for more than 10 years, and I am always a little disappointed when traveling to other Dutch towns to find that everything\u2019s a bit the same: Same quaint two- and three-story tilted, brick-and-timber houses lined up along picturesque canals, same town center organized around a central church and square; same main shopping street with the same collection of chain stores where everyone promenades on Saturdays.But Utrecht, about 35 miles from Amsterdam, doesn\u2019t feel like a cookie-cutter Dutch town, and that can largely be attributed to its canals, which have a different look and feel from canals elsewhere in the Netherlands. Notably, these canals have wharves, which means boats can glide right up to the side of the canal and dock (which isn\u2019t quite so easy in Amsterdam, for example, where you can only disembark from a canal boat at one of several established docks, or else you have to pull up to the canal wall and tremulously climb a ladder).Created in medieval times, this system of waterways was used for trade and transport of cargo, and the wharves led on to cellars used for storage. Today, they have been adapted to serve as houses, restaurants and cafes. When springtime comes, the wharves become terraces where everyone seems to promenade or dine in the sun, next to the lively water traffic that you watch pass by right in front of you: kayaks, rafts and even the occasional Venitian-style gondola.It seemed like we were joining the entire city \u2014 including the students who attend the local university \u2014 for a Sunday jaunt. There must have been thousands of people at the establishments along the water, on the mezzanine and orchestra levels, making this one of the liveliest terrace cultures in Europe.NINA SIEGALConfession: I\u2019ve lived in Paris for 12 years, but I\u2019ve never braved the crowds (or ticket prices) to scale the Eiffel Tower and admire the cityscape from high above the Seine. Instead, when I feel like hovering over a body of water and enjoying knockout views with the help of Gustave Eiffel, I cross the long, elevated footbridge he designed for Paris\u2019s most enchanting park: Parc des Buttes-Chaumont.Like the Eiffel Tower, the park, a 25-hectare (around 61 acres) green space in northeast Paris, was created for a Universal Exposition, in 1867. Like the celebrated icon, the former quarry turned park required Pharaonic labors to complete. Some 1,000 workers spent years dynamiting rocks, removing boulders, deploying soil and digging a water basin while creating vast ersatz cliffs, grottoes and cascades from concrete and other materials. Eiffel designed the metal-and-wood bridge that spans the artificial lake and leads to the marquee attraction: a jagged mountainous island topped by a Roman-style temple. Stone tunnels and stairways groove the fairy-tale landscape, and classical-style sculptures and sinewy green lampposts dot the grass. Small wonder that Andr\u00e9 Breton and Louis Aragon, the early 20th-century pioneers of Surrealism, rhapsodized about this urban oasis.\u201cHere is the apartment of dreams,\u201d Aragon wrote. \u201cA gorge of artificial rock, a passage at the bottom of a vale, a stream rushing to a waterfall at its end.\u201dJust before the park\u2019s 150th birthday \u2014 it opened on April 1, 1867 \u2014 I circled the lake and followed the paths toward Eiffel\u2019s brainchild, which was rebuilt some decades ago. The whole population of the multiethnic 19th Arrondissement seemed to be sprawled along the waterside, equipped with books or baguettes.Almost every area of the park offers a view of the lake and island. Framed by the arch of a stone tunnel, they appear somber and mysterious. Viewed from the lush hillside, they surge through the surrounding urban landscape in a dramatic burst. Looming below the high footbridge, they take on a sublime vastness.Climbing the island\u2019s switchback paths, I found myself in the small circular temple, modeled on the Temple of Vesta in Rome. The city was at my feet. Beyond the patchwork sprawl of boulevards and rooftops, the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica was visible in the distance. Next to me, an Arab woman photographed her children against the scenic backdrop, while a Frenchman in a black skullcap gazed out from the railing. For the moment, we were all worshiping the same thing: Paris.SETH SHERWOODDipping a toe into the Eftalou hot springs on the northern tip of Lesbos island can take what seems like an eternity. Channeled into a superb communal bathhouse at the edge of the azure Aegean Sea, the thermal waters that well up are so sultry \u2014 between 109 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that visitors tend to slip into the enveloping heat inch by inch.Greeks have frequented this spot for centuries to soak up the therapeutic properties of the waters, which are rich with radium, chloride, sodium and other minerals said to ease arthritis and rheumatism. While Lesbos, as a volcanic island, has a number of natural thermal springs, Eftalou holds a unique perch next to a tranquil pebble beach with wind-sculpted lava formations.Visiting is easy from the nearby town of Molyvos, adorned with pretty stone houses set into the side of a steep hill and crowned by an old Genovese castle. After walking or taking a bus to the entrance to Eftalou, a path leads to a domed, whitewashed building where the communal hot bath is next to a more modern facility, where visitors can rent private bath tubs.Eftalou\u2019s ritualistic endurance challenge involves soaking for a few minutes, or as long as you can stand it, then plunging directly into the bracing waters of the Aegean, and heading back to the thermal pool. The relaxation sets in after a few rounds, deepened by floating in the salty sea and looking across the horizon toward the purple mountains of Turkey, or gazing upward at the impossibly blue sky.LIZ ALDERMANDespite being 70 or so miles from the sea, Hamburg is very much defined by its relationship with water: The huge Alster lake lies at its heart, and nearly 2,500 bridges crisscross the city\u2019s network of canals and rivers.But it is the great Elbe River that is the lifeblood of this old Hanseatic port, with container ships and cruise liners coming inland from the North Sea, making it the principal maritime gateway to Germany.Strandperle is the older, larger and more charming of the two \u2014 its name means \u201cbeach pearl,\u201d and there is indeed something precious about it. Here, you can while away a few hours drinking the local Astra beer, a Weissweinschorle (white wine spritzer), or the native Fritz Kola. The food is tasty \u2014 decent burgers, salad and currywurst for 10 to 15 euros ($11 to $16), served in easygoing fashion.The beach is relaxing in the way all beaches are \u2014 sand under your feet, sun bouncing off the water, a busy tranquillity \u2014 but it is the view across the river that really sets it apart. You can watch huge vessels glide up and down the river, and it\u2019s impossible not to find yourself wondering which far-off port they set sail from, or what mysterious cargo they carry.Eventually one of these vessels will dock directly opposite the beach. Watching the cranes, with their vaguely equine form, go to work, hoisting the containers is utterly mesmerizing, a large-scale mechanical choreography unfolding before you.There is something resolutely German about the spectacle \u2014 the juxtaposition of beach and industry, the hum of playful relaxation on one side of the river and the thrum of modern commerce on the other, balanced in delightful synchronicity.DAVIN O\u2019DWYERFjords can be found in many places \u2014 Alaska, the Amalfi Coast or any place where receding glaciers carved a deep valley that subsequently filled with seawater. But these geological phenomena are most closely associated with Norway, and not just because the origin of the word is from Old Norse. Some of the longest, deepest fjords in the world are along the country\u2019s western coast, which maintains a near-mythic status among certain travelers.My premier fjord tour, several years ago, was peppered with hokey fabricated \u201csights,\u201d like a middle-of-nowhere waterfall \u2014 impressive by itself \u2014 where actors dressed as forest trolls materialized from the mist and proceeded to dance to the thundering theme of Edvard Grieg\u2019s \u201cIn the Hall of the Mountain King.\u201dI chose a less flashy tour last fall, when I boarded a catamaran in Bergen, Norway\u2019s western second city, with my friend Meredith, who was visiting Scandinavia for the first time.\u201cYou have to see a fjord when you\u2019re in Norway,\u201d I had said before we sailed north toward Osterfjorden, an icy drizzle pelting our faces. This three-hour cruise also had some predetermined stops: to admire a pack of tame mountain goats, a trickle of a waterfall and an old one-room schoolhouse that students once reached by rowboat. But the soundtrack was mellower: silence to accompany the landscape as the boat glided through the waterway framed by tall cliffs, leaving a gentle wake rippling through the inky water.Our environs were as isolated \u2014 read: no cell service \u2014 as they were impressive. Contact was soon lost with Meredith, too, as she succumbed to jet lag. Alone, I retreated to the aft deck and watched the passing landscape, shifting but unchanging. The occasional village beside the water \u2014 no visible road in or out, just a few wooden houses clustered together as if seeking collective warmth against the chill \u2014 seemed to be a vision of Norway past. Here, in the boat\u2019s gentle lull, a calmness enveloped the static scene. And as with every fjord that had come before, time retreated, leaving in its place a meditative experience \u2014 nature\u2019s mindfulness master class \u2014 available to anyone willing to undertake the journey.INGRID K. WILLIAMSPrague is justifiably celebrated for its buildings, with hundreds of nonpareil constructions illustrating more than 10 centuries of amazing architecture. But in recent years, the Czech capital has embraced its natural beauty as well, especially the Vltava, which slides through the city like a serpent.Many travelers probably won\u2019t notice that the music playing during the landing in Prague aboard most Czech Airlines flights is none other than the Czech composer Bedrich Smetana\u2019s symphonic poem \u201cVltava.\u201d But if you experience Prague like a local, you\u2019re likely to take home many wonderful memories of the beautiful river itself.EVAN RAILThe anticipation is important. When I take first-time visitors to the Cinque Terre, I always have a plan, and the plan is to hike. Starting in Monterosso, we climb into the hills, up one narrow stone staircase after another, following the path across bridges and through lemon groves until sweat beads at our temples and shirts plaster to our backs. Energy flags, the ascent seems endless, but suddenly, there is the view: the seaside village of Vernazza with its curving harbor and jumble of pastel buildings the size of Legos from this height, perched in a spot where nature intended nothing but towering cliffs dropping into the Mediterranean.Longtime residents of this region, on Italy\u2019s northwestern coast, love to debate the merits of the Cinque Terre\u2019s many trails. The main footpath, the Sentiero Azzurro, is often deemed too crowded, though it\u2019s for good reason: The impact of this particular vista, a gut-punch of natural beauty, never fails to impress. Even after more than 10 years of hiking this trail (my sleepy inland town is only 10 miles away), I still reach for my camera every time.Later, after a long descent, the trail eventually culminates in Vernazza, where there are few signs of the landslides that nearly wiped out the village and neighboring Monterosso in 2011. Before that disaster, the harbor was the perfect posthike swimming hole. On calm summer days, turquoise water would lap over smooth stones that were cool and slippery beneath hot feet as you waded into the sea. This is the dreamy scene that my friend Elizabeth snapped six years ago, then enlarged and hung up in her Chicago home \u2014 a memory of a sweltering August afternoon that she now recounts to her young sons.Today, the reinforced harbor has more concrete than natural stone. But the same panorama, seen from aboard the ferry as it departs from the quay, is just as memorable. Then Vernazza recedes from view, again a tiny puzzle piece in the cinematic Cinque Terre coast.INGRID K. WILLIAMSPerched over the water\u2019s edge near the city\u2019s old commercial wharf, Centro Bot\u00edn is the first building in Spain designed by Mr. Piano. Commissioned by the Bot\u00edn Foundation, which is run by the family that controls Spain\u2019s biggest bank, Banco Santander, the building features two elevated structures clad in 270,000 shimmery ceramic discs meant to reflect the changing light and colors of the bay and sky.Inaugural exhibitions are devoted to the German contemporary artist Carsten H\u00f6ller, drawings by Goya and selections from the foundation\u2019s collection. Fernando Caruncho, a landscape designer, has revamped the neighboring Pereda Gardens, and the center\u2019s restaurant will be led by the chef Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez.Centro Bot\u00edn is not the only reason to visit Santander, which stretches along one side of an expansive bay in which sailboats, cruise ships, ferries and freighters navigate. The mouth of the bay is guarded on one side by the Magdalena Palace, which once served as a summer residence for Spanish kings. On the other side is El Puntal, a huge sandbar that, when it is sunny out, draws residents in pleasure boats and water taxis.ANDREW FERRENAn\u00a0article\u00a0last Sunday\u00a0about 10 waterside destinations in Europe described the location of the Guggenheim Bilbao, in Bilbao, Spain, incorrectly.

{"Headline": "A Green That Does More Than Garnish", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byCity KitchenWe know watercress as a garnish here in the United States \u2014 just a bit of decorative greenery, like a parsley sprig. That\u2019s a shame.In France, watercress soup is popular; basically a variant of the soup vichyssoise (potato and leek), with a fair amount of the peppery greens blended with the pur\u00e9e, it is creamy, green and lovely. Or watercress may replace curly endive in the classic bistro salad with bacon, egg and mustard vinaigrette.Watercress has been a popular ingredient in Britian since Victorian times. Dainty watercress sandwiches are standard tea fare, prepared like cucumber sandwiches on buttered slices of crustless white bread. I do love a watercress sandwich, but I\u2019m apt to make mine a bit more robust. A freshly baked crisp baguette, split lengthwise and generously buttered, stuffed with watercress and slices of tart cornichons, is one of my all time favorite versions, suitable for a picnic or spontaneous snack.An aquatic plant, watercress grows wild in streams everywhere, but unless you know the water is pure, it\u2019s best not to pick it. One of the vendors at my local farmers\u2019 market collects wild cress from an unspoiled freshwater spring and it is marvelous, but most watercress is cultivated, often hydroponically.There are also several varieties of land cress, grown in soil, such as upland cress, curly cress or peppercress. It is a cruciferous vegetable (and a superfood, overflowing with nutrients), a relative of arugula, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and kale.A watercress salad is always a fine idea. This colorful rendition is easy to put together and a bit unusual. It employs raw beets, for one thing, very thinly sliced and dressed only with salt, lemon juice and lemon zest. The seasoning lightly pickles the beet slices in just a few minutes. I layer the watercress and beets, adding sliced radishes and hard-cooked eggs. It is beautiful, if somewhat spartan \u2014 seasoned, but not really dressed.It\u2019s very good just like that. But to add richness, the salad is finished with a spoonful of zesty horseradish cream, passed separately at the table. Then it becomes something otherworldly.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Be Clear: Bad Wines Are Bad Wines, Period", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byThe PourIf you drink bad wine long enough, will that eventually lead to drinking good wine?No, I don\u2019t think so. Still, a couple of wine writers have recently tried to make the case that bad wine should be tolerated, if not embraced. They argue that it can\u2019t be entirely bad if it appeals to large numbers of people. Drinking bad wine encourages the love of all wine, and, really, nothing is harmful about bad wine, so why not live and let live?I\u2019m all for peaceful coexistence. I would never fault people for the wines they choose to drink, or for not making good wine a priority in their lives. But if you do care about drinking good wine, then you ought to take serious issue with these arguments, as I do.Just as important, these articles suggest that wine critics should not make reasoned aesthetic judgments about good and bad. Instead, critics should encourage drinking wine of any kind on the theory that wine culture will ultimately benefit from the quantity consumed rather than the quality.Aside from its patronizing nature, such a position conflates the role of the critic, whose aim is to encourage judgment and discernment, with an industry mouthpiece, whose role is to encourage sales. Critics, and all wine journalists, should owe no allegiance to the wine industry, nor accept the notion that consumption of any wine achieves a sort of ultimate good.\u201cThese maligned bottles have a place,\u201d Ms. Bosker wrote. \u201cThe time has come to learn to love unnatural wines.\u201dMs. Bosker argued that applying technology to wine has democratized it by improving its quality and making what she called good wine accessible to more people at lower prices.\u201cThanks to pumps and powders, drinkers who can\u2019t splurge no longer have to settle for plonk,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe gap between fine wine and commercial wine is shrinking as producers use chemical shortcuts not only to avoid blatant flaws, but also to mimic high-end bottles.\u201dThis argument is wrong in almost every way.First of all, additives and manipulation didn\u2019t improve the general level of wine. Science did. For centuries, nobody understood how winemaking worked. Fermentation was largely a mystery, as were the reasons that wine spoiled.Scientific breakthroughs revealed the role of yeast in fermentation and explained how bacteria converted harsh malic acid into softer lactic acid, which makes many red wines and some whites easier to drink. Science uncovered the pernicious effects of unwanted microbial activity in wine, the harm that comes from prolonged exposure to air and warmth and the benefits of scrupulous attention to cleanliness in winemaking. This all resulted in fewer flawed wines.Technological improvements were beneficial, too. Refrigeration helped to make fresh, fruity white wines, as did the wide availability of stainless steel. Yet the technology for manipulating textures and flavors, and for taking away alcohol, hasn\u2019t improved wine. It\u2019s just made it more formulaic, like soft drinks and other beverages, by streamlining production for consistency and stability. It\u2019s like saying the development of Wonder Bread made bread better.Finally, the notion that manipulating cheap wine to mimic high-end bottles benefits consumers is laughable. Few things have been as damaging to the American wine industry as its homogenization. Knockoff wines sell, but the American wine industry also craves critical approval. Imitation high-end wines may satisfy many people, but they are commodities, no more worthy of applause than the imitation designer bags sold on Canal Street.One of wine\u2019s glories is its diversity. The Old World, which had the advantage of centuries of localized efforts, can offer hundreds of different wines, produced by heritage and tradition, that are far more honest expressions of culture than any imitation Napa cabernet sauvignon \u2014 a product of oak chips, enzymes, \u201cpumps and powders\u201d \u2014 rising from California\u2019s sun-baked Central Valley.While I believe that less processed wines are healthier, they are also better wines. For people who want to drink better wines, thinking of wine as food was a useful approach to achieve that goal.Ms. Bosker and Ms. Mobley found common ground in their hope that processed, manipulated wines would serve as gateway bottles for the next generation of wine lovers.This is a position that I have never understood. I don\u2019t believe that the wine industry cares about \u201coenophiles,\u201d a word that is as snobbish as it sounds. It doesn\u2019t produce millions of bottles of bad cheap wine because it wants to develop knowledgeable, judicious wine drinkers. It makes junk wine because it sells like junk food.Cheap good wine, which may take a bit of effort to find, and which is marginally more expensive, would be a far better on-ramp for future wine lovers. Whether cheap or expensive, good wine is more than a focus-group-tested alcohol delivery system. It is an expression of culture, a convivial pleasure, a companion to food and, occasionally, an emotional and contemplative experience.That sort of experience is not for everybody. Many people simply have other priorities in life, and are happy to get a bit buzzed on fruity wine, which is fine.But I take issue with people who ought to know better, those who confuse the differences between bad and good wines, and critics and industry promoters. Anyone who is in the business of examining wine critically needs to actually be critical, not simply validate consumer choices, and looking at wine critically means understanding the chasm between mass-produced wine products and wines that are an expression of a place, a people and an aesthetic.I said I thought it would be horrible. Yes, wines that few people are able to taste would instead be widely available, their complexities sampled by many rather than a privileged few.Yet such reproductions would completely change the experience. Good wine is, by nature, fleeting, mysterious, ever-changing, subject to the imperfect, unpredictable nuances of weather, place and human judgment. It changes continually, reacting to temperature and touch, food and mood, its years in the bottle and its minutes in the glass. It is beyond reproduction.Whether it is cheap or expensive, those who love wine live for the thrill of the surprise, the sense of discovery, the pleasure of knowing that the best wines can take you places that you never anticipated.It\u2019s the unknown that makes fine wine, not the elimination of flaws or the popularity of flavors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jersey City Mayor Balks at Tax Break for Kushners", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe Democratic mayor of New Jersey\u2019s second-largest city, who has had his ups-and-downs with the state\u2019s volatile governor, Chris Christie, is now threatening to stymie luxury development dreams of the family of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The project \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family,\u201d Ms. Meyer said in Beijing to an audience of people interested in securing permanent residence in the United States in exchange for investments of $500,000 or more.The roadshow in China added fuel to fears that the Trump family has not sufficiently severed ties to its varied business interests, leaving open many avenues to conflicts of interest.In Jersey City, the Kushner family\u2019s involvement in the project has stirred up opposition among liberal and progressive residents of Jersey City who are critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, especially his stance on immigration. One activist group has campaigned to \u201cevict Trump-Kushner,\u201d demanding that the city refuse any tax breaks to companies that Jared Kushner has a stake in.In his brief posting, which linked to a story in The New York Times about the investor roadshow in China, Mr. Fulop indicated that he had found fault with the terms of the requested tax abatements.Some critics of the mayor charged this week that the opposition to the tax break was aimed at appeasing liberals who disapprove of Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent political,\u201d said Bill Matsikoudis, a former Jersey City corporation counsel who is running against Mr. Fulop. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to throw a bone to the progressive, very anti-Trump people in Jersey City.\u201dMr. Matsikoudis, a Democrat, said he could not recall a request for a large tax abatement being turned down in Jersey City, whose leaders have used tax breaks to lure developers to its growing financial district on the west bank of the Hudson River. But he added that the package of tax breaks the Kushner group was seeking appeared to be quite rich even by the standards of the Fulop administration.The tax breaks would require an ordinance passed by the City Council, which has not yet taken up the matter. But in his posting, Mr. Fulop said, \u201cI don\u2019t foresee the council voting in favor.\u201dThat pronouncement drew cheers from \u201cEvict Trump/Kushner,\u201d which released a statement saying, \u201cwe know that our resistance is just beginning.\u201d Alluding to the promotional events in China, the group said, \u201cThis attempt to use the office of the presidency for personal profit is grossly unethical. Such behavior is a direct consequence of Jared Kushner\u2019s failure to fully and transparently divest from his businesses.\u201dA spokesman for the Kushner Companies, James Yolles, said the project would be a boon to Jersey City. \u201cOur current proposal for One Journal Square would provide 4,000 sorely needed union jobs and $180 million in tax revenue for Jersey City over the next 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier this year, we looked at the market and decided on a more conventional project, which we think strengthened our proposal. We are committed to moving ahead with this meaningful investment in the long-term future of Journal Square.\u201dJared Kushner has divested his interests in the One Journal Square project, selling them to a family trust whose primary beneficiaries are his siblings and whose trustee is their mother. He remains the beneficiary of a series of trusts that hold stakes in the majority of the Kushner Companies business.About 18 months ago, One Journal Square received $93 million in tax breaks from the state of New Jersey through its Economic Development Authority. The main partner of the Kushner Companies in the project is KABR Group, a private equity real estate firm.A different Kushner Companies project that opened late last year in Jersey City relied on $50 million raised from foreign investors seeking entry to the United States on EB-5 visas. That visa program awards foreigners the right to live in the United States for two years, and a good shot at permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects.That building, a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment, got its EB-5 funding entirely from Chinese applicants. Applicants from China account for about 75 percent of the EB-5 visas.The Kushners seek $150 million in EB-5 financing for One Journal Square. The copy of the abatement application for the project estimated that the project would cost more than $820 million.Jesse Drucker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Andrew Scheer, Canada\u2019s Conservative Leader, Has Yet to Define Himself", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s new Conservative Party leader, Andrew Scheer \u2014 who will challenge Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the next national election \u2014 is somewhat of a mystery.He shares a political background with his fellow Conservative Stephen Harper, the former prime minister Mr. Trudeau defeated in 2015. But while Mr. Harper was often characterized as something of a micromanaging autocrat, Mr. Scheer campaigned on building consensus within the party.And though neither exudes the glamour or political flare of Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Scheer lacks Mr. Harper\u2019s wooden public manner. Mr. Scheer, who was announced as party leader on Saturday night, has a face that lights up in a warm smile \u2014 something Mr. Harper had found difficult to summon. And while the former prime minister was once famously photographed giving his young son a stiff handshake before school, Mr. Scheer has been seen acting as a jungle gym for his five children.Still, the morning after Mr. Scheer squeaked out a victory over Maxime Bernier, a free-market member of Parliament from Quebec and an enthusiastic admirer of Ayn Rand, it was not obvious if Mr. Scheer will simply be Stephen Harper with a smile.\u201cIt will be a journey of discovery for Canadians when it comes to Andrew Scheer,\u201d said Tim Powers, the vice chairman of Summa Strategies, a polling and lobbying firm that was formerly an adviser to governments held by the Progressive-Conservatives, one of the predecessors of the current Conservative movement.Mr. Scheer, 38, emerged from a field of 14 candidates through an unusually complex voting system to take 50.95 percent of the available points. And while Mr. Bernier laid out a detailed and often provocative platform, Mr. Scheer offered few campaign promises that often dealt with small issues. His most significant vow was to end carbon taxes \u2014 but that stance was shared by most of the candidates, and such taxes are ultimately a responsibility of provinces, anyway.Two factors add to the difficulty of predicting what Mr. Scheer will do as party leader now \u2014 or what he might do in 2019 if his party defeats Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and makes him prime minister.Mr. Scheer was elected to Parliament at age 25 and never served in any of Mr. Harper\u2019s cabinets, which kept his public profile to a minimum. And from 2011 to 2015, he was the speaker of the House of Commons \u2014 a job that not only required him to be nonpartisan but also meant he could not propose or vote on legislation.\u201cScheer\u2019s advantage is that no one can define him,\u201d said Peter Woolstencroft, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Waterloo who has written often about Canada\u2019s conservatives. \u201cBut his weakness is that he has no defense against people who will try to define him.\u201dProfessor Woolstencroft said several critical areas will require Mr. Scheer\u2019s attention if he hopes to turn around the Conservative Party\u2019s fortunes. While minority communities have emerged as an important force in Canadian politics as the country\u2019s demographics have changed, much of the debate during the leadership campaign focused on issues that some saw as xenophobic or even racist.\u201cThe Liberals respect new Canada,\u201d Professor Woolstencroft said. \u201cIf the Conservatives don\u2019t watch it, they\u2019re going to be very unhappy after the next election.\u201dProfessor Woolstencroft also said that Mr. Scheer needed to break with Mr. Harper\u2019s approach to dealing with indigenous Canadians. Relations between that group and the Conservatives have been, at best, strained.Mr. Scheer, a Roman Catholic, holds socially conservative positions on issues like gay marriage, abortion and extending rights to transgender people. Those appeared to help him gain support in his leadership bid.But same-sex marriage and abortion are permitted in Canada, and Mr. Scheer has promised not to open debate on those issues \u2014 creating some doubt about his true position.\u201cIf he embraces too much of a social conservative agenda, he\u2019ll find there\u2019s not enough social conservatives in Canada to win,\u201d Mr. Powers said.Ultimately, it is how voters compare Mr. Scheer with Mr. Trudeau, not Mr. Harper, that will be the test of his leadership. And it may be a test in which his party gives him the benefit of the doubt, at least in their first face-off.Before and after his victory on Saturday, Mr. Scheer focused his attacks mostly on Mr. Trudeau\u2019s style rather than on his politics, casting the prime minister as an out-of-touch elite.But Mr. Powers said that Mr. Scheer may not need to win in 2019 to keep his party happy.\u201cHistory would suggest Trudeau has the opportunity to win a second mandate,\u201d Mr. Powers said. \u201cConservatives may want to see this current leader hold and renew the party. Justin Trudeau is a very strong opponent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Returns to Crisis Over Kushner as White House Tries to Contain It", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byPresident Trump returned home on Saturday to confront a growing political and legal threat, as his top aides tried to contain the fallout from reports that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a focus of investigations into possible collusion between Russia and the president\u2019s campaign and transition teams.As Mr. Trump ended a nine-day overseas trip that aides considered the most successful stretch of his presidency, he was returning to a crisis that had only grown in his absence. The White House canceled a presidential trip to Iowa in the coming days and was putting together a damage-control plan to expand the president\u2019s legal team, reorganize his communications staff and wall off a scandal that has jeopardized his agenda and now threatens to engulf his family.Mr. Trump\u2019s private legal team, led by his New York lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, was preparing to meet in Washington to face new questions about contacts between Mr. Kushner and representatives of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump may meet with Mr. Kasowitz as early as Sunday, and aides have recruited a series of prominent Washington lawyers with experience in political investigations for Mr. Trump to interview in hopes that they might join the legal team.Mr. Kushner, who organized the president\u2019s Middle East stops at the start of the foreign trip, chose to return to Washington with several days to go and has been unusually subdued since then. But he has no plans to step down from his role as senior adviser or to reduce his duties, according to people close to him.Still, there are signs that he is tiring of the nonstop combat and the damage to his reputation. He has told friends that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have made no long-term commitment to remain by Mr. Trump\u2019s side, saying they would review every six months whether to return to private life in New York.As reports emerged about investigators\u2019 focus on Mr. Kushner, he and Ms. Trump discussed the possibility of having Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, issue a statement denying that Mr. McGahn had been contacted by federal officials about Mr. Kushner. Mr. McGahn, who has been increasingly uneasy in his role since Mr. Trump ignored his advice to delay Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal, said he was not the person to write such a statement, suggesting that doing so would create a precedent requiring a response to each new report. Mr. Kushner\u2019s private lawyer issued a statement instead.Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner have complained privately about what he views as an unfair level of scrutiny of his actions. He has dismissed the attention on him as a reflection of his father-in-law\u2019s unconventional approach to diplomacy and inexperience in government, rather than of anything nefarious he has done. People close to Mr. Kushner, who had lunch with Mr. Priebus on Friday and who projected an air of calm, were adamant that he was preparing for a long fight and not an exit from the White House.The reports about Mr. Kushner dominated an end-of-trip briefing for reporters in Taormina, Italy, where Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the president\u2019s national security adviser, and Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, declined to comment specifically on Mr. Kushner but sought to play down the significance of the disclosures.\u201cWe have back-channel communications with any number of countries,\u201d General McMaster said. \u201cSo, generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner. It doesn\u2019t predispose you to any kind of content in that conversation.\u201dHe did not say whether he was comfortable with the idea of a private citizen, as Mr. Kushner was at the time, opening such a back channel.Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers were working to create a crisis-control communications operation within the White House to separate the Russia investigations and related scandals from the administration\u2019s day-to-day themes and the work of governing, according to several people familiar with their plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to divulge the details of a still-evolving strategy.The goal, these people said, is to give Mr. Trump more outlets for communicating his message in an unvarnished way, while curbing opportunities for aides to be confronted publicly with damaging developments or unflattering story lines.White House aides were trying to assemble a powerhouse outside legal team that they hoped would include seasoned Washington lawyers of the stature of Paul D. Clement, Theodore Olson or Brendan Sullivan, and they planned to introduce some of them to Mr. Trump as soon as this weekend. More lawyers could also be hired onto the White House staff to help Mr. McGahn.The approach is modeled on the war room used by President Bill Clinton during various inquiries, including one that led to his impeachment for lying under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Clinton retained a private legal team and established a separate office to handle questions about investigations, so that the White House could preserve the image of governing and keep its primary focus on the president\u2019s broader message.Aides are talking about bringing Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, and David Bossie, his former deputy campaign manager, onto the White House staff to manage the war room.Under the evolving scenario, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, would take a diminished public role, with daily on-camera briefings replaced by more limited interactions with journalists, while Mr. Trump would seize more opportunities to communicate directly with his core supporters through campaign rallies, social media appearances such as Facebook Live videos, and interviews with friendly news organizations.The president, who has more than 30 million followers on Twitter, has been told by his lawyers to limit his posts. Each one, they argue privately, could be used as evidence in a legal case against him, and the president went through his entire overseas trip without posting a single incendiary message.Among those most adamant about limiting Mr. Trump\u2019s access to the news media was Mr. Kushner, who has been critical internally of the White House press operation and has sought to marginalize Mr. Spicer, whom he views as too undisciplined to control the president\u2019s message. Mr. Kushner has also favored creating a rapid-response team to counter reports like the ones that emerged on Friday.In a move that many in the West Wing viewed as emblematic of his attempt to wrest control of communications from Mr. Spicer and Mr. Priebus, Mr. Kushner displaced an operations official from the office across the hall from his own and installed his spokesman, Josh Raffel, in his place, according to two people familiar with the matter.Republican strategists said it was vital for Mr. Trump to focus on advancing a legislative agenda to show voters that the administration could deliver policy changes and allay lawmakers\u2019 simmering fears that the president\u2019s troubles could damage their re-election chances.\u201cWhat they need to do is crank up the legislative side of things and say, O.K., that\u2019s going on, and Trump\u2019s going to be Trump, but meanwhile, they\u2019re actually working to get some kind of health care plan through the Senate, some kind of tax reform, and do what they promised they would,\u201d said Rich Galen, a top adviser to Newt Gingrich when he was the House speaker during Mr. Clinton\u2019s tenure.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s push to revamp health care has faltered in Congress, and the White House has yet to present a detailed plan for his promised tax cuts.Joel Johnson, who was a top adviser to Mr. Clinton, said the traditional options available to a besieged president returning from overseas would be delivering a major speech, shaking up his staff and getting out on the road. But he said it was unclear whether Mr. Trump could do any of those things effectively enough to recapture control of his narrative.\u201cYou\u2019re always looking for a reset button and how do we change the conversation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be running the program down there right now. I don\u2019t know where they go.\u201dMaggie Haberman reported from New York, and Glenn Thrush and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington.

The Mississippi Department of Public Safety said in a statement that he would be charged with one count of capital murder and seven counts of first-degree murder.\u201cMy pain wasn\u2019t designed for him,\u201d Mr. Godbolt said of the officer who was killed. \u201cHe was just there.\u201dAt the first location, which the police were called to at 11:30 p.m. Saturday, the authorities found three female victims and the police officer, the authorities said. Two male victims were found at a location in Brookhaven, and a man and a woman were found at another location in Brookhaven, they said.The authorities identified the slain officer as William Durr, 36, of the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The Department of Public Safety said the identities of the other victims would not be publicly released until after their families had been notified. It said a full investigation into the killings was continuing.The videos showed Officer Durr presenting to children with the help of a toucan, a chimpanzee and a boy in a striped T-shirt. In one video, Officer Durr is telling a room of Brookhaven children that they are fireflies.\u201cYou can light up the world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make all those people happy.\u201dCpl.

But by no means was it new to those familiar with interventions by the United States and its Western allies into other conflicts across the Middle East and South Asia.Few have witnessed those conflicts more closely than Rod Nordland, the international correspondent at large and Kabul, Afghanistan, bureau chief for The New York Times, who has worked as a reporter in more than 150 countries and conflict locales including Baghdad, Cairo and Beirut.Back in the mid-1980s the 16-inch guns of the battleship New Jersey bombarded Druze and Syrian gun batteries in Lebanon as America was drawn into that country\u2019s own protracted civil war. In 2001, after Sept. 11, airstrikes helped to break the Taliban\u2019s stranglehold on Afghanistan, allowing the Afghan military, helped by American special forces on the ground, to take city after city and eventually the capital, Kabul. In 2003, nightly bombing raids on Iraq helped to topple Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, allowing United States soldiers and Marines to enter Baghdad just three weeks after the war began.But toppling regimes, taking cities or stopping large-scale insurgent attacks on a city or a military position is one thing. Holding onto cities and countries in the face of insurgent attacks is another, especially when the very airstrikes that prove so effective in the initial phase of the war becomes a liability in the aftermath because they kill civilians as well as combatants.Speaking in the latest episode of The Times\u2019s live interactive video series \u201cI Was There,\u201d Mr. Nordland said that civilian casualties, and the deaths of allies during errant airstrikes, were a huge negative factor.\u201cI think both in Iraq and Afghanistan it\u2019s been the single biggest recruiting tool, death through airstrikes especially, for the Taliban and for Al Qaeda and its allied groups in Iraq,\u201d he said.\u201cAirstrikes have almost never succeeded, especially against irregular forces, or with very limited objectives. I can think of one case where they succeeded, against Milosevic in Serbia, but even that is debatable, the Russians withdrew support.\u201dTaking the recent strike against Syria as an example of their limited effectiveness, he said that 59 Cruise missiles was a \u201chuge amount of ordnance, more than $50 million worth.\u201d Yet the outcome was that it \u201ckilled possibly four people, who may or may not have been civilians.\u201dMr. Nordland took questions from viewers during the Facebook Live interview. He was unable to answer all of them, but here are two of his replies to queries about the broader political and military engagement of the United States in the Middle East and South Asia.Marjorie Rose asked what would happen if there were to be a \u201ctotal withdrawal by the U.S. and allied forces\u201d from the region.He replied: \u201cAfghanistan would become a Taliban state again in a fairly short time, or at the very least the Taliban would reconquer large parts of the country. ISIS would probably roll back Iraqi forces from Mosul and might even threaten Baghdad again, and ISIS would be expanding rather than shrinking in Syria, as it is now. The Damascus regime would be less affected, since the American military role is only oriented against ISIS, and the regime is much more threatened by other opposition rebels than ISIS.\u201dRina Goins asked if the recent Syrian strike \u201cwas military action as such or a publicity stunt.\u201dMr. Nordland replied: \u201cIt could well be a publicity stunt to try to undercut that argument that Trump is in the Russians\u2019 pockets, and the Russians could be posturing when they claimed that they came within minutes of a confrontation with the United States \u2014 after all, we gave them advance warning to minimize that risk.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s clear,\u201d he added, \u201cis that, as a military action, it was pretty ineffective, especially when you consider bang (airport reopened next day) for buck ($59 million worth of cruise missiles).\u201d_____Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chris Cornell, Soundgarden and Audioslave Frontman, Dies at 52", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byChris Cornell, the powerful, dynamic singer whose band Soundgarden was one of the architects of grunge music, died on Wednesday night in Detroit hours after the band had performed there. He was 52.The death was a suicide by hanging, the Wayne County medical examiner\u2019s office said in a statement released on Thursday afternoon. It said a full autopsy had not yet been completed.Mr. Cornell\u2019s representative, Brian Bumbery, said in a statement that the death was \u201csudden and unexpected.\u201dSoundgarden played at the Fox Theater in Detroit on Wednesday night, and had been scheduled to perform in Columbus, Ohio, on Friday at the Rock on the Range festival.Dontae Freeman, a spokesman for the Detroit Police Department, said in an interview that officers went to the MGM Grand hotel and casino around midnight in response to a call about an apparent suicide of a white man, whom he did not identify. Mr. Freeman said the man\u2019s date of birth was July 20, 1964, which is Mr. Cornell\u2019s.He added that the man\u2019s wife had called a family friend to check on the man; the friend forced his way into the man\u2019s room at the casino and found him unresponsive on the bathroom floor with a band around his neck. He was pronounced dead at the scene.Soundgarden\u2019s musical journeys tended toward the knotty and dark, plunging into off-kilter meters and punctuated by Mr. Cornell\u2019s voice, which could quickly shift from a soulful howl to a gritty growl. Onstage, Mr. Cornell was an imposing figure, flinging his long hair as he presided over mosh pits of fans churning to the band\u2019s metal-tinged riffs.Mr. Cornell was one of four prominent frontmen \u2014 along with Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Layne Staley of Alice in Chains \u2014 who brought Seattle\u2019s sound to the national stage in the late 1980s and 1990s. He helped form Soundgarden in Seattle, where he was born, around 1984. Sub Pop, then a fledgling record label, released the group\u2019s first single, \u201cHunted Down,\u201d in 1987, as well as two subsequent EPs. The group\u2019s debut album, \u201cUltramega OK,\u201d which came a year later on the punk label SST, was its last release before it made the leap to a major label.The album \u201cBadmotorfinger,\u201d released in 1991, benefited from a swell of attention that was beginning to surround the Seattle scene, where Soundgarden, along with Nirvana and Pearl Jam, was playing a high-octane, high-angst brand of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.Three of Soundgarden\u2019s studio albums have been certified platinum, including \u201cSuperunknown,\u201d from 1994, which featured the Grammy-winning songs \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d and \u201cSpoonman\u201d as well as \u201cFell on Black Days\u201d and \u201cMy Wave.\u201dAfter disbanding, the group \u2014 which includes the guitarist Kim Thayil, the bassist Ben Shepherd and the drummer Matt Cameron \u2014 reunited in 2010 and has performed regularly since then.Mr. Cornell grew up in Seattle, the youngest of six children, and has said that he spent a lot of time in trouble as a child \u2014 he was kicked out of seventh grade once and eighth grade twice, he told Rolling Stone in a 1994 interview, and said that he struggled with drugs and then loneliness and depression. He dropped out of school at 14 after his parents\u2019 divorce and got a job to help support his mother, he told Spin magazine in 1996.Music became a refuge, and Mr. Cornell started to take it very seriously. He has said he was drawn to the harmonies of the Beatles early on, and started to play drums at 16. His first group was called the Jones Street Band (named after the street he lived on), and Mr. Cornell played the role of the singing drummer. After answering an ad to be a vocalist in another band, he met Mr. Thayil and Hiro Yamamoto, Soundgarden\u2019s original bassist, and the trio quickly wrote a batch of songs.Mr. Cornell released five solo albums during and after his time with Soundgarden, starting with \u201cEuphoria Morning\u201d in 1999. His 2007 album \u201cCarry On\u201d featured an acoustic cover of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d which was the inspiration for a well-received version of the song on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201dHe contributed the song \u201cSeasons\u201d to the soundtrack of \u201cSingles\u201d (1992), Cameron Crowe\u2019s love letter to the Seattle music scene, and made a cameo in the film.In 2001, after Rage Against the Machine\u2019s lead singer, Zack de la Rocha, left the group, Mr. Cornell and members of that band formed Audioslave. The group released three albums before announcing its split in 2007.In November 2016, Mr. Cornell hit the road for the first time with another supergroup, Temple of the Dog, featuring a blend of members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. The band, known for its breakout hit \u201cHunger Strike,\u201d a dramatic duet between Mr. Vedder and Mr. Cornell, had been formed about 25 years earlier as a tribute to Andrew Wood, the lead singer of the Seattle bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone, who died of a heroin overdose in March 1990.A close friend, Eric Esrailian, whose family regularly took vacations with the Cornells, said Mr. Cornell was never the bold persona he seemed onstage. \u201cHe liked to take pictures of our kids at dinner, just talking to each other,\u201d Mr. Esrailian said, adding that \u201cIn 10 years of friendship, I\u2019ve never seen him have more than a Diet Coke.\u201d He said he had seen no mood changes in recent days or weeks. \u201cWe were talking about summer vacation plans in Greece,\u201d he said.Mr. Esrailian told a story about Mr. Cornell\u2019s giving him a guitar for his birthday, signed by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Jimmy Page, and Jimmy Page is a fan of Chris Cornell,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the same guy we\u2019d eat sushi with and he\u2019d make jokes.\u201dWhen Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last month, Mr. Esrailian said he told his friend that he belonged there as well: \u201cHe said, I don\u2019t need that now, because I\u2019ve got so much ahead of me.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misidentified the source of a tweet honoring Chris Cornell.

These flowers have the color of mustard, but, surprisingly, a very mild flavor.A chive blossom is deceptive, too. It certainly looks harmless enough, perched above a bunch of chives. The pale violet sphere-shaped bloom is actually composed of myriad tiny bell-shaped blossoms clustered together. Declustered, the beautiful flowers appear dainty. Nibble on one, and you\u2019ll see it is far stronger-tasting than a chive; it has the sharp bite of raw onion.Herb blossom butter is easy to make: Simply stir an assortment of chopped flowers into softened butter and season with salt, pepper and lemon. Smear the butter on saut\u00e9ed flounder fillets straight out of the pan. Toss a knob of it into freshly cooked egg noodles or steamed zucchini or scrambled eggs. Spread it on sliced bread for garden-party cucumber sandwiches.Of course, there are other beautiful edible flowers to consider, like calendula and nasturtium and borage and marigold, ready to sprinkle, like fairy dust, as a garnish, or to make your herb blossom butter even more colorful.And to Drink ...Dry white wines love any combination of butter, herbs and mild fish. Throw in a little citrus, and all the better. The herb flowers here offer visual appeal, but to the wine, it\u2019s all the same. Your decision is how fancy you want to get. A good Chablis, Meursault or chardonnay equivalent would be a classic match. Just as good would be wines with pronounced herbal tones, like gr\u00fcner veltliners or sauvignon blancs from the Loire Valley. Muscadet, too, would be delicious, particularly a bottle with some richness to it. You could also pull out a dry chenin blanc, like a Savenni\u00e8res, or even a Champagne or similarly constituted sparkling wine. Sherry lovers know that finos and fish are a treat.

{"Headline": "South Sudanese, Seeking to Fit In, Stand Out in Australian Basketball", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "A program meant for fun now has to protect its young players from something it never expected: the interest of American recruiters.Supported byBLACKTOWN, Australia \u2014 The teenage boys rush the ball down the court, knowing that the losing team will face another round of the lung-crushing wind sprints that make their borrowed gym at a police athletic center here even more confining.\u201cBall, ball,\u201d yells Henry Makeny. He\u2019s 16 years old, 6-foot-6, and he\u2019s posting up on his friend, Gum Majak, who is an inch taller.Passes move around the outside, through hand-in-your-face defense, past shouting opponents. Finally, Henry gets the ball. He immediately spins and elevates. He\u2019s over the rim but he doesn\u2019t quite have control, and misses.Like Henry, this club of Sudanese-Australians who call themselves Savannah Pride (as in a pride of lions) has found itself hurtling from casual play to something much more tied to the power centers of big-time basketball.None of this was what Mr. Chagai expected or aimed for. He and a few other South Sudanese refugees started playing for fun after landing here a decade ago, and they started coaching only because it\u2019s what their community needed. Many of the South Sudanese children arrived without fathers. Their new country \u2014 generous, rich and often quite racist \u2014 needed navigating.And so the gym here in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs quickly evolved into what it is today: an enclave unto itself \u2014 narrow, stinky as an adolescent hamper, with a mural of Michael Jordan hanging over the court \u2014 where the sons of Sudan\u2019s horrid war can play hard and find guidance with other boys and men who understand their struggles and potential.\u201cIt kind of brings you together,\u201d said Gorjok Gak, who is also 6-foot-11, like his brother Deng. \u201cYou have something to do, always. We practiced every day and after practice we\u2019d play until like 9 and then go eat and then go home. And then same thing the next day.\u201d\u201cThe relationship with Mayor is really superstrong,\u201d he added. \u201cI look at him, like, as another father for me.\u201dThe challenge for the Pride now is how to preserve that fatherly mission while managing international interest and all the pressures that come with it.Other coaches and teams in Australia already treat the Pride as a feeder, recruiting the best players, sometimes pushing them to prioritize tournaments that conflict with school or Pride training. Mr. Chagai has a hard time keeping up with all the calls and emails from coaches all over the world, and in previous years some players, who were seized upon by dubious American scouts, ended up at schools that were little more than athlete factories. About a dozen of the players have come back to Australia after dropping out of high school or college programs.With Henry Makeny in particular, Mr. Chagai, a volunteer trying to manage a program for nearly 200 boys, is working hard to find a better way. He\u2019s known the Makeny family since they all lived together in a Kenyan refugee camp. Henry has offers from five American high schools, and a couple of weeks ago a college coach showed up for practice here and quickly made him an offer.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure, to contain this, to do the research,\u201d Mr. Chagai said, sipping tea at the Makeny home, which the boy shares with his mother and six other relatives. \u201cThe family, they rely on me.\u201dHenry\u2019s siblings and mother smiled and agreed.Coach Mayor, as Mr. Chagai is known, is partial to dark pants and bright dashiki shirts, and quicker to smile off the court than on. Violence and basketball shaped his life.He left home and his parents at age 7, he said, guided by a cousin who wanted him to get an education. One of thousands of Lost Boys forced to flee as a civil war engulfed South Sudan in the early \u201890s, he trekked first to Ethiopia; then, when war invaded again, he walked for three months to the sprawling Kakuma camp in Kenya.There, as a gangly 9-year-old, he found basketball through an American Baptist church that had set up a court. It became the place where a young Mayor developed discipline and made friends. He lost himself for hours on end in the game.He often shares this experience with boys who are missing practices, ignoring homework or getting into fights. He brings them to a McDonald\u2019s in an ugly strip mall. He orders a chai latte for himself, food for the struggling boy, and then he says: \u201cThe first thing you have to appreciate is that you\u2019re alive.\u201dNever one for sweetening truth, he tells these boys what it was like growing up without parents, and he reminds them that they are fortunate, able to walk around without hearing gunshots, and able to connect and compete with others who understand their experiences.He tells them they must become survivors \u2014 on the court and off.\u201cSport will always be the best thing in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s brought me brothers. It\u2019s brought me fathers.\u201dThe Blacktown local government area, where Mr. Chagai has lived since arriving, is a striving, diverse western Sydney region of 340,000 people with a large Aboriginal population (the source of its striking name) and where 38 percent of the population is foreign born. It\u2019s a multicultural but tribal stretch of strip malls and boxy housing where immigrant groups stick with their own or occasionally clash, and Mr. Chagai craved some kind of structure and connection when he arrived.He turned to basketball just a few weeks in, having found a half-dozen other South Sudanese refugees who were familiar with the game from their own refugee camp experiences. The group included one of Henry Makeny\u2019s older brothers. Together they made their way to the Blacktown Police Citizens Youth Club, or P.C.Y.C., because it was nearby and cheap: just two dollars to enter.After a while, they sought out more-serious competition. Acuoth Achol, another one of the original players and now Mr. Chagai\u2019s main assistant coach, said the first team they joined had consisted entirely of Filipinos, who would let only one Sudanese player on the court at a time.\u201cWe all had to take turns substituting,\u201d he said, adding that the teammates seemed to be threatened by the competition.Pickup games around Sydney weren\u2019t much better. \u201cThey\u2019d tell us \u2018Hey, no dunking,\u2019 or \u2018You can\u2019t play because you hang on the rim,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Achol, a 6-foot-8 gentle giant with a soft middle, who coaches in black dress shoes. \u201cTo establish ourselves here was very, very difficult.\u201dMr. Chagai said their first round of coaching happened partly just to expand the circle of players. Boys would come hang out at the gym, wanting to play, but not really knowing how.\u201cThey needed someone to teach them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was us.\u201dTheir first brush with bigger dreams occurred in 2008, when Ater Majok, a muscular 7-footer, was recruited to play at the University of Connecticut. At the time, they were coaching with an American named Edward Smith, who worked with the best players and made connections with coaches in the United States. He helped funnel several prospects, including Thon Maker, to schools there and in Canada.But after an initial burst of pride and excitement, Mr. Chagai and Mr. Achol began to worry that the recruitment process was getting out of hand.Coaches and scouts started swooping in for the annual South Sudanese-Australian basketball tournament in July, featuring teams from all over the country. Promises of professional futures were made. Children were moved to the United States, away from their tight-knit families, with little support. Disappointment followed.The New York Times is rolling out expanded coverage of Australia and the region. Here\u2019s how to see our work and connect with our team.\u201cThe problem \u2014 with especially the South Sudanese kids who come from sometimes broken families \u2014 is these middlemen have at times put them in a situation that wasn\u2019t the best situation for kids.\u201dThe Pride cut ties with Mr. Smith a few years ago. He now coaches at a high school in Canada, where calls to his office were not returned.Mr. Chagai prefers not to be accusatory, noting that there were many factors at play. \u201cWe did what we had to do,\u201d he said. \u201cOur main role, it\u2019s not about building a superstar. It\u2019s about building human beings.\u201dDeng Gak returned to the Blacktown P.C.Y.C. a few months ago. In between shooting around and joking, he said he gave the players a message that seemed steeped in both good basketball and South Sudanese identity: \u201cDon\u2019t stop trying. Listen to coach.\u201dRespect for one\u2019s more experienced elders is deeply ingrained in South Sudanese culture, and the Pride\u2019s success as a development program comes at least partly from generational apprenticeship. In addition to the Gak brothers, who will return again soon for another round of guidance, Luol Deng has also agreed to host a three-day camp for South Sudanese players in Melbourne in July. And many of the coaches and other volunteers \u2014 who drive players to tournaments, who help pay for uniforms \u2014 are older brothers who played.These days, they are the ones encouraging siblings and cousins as young as 10 to make the Pride a priority, while sharing with them how basketball has helped them in ways having nothing to do with sports.Like the Gak brothers, they also talk about coaches visiting them at home, checking homework, hosting barbecues for poorer families and pushing them to never give up.\u201cIf we can train hard here,\u201d said Christopher Abujohn, an alumnus with a younger brother just getting started with the Pride, \u201cwe can learn how to work hard and train ourselves for life.\u201dThe older boys, like Henry and Gum, seem to be adopting the philosophy wholeheartedly. At practices, Henry in particular already behaves like a leader, running harder than anyone else, clapping as less talented players run drills.His older sister, Adol Makeny, 34, a lab technician at a hospital, said he\u2019s always been mature, \u201ca big person in a small body\u201d \u2014 though now his body seems to have caught up.And so have his dreams. His eyes light up like flares when he talks about the Gak brothers.\u201cThey were pretty much where we are now,\u201d he told me one day after practice. \u201cAnd now we can watch them on TV.\u201dStill, as mature, tall and talented as he is, Henry is young: He still eats too much junk food and struggles talking to girls. He\u2019s the baby in a family of eight brothers and sisters who were raised partly in the African bush, and who told me they also frequently face racism in Australia: A neighbor is trying to get them evicted from their rented townhouse because of all the people coming and going. When Henry takes the train home after practice, he and the other players are regularly stopped and questioned by the police.The New York Times is expanding its coverage of Australia and the region and we\u2019re inviting subscribers to help us shape the project with questions and discussion.While many of their parents clearly appreciate the chance to live in Australia, flaws and all, the boys tend to express a more complicated mix of emotions. Some have made more Australian friends than others. All are frustrated by stereotypes about their community that focus only on crime, and many of them wonder if they can ever be considered fully Australian even though they are citizens, with Australian passports. For many, this is the only country they know.When I asked Henry for an example of what he would tell his American teammates about his background, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell them I come from Australia but I\u2019m South Sudanese.\u201dGiven the ever-present mix of both pressure and excitement (Henry dreams only of playing in the N.B.A.), it\u2019s no wonder he is in such a hurry.His relatives, along with Mr. Chagai, are all nonetheless trying to help make sure Henry does not go too far too fast and get ahead of himself.His mother, Elizabeth Mayen, 50, is constantly reminding him to do his homework in case basketball doesn\u2019t work out. \u201cLike every mom or dad, you want your child to have a good future, a good life,\u201d she said.Mr. Chagai is also struggling with how to keep Henry from overscheduling; in April there was a junior tournament in the United States that one of Henry\u2019s coaches from another team wanted him to attend, even though Mr. Chagai feared it would take too much time out of school.After much discussion, he ended up not going.There are three other players with Savannah Pride who are also attracting serious scouts, including Gum, Henry\u2019s toughest competitor in the program.There are younger players just a step behind as well.But Henry has far more interest flowing his way, which means Mr. Chagai is often on the phone or emailing with coaches he trusts \u2014 like Coach Mantegna at Blair Academy \u2014 asking about different schools he\u2019s never heard of. Programs in Nevada, California, Texas, New Jersey and Florida have all begun to pester Mr. Chagai with pitches for Henry and just general inquiries.The New York Times is expanding its coverage of Australia, New Zealand and the region \u2013 and we want to hear from you.He\u2019s more worried than usual about both time and finances. Last year, after getting married, Mr. Chagai tried to quit the Pride entirely and pass it on to someone else. His relatives in South Sudan kept asking why he was spending so much time working without pay, but community leaders in Sydney and the families of dozens of players, including Henry\u2019s, started a Facebook campaign to keep him from leaving.He ended up with a compromise: He took a break. He visited South Sudan for three months. He returned to Sydney a few weeks ago.Now, after leaving his job at the local refugee resettlement office to make the trip, he\u2019s trying for the first time to see if there\u2019s a way for him to work with the Pride full-time.An advisory board formed in August by supporters, including members of the state basketball association, is trying to find the money. \u201cWe\u2019re working through it now,\u201d said Mark A. Wright, a former police commander in Blacktown who is among the Pride\u2019s most avid boosters. \u201cThe goal is to future-proof the program.\u201dIn the meantime, Mr. Chagai is relying for help from the community he serves. And the coaching continues.With the main South Sudanese-Australian tournament in July fast approaching, the drills and scrimmages in the P.C.Y.C. gym are becoming more intense. There are about 40 players trying out for 22 slots on two teams for boys aged 16 and younger. Just the other day, a coach from Texas Christian University stopped by to assess the action. He immediately offered Henry a spot on the team.No matter where he plays, Henry Makeny said he\u2019s ready. He\u2019s prepared to play the best basketball of his young life, far away from home.Robbie Harms contributed reporting from Gainesville, Fla.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Notorious Figure in South Korean Scandal Is Extradited", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 One of the most notorious figures in the corruption scandal in South Korea that led to the impeachment and ouster of President Park Geun-hye was extradited home from Denmark on Wednesday.Chung Yoo-ra became a lightning rod for anger over social injustice after revelations that her mother, Choi Soon-sil, used her influence with Ms. Park to promote Ms. Chung\u2019s career and support her luxurious lifestyle.Ms. Chung had been in a detention center in Denmark since January, fighting South Korean prosecutors\u2019 efforts to bring her home to face questioning and possible criminal charges.This week, she gave up that fight and agreed to be extradited.\u201cI have no idea what went on between my mother and the former president,\u201d she told reporters at Incheon International Airport before prosecutors whisked her away. \u201cI guess I am wrongfully accused.\u201dMs. Park\u2019s trial on the same charges began in May.Ms. Chung, 21, has been elusive. South Korean journalists had looked for her across Europe, where she was believed to be training as an equestrian, and South Korea had also asked Interpol to help. In January, the Danish police found her in the northern city of Aalborg.Prosecutors say that the bribes that Ms. Choi and Ms. Park are accused of collecting included $6.2 million from Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate, donated to support Ms. Chung\u2019s equestrian career. She once trained in Germany using a thoroughbred acquired for $830,000.On Wednesday, Ms. Chung said she did not know whether the money came from bribes, adding that she was just one of six equestrians supported by Samsung.But she apologized for a Facebook post in 2014 in which she belittled friends less well off than she was.\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing but your parents to blame for your lack of resources,\u201d Ms. Chung wrote.The post was shared widely in South Korea, where widening economic inequality has fueled increasing public anger. It helped her become a symbol of the children of the well connected, who are often accused of using their parents\u2019 influence to act above the law.Ms. Choi was accused of illegally enrolling her daughter in Ewha Womans University in Seoul in 2015, using her connections with Ms. Park to force the elite school to accept Ms. Chung. An inquiry by the Education Ministry revealed that Ms. Chung had been admitted at the expense of candidates with better credentials.Ms. Chung\u2019s family also used its influence to persuade Ewha to give her good grades even though she barely attended classes, officials at the ministry said.The accusations of illegal enrollment have been particularly inflammatory in South Korea, where students cram for years to prepare for intensely competitive college entrance exams.Ewha revoked Ms. Chung\u2019s enrollment after the scandal broke.On Wednesday, Ms. Chung sounded almost nonchalant.\u201cIt was a natural decision because I never attended any classes,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what my major was.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Galette That Lets Early Strawberries Shine", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byA Good AppetiteThis elegant galette, however, requires a bit more attention. But those few extra steps \u2014 making a two-layer filling of strawberries and pistachios, and using cream cheese to enrich the crust \u2014 add a lot to the finished dessert.Pairing berries and pistachios is an idea I stole from the French, though raspberries are usually the berry of choice. In patisseries across France, you will see pistachio macarons with raspberry buttercream, and pistachio financiers with raspberries inside.I chose strawberries because they are just coming into season. Here, some are cooked down with a little sugar until syrupy, their somewhat elusive flavor condensed into a compote that is baked inside the tart. Use the bruised or ugly berries for this since you won\u2019t see them, anyway. Then save the prettiest ones for the top of the galette, piled there just before serving so they maintain their plumpness.Because getting the most out of all the ingredients was part of my goal, the pistachios are also used in two ways. A sprinkling of the chopped, green-fleshed nuts adorns the crust, along with crunchy raw sugar, giving it texture and visual appeal. More pistachios are ground with butter and eggs into a smooth paste called frangipane, which is traditionally made with almonds.After the dough is rolled out (which, thanks to the cream cheese, is relatively painless to do), the frangipane and the strawberry compote are layered on top. It\u2019s important to keep the two elements from blending together too much so their characters remain distinct. The first thing to hit your tongue should be the fruitiness of strawberries, with the richness and crunch of pistachios following in its juicy wake. Just use a light touch when spreading the syrup from the strawberries over the frangipane, and you should be fine.The moisture in the compote can soften the crust if it sits too long, so bake this the day you serve it. But the components \u2014 the dough, frangipane and compote \u2014 can be prepared up to five days ahead.It does all add up to being a bit more work than your average galette. But this beautiful, complex-tasting pastry is well worth the effort.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "During Ramadan, Home Cooks Shine", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byFor Amanda Saab, the flavors of Ramadan are baked into sweet, tender bites of namoura. Her Lebanese grandmother used to make the cake, folding together frothy, aerated yogurt and semolina flour. Now Ms. Saab makes it the same way, soaking the cake in a floral-scented sugar syrup while it\u2019s still warm from the oven, and cutting it into diamond-shaped pieces.\u201cWhile I\u2019m not consuming food all day, I\u2019m thinking about food,\u201d said Ms. Saab, a social worker who lives near Detroit. \u201cNot about how I\u2019m missing out, but about how to make the best thing to fulfill everyone\u2019s cravings after a long day of fasting.\u201d\u201cWhile my tummy is rumbling, it\u2019s drawing me closer to my faith,\u201d said Ms. Saab, 28.Ms. Ameen\u2019s father immigrated to the United States from Pakistan in the 1960s. She grew up in Chicago, where her family hosts vibrant iftars, one of the names for the evening meal that breaks the day\u2019s fast.An iftar may be as elaborate as the truffle-laden platters on display in the dining room at the Four Seasons Resort in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, or as simple as chicken and rice, passed out free on paper plates at a mosque.For home cooks, who often take turns hosting an iftar or carrying their homemade food to share at community centers and mosques, it\u2019s time to shine.Many will strategize for the days ahead, planning menus and cooking in bulk. Keeping a few labor-intensive dishes ready to warm through can minimize the time spent hungry, in an unreasonably fragrant kitchen, when there are hours to go before the day\u2019s first bite.\u201cBy about 3, you start to hit a wall and you wish you didn\u2019t have to be around food all day,\u201d Ms. Ameen said. \u201cEverything starts to smell so strong.\u201dShe stocks her freezer with homemade samosas to last the month, ready to crisp in hot oil or to pop into the oven in small batches. Ms. Saab fills hers with kibbeh, the bulgur wheat and beef shaped by hand into tiny, plump footballs, and makes big pots of lentil soup.Of course, not everything can be done in advance. Ms. Ameen will also put together light foods she finds ideal for a fasting stomach, like fruit chaat, a tangy, savory fruit salad made from what\u2019s ripe that day and in season, all marinated with cumin, dried mango and chiles.\u201cWe eat a lot of watermelon,\u201d Ms. Ameen said of one of the fruits she uses to make the chaat. \u201cYou\u2019re so dehydrated, it\u2019s a quick way to get liquid into your body.\u201dDahi vada also makes appearances throughout the month, the lentil fritters soaked in a cool sauce of yogurt and a second of sweet-sour tamarind. It\u2019s a dish that her family serves this time of year and no other, and as it\u2019s garnished, the perfume of toasted, crushed cumin rises.\u201cThat smell, to me, is the smell of Ramadan,\u201d Ms. Ameen said.The diversity of Muslims in the United States is reflected in a wide range of foods that will break fasts all month long, from casseroles of macaroni and cheese to es campur, the Indonesian dessert of fruit and jellies, from the Nigerian bean fritters known as akara to asheh, an herb-packed Persian soup.\u201cBut the fast is a reminder that food is a means, not an end goal,\u201d said Faiyaz Jaffer, a research scholar and chaplain at New York University\u2019s Islamic Center. The center will serve iftar to nearly 300 people each evening, with catering from restaurants such as Soul Spot in Brooklyn and Fatima\u2019s Halal Kitchen in Queens.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into practice, of course,\u201d Mr. Jaffer said. \u201cWe save up to eat at expensive restaurants, we think about food and what meal is next, but the idea is that there\u2019s a time for that, but it\u2019s not the end goal of life.\u201dThough not all Muslims choose to fast, fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and many are connected by it each year.\u201cIt\u2019s a test of our willpower, a way to emphasize our spiritual dimension,\u201d Mr. Jaffer said.Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and this year it falls at the tail end of spring and the beginning of summer in the United States. The days stretch out, long and hot.\u201cI will make a big salad every day, and that is not negotiable,\u201d said Ms. Saab, who likes to pace herself with light foods that will hydrate and nourish.For her Lebanese-American family, she prepares juicy variations on fattoush: a range of crunchy vegetables, herbs and leafy greens tossed in a simple lemon-sumac dressing with pieces of warm fried flatbread.It\u2019s work, but Ms. Saab wants to continue these dinners during Ramadan. And she has been moved by people from outside of her faith, eager to fast by her side for a day. \u201cI think it\u2019s so generous that they want to fully embrace and engage,\u201d she said.Skipping food and drink for well over 12 hours can put stress on the body, which immediately struggles against dehydration and hunger.Many people experience throbbing headaches and dizziness, caffeine withdrawal and waves of fatigue. (Ms. Saab, who is expecting a child over the summer, will not fast this year; young children, pregnant women and older adults or the unwell are not expected to do so.)\u201cIt\u2019s a big change to go from three meals a day and snacks to fasting, and all of a sudden that energy isn\u2019t coming in,\u201d said Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, who studies the effects of fasting.\u201cJust like it takes a while for your cardiovascular and muscular systems to adjust to the stress of exercise, the bioenergetic challenge of intermittent fasting is the same,\u201d he said. It can take weeks, or in some cases up to a month, for the body to adapt to more restricted time windows for food.Ms. Adewunmi, 34, cooks for ease when fasting, focusing on carbohydrates and protein, often preparing a single, simple recipe on a loop all month.\u201cOne year, I was obsessed with courgette fritters,\u201d she said, using the British term for zucchini. \u201cAnother crazy Ramadan, it was spinach balls.\u201dShe found the spinach recipe on a halal food blog, an adaptation of the Italian chef Antonio Carluccio\u2019s green dumplings. It was ideal for breaking the fast at home the way she liked, with comforting food she could warm up and eat in small doses throughout the evening.\u201cYou\u2019re so worried about how hungry you\u2019re going to get, you end up eating way too much and it\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cYou learn it every Ramadan.\u201dLast year was Ms. Adewunmi\u2019s first living in New York. Far away from her family and friends during Ramadan, she found herself alone between work and home at sundown. She stopped in a Punjabi-owned bodega in Manhattan and asked the shopkeeper if he had anything with which she could break her fast.\u201cStraight away, a big tray of dates came out,\u201d Ms. Adewunmi said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask me about my Muslim-ness; he didn\u2019t ask for my credentials. During Ramadan, everyone becomes everyone\u2019s sister, everyone\u2019s brother.\u201dMs. Adewunmi doesn\u2019t like dates, truth be told.

{"Headline": "A Late Entry by The Times Into the Fact-Check Biz", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorTHE NEW YORK TIMES likes to proclaim its supremacy over all competitors in all categories. But it\u2019s barely on the scoreboards in the journalistically fashionable realm of \u201cfact-checking.\u201d\u201cIdeally, The Times would have two or three people, but for now it\u2019s me,\u201d said Qiu without exasperation.Most media sites routinely assess the accuracy of political statements in the course of their reporting. Fact-checking teams are different. These researchers select significant political claims and set out to determine their veracity by combing through old news stories, speeches, past interviews, scientific and medical data, expert opinions, anything that could help distill fact from opinion. After that, the statements get rated, from the truthful to the ridiculous.The aim is to choke off misinformation so it doesn\u2019t enter the public discourse with the same force that it might have, and \u2014 ideally anyway \u2014 to act as a prophylactic that scares loose-tongued lawmakers out of making false claims.When they do their job well, fact checkers produce passionless, straightforward assessments, with no evidence of ideological leaning. Though Trump\u2019s improvisational approach to the truth has broken all records, fact checkers have found most politicians will bend the truth if it helps them make a point.There\u2019s little room for sloppiness if you\u2019re calling yourself a \u201cfact checker,\u201d so the system is designed to avoid disasters. After a reporter researches and writes a finding, a team of three editors reviews it and determines the rating, anywhere from a \u201ctrue\u201d to \u201cPants on fire.\u201d No system is infallible, though. Two or three times a year, PolitiFact learns new information that causes it to significantly change its rating. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s a train wreck that I try to block out of my mind,\u201d said Holan.Glenn Kessler, editor of the operation, says there\u2019s a real benefit to having a dedicated team checking the proclamations of the powerful. \u201cIf you do nothing but this, day in and day out, you build a memory bank of expertise with a database to rely on,\u201d he said.That\u2019s part of the problem as The Times begins to turn over its engines. At its current rate of 2.5 posts a week, it would take 19 years to match the size of The Post\u2019s database, and 100 years to catch up to PolitiFact. Records of long-retired politicians may not seem worth much, but they can be an important historical tool \u2014 and a sandbox of fun for political junkies.But culturally, editors were slow to recognize that readers wanted someone to pierce the political rhetoric of the day and dissect the provenance of claims. They wanted blunt assertions of truth or fiction \u2014 and proof as to why \u2014 more than they seemed to want traditional \u201cnews analyses\u201d that sometimes read like a morass of context and nuance.Carolyn Ryan, a masthead editor who has been pushing internally for a fact-checking unit for some time, hired Qiu from PolitiFact as an initial step toward staffing a fuller team. Finding an editor is next, and work is underway to give its fact checks more graphic appeal.\u201cOur readers have shown us that they want real-time fact-checking, and they respond very powerfully to it,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe need to build it out, and make it more prominent on our website and easier to find.\u201dWith the vast resources of The Times, it\u2019s hard to understand its slow entry onto the track, but good for readers that it\u2019s arrived. For all the droll Pinocchio noses and flaming-pants icons, these fact-check operations perform a significant public service, arguably as important to political accountability as any journalistic invention of the past decade. And if truth matters, as Times ads repeatedly proclaim, it\u2019s worth building a team to ensure it.An earlier version of this column misstated the subject of a FactCheck.org video. It was about a presidential debate, not how to spot fake news.Advertisement"}

Jeff Moore, the prop master for the show\u2019s second season, chose standard sweet-cherry bakery pies, latticed and double-crusted, and always had both on set.\u201cThere was a reason why the pie worked, and there was a reason doughnuts worked,\u201d he said. \u201cThose two things represented Twin Peaks, the normal American town.\u201dAs for the original recipe, the owner of the Mar-T, Pat Cokewell, would not reveal it, though she said the pies used sweet cherries flavored with almond and a crust made with vegetable shortening. \u201cOurs was very good,\u201d she said. \u201cI can just say that.\u201dMs. Cokewell sold the restaurant in 1997 to Kyle Twede, who chose not to use the Mar-T recipe.

It can be, with a few modifications. The following recipe is the composite sketch of a divinely good cherry pie.It calls for milk curdled by vinegar for the mock buttermilk crust, but takes liberties with the cherry filling, packing as many sour cherries as possible into a deep-dish pie and amplifying the fruit flavor with a generous splash of cherry liqueur.It is cherry pie in HD.

Mr. Christian, who the authorities said had a history of making extremist statements on social media, was ranting at, and talking disparagingly about, the two women, one of whom was wearing a hijab.One of the women, Destinee Mangum, 16, spoke to a Fox affiliate in Oregon on Saturday.

{"Headline": "French Voters Defy Putin\u2019s Meddling, but You\u2019d Hardly Know It in Russia", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 The official tone from the Kremlin on Monday, the day after the pro-Europe Emmanuel Macron was elected France\u2019s president, was that Russia can work with anybody. But the snow falling on Moscow was perhaps more reflective of the damp chill in the Kremlin\u2019s relations with Europe after yet another fruitless attempt to influence an election abroad.For the last three years, since Europe slapped sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis, the Kremlin has sought to undermine and weaken the Western, trans-Atlantic alliance arrayed against it. Elections in particular have been viewed as a prime moment to try to exploit Western weakness \u2014 and openness \u2014 to help bring to power leaders more sympathetic to Russia.France was the latest potential prize. Moscow backed one losing candidate after another, including an unusual, high-profile endorsement of the pro-Russia, far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whom French voters rejected soundly on Sunday.Never mind that before the vote Russian-state run media profiled Mr. Macron as probably gay, in thrall to Jewish bankers and among the enthusiastic \u201cdemons of globalization.\u201dStill, the nationalist, anti-globalization camp did not lose all hope. \u201cIn France the battle is lost, the war is not,\u201d wrote Alexander Dugin, a central philosopher of the nationalist right who also lectures periodically in France. \u201cTransnational (and transgender) elites defeated the people.\u201dOutside the ranks of Kremlin acolytes, however, political analysts aimed their criticism directly at Mr. Putin\u2019s foreign policy, saying it was time to recognize that Russian attempts to influence elections abroad, including in the United States, were a disaster and damaging Russian interests.\u201cOne more defeat for the Kremlin,\u201d wrote Konstantin von Eggert, a program host and political analyst on the independent Dozhd television channel.Last fall, the Kremlin thought it had found a natural ally in Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a conservative former prime minister chosen as the center-right candidate in the primaries. Long warm toward Russia and Mr. Putin personally, he called for ending the sanctions.When a scandal sank his chances, the Kremlin turned to Ms. Le Pen. She has made no secret of her love for Russia, endorsing its annexation of Crimea. Her National Front had also received an $11 million loan from the now-defunct First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow.Then came accusations from the Macron campaign that Russia had hacked its computers. On the eve of the vote, a huge trove of stolen campaign emails was posted anonymously on the internet. French law prohibited any discussion of them in the final two days of the election, but Russia remains a prime suspect.The leak did not seem to have much effect, landing with something of a thump in France. Even the main hashtag being #MacronLeaks, in English rather than in French, smacked of foreign meddling.Mr. Putin, with his message of traditional family values and national pride, does have some support in Europe, particularly among far-right and populist movements, like the National Front as well as the Five Star Movement in Italy.\u201cIn French terms, the alt-right and the far right overestimated the effect you can achieve through social media,\u201d said Ben Nimmo, who studies disinformation and other online efforts for the Atlantic Council. \u201cI don\u2019t for a moment think that the game is over and I don\u2019t think for a moment that the Russian disinformation campaign has admitted defeat.\u201dAfter the result emerged, much Russian coverage focused on the fact that one-third of the votes went to Ms. Le Pen, and suggested that the election was somehow tainted by many people casting either blank ballots or not voting.Rossiya-24, the main Russian satellite news channel, kept repeating that Ms. Le Pen had achieved a \u201cphenomenal result.\u201d (Her party\u2019s showing was its best ever but still well below the threshold that even her own advisers said they would regard as a success.)\u201cThe victorious defeat of Marine Le Pen,\u201d read one headline on the French service of RT, the international TV service for the Kremlin.Some mocked the French for their choice.While much of Europe remembers the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany on May 8, Russians commemorate it on May 9, and generally believe that they receive insufficient credit.\u201cThe French deserve the \u2018elastic\u2019 Macron; they must go through globalist hell,\u201d wrote Daria Aslamova, a columnist in Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular, pro-Kremlin tabloid. \u201cThey do not deserve democracy paid for by the lives of millions of Soviet soldiers.\u201dGiven the Macron-bashing on Facebook, one music promoter in Siberia joked that Russia had finally found a substitute punching bag for President Barack Obama. \u201cJudging by Facebook \u2014 all Soviet people have with relief and joy received the election of Comrade Macron to the vacant post of our Russian Obama,\u201d he wrote.Elsewhere in the Russian media there was some straightforward analysis of Mr. Macron\u2019s prospects, including his desire to strengthen the European Union and to institute broad economic change.On the opposite end of the spectrum were those who argued that Mr. Putin had not only failed to help elect a candidate sympathetic to Russia but, as in the United States and elsewhere, was effectively turning both politicians and the public against Russia.\u201cMacron was the most anti-Kremlin candidate,\u201d Mr. von Eggert said in an interview.Mr. Macron, like Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, essentially addresses Moscow as a problem rather than a partner, the analyst said, and Moscow\u2019s recent foreign policy initiatives, from campaign meddling to sending its military into Syria, have brought little of positive substance for Russia.\u201cWhen you are talking about pro-Kremlin policy change, we have not seen much,\u201d Mr. von Eggert said.The Macron campaign was so incensed by the tenor of reporting by the Russian outlets Sputnik and RT that it banned them from some campaign events, provoking protests from Moscow.Mr. Macron, in his debate with Ms. Le Pen right before the vote, vowed to take a harder line with Mr. Putin. While acknowledging that Russia had to be at the table to help solve problems like the wars in Ukraine and Syria, he underscored that its values were different.\u201cIn no case will I submit to Mr. Putin\u2019s diktats,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cHe will be a working partner on a number of regional issues, someone I will talk with, but with the awareness that on a lot of issues we don\u2019t have the same values or the same priorities.\u201dOver all, experts said, Russia has been able to obtain a toehold in the influence game because it is addressing angry populations alienated by current governments.\u201cIf our societies continue to stumble because we have a large segment of disaffected voters, Russia might be able to undermine the system that we built,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn many respects the best way to deal with Russia is getting our own house in order.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Lamers could not be reached for comment on Monday or Tuesday.Mr. Vences-Lopez was booked on charges of suspicion of committing fare evasion, giving a false name and obstructing an officer, according to the incident report.In a statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said its officers placed an immigration detainer on May 15 with the Hennepin County Jail on Mr. Vences-Lopez, who is from Mexico, and he was transferred to ICE custody the next day.On May 23, a federal immigration judge issued a deportation order, and Mr. Vences-Lopez will remain in ICE custody pending his removal, the statement said.ICE said it is routinely notified when a foreign national is booked into a county jail.The chief pointed out in his statement that the shift in custody happened three days before the video of the passenger\u2019s exchange with the officer was posted on Facebook.\u201cThere was no reference to his immigration status in the police reports, nor did MTPD notify ICE or any other agency of any immigration-related concerns,\u201d Chief Harrington said.The chief said the department had hoped to explore other options for Mr. Vences-Lopez, such as a diversion program rather than a court appearance.\u201cOur policies and procedures reflect our commitment that our officers will not act as immigration officers,\u201d he said, adding that departmental policies had been updated to \u201cexplicitly state that Metro Transit officers will \u2018ensure equal enforcement of the law and equal service to all persons regardless of their immigration status.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe also are working to re-establish the trust that was broken by this isolated incident,\u201d he added.He said he had hoped that the rider would be placed in a diversion program or have the charges dropped.\u201cI believe we had an officer make a serious mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, I \u2014 and all our council members \u2014 expect more from our training and our department.

Or Maybe Not.", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byMr. Putin\u2019s repeated calls for unity in fighting terrorism \u2014 delivered from the podium of the United Nations, at countless global summit meetings and after every grisly attack around the world \u2014 have often been met with skepticism, interpreted as smoke screens to cloak the violence fomented by the Kremlin in places like Chechnya, Ukraine and Syria.That could signal a major policy shift, political analysts said.\u201cThe Kremlin has been so skillful in getting the president of the United States to cooperate in an unusual way,\u201d said Maxim Trudolyubov, a Russian political analyst and columnist. \u201cIt is a big and completely unexpected coup for the Kremlin.\u201dMr. Putin has long sought such cooperation. In part, he owes his 17 years leading Russia as either president or prime minister to the fact that he defeated a domestic insurgency in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus by branding it as part of the global war on terrorism and flattening the place. Although Al Qaeda was almost certainly active in Chechnya, no one outside Russia paid much attention to Mr. Putin\u2019s warnings about extremism there \u2014 until after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.His antiterrorism campaign is central to his grand overall strategy of restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed in Soviet times.Yet given the whims of Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudolyubov and others said, it is unclear that such cooperation will endure. The unexpected manner in which the information was shared makes it difficult to assess whether it reflects a permanent shift in course.\u201cIt is not something that Russia can rely on, because Trump changes like the weather,\u201d Mr. Trudolyubov said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of victory that you do not really want if you want orderly policy cooperation.\u201dThroughout his campaign, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would work more closely with Russia, and this latest episode could indicate that he is following through.Although Moscow asserted that chasing Islamist militants from the ancient ruins of Palmyra \u2014 twice \u2014 proved that it was defending civilized Western values, Russian firepower has largely been focused against the uprising confronting Mr. Assad.Outside of the Islamic State, a shared definition of who constitutes a terrorist in Syria does not exist, and the Pentagon has been leery about cooperation.\u201cThe problem is that both Russia and the U.S. mean different things when they talk about the fight against terrorism in Syria,\u201d said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg. \u201cThe question is whether they will try to bridge the gap in their understanding.\u201dIn addition, it is taken as a given in Russia that whatever Mr. Trump wants, the real establishment in Washington will put a stop to it if it clashes with its interests. \u201cIt is not a question of whether Trump wants to or not, it is a question of whether Trump can or not,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.Still, disparaging asides about Mr. Trump that had been creeping into official newscasts will most likely vanish.\u201cI would expect the Russians will now stop criticizing Mr. Trump as they have done during the last month or so,\u201d Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, the director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email.Even if the Kremlin has reason to be pleased with the latest episode, Mr. Putin and the Russian government prefer that policy changes happen in an orderly, choreographed manner.If the United States and Russia are to forge genuine new cooperation on terrorism, analysts said, Russia would prefer that it emerge from a meeting between the two presidents, scheduled for July, not via Twitter and confusing, contradictory denials in Washington.In any case, the Oval Office episode was not big news in Russia, where the main headline of the day was Ukraine\u2019s shutting down key Russian social media and information sites, including Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and Yandex, Russia\u2019s version of Google.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, dismissed the reports from the White House. \u201cFor us, this is not a subject,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is the latest nonsense.\u201dFew here accept the idea, at least publicly, that Russia helped Mr. Trump by stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, even if Russia has clearly stated that conducting hybrid information warfare is important to achieving its strategic goals.One of those goals is undermining the Western institutions that oppose it. Whether anyone accepts that idea or not, there is glee in some quarters in Moscow at the confusion in the American capital.\u201cOf course, from Moscow, we look at this chaos with a bit of a smile,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cSo many Americans used to look at the chaos in Russia that way. It is a kind of psychological revenge.\u201dAmerican officials preoccupied with domestic problems will also have less time to meddle in Russian affairs, he added.Most Russians expect that the United States will endure given the strength of its institutions, its economy and its overall resources. Some wonder, however, if the dysfunction at the White House will descend to the level that paralyzed the Kremlin in the worst, last days of the Soviet Union, or even to that of pre-Putin Russia.There were sarcastic remarks regarding the White House in a commentary on Channel One, a state-run television station, during a news program on Sunday.\u201cThe new action-packed series, tentatively titled \u2018Secrets of Trump\u2019s Oval Office,\u2019 becomes more fascinating every day,\u201d said a commentator named Evgeny Baranov. \u201cRussia\u2019s footprint, that is in one way or another present in each new episode, only enhances the intrigues of this bold plotline.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I had hired speedboats before in Capri, zooming around like Tom Ripley on a spree, but I\u2019d never had any luck finding one in La Serenissima.

How hard could it be?All of which made it an alluring slice of lost Venice, a place where history, and maybe even solitude, might endure.\u201cYou want another try?\u201d the instructor asked.This time, when I returned to the dock, the long boat slid unpredictably at every touch of the tiller. Trying to correct, the boat swerved more. The instructor raised his eyebrows. I had failed the test.I felt slightly better when a fisherman from Florida turned up a few minutes later and also flunked. He was left scratching his head as we both stood ruefully on the dock. Having taken boats out all over the gulf, he agreed that mastering the topetta was a lot harder than it looked.Still, my dream was evaporating before my eyes. I hung around the docks mournfully, racking my brain. Then I had a brainstorm: \u201cCan I take lessons?\u201dFor 60 euros ($66) an hour, it turned out, I could get all the lessons I wanted, but I would need to wait three days for one of the pilots to be free. Though I was supposed to fly back to New York that night, I signed up on the spot.\u201cThe Lagoon is where Venice was born,\u201d Mr. Cipriani said, describing how Italians fled Attila the Hun\u2019s hordes in the fifth century and cobbled together a city in the marshes. \u201cNow its revival is the key to Venice\u2019s future.\u201dExotic historical sites are also being saved, most famously a Renaissance-era quarantine complex on Lazzaretto Nuovo. \u201cThe very word \u2018quarantine\u2019 originated here,\u201d said Ugo del Corso, a volunteer who showed me around the fortresslike structure. \u201cIt comes from quaranta, 40, the number of days you had to spend here before entering the city.\u201dBy Monday morning, I was primed for my boating lesson. This time, the experience could not have been more different. I was booked to go with Pietro, the 20-ish son of the owner, and he was relaxed to the point of somnolence. \u201cTake everything slowly,\u201d was his advice as we got into the topetta. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone rush you.\u201d When I eased into the chaos of water-taxis, ferries and barges in the canal, Pietro only shrugged, giving a gentle directive: \u201cGo a little left,\u201d \u201cmore to the right.\u201d Soon we found a quiet canal where I could practice docking and reversing, learning how to glide in neutral toward a gentle stop at the jetty.It was time to enter the Lagoon.As soon as we did, the world opened up, all blue sky and mirror-flat water the color of burnished steel. After days on the ferries, I knew to follow the long strings of wooden briccole, the log pylons that indicate navigable channels. (Fun boating fact: the city has few funds to maintain the briccole, so many have disappeared or float rotten beneath the water line, creating a unique maritime hazard.) The speed-limit signs began to increase: 7 kilometers an hour (4.3 miles an hour) gave way to 11, then 20. I opened up the throttle. This was it! Even though the topetta could manage only 16 k.p.h., I felt like Luke Skywalker taking the controls of an X-wing, slicing through the water, totally free. I was not quite alone, but nearly so: Pietro just leaned casually against the gunwale and kept checking his smartphone, occasionally looking up to make sure I wasn\u2019t heading off into the Adriatic.I docked at Cimitero, the ancient island cemetery, to prowl the mausoleums; circumnavigated Sant\u2019Erasmo; then called in at San Francesco del Deserto, a monastery still inhabited by monks. But as liberating as the boat was, I was very glad Pietro was along. I still couldn\u2019t really tell the islands apart, so the chances of my finding my way alone seemed remote. And the Venetian navigational rules seemed fluid, to say the least. I couldn\u2019t read half the boating signs, which were weathered or missing. When boats came speeding at me in several directions, I had no idea who had the right of way. It felt as if almost anything could happen. On one occasion, the outboard went into paralysis. Pietro stepped to the stern and put the engine in rapid reverse. Seaweed had wrapped itself around the propeller.\u201cHow did it go?\u201d one pilot asked Pietro when I made it back to Brussa.\u201cPerfetto,\u201d Pietro said.Suddenly everyone was my best friend. Even the instructor who had failed me broke into a sunny, tobacco-stained smile.\u201cSo can I take the boat out by myself now?\u201d I asked.\u201cPerch\u00e9 no?\u201d Why not?This was all I really needed to hear. I walked into a nearby bar, stood at the counter and pondered delaying my flight back to New York. But the Venetians had been right all along: It would take quite a few more lessons before I would feel comfortable about heading out solo. Which is maybe as it should be. Venice still has some secrets it won\u2019t easily yield.The historical center of Venice divides the Lagoon more or less in half. The northern side is what most travelers see when they transfer from the airport by water, or when they take tours to Murano, the glassblowing island, and Burano, famous for its brightly colored fishermen\u2019s houses. Ferries to the other northern islands (Mazzorbo, Sant\u2019Erasmo, Torcello, Cimitiero, San Fransesco del Deserto) leave from the stations at Fondamenta Nuove. Make sure to check the timetables carefully, some run only on weekends; on weekdays, Mazzorbo can be reached via a short bridge from Burano, which has regular service) Visits to Lazzaretto Nuovo, also in the north, are on weekends or by appointment (lazzarettonuovo.com/visit-the-island).Tony Perrottet is the author of five books on history and travel, most recently \u201cThe Sinner\u2019s Grand Tour.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To my knowledge, the 43rd president has never admitted his grave mistake, which cost the lives of thousands and produced much of the global instability we find ourselves in today. It\u2019s not that historians have treated Bush poorly, as Alter intimates; rather, it is Bush who has treated history recklessly.\u2666To the Editor:Jonathan Alter speaks of George W. Bush\u2019s quest for penance in his paintings of wounded soldiers who served in Iraq. Does the former president plan another, larger book of portraits of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis whose lives were ruined by his reckless war?\u2666To the Editor:In regard to Khalil Gibran Muhammad\u2019s fine review of \u201cLocking Up Our Own\u201d and \u201cA Colony in a Nation\u201d (April 16), a brief addendum. While in cities like Washington, D.C., African- American citizens and officials were willing to imprison lawbreakers from the late 1970s onward, as the Yale Law School professor James Forman Jr. reports in \u201cLocking Up Our Own,\u201d these decisions paralleled an expanding attitudinal class fissure in black society. As reported in a 2007 Pew Research Center poll, 61 percent of African-Americans held the belief that \u201cthe values of poor and middle-class blacks have grown more dissimilar over the past decade.\u201dSo from this period onward, African-American society has been fortunate, one might say, that this apparent class cleavage has not been worse. As the Pew poll put it: \u201cEven though many blacks believe there is a growing values divide within the black community, most blacks still see at least some measure of solidarity in values shared by blacks. A majority (65 percent) says middle-class blacks and poor blacks share at least some values in common, with nearly a quarter (23 percent) saying they share a lot in common.\u201dThe writer, a professor of government emeritus at Harvard, is the author of \u201cTransformation of the African American Intelligentsia, 1880-2012.\u201d\u2666To the Editor:The writer is a professor of English emerita at the University of Pennsylvania.\u2666To the Editor:How does John Waters (By the Book, April 23) not have a column in the Book Review?

However, the word \u201cskepticism\u201d was conspicuous by its absence; it was not once quoted from the text of the book, although I suspect it appears there.Without some degree of skepticism there can be great danger in how we receive knowledge. Harari says: \u201cHumans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups.\u201d \u201cGroupthink,\u201d he calls it. It\u2019s well understood that those who speak loudest (advertisers and propagandists) will have great influence over our beliefs. Isn\u2019t that a profound reason to promote skepticism?My skeptical antenna pulsed when Harari wrote: \u201cNo individual knows everything it takes to build a cathedral, an atom bomb or an aircraft.\u201d I seem to recall that many people have built and flown their own aircraft.Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

{"Headline": "Packaging Food With Food to Reduce Waste", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byFor the environmentally conscious eater, they are among the most inconvenient truths: Too much food goes to waste. Too much packaging comes with the food. And too much of the packaging is made to last for ages.Now there may be a single answer to all three problems: using excess food to make the packaging.A growing number of entrepreneurs and researchers are working to turn foods like mushrooms, kelp, milk and tomato peels into edible \u2014 if not always palatable \u2014 replacements for plastics, coatings and other packaging materials.The United States Department of Agriculture, for instance, is giving new meaning to the notion of pizza with extra cheese: A team at its research laboratory in Wyndmoor, Pa., has developed a material from milk protein that can be used to line pizza boxes, encase cheese or create, say, soluble soup packets that can simply be dropped in hot water.The product could even serve as a substitute for the sugar used to coat cereal flakes to prevent them from going soggy too fast, said Peggy Tomasula, a research leader at the laboratory \u2014 although she also noted that at this point, it may be uneconomical for some applications.The project grew out of the Agriculture Department\u2019s search for ways to put some of its stockpiles of milk powder to use; fluid milk consumption has steadily declined for years, but federal subsidies for the dairy industry have kept production humming.\u201cWe were going to great expense to make maple syrup and even somewhat more expense to get organic certification \u2014 and then shipping it in all this plastic,\u201d said Tom Ward, a former executive director of the center, referring to the containers and foam pellets it used to ship orders. \u201cThat just seemed nonsensical.\u201dSo for the past two years, the group has sent its syrup out in glass bottles cradled in a molded material made from mushrooms. \u201cYou can literally break it up and put it in a compost pile, then scatter it around your rose bushes,\u201d Mr. Ward said. \u201cI think what we\u2019re doing is a microcosm of what\u2019s coming in terms of products that are sustainable from start to finish.\u201dThe Ecovative product is made using the mycelium fungus that forms the roots of mushrooms as they grow in environments like piles of dead leaves or compost. Ecovative grows the fungus in a variety of substances, which lead to materials of different strengths, flexibility and durability.\u201cYou could eat it,\u201d Mr. Bayer said, \u201calthough we don\u2019t encourage that,\u201dOver the past several years, governments have quietly bankrolled efforts to develop packaging from food. The European Union, which underwrote a project to develop coatings from whey and potato proteins from 2011 to 2015, estimates that the global market for so-called bioplastics is growing by as much as 30 percent each year.Bringing those products to market, however, is a challenge. The Agriculture Department, for example, tried to build interest in a milk-protein-based product more than a decade ago but found no takers, Dr. Tomasula said. Cost and the fact that it was susceptible to moisture made it a hard sell.\u201cEdible films were just getting started then, and there were a lot of people playing around with them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut food waste and food security weren\u2019t big issues then, and nobody really seemed to notice them.\u201dBut he sees hurdles. \u201cEven though these products are important,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil someone steps up and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to use it on a big scale,\u2019 they\u2019re just science looking for an application.\u201dBig companies like PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9 are more interested today than they were years ago, goaded by consumers who are increasingly aware that the food they eat and its packaging can damage the environment.The companies remain skeptical, however. \u201cSome of the stuff out there is just gimmicky,\u201d said David Strauss, the head of packaging in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s United States operations. \u201cThey sound nice but will never be cost-competitive or, in a final analysis, don\u2019t have the impact on waste or the environment that the people making them promise.\u201dThen there is the issue of food security: Nestl\u00e9 says it wouldn\u2019t want its demand for packaging to reduce the food supply, given widespread hunger. \u201cIt\u2019s no good to package our products in a packaging that could instead have been used to feed people,\u201d Mr. Strauss said.Few, however, are begging to eat the peels left after tomatoes are processed. A group of researchers in Italy has used them to develop a lining for cans.Originally underwritten by the European Union, the project is being advanced by a group that includes a large Italian family-owned farming business, a major Italian food processor and a manufacturer of industrial coatings. The group is building a pilot plant in Mantua, Italy, to make the coating.\u201cWe put it in different layers, like an insect\u2019s wing, and demonstrated that you can make sheets that look something like Saran Wrap and are much stronger,\u201d said Robert Cunningham, the director of platform development at the Wyss Institute.Dr. Cunningham said Shrilk could be used to make egg cartons or a wrap for lettuces. He said that a number of large packaging companies had expressed interest in the product, but that it is not yet cost-competitive. \u201cThe next step has to be industry stepping in and changing the economics,\u201d he said.A juice bar, for instance, could create a container with each order. \u201cIt\u2019s something like an espresso machine that you put on the shelf and make a container from Ohoo while a customer waits,\u201d said Rodrigo Garcia Gonz\u00e1lez, a founder of Skipping Rocks.The company has talked with many of the world\u2019s largest beverage companies, Mr. Garcia Gonz\u00e1lez said, but none have yet embraced Ohoo.\u201cThose conversations are moving quite slowly because this is a product that challenges the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are people who are making quite a lot of money from the status quo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "2017 College Access Index Methodology", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWe examined colleges with a five-year graduation rate of at least 75 percent. Roughly 170 colleges nationwide met this standard. For these colleges, we collected three main kinds of data to produce the ranking.The first is the share of entering freshman who receive Pell Grants, the large federal financial-aid program. It typically helps students coming from the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution (and most Pell recipients are in the bottom 40 percent).We then multiplied the share of Pell students by the graduation rate for Pell recipients. The resulting number captures the share of a college\u2019s entering class that is low-income and can be expected to graduate. The number led to one half of a college\u2019s index number.The other half came from the average price \u2014 tuition, fees, room and board, net of financial aid \u2014 that the college charged students from families with annual income between $30,000 and $75,000.Together, the index measures how many lower-income students graduate from a college and how much they must pay to attend it.These statistics remain the only apples-to-apples statistics that most colleges have been willing to release (because the federal government mandates it). If colleges released more detailed statistics \u2014 such as an annual breakdown of their student body into comparable income buckets, rather than based only on the Pell cutoff \u2014 we would use them in our analysis. (More detailed statistics do exist, but they are at least five years old.)One other point: Officials at some public colleges with declining Pell shares argued that the main reason was the improvement in the economy over the past few years, which they say had made fewer students eligible. But after talking with economists and looking at the data, I\u2019m skeptical of that explanation.For one thing, incomes haven\u2019t risen that much in the past few years. For another, the Pell shares at private colleges have held steady on average. The economic improvement may well have played a small role in the declining Pell shares at some public colleges, but other factors, such as declining state support, have played a bigger role, as my column explains.Below, we offer more details on the calculations.The Department of Education publishes data for each college on the share of first-year, full-time students receiving Pell Grants, with the most recent year available typically being 2014-15. We requested 2015-16 data from each college in the index, and most provided it.For those that did, the 2014-15 share accounted for 40 percent of their raw Pell score; 2013-14 accounted for 30 percent; 2012-13 accounted for 20 percent; and 2011-12 accounted for 10 percent. For those colleges that did not provide the 2014-15 number, we used the previous three years, with the same 3-2-1 weighting.The goal is to make the most recent year count most heavily but to avoid allowing any single data point to dominate.We asked each college in our index to provide us with graduation rates for the first-time full-time cohort that entered in the fall of 2009 \u2014 the six-year graduation rate for both Pell students and all students. Most but not all colleges provided the data. The Pell and overall graduation were strikingly similar on the whole, which is good news. Lower-income students who enroll at most top colleges graduate at almost the same rate as upper-income students.For colleges that provided the Pell graduation rate, we multiplied the six-year rate times its Pell share to arrive at an adjusted Pell score. For example, a college with 15 percent of freshmen receiving Pell grants and a Pell graduation rate of 80 percent would receive a Pell score of 12 percent \u2014 signifying that 12 percent of first-year students were both Pell recipients and likely to graduate.For colleges that did not provide a Pell graduation rate, we used overall graduation rate, deflated to adjust for the difference between overall and Pell graduation rates. We used the 25th percentile of the Pell/overall ratio, in an effort to ensure that colleges would not benefit by declining to provide their Pell graduation rate.Yet the net price nonetheless captures the differences between colleges that offer nearly full scholarships to lower-income students and those that charge such students tens of thousands of dollars a year.We used the same weighting for the past four years of data as we did for Pell Grants, with the most recent year counting most.We then took an average of the net price for students from two groups: families with annual income between $30,000 and $48,000, and those with income between $48,001 and $75,000. (Federal rules set the cutoffs for these groups.)An index value of 1 is average. A value higher than 1 suggests a greater commitment to economic diversity.Advertisement"}

Flat sandals, embellished with pearls or gilded in gold, are fancy enough for black tie without endangering the well-being of your soles.Founded by the longtime friends and collaborators Ryan Holliday-Stevens and Laura Taylor in 2013, Solace London has won over celebrities like Bella Hadid and Chrissy Teigen as well as retail bigwigs like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue. One glance at the fashion-forward shapes and details (think: asymmetrical hemlines and oversize ruffles) and it\u2019s not hard to see why. And for all of the fancy endorsements, the prices are a good deal below luxury.Minaudieres are fine, but after years as the go-to occasion bag, they can seem a little ho-hum. Satin pouches feel fresh for evening and have the added benefit of being extra-light to carry, and easy to pack for destination events.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Work for Audible, Live Rent-Free?", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported by360 ViewWould you live in Newark if your boss paid your rent for a year?Of about 1,000 employees in the company\u2019s Newark and Jersey City offices, 64 applied. In March, the company, which has 16 global locations, expanded the offer, pledging a $250 monthly rent stipend for a year to any employee who lives in, or moves to, Newark. More than two dozen employees have taken advantage of that offer.Audible is among a handful of companies around the country offering housing assistance to its workers, although such benefits tend to happen in areas where the cost of living is extraordinarily high, which is not the case for Newark.But how do you draw workers to a place without much of a draw?Only about 70 Audible employees working in the headquarters live in Newark, and that number includes those who took the company up on its housing offer. About a quarter of the company\u2019s New Jersey-based employees live in New York City and Jersey City and the rest commute from elsewhere in the tristate area, coming from as far away as Connecticut.Many Audible workers suffer through long commutes not because they can\u2019t afford to live near where they work, but because they don\u2019t want to. So for Audible, the incentive isn\u2019t really about money; it\u2019s about Newark. \u201cClearly what they\u2019re trying to do is to get people to give Newark a try,\u201d Mr. Lubell said.Audible\u2019s founder and chief executive, Donald R. Katz, has been something of a cheerleader for the struggling city, ever since he moved the headquarters to Newark from Wayne, N.J., a decade ago.As exciting as it may be to discover a new area, leaving New York for a city that has only recently begun to climb out of decades of neglect is a big change, even if the boss is footing most of the bill for the first year.\u201cIt was definitely a period of adjustment,\u201d said Deanna Paquette, 29, a senior designer at Audible and a recipient of the $2,000-a-month rent reduction. Ms. Paquette moved in April to a $2,450-a-month one-bedroom apartment that was twice the size of the studio she had been renting in South Williamsburg for around $3,000 a month. \u201cI knew I needed to leave Brooklyn for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was such a big jump.\u201dFor Ms. Paquette, the biggest hit has been to her social life. \u201cIf you step out at 9 p.m. on a Saturday, there\u2019s not a ton going on the way there was in Brooklyn,\u201d she said. No longer can she text her friends and immediately meet one somewhere in the neighborhood.The move has had another significant impact on her life \u2014 nearly eliminating her commute. Now, rather than spending two and a half hours a day on subways and PATH trains, she spends about 20 minutes walking to and from the office. Already, Ms. Paquette cooks more at home and has taken on more volunteer opportunities with the company.Audible didn\u2019t decide to help pay the rent because it was concerned workers spent too much time in transit. Yet this unintended consequence may be the one that delivers the biggest impact. Moving a few dozen workers to Newark isn\u2019t going to save the city. But reducing commute time could drastically improve a worker\u2019s quality of life. The hours we spend each day sitting on trains, buses and in our cars contributes to our collective misery. Anyone who has ever had an hourslong commute knows that time spent in transit means less time to do things like go to the gym, hang out with friends or even just pet the cat. Shorten your commute and odds are you\u2019ll be happier and healthier.When Amy Garas, 36, the executive assistant to Audible\u2019s chief financial officer, entered the housing lottery, she was thinking about the two hours she spent in her car each day driving back and forth from her apartment in Somerset County, N.J. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t work at Audible, I don\u2019t know if I would have been so eager to move\u201d to Newark, she said. \u201cBut having a really great commute was a huge selling point.\u201dAn article and a picture caption last Sunday about Audible.com\u2019s offer to subsidize rent for employees living in Newark, where the company has its headquarters, misstated the given name of a senior designer at Audible who received a $2,000-a-month rent reduction for one year. She is Deanna Paquette, not Deanne.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Shaming Children So Parents Will Pay the School Lunch Bill", "Date": "2017-04-30", "News": "Supported byOn the first day of seventh grade last fall, Caitlin Dolan lined up for lunch at her school in Canonsburg, Pa. But when the cashier discovered she had an unpaid food bill from last year, the tray of pizza, cucumber slices, an apple and chocolate milk was thrown in the trash.\u201cI was so embarrassed,\u201d said Caitlin, who said other students had stared. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird being denied food in front of everyone. They all talk about you.\u201dCaitlin\u2019s mother, Merinda Durila, said that her daughter qualified for free lunch, but that a paperwork mix-up had created an outstanding balance. Ms. Durila said her child had come home in tears after being humiliated in front of her friends.Holding children publicly accountable for unpaid school lunch bills \u2014 by throwing away their food, providing a less desirable alternative lunch or branding them with markers \u2014 is often referred to as \u201clunch shaming.\u201dHazel Compton, 12, remembers being given a sandwich of white bread with a slice of cheese instead of the hot lunch served to other children at her Albuquerque elementary school. (A school district spokeswoman said the sandwich met federal requirements.)\u201cThey would use the sandwich like a threat,\u201d Hazel recalled. \u201cLike, \u2018If you don\u2019t want it, your parents have to pay.\u2019\u201dOliver Jane, 15, said that when she had meal debt at Shawnee Heights High School in Tecumseh, Kan., she was told to return her tray of hot food and was given a cold sandwich instead.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t eat the lunch, they were just going to throw it away,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems unfair to me to expect a bunch of kids to be responsible for putting money in their lunch accounts when they don\u2019t even handle their own funds.\u201dMarty Stessman, superintendent of the Shawnee Heights Unified School District, said that younger children were allowed to take a limited number of meals despite debt, but that high school students were not.\u201cNotices are sent home automatically when they go below $5, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise,\u201d Dr. Stessman said. \u201cThey should know before they get to the cashier.\u201dThe problem of meal debt is not new, but the issue has received more attention recently because the Department of Agriculture, which oversees school lunch programs, imposed a July 1 deadline for states to establish policies on how to treat children who cannot pay for food.\u201cIt has been a longstanding issue in schools, one that\u2019s gone on for decades,\u201d said Kevin W. Concannon, who was the department\u2019s under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services in the Obama administration.\u201cWe\u2019re not telling schools what to put in their policy, but we do want them to think about the issue,\u201d said Tina Namian, who oversees the school meals policy branch.The department does not prohibit practices that stigmatize children with meal debt, but offers a list of \u201cpreferred alternatives,\u201d such as working out payment plans and allowing children with unpaid balances to eat the regular hot meal.Minnesota and the San Francisco Unified School District, among others, also have adopted anti-shaming policies. Recently, the Houston Independent School District notified its food service department that children with debt should be served the regular hot meal.\u201cThis is fundamentally a right-versus-wrong decision,\u201d said Brian Busby, the chief operating officer for Houston schools. \u201cIf a kid needs a meal, he\u2019s going to eat.\u201dBut feeding hungry children whose families have meal debt does not solve the problem for schools, which still must grapple with paying the bill. In 2016, the School Nutrition Association published a review of almost 1,000 school lunch programs, finding that nearly 75 percent of districts had unpaid meal debt.One solution is the federal free meal program. But not every struggling family meets the income requirements, and those that do may have language barriers or fears over immigration status, or fail to file the paperwork.An Agriculture Department guidance document suggests that districts reach out to the community for help, for example through \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d funding and school fund-raisers. Such efforts around the country have begun to help some districts solve the problem.In 2014, when a theater technician, Kenny Thompson, was mentoring fourth graders in the Houston-area district of Spring Branch, he saw a cafeteria worker refuse to serve a child the hot meal of chicken, potatoes, fruit and milk.\u201cThe lunch lady says: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I told you yesterday you couldn\u2019t have this today. You need to tell your parents to pay their bill.\u2019 And then she turns around and gives him two slices of bread with cold cheese,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.He knew the child\u2019s mother was in the hospital, and he stepped in to pay the bill.Others argue that school meals should be offered free to all children, regardless of income, as is the case in Sweden and Brazil.Some cities, including Boston, Chicago and Detroit, offer free meals to all students under the Community Eligibility Provision, a federal regulation that allows schools and districts in high-poverty areas to do so regardless of individual need. In New York City, a pilot free lunch program is under review. Most schools in the United States, however, do not qualify for the provision, and only about half of those that do take advantage of it.As a result, districts struggling with unpaid lunch bills, which can run into the millions in large urban areas, often resort to shaming tactics to push parents to pay.Crystal Jarek, a retired teacher in Lee County, Fla., said she remembered the staff taking debt notices to class. \u201cThe cafeteria staff would come in at noon, wearing their hairnets, and hand out letters,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the kids would turn around to see who was getting one.\u201dDuring the 2015-16 school year, Lee County began offering free meals for all students at 76 of its schools, including the one where Ms. Jarek taught.Kerry Krepps, a retiree in Kansas City, Mo., has seen the lasting effects of lunch shaming. Her adult son refuses to eat peanut butter because it reminds him of middle school in western Minneapolis, when students with debt were sent to a table to make peanut butter sandwiches.\u201cThe humiliation has persisted for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows how lasting these experiences can be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I\u2019m Not Reviewing Noma Mexico", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAnd I\u2019m going to miss it.As these you-are-not-there dispatches clattered in over the Teletype, I had two thoughts: The first, of course, was, \u201cHoly banana peels, can I pull some strings and get in?\u201d This was quickly followed by, \u201cWhat is the point?\u201dOf course, there are other reasons to write reviews. We restaurant critics do more than fill our mouths and then flash our greasy thumbs up or down. We try to assess the way a place fits into its context, including its environment. Part of this is simply sorting out whether, say, a new Sichuan restaurant in Queens is as good as, better than or different from all the other Sichuan restaurants nearby. We ask whether it\u2019s providing something the location doesn\u2019t already have, and whether it makes sense there. These are separate questions: Queens might not have an overpriced, incompetent Sichuan restaurant, but that doesn\u2019t mean opening one is a good idea.You don\u2019t need to eat at Noma Mexico to know Tulum doesn\u2019t have anything like it. But does it make sense there?Start with the advertised cost \u2014 $600 a person, or $750 after tax and service charges. This is considerably more than Noma charged for its pop-ups in Sydney (around $350 without drinks) and Tokyo (about $380), two cities where it\u2019s not unheard-of to spend that much on a meal.Tulum is not a city; it\u2019s a resort town, formerly a sleepy getaway of tilted palapas and sunrise yoga classes that has been climbing upscale. Largely thanks to the tourist economy, the state of Quintana Roo has the highest employment rate in the country, but the average income is in the bottom third. About half the state\u2019s residents live in moderate to extreme poverty.Before dinner reservations were available, Mr. Redzepi announced that he would also be serving free lunches to Mexican culinary students for the last two weeks of the pop-up. But, clearly, most of the people coming for dinner have paid for not just the meal but for flights to the Yucat\u00e1n, a car rental or taxi to Tulum, and at least one night in a hotel.It is no surprise that a paying audience exists for this tropical getaway. At this point in his career, Mr. Redzepi could sell out a weenie roast in Death Valley. What I find hard to run through my critical algorithms, though, is the idea of a meal devoted to local traditions and ingredients that is being prepared and consumed mostly by people from somewhere else.The Noma philosophy, from the start, was rigorously local. Mr. Redzepi drew a circle around the Nordic region and gathered almost all his ingredients from inside it, with rare exceptions. Noma founded a next-level locavorism that is widely if not always intelligently imitated, and one of its legacies is the notion that restaurants with global ambitions must demonstrate a strong attachment to their location.By all reports, Noma Mexico has sense of place in spades. The path to the jungle dining area is lined with baskets of jackfruit and mangos. The tables slipped in between the palms were made from a local hardwood. Directly in front of the kitchen, four women from a nearby Mayan village make tortillas.But can a restaurant really be of its place if it doesn\u2019t bend and sway to the breezes of local tastes and local demands? I doubt it, and I doubt that my own ecstatic reveries (for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that I would have enjoyed Noma Mexico as much as everybody else) would help on that front. I\u2019d be another tourist, hoping to be knocked out with sensations that would carry over to the flight back to New York.Back home at the keyboard, I\u2019d calculate how many words to spend on sensory pleasures and how many on the $2,000 or so that my employers were on the hook for, whether it was \u201cworth it\u201d and whether the local standard of living was likely to be helped by the attention Noma had brought to Mexican ingredients.Fretting about the ethics of eating a meal costing hundreds of dollars is a particularly awkward form of talking with your mouth full. I know, because I\u2019ve done it before and will do it again, always with a small pit of shame in my gut. The two things can never really be reconciled, without some shady bookkeeping.I don\u2019t blame Mr. Redzepi and the Noma crew for coming up with an event that makes my critical lens fog over. They\u2019ve acknowledged that they owe something to Mexico and tried to pay it back. In Tulum, they\u2019re chasing their curiosity and raising new bars to vault over, which is what creative people should do.That\u2019s the artistic side of Noma Mexico. On the business front, they\u2019ve chosen to pour their creativity into something that, because of its planned scarcity and relative expense, has to be seen as a luxury product. Luxury goods tend to float free of the everyday world and create their own cultural context, one of wealth and exclusivity. There are many ways to respond to that, but in this case, I don\u2019t think a review written by me is one of them. I\u2019d rather review a restaurant that has its roots in the ground.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap\u2019s $2.2 Billion Loss Caps Bumpy First Months as a Public Company", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe results represented a bumpy start for Snap after its much-celebrated initial public offering, the biggest for a technology company in recent years. Snap\u2019s earnings illustrate how difficult it is for smaller social media companies to compete in the age of Facebook, the social network run by Mark Zuckerberg, which has sucked up more than two billion people worldwide and has made the size of its network a primary selling point.Snap\u2019s weak results so soon after its I.P.O. appeared to shock many \u2014 even though it had warned investors that owning Snap stock would not be an easy path to riches. In its I.P.O. filing, Snap had highlighted slowing growth and huge losses that were not expected to end. Snap\u2019s executives had cautioned that results would be \u201clumpy and unpredictable.\u201dEvan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, had said, \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019ve encountered over time is explaining to people why bigger isn\u2019t better.\u201d\u201cThey told us all of this,\u201d Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, said of Snap\u2019s executives. \u201cWith Snap in particular, there\u2019s always been a greater fool element \u2014 a lot of people bought it because they thought someone else would pay more for it. That\u2019s impossible to ignore.\u201dSnap\u2019s $2.2 billion loss for the first quarter, which included a $2 billion expense related to stock compensation, was far above its $104 million loss a year ago. Revenue was $149.6 million, almost four times as much as a year ago, but fell short of Wall Street estimates of $158.6 million.And while Snap said its number of daily users had increased to 166 million in the first quarter, up 36 percent from a year ago, that was down from 53 percent growth in the first quarter of 2016.Snap emphasized on a call with analysts on Wednesday that people were spending more time than ever on Snapchat, more than 30 minutes a day, seeking to convince investors that loyalty to its products matters more than the size of its user base.\u201cWe still have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m excited by the amount of progress we\u2019ve made in such a short time,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said. He added that people were highly engaged with Snapchat, with users creating on average more than three billion snaps, or short pieces of content, every day, up from 2.5 billion the previous quarter.Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said Snap\u2019s argument was that \u201cif users are spending more time in the app, no matter the growth rate, that by itself could attract advertisers.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cat this early stage, growth in both user time spent on the platform and in the number of users are both very important.\u201dWhen asked during the call on Wednesday about whether he was worried about Facebook, Mr. Spiegel said innovative companies needed to \u201cbasically enjoy the fact that people are going to copy your products if you make great stuff.\u201dIn March, Snap said its financial performance would depend more on its \u201cability to elevate user engagement\u201d if the number of users did not grow significantly. The company generates most of its revenue by selling space to advertisers who want to reach a young audience that spends a lot of time looking at images and stories in the app.Snap is also spending handsomely to create products to engage users. It spent $805.8 million on research and development in the first quarter, 28 times higher than a year ago. Marketing costs skyrocketed to $219.7 million, from $14.7 million a year ago.Snapchat still has an ace: Its users are demographically attractive. Many are between 18 and 34, a group that is particularly alluring to advertisers, said Sean Corcoran, executive director for the Americas at MullenLowe Mediahub, a digital advertising firm.\u201cIt\u2019s close to 80 million people, spanning high school to young moms and dads, and they are incredibly hard to reach because their media habits are fragmented,\u201d Mr. Corcoran said. \u201cSnapchat is one of the few places you can get to them in a mass way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Uproar Over \u2018Transracialism\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDr. Tuvel was prompted to write her article by the controversy that erupted when Rachel Dolezal, the former local N.A.A.C.P. official who had long presented herself as black, was revealed to have grown up white. The Dolezal story broke just 10 days after Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Vanity Fair debut, and the two discussions merged. If Ms. Jenner could identify as a woman, could Ms. Dolezal identify as black? If transgender was a legitimate social identity, might transracial be as well? Dr. Tuvel\u2019s article subjected these public debates to philosophical scrutiny.The idea of transracialism had been rejected out of hand by the cultural left. Some worried \u2014 as many cultural conservatives indeed hoped \u2014 that this seemingly absurd idea might undermine the legitimacy of transgender claims. Others argued that if self-identification were to replace ancestry or phenotype as the touchstone of racial identity, this would encourage \u201cracial fraud\u201d and cultural appropriation. Because race has always been first and foremost an externally imposed classification, it is understandable that the idea of people declaring themselves transracial struck many as offensively dismissive of the social realities of race.Dr. Tuvel\u2019s cultural-left credentials are impeccable. Her research links race, feminism and justice for the oppressed (including animals). But she concluded that the strong philosophical arguments in favor of accepting transgender identities should also support the possibility of altering socially defined racial classifications to match people\u2019s inner sense of racial identity.Dr. Tuvel was careful to point out that her \u201cthesis relies in no way upon the claim that race and sex are equivalent, or historically constructed in exactly the same way.\u201d As a philosopher, she was interested in the structure of social reasoning about gender and racial identities, not in the lived experience of black or transgender people. Crucially, she explicitly rejected the idea that self-identification alone should be the ultimate arbiter of racial identity, emphasizing also how one is treated by others.One of the criticisms of Dr. Tuvel was that she failed to engage the full range of literature relevant to her argument. As it happens, that literature now includes a book of my own, though it was published too recently for her to have addressed it in her article. My book analyzes the shifting terrain of race and ethnicity through the multifaceted lens of the transgender experience \u2014 encompassing not just the movement from one category to another but the staking out of positions between and beyond existing categories.But the Tuvel affair raises issues that go beyond the controversial notion of transracialism. First, it invites reflection on what might be called \u201cepistemological insiderism.\u201d This is the belief that identity qualifies or disqualifies one from writing with legitimacy and authority about a particular topic. Few would argue directly that who we are should govern what we study. But subtler forms of epistemological insiderism are at work in the practice of assessing scholarly arguments with central reference to the identity of the author. Does the often-mentioned fact that Dr. Tuvel is white and cisgender (as am I) disqualify her from raising certain questions? Is her identity relevant to assessing her argument for according more weight to an individual\u2019s racial self-identification and less weight to ancestry?Epistemological insiderism not only stakes out certain domains as belonging to persons with certain identities; it also risks boxing persons with those identities into specific domains. It risks conveying the patronizing and offensive expectation that members of racial and ethnic minorities will focus their scholarship on race and ethnicity.Todd Gitlin\u2019s devastating observation about the debilitating consequences of the left\u2019s cultural politics \u2014 \u201cwhile the right has been busy taking the White House, the left has been marching on the English department\u201d \u2014 dates from the \u201990s, but it has lost none of its pertinence. Only now the battle lines are drawn within the cultural left; the English department was conquered long ago. The spectacle of the left devouring its own children \u2014 and of emancipatory liberalism turning into its opposite \u2014 may read as farce. But in the context of the wider political emergency we face, the obsessively inward focus of the cultural left can also be understood as tragedy.Rogers Brubaker is a sociology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author, most recently, of \u201cTrans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His uncle said he had no use for the internet, since he had never learned to read; furthermore, he wanted to nap. This he made clear by periodically screwing up his face into a huge yawn.Mr. Neti, 38, pressed on earnestly, suggesting that he could demonstrate the internet\u2019s potential by Googling the history of the Gond tribe, to which they both belonged. Since acquiring a smartphone, Mr. Neti couldn\u2019t stop Googling things: the gods, Hindu and tribal; the relative merits of the Yadav caste and the Gonds; the real story of how the earth was made.His uncle responded with half-closed eyes, delivering a brief but comprehensive oral history of the Gond kings, with the clear implication that his nephew was a bit of a good-for-nothing. \u201cWhat does it mean, Google?\u201d his uncle said. \u201cIs it a bird?\u201dAnd then, theatrically, he yawned.While India produces some of the world\u2019s best coders and computer engineers, vast multitudes of its people are like Mr. Neti\u2019s neighbors, entering the virtual world with little sense of what lies within it, or how it could be of use to them.The arrival of the internet in their lives is one of India\u2019s most hopeful narratives.In the 70 years since independence, India\u2019s government has done very little to connect Taradand, in Madhya Pradesh State, in central India, to the outside world: The first paved road appeared in 2006. There has never been a single telephone landline. Electricity is available to only half the houses. When Mr. Neti was growing up, if someone in the village needed emergency medical care, farmers tied the patient to a wooden cot and carried him five miles through the forest to the nearest hospital, a journey of four hours.With the cost of both smartphones and data plummeting, it is fair to assume that Taradand\u2019s next technological leap will be onto the internet.Those who work in development tend to speak of this moment as a civilizational breakthrough, of particular significance in a country aching to educate its children. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made expanding internet use a central goal, shifting government services onto digital platforms. When Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, toured India in 2014, he told audiences that for every 10 people who get online, \u201cone person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created.\u201dSo it is instructive to follow Mr. Neti as he tries to drum up a little interest in Taradand. Young men use the internet here, but only young men, and almost exclusively to circulate Bollywood films. Older people view it as a conduit for pornography and other wastes of time.Women are not allowed access even to simple mobile phones, for fear they will engage in illicit relationships; the internet is out of the question. Illiterate people \u2014 almost everyone over 40 \u2014 dismiss the internet as not intended for them.Still, Mr. Neti persists with the zeal of the newly converted.\u201cYou can call me the black sheep. That\u2019s what I am,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the internet age. One day they\u2019ll all come around.\u201dMr. Neti is, in some ways, an unlikely harbinger of technological change. His parents pulled him out of school in fifth grade to marry \u2014 his wife was 10 \u2014 and though he can read and write in Hindi, his school transcript brands him illiterate, foreclosing any opportunity to get a government job.When he bought his first mobile phone, in 2001, he was so nervous he did not make a call for nearly a week. When he finally did, he blurted out: \u201cFriend, I have bought this mobile. Is this your number and your name? I am Babulal!\u201d The next day his phone stopped working and he returned to the shop, telling the salesman that something was wrong with the phone.\u201cI had no idea what to do,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Your balance is over.\u2019\u201dBut this experience in no way prepared Mr. Neti for his first encounter with the smartphone, which he spotted about a decade ago in the hand of a computer operator in Taradand\u2019s local administration building.The official was an agreeable sort, and Mr. Neti began borrowing his phone for two- and three-hour stretches. He went on Google, searching for the word \u201cGondwana,\u201d the name for the Gond tribe\u2019s traditional land.\u201cIt was as if I had opened up history, the history of Gondwana,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed fascinating. You didn\u2019t have to buy a book. The earth map came up as round, and part of it was Gondwana. Ireland, Gondwanaland, Switzerland. I was fascinated. No sooner would I see a mobile than I would run over.\u201dOnly after some time, he recalled, did Mr. Neti realize it was possible to search for terms other than Gondwana.\u201cIt seemed,\u201d he said, \u201cas if I was diving into a sea with no bottom to it.\u201dThis marked the beginning for Mr. Neti of a wide-ranging inquiry about the world surrounding him. He was interested, for example, in knowing whether the residents of other countries worshiped Ram, the Hindu deity and, upon discovering that they did not, hastened to inform his neighbors of this startling news. He decided to fact-check the assertion of a childhood friend, who is from the Yadav caste, that the Yadavs had been present at the creation of the earth and learned this was not a universally accepted view.\u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t personally saying anything about the Yadavs, it was Google saying something negative,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe was very offended.\u201dAt some point, Mr. Neti discovered that he had become skeptical of nearly everything he had been taught. \u201cI tried to find out if the gods created the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out it was not true. But still I cannot answer the question of who created the earth. But I believe Google contains the answer.\u201dMr. Neti finds it maddening that, in a region whose farmers are desperate to educate their children, his neighbors still regard the internet principally as a way to watch movies.\u201cThe villagers do not yet understand,\u201d he said \u201cThey don\u2019t know that the whole world rests inside the mobile. The day people realize that, they will stop going out to study.\u201dIf Mr. Neti\u2019s audience was tougher than usual, there was a reason: A 15-year-old girl from Taradand had just eloped with a 17-year-old boy from a different caste, and everyone was blaming technology. There was no evidence the young couple planned their getaway on the phone, but everyone assumed it.\u201cNinety-nine percent of mobile users misuse them,\u201d said Devender Kumar Patel, 17, whose hair had been coaxed into a four-inch ducktail. \u201cRapes are an outcome of these things. One of my cousins received a call on a mobile phone, was asked to go someplace and was murdered.\u201dThe internet, Mr. Patel felt, is worse: a labyrinth of shallow diversion where many young people in the village would lose their way. \u201cThose who use it badly will go farther down from where they are,\u201d he said.His father, Sriram Karan Patel, 44, nodded darkly.\u201cThey are seeing what they should not be seeing,\u201d he said.This was also the opinion of Mr. Neti\u2019s father, Kuware Singh, who returned from the fields to the family compound naked to his waist. Totally illiterate, he remains wary even of the basic cellphone; he will speak on it only if someone holds it up to his ear. He said he was unsure how he felt about all the time his son spent on the internet.\u201cIt depends,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWill it help him get a job?\u201dMr. Neti does spend a lot of time online. Walking around the village, he stops periodically to take selfies and post them on Facebook, and he scrolls through his feeds compulsively. He likes to describe his smartphone as his \u201cbest friend,\u201d or his \u201cguru.\u201dNone of this makes much sense to his neighbors. A friend from childhood, Markandeya Yadav, said it was difficult for him to keep up with Mr. Neti\u2019s internet discoveries.\u201cI am a simple man,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. \u201cHe has changed, but I have not.\u201dThe worst damage has been to Mr. Neti\u2019s relationship with his wife, Sitabai, who comes from a far more remote village and is completely illiterate. She had taken to scrolling through images on her husband\u2019s phone and, coming across a woman\u2019s photograph, began calling numbers at random. She reached a senior district bureaucrat whose contacts he had programmed into the phone, and Mr. Neti had to beg the official\u2019s forgiveness. After hanging up, he slapped her \u201cfour or five times,\u201d he said.\u201cMy wife\u2019s mentality is such that she lives in yesteryear,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will not tread my path. And if I tread her path, I will be left miles behind.\u201dMr. Neti said he had made little effort to explain the internet to Sitabai.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the mental capability,\u201d he said. \u201cHow would you explain a mobile to a dog?\u201dAt moments of discouragement, Mr. Neti recalls that Taradand has already accepted a new technology. Fifteen years ago, when people began using mobile phones, his neighbors were elated. They were more efficient in everything they did.It was no longer necessary to make long overland journeys to inform relatives of family news. Before going to market, farmers could call around to compare wholesale prices for vegetables. Migrant laborers could find out where the contractors were paying 400 rupees a day, or around $7.50, instead of the usual 150.Even Mr. Neti\u2019s uncle, Siya Ram Singh Gond, shook his head gravely at the thought of how long they had lived without these tools. \u201cSo much time was wasted,\u201d he said.Once in a while, Mr. Neti feels he is close to a similar breakthrough with the internet. An example came recently when his father mentioned visiting a district records office to check the boundary of his land. Mr. Neti used Google for a few minutes and then held up his smartphone in front of his father. His father peered at the property lines that Mr. Neti was showing him, accessible on the district administration website, and approved.\u201cThe boundaries were there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all correct.\u201dWithin hours, he had performed the same service for a dozen other men from neighboring farms.\u201cIt was a very happy moment for me,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cMy father also realized this was no ordinary instrument.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Judge Refuses to Recuse Himself in Shooting by White Officer", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byAn Alabama judge who once complained on Facebook of being racially profiled by the police refused on Thursday to recuse himself in a case involving a white police officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a black man.Defense lawyers had argued that two posts by the judge, Greg Griffin of the Montgomery County Circuit Court, created the appearance of a conflict, one of the lawyers, Roianne Conner, said in a phone interview.But Judge Griffin denied the defense\u2019s motion during a hearing on Thursday morning, Ms. Conner said.\u201cHe took it very personally,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me he could take off his black robe, but he couldn\u2019t take off his black skin.\u201dThursday\u2019s ruling was the latest twist in an emotionally charged case that has resonated deeply in the predominantly black city of Montgomery, a place with a history of distrust between the local authorities and residents.Ms. Conner estimated that six judges had already recused themselves from the closely watched case for various reasons. And her team has asked to move the trial to another county because, it contends, its client has been the victim of \u201cracial prejudice\u201d since his arrest.Neither Judge Griffin nor his court reporter responded Thursday to phone calls and an email seeking comment. A call to the Montgomery County District Attorney\u2019s Office also was not returned.Ms. Conner said the defense was preparing to file documents that would challenge the judge\u2019s decision in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.Thursday\u2019s decision came almost 15 months after the defendant, Officer Aaron Smith, shot Gregory Gunn, a 58-year-old black man.Officials have said that on Feb. 25, 2016, Officer Smith stopped Mr. Gunn, who was walking home after a late night of work and playing cards. It was after 3 a.m., and he believed Mr. Gunn to be suspicious. The two became involved in a struggle, and at some point, officials said, Officer Smith opened fire, fatally striking Mr. Gunn.Lawyers for Officer Smith have criticized the arrest as politically motivated and asserted that his use of deadly force was appropriate.Judge Griffin\u2019s Facebook page appeared to have been deleted as of Thursday evening, but court documents filed by the defense include a photograph of a message he posted in April 2016 \u2014 after Officer Smith was arrested. In the message, the judge describes being briefly detained by the Montgomery police on his morning walk.The officers, he was told, were looking for a man who fit his \u201cdescription\u201d who had been walking with a crowbar.\u201cThroughout the ordeal, the officers were courteous; however, it was aggravating to be detained when the only thing I was guilty of was being a black man walking down the street in his neighborhood with a stick in his hand,\u201d Judge Griffin wrote. \u201cLord Have Mercy!!!!!\u201dIn another post, six days later, Judge Griffin posted a photo of himself shaking hands with the chief of the Montgomery Police Department in court.\u201cWe discussed the incident,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWE ARE OK!!\u201dJudge Griffin was assigned Officer Smith\u2019s case about a year later, after other judges recused themselves, Ms. Conner said.In their motion filed Monday, lawyers for Officer Smith argued that the stop their client made of Mr. Gunn was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the judge\u2019s \u201cown personal incident.\u201d The judge, they said, had \u201cbeen subjected to and spoke out against the same actions that will weigh heavily in the determination of Mr. Smith\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201dThe defense had also raised the issue of race in court documents filed in December, requesting a change of venue. The motion has yet to be argued in court, Ms. Conner said, adding that it could be weeks or months before the trial begins.Advertisement"}

F. Pinkerton for 18 months and I just learned for most of that time you have been involved in an intimate relationship with him also.\u201dEighteen months? Pinkerton (not his real name) was an on-and-off boyfriend I had last dated for two months, during which time he said there was no one else in his life.Whether this made me the Other Woman or the woman who texted me the Other Woman is one for the scholars, in this case Bathsheba Plotkin, who lived in Vilna in the late 19th century and is still revered for her commentaries on disastrous relationships or, as they were then known, marriages.\u201cIf Tevya is delivering milk at 10 at night of course he is messing around,\u201d she famously said. \u201cDon\u2019t be aggravated, darling. You\u2019ll feel better in 100 years when they create psycho-pharmaceuticals.\u201dWhere was I?Oh, yeah, the woman who texted me in the middle of the night about a person we had both been involved with. The subject of our conversation, I must admit, did have that special something that ensures one will never be lonely in this town \u2014 a penis.The woman and I had a long, illuminating conversation. She told me that Pinkerton had remained on OkCupid throughout their relationship, had presented himself as single on Facebook and, after she had spent weeks at his bedside after a health crisis, had made dates with other women.How had she found out? She had waited until this amorous skunk had fallen asleep and examined his cellphone. She\u2019d also found some old texts and photos between him and me. I have to admit that annoyed me a little. If I had known a third party would be viewing them, I would have sucked in my stomach in those swimsuit shots.Still it gave me an idea: If you suspect foul play in your business or personal life, hire a woman whose partner is doing her dirt to get to the bottom of it because no one will bring to it the intensity and single-minded focus she will.These women could start a company: the Crazy Ladies Detective Agency.You want to know about hacking and the presidential election? The Crazy Ladies could tell you in 48 hours. Then they would stride into the Russian Embassy, slap the evidence on the night stand (it\u2019s an old habit) and say: \u201cDon\u2019t insult my intelligence by trying to deny it. Just pack your things and get out of the country. Not the Nespresso machine. The Nespresso is mine.\u201dDedicated? These people will stay up all night, fueled on nothing but a half-dozen diet ice cream bars, chasing down leads: checking Facebook, examining credit cards and E-ZPass receipts, setting up motion-triggered wildlife cameras outside suspect apartments.Oh, excuse me, I\u2019m receiving a message from the beyond from Bathsheba, blessed be her memory:Joycela, darling. Make sure everybody knows you aren\u2019t endorsing stalking, like Schmuel the blacksmith who went so crazy when he saw the dressmaker\u2019s ankle that he hid outside her window at night hoping to see her whole foot. I don\u2019t mind telling you I did not shed a tear when his anvil accidentally fell on his head, the bum. Would you mind spitting for me, sweetheart? It doesn\u2019t work here and I miss it. O.K., let me be very clear: This column does not endorse stalking. Although there is a gray zone, isn\u2019t there?For instance, let\u2019s say there is an old boyfriend who leaves flirtatious messages on your Facebook page long after you have broken up:\u201cYou look just like Marilyn. Yes, that Marilyn.\u201d \u201cLabor Day weekend was when I was down in the Village looking for women just like you.\u201dIt\u2019s understandable that you stroll over to his Facebook page and, noting that he hasn\u2019t posted photos with women, assume he isn\u2019t seeing anyone. Perhaps you then flip through your mental photo stream, pausing at the one of him in your kitchen with a platter of roast duck. It appears to be one of his favorite memories, too, as he is using it on OkCupid. No, of course, it is not cyberstalking to see if an old boyfriend is on OkCupid. It is due diligence.Then say a short time after that Labor Day flirt, you get a friend request from an interesting looking woman with a nice smile. A few days later she puts up a post and you click on her page and what do you find? Photos of her and your ex.You are not necessarily the most astute woman in the world, but it slowly dawns on you: This woman did not send you a friend request because something you wrote made her laugh. She sent it because she\u2019s running a clandestine investigation on the guy she has been dating and the investigation uncovered you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re the Americans searching for Iranian nuclear dumps, and once you\u2019re in country, you find the Israelis are there and two steps ahead of you. Appalling! Can no one be trusted in this town?A counter investigation is called for. Does this woman have a LinkedIn presence? A personal business page? A D.U.I. arrest?She is actually pretty impressive: educated, artistic, successful in her field. It\u2019s too bad that she, as well as the old boyfriend, must now be unfriended. It\u2019s also too bad that when this cad pops up in the flesh, many months later, saying that he is no longer in a relationship, you buy it without once again checking him out and have a brief springtime romp.Six months later, when the woman sends you a distressed middle-of-the-night text and you speak with her, she will prove to be sympathetic and extremely nice. The two of you have a lot in common, including your appalling judgment regarding men. Maybe you should go into business together and start a detective agency.Advertisement"}

During the event, many analysts\u2019 questions about the company were dismissed by Mr. Spiegel. None of the executives made a particularly impassioned case for why the business would be a success over the long term.On Thursday, Jim Cramer, the investor and CNBC host, said Mr. Spiegel needed to be \u201chazed\u201d and put through a \u201cgauntlet\u201d by investors because \u201che is so arrogant.\u201dSnap\u2019s earnings showed that \u201cyour house has to be in order before you go public,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. \u201cYour job is to predict what you\u2019ll hit and then do it.\u201dSnap declined to comment.While Snap may make people rethink what it means to be prepared for a public offering and how high investors might value a buzzy company, it will most likely not discourage companies from going public altogether. Generally speaking, newly public companies have done well for investors over the past couple of years, so there is an appetite to buy into more of these start-ups.\u201cThere\u2019s a buildup of potential I.P.O.s,\u201d said Scott Sandell, a venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates.Many start-ups also do not face the tough situation Snap is in now, in which it is being compared to a Goliath like Facebook, which is aggressively copying some of Snapchat\u2019s features.For many of the tech start-ups that are evaluating going public, Snap\u2019s trajectory offers valuable lessons, said Elad Gil, the founder of the genetic testing start-up Color Genomics. The kind of public market beating that Snap just went through can ultimately help a company become more focused and disciplined, he said.Just look at what happened with Facebook, Mr. Gil added. The social network\u2019s stock, which was priced at $38 for its I.P.O., at one point went as low as $18 a share in its first year as a public company.The investor skepticism helped Facebook concentrate on spreading into new areas, such as mobile advertising, where it has since become a juggernaut. On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s stock closed at $150.04.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nearly a Decade Nursing? Study Pierces Orangutans\u2019 Mother-Child Bond", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byTrilobitesElizabeth Hunt Burrett, a mother from Australia, experienced a moment with an orangutan while breast-feeding her son at Melbourne Zoo last year.Because observing wild orangutans can be difficult, the authors recreated the nursing history of four orangutans by analyzing barium, an element absorbed from maternal milk, in teeth taken from museum collections. In doing so, the scientists also discovered a possible clue why the apes nurse for so long: The teeth showed cycles in barium, which might correspond to environmental fluctuations in food.\u201cWhen times are tough, adult orangutans will fall back on things like bark or hard seeds,\u201d she said. \u201cBut offspring may not have the ability to eat some of these foods, or the knowledge to find them on their own, so they\u2019re maybe falling back on mothers\u2019 milk during periods of scarcity.\u201d These are the first findings tying nursing to food scarcity in a primate, Dr. Smith added.Previously, researchers estimated that orangutans wean off maternal milk between 6 to 8 years old, but they could never be sure because field surveys of the animals are tricky: Offspring often suckle inconspicuously, high up in trees or at night, and even when suckling is observed, it\u2019s hard to know whether the animals are consuming milk or just comfort nursing, with no milk transfer.When producing milk, mothers incorporate ingredients from their own skeleton, including calcium and trace amounts of the chemically similar barium. These elements get written into the skeletons and teeth of their offspring.Barium makes a good marker for nursing, because it\u2019s readily absorbed from maternal milk but not so much from other foods, Dr. Austin said.The researchers studied nine teeth, belonging to two Sumatran and two Bornean orangutans, taking microscopic samples at hundreds of points in time per tooth, then quantifying the amount of barium in each sample.In all four orangutans, barium increased through the first year of life. It dipped between 12 and 18 months old, indicating that the apes started supplementing milk with solid food. Thereafter, barium fluctuated on a roughly annual basis, presumably in response to solid food availability.An extended nursing period relates to why orangutans are headed for extinction at current rates of habitat loss and poaching, Dr. Smith said.This study \u201cpoints to an even more vulnerable ape than we might have originally understood,\u201d she said. \u201cThat they need so long to be able to transition from one infant to the next explains why they\u2019re struggling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There is absolutely no question that they would have been calling for Clinton\u2019s head if she had done anything remotely like this, or for that matter, any of dozens of outrages Trump has committed since taking office after losing the popular vote.Mr. \u2018President\u2019, it\u2019s you who are \u2018Not fit!\u2019, and the same is true of any elected official who defends you at this point. Just plain disgusting.\u201d\u201cNumerous times in my professional life, I\u2019ve been drug-tested, I\u2019ve gone through background checks and security clearances. I\u2019ve signed legally enforcible non-disclosure agreements. I\u2019ve had to disclose that I have been involved in lawsuits or have felonies and I don\u2019t have any financial liens against me.Apparently, I have been more thoroughly vetted in my professional work by my employers ... than Trump. And the Republicans expect all of us who must meet a high worth ethic to put up with this?\u201d\u201cAll any Republican politician has to do to secure their legacy as a hero is to repeat after me: \u2018The President is unfit for office and should resign.\u2019\u201dSome commenters did not believe that revealing classified information to the Russians was detrimental to national security, and could even help the United States defeat ISIS.\u201cSeriously? This is not news. If it\u2019s so sensitive why make this a story? If no specific details of sources were shared and only the nature of the plot, how is that excessive disclosure?Wouldn\u2019t rapprochement among the two largest nuclear powers be a good thing? The partisanship is obscuring everything Trump says and does to the extent that people always want to see it in the negative. There isn\u2019t a story here, at least not yet.\u201d\u201cNot news anymore, unfortunately. Tell us when you have audio of Trump promising allegiance to Russia. Anything else is starting to become a lot of white noise. Where is the illegal act? Where did he cross the line?\u201d\u201cThe way I look at it, if this information helps fight ISIS or prevent loss of innocent life, what\u2019s wrong with sharing it? I think this is getting blown out of proportion.\u201dPotential repercussions of Mr. Trump\u2019s disclosure for the intelligence community were chief among the concerns of some commenters.\u201cWhich ally is now going to feel comfortable sharing intelligence with the U.S.? and even the security agencies within the U.S. may have doubts about what can be shared. Nixon pointed out that whatever the president chose to do is legal.By extension the worst excesses of despots will also be legal but could not be considered moral, sensible or in the best interests of the nation. \u2018Checks and balances\u2019 just don\u2019t address this lack of fitness to govern adequately.\u201d\u201cIt seems to me that the larger story here is that the intelligence community has so little faith in Trump that it is putting stories like this out in the press. Whoever gave this story to the press may also be trying to protect other sources by letting them know what\u2019s at risk.That this story found its way into the headlines suggests that the intelligence community increasingly sees Trump as a threat to their mission, not to mention the principles that they risk their lives for.\u201d\u201cThe White House says that sources/methods were not disclosed. Perhaps they were made discoverable by the revelation. But, we will never know if ISIS would have been aware of the intelligence but for the news clamor. And that clamor is what will likely put any source, which may or may not be human, in jeopardy. If the source is human, let\u2019s not pretend that the media cares a whit if someone is killed if they can lay it at Trump\u2019s door or even if they can use the disclosure to harm him in some way.I\u2019m not a supporter of Trump and have always thought he was completely unqualified. But, I have very decent friends who are supporters and they feel we are approaching sedition.\u201dSome readers were skeptical about the use of anonymous sources while others blamed the media for further bolstering Mr. Trump\u2019s sharing of information with Russia. \u201cUnless these news agencies stop using anonymous sources, there is no way a rational person can believe them. If the sources identified themselves, they could then be questioned/cross-examined!If they continue to hide, they could say or simply make up almost anything! How do we know where the truth ends and their speculation begins? How can the truth be found? Even the reporter is shielded from scrutiny. This looks like a coup attempt by Trump\u2019s enemies.\u201dIt\u2019s quite strange that the media is giving such prominence to and broadcasting so much detail about supposedly highly secret information and its source in order to show how irresponsible President Trump is.By contrast, all President Trump did was warn two highest-level Russian diplomats in private about an ISIS threat to global airline traffic\u2014presumably because no one wants Russian airliners blown up any more than they want American ones blown up (although one wonders about some people on that account).It seem that of the two, the media and the President, the media is by far the most at fault for leaking state secrets. Strange indeed: it seems the goal of bringing down Trump overrides all other considerations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was given to him by his mother when he was a teenager, and on it hung a tiny pendant with a word, rendered in stylized Arabic script, that Mr. Mushtaq knew would enchant some men and utterly enrage others.The word: \u201cAllah.\u201d\u201cMy presence here is an anomaly,\u201d Mr. Mushtaq said. \u201cMy presence shows that people that look like me, that are Pakistani, that are Muslim, are here for peace. We are the sex symbol. We are the people that everybody wants to hit on.\u201dMr. Mushtaq, who competed as Mr. Long Beach Leather, was not the first Muslim contestant to compete at I.M.L., as the event is commonly known. But he was the first Pakistani-American contestant, and in the leather community his presence at I.M.L. was a big leap out of the pitch-black closet for Muslim men who are not only gay, but also into leather fetish.When asked why he competes, he said, \u201cWhen you get the Facebook message that says \u2018You are living my dream.\u2019\u201dIssa Arden, a member of the social media team for I.M.L., said that having Mr. Mushtaq compete this year could broaden the gay subculture\u2019s appeal to racial, ethnic and religious minorities. \u201cThe more fully you see people that are different in various ways, the more you see an embrace of everything that leather can be,\u201d said Ms. Arden, one of a small group of women at I.M.L. \u201cHaving someone Muslim or noticeably brown or who is well built but smaller of stature, it\u2019s all of those things.\u201dBut publicity has been a mixed bag. Mr. Mushtaq said that while most of the feedback he received had been positive, he also got text messages calling him \u201can ugly, dirty Muslim\u201d and a \u201cterrorist.\u201d He has also met fellow leather folk who think \u201cthat being Muslim is the antithesis of being progressive,\u201d he said.Although he calls himself a Muslim (he studied Arabic and the Quran as a child), Mr. Mushtaq says his relationship to Islam today is \u201can ethnic identity as opposed to a fundamentalist religious identity.\u201d He adheres devoutly to some elements of the faith (he doesn\u2019t eat pork), and more casually to others (\u201cI\u2019m a very light drinker\u201d). His Islam is not \u201cthe crazy people with the swords,\u201d as he put it, but professionals \u201cwho consider themselves Muslim\u201d and who \u201cmight approve of gay marriage.\u201dMr. Mushtaq was born in California to Pakistani immigrant parents and came out as gay in high school in conservative Orange County at 15. But it wasn\u2019t until he attended California State University, Fullerton, that he discovered he was \u201cbored being gay.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be more edgy, the libertine that everyone gossiped about and called a slut,\u201d said Mr. Mushtaq, whose chatty, giggle-prone personality may seem at odds with the stereotype of an order-barking leatherman.Today, Mr. Mushtaq sexually identifies as an impact-play and bondage switch, meaning he is comfortable assuming the dominant and submissive roles in the infliction of pain. His preferred tools are flogs and a whip he has named Wally. (\u201cIt\u2019s the kinkiest thing I could think of.\u201d)He lives with his maternal grandparents in Anaheim, Calif., and maintains a good relationship with his divorced parents, who he says are supportive of his leather endeavors. In a phone interview, Ruby Atcha, Mr. Mushtaq\u2019s 70-year-old grandmother, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t care about Muslims and religion\u201d and was more concerned with her older grandson\u2019s happiness than with his sexuality. She and her husband were proud that Mr. Mushtaq felt he could be open about his choices.\u201cWe\u2019re very happy that at least he\u2019s never lied to us,\u201d she said.After several days of dress rehearsals, interviews and, of course, parties, Mr. Mushtaq took his place to compete with 62 other men from around the world. As it turns out, Mr. Mushtaq didn\u2019t win or even make the first cut of 20. (The title went to Ralph Bruneau, who competed as Mr. Gay Naturists International Leather.)But Mr. Mushtaq was far from crushed. After the competition, he went back to his hotel room, had pizza and made plans to return to his job as an adjunct professor of sociology at Long Beach College. He also wants to continue to spread the message that \u201cvisibility makes people secure.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about reaching out to the people in Islamabad,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be the role model I didn\u2019t have.

Mr. Penn, the former associate director of the Office of Public Engagement under President Barack Obama, currently stars as the press secretary Seth Wright on the ABC drama \u201cDesignated Survivor.\u201dFrom his movie roles to his tenure in the White House to acting on television shows including \u201cHouse\u201d and \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d Mr. Penn has spent considerable time in a number of cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington and now Toronto \u2014 where \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d is filmed.Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Penn:\u201cHarold and Kumar Go to White Castle\u201d was filmed in Toronto. Now you\u2019re back in the city for \u201cDesignated Survivor.\u201d What has changed the most since you were last there?\u201cHarold and Kumar\u201d was my first huge movie that was on location. Actually, it\u2019s funny that I should say that. It was not a big movie. People just ended up seeing it. Toronto, like any city over a 12-year period, changes a lot, but it is an incredibly diverse city. They take in refugees that the United States doesn\u2019t accept. It\u2019s a totally different experience when you live somewhere as a full-fledged adult and the city has grown so much. I came back and saw not just new buildings, but entire neighborhoods that were industrial and have been transformed into living spaces.Is there an area in Toronto that you gravitate toward?There\u2019s a neighborhood called Parkdale that I really like, which has an interesting Tibetan population. There\u2019s a lot of great food, and I don\u2019t mean fancy places where you dress up and go to dinner, but really great hole in the wall, authentic places to grab food. It\u2019s a really nice neighborhood, in the West End of the city. Little Portugal is another great neighborhood, with really nice shops and restaurants.For a while, you had a bicoastal lifestyle. What was that like?Both Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., are vibrant cities. What I love about L.A. is how creative it is. In the District, the focus is on the cerebral.What were some of your most memorable experiences at the White House?For the most part, I had the opportunity to serve as the president\u2019s liaison to young Americans. The Affordable Care Act, the repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, and the Dream Act were some of most memorable things that the president was working on. I remember being in the West Wing with other staffers when the Dream Act vote failed by just a few votes, and the president saying that we\u2019ve come closer than we ever have before, but we still have a long way to go.Talking to people whom we disagree with is more important now than it has been before, and I don\u2019t mean just ranting on your Facebook wall. A conversation tends to go very differently when you\u2019re having a beer with someone that you disagree with, compared to sending a nasty tweet to someone because you want to make yourself feel better.I shot a small independent film in the Himalayas earlier this year, in a small town called Manali. So many of the folks that we worked with were local, and to go places where your co-workers literally grew up was pretty remarkable. I would say the same about Detroit, which is an amazing city. The things that they\u2019re doing with art, urban farming and technology are really exciting. I loved Croatia, which was beautiful and filled with friendly people.Advertisement"}

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who is seeking a second term, was broadcasting a live video on Instagram. It\u2019s impossible to get Instagram videos once they are no longer live, so this was my one chance to catch Mr. Rouhani\u2019s speech. I ducked into the bathroom to listen in. Then, about 20 minutes later, Ebrahim Raisi, the hard-liner candidate, started a live stream of his own. The bartender and people sitting at the bar watched as I went back and forth to the bathroom wearing my headphones, clutching my phone and whiskey.The campaign videos became my 3 a.m. ritual. For two weeks, I slept with my phone by my ear, with the volume on high. Instagram alerts produce only a half-second \u201cding\u201d \u2014 I slept shallowly, afraid I\u2019d miss it.I wasn\u2019t sure where watching the rallies would lead. Although I am Iranian \u2014 born in Tehran and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia \u2014 and have the right to vote in the election, I was on the outside looking in. I have been back to Iran a handful of times; still, my clearest window into Iranian society has been through my cousins\u2019 Instagram accounts. Their posts carried the details of their lives \u2014 videos of the terrible traffic in Tehran; images of the cement factory where an acquaintance worked; selfies revealing how far back some of my friends wore head scarves.Some of what I discovered would be familiar to American social media users. For instance, the candidates used automated bot accounts to spread propaganda; as soon as I followed Mr. Raisi\u2019s official personal Instagram, three accounts followed me back.But the new format has had powerful consequences. At a Rouhani rally this month, supporters chanted praises of former President Mohammad Khatami. A leader in the reformist movement in Iran, Mr. Khatami has been barred from appearing or even being mentioned in Iranian media because of his support for the 2009 protests. Not only are there strict rules on exactly how many minutes each candidate is allowed to campaign on TV, on the radio and in the presidential debates, there is no way the pro-Khatami sentiment would have been shown on state media, at least not in this universe. Yet here was Mr. Rouhani, holding forth for nearly two hours in a frank appeal to reformist voters.It was no surprise that Mr. Rouhani, who expanded internet access during his first term, was courting votes online. The surprise was his opponent, Mr. Raisi. One video I watched showed him praising his wife for being a university professor and promoting gender equality. Mr. Raisi burnished this new narrative with pictures of himself with young voters and female supporters \u2014 not gestures one would expect from an arch-conservative cleric who was anti-internet until just a few years ago.All Iranians have stories of self-censorship in some form. But change is coming to Iran, in part by riding the swell of young people getting political on social media. Until the election, my cousin\u2019s Instagram feed had mostly consisted of Tehran scenery, homework and family. Now she shares images and video of herself in purple nail polish, the campaign color of Mr. Rouhani, sometimes bearing photo filters from his campaign. Early Thursday morning I received a private message from her. She asked if I was voting.To watch \u201cIn Iran Election, Even Hard-Liners Turn to Instagram,\u201d visit nytimes.com/video.videoAdvertisement"}

These garlicky leeks can\u2019t be raised in captivity, but must be foraged in rich, moist forests.\u201cThey\u2019re impossible to actually just cultivate,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have tried. This is one of those true wild products.\u201dI joined Mr. Colicchio, known for his restaurants, including Fowler & Wells, and the Bravo show \u201cTop Chef,\u201d for a lunchtime excursion earlier this week to scope out this season\u2019s offerings with his trained eye \u2014 all captured on Facebook Live.A stand for Lani\u2019s farm from Burlington County, N.J., quite literally had a field of greens, including chrysanthemum greens (a staple of Chinese hot pots), komatsuna (Japanese mustard greens), and so-called Chinese broccoli (which had flat leaves that look more like smooth kale).I sensed a theme. \u201cIt\u2019s a season for greens, not just greens for a salad, but greens to cook,\u201d he explained, pointing out a stack of wild dandelions. Mr. Colicchio would saut\u00e9 them in butter or olive oil with garlic and then toss it all with pasta for a weeknight dinner.As he kept an eye out, he seized on a container of broccoli rabe flowers, which have yellow petals that are not only edible but delicious. He nibbled as he went, beheading a kale flower while explaining that they taste sweeter than their namesake.Later, he found one of his favorites: fresh chamomile. \u201cTypically, you think chamomile, and you think tea,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is kind of sweet, not really sweet like sugar, but really floral.\u201dThey look like miniature daisies. After he\u2019s braised a fish, Mr. Colicchio said he likes to break up chamomile flowers over it, yellow centers, white petals and all. \u201cYou get this beautiful floral flavor,\u201d he said. Or alternatively, put them in vinaigrette.\u201cYou\u2019ll only find this stuff at a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d he said.There are certain things Mr. Colicchio can\u2019t get enough of: Beets, Swiss chard and mushrooms. \u201cThey all taste like one thing,\u201d he said, a smile crossing his face. \u201cThey taste like dirt. They taste really earthy.\u201d It reminds him of making mudpies as a kid and sneaking a little taste. \u201cIt just kind of sticks with you,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, I love those earthy flavors.\u201dHe also had strategic advice for home cooks who want to get the most out a farmer\u2019s market. First, do a walk-through to see what\u2019s on offer to avoid getting overloaded. Mr. Colicchio, who has campaigned against food waste in recent years, is a firm believer in buying to cook for that night\u2019s dinner, instead of purchasing a couple days\u2019 worth of produce.For those lucky enough to live in areas with several regular markets, that\u2019s an option. \u201cPut it into your routine, on the way home from work, hit the farmer\u2019s market and get what you need for the night and then you don\u2019t have to worry about storage.\u201dAnd on the weekend, bring the kids. \u201cBring them to a farmer\u2019s market with you and show them what a ramp is \u2014 then it almost becomes their idea.\u201dIt\u2019s something my parents neglected to do (Are you reading this, Mom?), but it\u2019s not too late for the generation coming up.\u201cI have a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old,\u201d Mr. Colicchio said, explaining that the youngest \u201cwill not eat unless it\u2019s his idea.\u201d But he said, \u201cIf I bring him shopping and he chooses everything, then he\u2019ll eat it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Budget Cuts? More Like Radical Surgery", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byAs the chart below shows, defense receives an increase, Medicare and Social Security retirement are left almost entirely unchanged and pretty much everything else is massively trimmed. (All projected changes are in relation to current law, and these figures are not adjusted for inflation, making the effective cuts from today\u2019s spending levels that much greater.)That means that President Trump, who vowed during the campaign not to touch Medicaid, now wants to cut it in half by 2027. He must really, really not like the poor.More than 74 million Americans, many of them impoverished single mothers, receive Medicaid. Are we actually going to impose far harsher treatment on this group than even the much reviled Republican health care legislation? Never in our history have we rolled back so dramatically a social program of such import.But let\u2019s not give short shrift to the equally large reductions in a vast array of domestic discretionary programs, ranging from education to environment to research and development and so many more.The new budget would take these areas down to roughly 1.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2027, well less than half of its 50-year average share of the economy of 3.8 percent.Many of these programs are investments in our future; we should be allocating more, not less, to them.Much has been made of $2 trillion that O.M.B. double counted. The reality is that the artificial math involved much bigger sums. Most importantly, the budget office completely ignored the president\u2019s massive planned tax cut, whose cost has been estimated at $6.3 trillion over the next five years, (including $1 trillion of tax reductions included in the health care legislation).At the same time, the proposal assumes that economic growth, which O.M.B. had been projecting at 2.2 percent, will accelerate to 3 percent.But no reputable economic forecaster believes that is possible, with or without the tax cut. Our labor force is aging and productivity growth has been waning, leading most economists to expect growth to remain roughly in the current range of 2 percent.Lastly, the $4.5 trillion of spending cuts that the administration seeks (including $1.25 trillion in the House health care bill) are by no means assured. Some would require 60 votes \u2014 and therefore a measure of Democratic support \u2014 to go into effect. Others that can be passed with 50 votes, such as the Medicaid evisceration, already face opposition from more moderate Republican senators.So to the extent that these plans are blocked, the deficit would be that much larger.All told, a budget that the Trump administration said would reduce red ink over the coming decade by $3.6 trillion would, in reality, add at least $1.7 trillion and possibly a good bit more.That\u2019s hardly the fiscal responsibility that the White House has been claiming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Red Book for Children", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byRed CenturyThere\u2019s only one small problem: None of it is true.To do so, Ms. Adamczak tells a tale of peasants surviving the transition from feudalism to capitalism, a story about workers adapting to the market demands of capitalist productivity and a parable about different, failed attempts by proletarians and unemployed people to improve their social and economic conditions through collective organizing. Scary stuff, I know. Although the narrative is full of suffering, defeat and failure, the real scandal of the book lies in its optimism, its hope that another world is still possible in the womb of the old. More outrageous, such hope cannot be decreed from above by politicians, leaders or businesspeople, but only created from below by people struggling together for a fair, dignified and free way of life.Long before the Soviet Union crushed all political tendencies that favored a more libertarian form of socialism, the name for that way of life free from the misery of wage labor was called communism. In the philosophical epilogue to her book, Ms. Adamczak explicitly confronts the problem of how to speak about communism after a century of disasters committed in its name. As she makes abundantly clear, it\u2019s not easy.And yet, that doesn\u2019t let us off the hook. The only way to truly understand the failures of communism is to take seriously the motivations, desires and ideals of those who advocated it. But to do that, one must first understand capitalism.Alas, the history of communism is littered with failed attempts by communists to be better at capitalism than the capitalists themselves. As Ms. Adamczak argues, this is because most communist criticisms of capitalism take one idealized aspect of capitalist society and pit it against the others, unwittingly perpetuating the framework communism sets out to abolish. This recipe for disaster recurs throughout history, and the only way to stop it is for everyone to learn about the unsuccessful attempts at revolution, so as not to repeat those mistakes in their current struggles. Hence, \u201cCommunism for Kids.\u201dNaming the problem may be the first step toward curing the illness, but it doesn\u2019t yet tell us how to proceed. For that, we need ideas, experiments and dreams. Is it wise to dream about utopia while living in the dystopia of the present?There\u2019s another reading of Adorno\u2019s remark. We may not be able to live a wrong life rightly, but we can stop living wrongly altogether. To do that requires a depth of social imagination, the courage of collective struggle and a wellspring of political desire that seems all but evaporated in the present moment. \u201cCommunism for Kids\u201d is not a message in a bottle to some imagined future audience; it is rather a collection of broken shards from lost futures still jammed in the present. It is a cry from behind the curtain of history to rectify the injustices of the past by attending to the suffering of the present. I suggest we pay attention.Jacob Blumenfeld, a writer and translator, is a researcher in philosophy at the New School for Social Research.This is an essay in the series Red Century, about the history and legacy of Communism 100 years after the Russian Revolution.Advertisement"}

By far the largest contingent of foreign students, they can be an economic lifeline for colleges, since they usually pay full tuition, and they can provide a healthy dose of international diversity.But those students often bring to campus something else from home: the watchful eyes and occasionally heavy hand of the Chinese government, manifested through its ties to many of the 150-odd chapters of the Chinese Students and Scholars Associations.In rare instances, members of the student group have been accused of spying.\u201cI basically don\u2019t think that any student organizations that are controlled by their government \u2014 which clearly the C.S.S.A. is \u2014 should have a presence on foreign university campuses,\u201d said Jeffrey Henderson, a professor of international development at the University of Bristol in England.Two days before the workshop, Dr. Henderson said, he received an email on behalf of the president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association stating that the Chinese Embassy in London was \u201cvery concerned that nothing should go on in the workshop that disturbs the harmonious relationship between Hong Kong and China.\u201dDr. Henderson arrived with plans to ignore the embassy guidance. Yet he found the seminar\u2019s Q. and A. session tightly controlled, permitting only written questions that had been vetted.For the most part, the clubs function as run-of-the-mill campus groups, providing transportation for new arrivals, sponsoring Lunar New Year celebrations and organizing bilingual job fairs. Joining the Chinese Students and Scholars Association on some campuses is competitive. Students are required to apply for spots on club committees, and being accepted confers a certain measure of prestige; members often trumpet it on their LinkedIn pages.Neither the Chinese embassies in Washington and London nor the consulate in Los Angeles responded to questions about their ties to the student organizations.\u201cSo it\u2019s true that we have connections with the consulate, but it\u2019s not the kind of relations that many people say we have,\u201d said Mr. Yao, a probability and statistics major from Zhuhai, China. \u201cThey think we represent the Chinese government, that we do things the Chinese government tells us to do, things like that, but that\u2019s not true.\u201dChinese Students and Scholars Association groups started to spread in the 1980s as the number of Chinese students studying abroad began to grow. \u201cI came to the U.S. and thought, \u2018Wow, great, I\u2019m in a free country, now I hope that everything is cool and happy,\u2019\u201d said Frank Tian Xie, who arrived in the late 1980s to study chemistry at Purdue University. \u201cBut I found out that the government extended their control to even Chinese students in America.\u201dDr. Xie, now a professor at the University of South Carolina, Aiken, said the Chinese Consulate in Chicago tried to handpick officers of the organization and periodically sent a representative to meet with students in a motel room.Li Fengzhi, a longtime employee of the Chinese Ministry of State Security who came to the United States in 2003 as a graduate student at the University of Denver, said that the Chinese government did not see the group so much as a spying operation, but rather as a propaganda and \u201cinformation collection organization.\u201d Mr. Li eventually defected and was debriefed by F.B.I. counterintelligence agents about the group\u2019s activities.The ties between the Chinese government and the student groups are not exactly secret. At some colleges, like the University of Connecticut and the University of North Texas, the groups\u2019 websites mention that they are supported by or affiliated with Chinese consulates.Michigan Technological University\u2019s group acknowledges a relationship with the Chinese Embassy, then adds, \u201cHowever, C.S.S.A. will not participate in any political revolutions, unless in special conditions.\u201dIn 2005, authorities in Belgium said they had identified another Chinese spy \u2014 a member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at Leuven University \u2014 coordinating industrial espionage agents throughout Europe, according to an unclassified 2011 F.B.I. report.At Columbia in 2007, a Canadian human rights lawyer, David Matas, arrived to find heavy security and a protest by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association against his presentation on China\u2019s mistreatment of adherents of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that combines portions of Buddhism, meditation and exercise and is banned by the government.Later, a threatening email \u2014 apparently directed at Mr. Matas \u2014 was sent to the Columbia group\u2019s website, stating, \u201cAnyone who offends China will be executed no matter how far away they are,\u201d Mr. Matas said recently.Last month the Columbia chapter held its annual China Prospects Conference at the Low Memorial Library at Columbia, focusing on economic policy and sustainable development. Several dozen government, academic and business leaders spoke to an audience of mostly Chinese students, and the agenda avoided third-rail topics such as human rights, Taiwan and the Dalai Lama.Several colleges where the Chinese Students and Scholars Association openly acknowledges ties to the Chinese government, including Columbia, said such ties did not violate any college rules. But colleges have found themselves caught up in Chinese politics just the same.At U.C. San Diego, about 3,500 undergraduates hail from China, or more than 10 percent of the student body. They pay more than twice what California students pay, providing critical revenue at a time when the University of California system is financially pressured.Other than Mr. Yao, the exiting club president, members of the group declined requests for interviews. But some other Chinese students said they also were offended by the Dalai Lama\u2019s invitation. At the Price Center, a campus student center and food court, several who were eating lunch one recent afternoon predicted protests on June 17, commencement day. One said his parents were going to miss his graduation because they refused to be present for the Dalai Lama\u2019s speech.Shiwei Terry Zhou, a junior from Wuhan, China, said the students felt targeted by the university\u2019s decision. \u201cWe make good grades. We don\u2019t make trouble. We pay a lot,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cWhat is the motivation?\u201dDespite the pressure, the university has not backed down.

We have strict guidelines on how and in what ways we cover sensitive stories. Our coverage of Monday\u2019s horrific attack has been both comprehensive and responsible.We cover stories about terrorism from all angles. Not only stories about victims but also how terrorist groups work, their sources of funding, how they recruit. Acts of terrorism have tremendous impact on how we live, on how we are governed and how we interact as people, communities and nations. At times the process of reporting this coverage comes at personal risk to our reporters. We do it because it is core to our mission.A powerful Islamist militia in Tripoli said on Wednesday that it had arrested Mr. Abedi\u2019s 20-year-old brother, Hashem, at the family\u2019s home in the Libyan capital on Tuesday, and said that he was a member of the Islamic State who was planning an attack in Tripoli.\u201cWe have been following him for at least a month and a half now,\u201d said Ahmed Omran, a spokesman for the militia, known as the Special Deterrence Force.Later, Mr. Omran said the group was also holding the father, Ramadan Abedi, who is also known as Abu Ismail.The Special Deterrence Force, or Rada, is one of the most powerful militant groups in the often lawless capital. Its leaders are staunch Islamists and it operates a detention facility where many people accused of being Islamic State fighters have been held.The militia also said that Hashem traveled to Libya from Britain on April 16, and that he had been in daily phone contact with his older brother since then.\u2014 Suliman Ali Zway and Declan Walsh Before his arrest by the Special Deterrence Force in Libya, the bomber\u2019s father said in a phone interview that his son Salman could not have carried out the attack on the Manchester Arena.\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it was him,\u201d said the father, Ramadan Abedi. \u201cHis ideas and his ideology were not like that. He was born and raised in Britain. He\u2019s a British citizen and he does not hold such ideologies.\u201dSalman Abedi, born in Manchester in 1994, had recently visited his parents, who had moved back to Libya after living for decades in Britain. The father, speaking from Tripoli, said he believed that his son was on his way to make a religious pilgrimage at the time of the attack.Five more victims of the Manchester Arena attack have been identified.Investigators have been focused on determining who may have helped the bomber, Mr. Abedi, plan and execute the attack at the Manchester Arena after an Ariana Grande concert.Chief Constable Ian Hopkins of the Greater Manchester Police said at a news conference on Wednesday, \u201cThis is a network that we are investigating.\u201dThe BBC, citing unidentified intelligence sources, reported on Wednesday that officials believed Mr. Abedi had been a \u201cmule,\u201d carrying a bomb made by someone else.Officials are still trying to find the \u201cfactory\u201d where the bomb was made and to discern whether Mr. Abedi received help assembling the device, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the investigation.Friends and neighbors of Salman Abedi have said he expressed extremist views, and a security official has said Mr. Abedi traveled to Syria, the stronghold of the Islamic State.He is also said to have expressed anger after an imam at a Manchester mosque delivered an anti-Islamic State sermon. Mr. Abedi recently traveled to Libya to visit his father and brother, who are now under arrest.During Mr. Abedi\u2019s visit to Libya, his parents became worried about his radicalization, and even seized his British passport, according to the friend in Manchester.Mr. Abedi\u2019s father denied this. Before he was arrested, he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that his son was not an extremist and was in possession of the passport because he was traveling back to Manchester before going to Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Defense of \u2018Transracial\u2019 Identity Roils Philosophy World", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byAcademic philosophy has resembled a battleground in recent years, and not just because of its famously bare-knuckled argumentative style.Now, an article in a leading feminist philosophy journal has touched off a firestorm of criticism and countercriticism, illuminating a divide within feminist philosophy itself and raising a thorny question: Just what counts as good philosophy where sensitive issues of identity are concerned, and who gets to decide?\u201cSociety,\u201d she concludes, \u201cshould accept such an individual\u2019s decision to change race the same way it should accept an individual\u2019s decision to change sex.\u201dBut underneath the hyper-charged war of words lies a wonkier but no less significant battle over philosophical method.Ms. Bettcher, who in 2009 was co-editor of a special issue of Hypatia dedicated to transgender issues, said Ms. Tuvel\u2019s article was part of a long tradition of researchers\u2019 treating transgender people as objects of inquiry without adequately taking into account what they say about themselves.\u201cThis is basically an argument that thought, \u2018I can just swashbuckle in and cite a few articles,\u2019 but didn\u2019t really reflect on these deeper issues,\u201d she said. Ms. Tuvel\u2019s conclusions, she added, \u201care false.\u201d\u201cThe content is objectionable, and the conclusions are objectionable, but that\u2019s not the really offensive part,\u201d said Ms. Botts, who delivered a critique of an earlier version of Ms. Tuvel\u2019s paper at a conference last month. \u201cThe really offensive part is that the perspectives of scholars working in these areas were treated as nonexistent or irrelevant.\u201d\u201cIf the agenda is more papers by women, and more papers about feminist issues, that\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if it turns out it\u2019s a really narrow conception of what that is, that\u2019s not so good.\u201dThe president of Hypatia\u2019s board of directors, Miriam Solomon, a professor of philosophy at Temple University, said the critics of the paper had \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d about the marginalization of transgender and nonwhite voices in philosophy. But she reiterated that philosophical pluralism was an important value, too.Ms. Tuvel\u2019s paper is \u201ca very competent example of a certain style of philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Hypatia should publish such things as well as other things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 S\u00f6ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.Instead, he went to China.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Schwertfeger said.Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China\u2019s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.China\u2019s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu \u2014 often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition \u2014 this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.\u201cIt\u2019s a race in the new generation of computing,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe difference is that China seems to think it\u2019s a race and America doesn\u2019t.\u201dFor Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.\u201dQuantifying China\u2019s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn\u2019t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation\u2019s spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cIt\u2019s the habit that yes is more risky than no.\u201dAuthorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China\u2019s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.\u201cThe lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut it has started to change.\u201dAt the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America\u2019s research institutions.Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.It\u2019s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.Baidu is a leader in China\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary \u2014 take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is \u2014 into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.In an apparent effort to harness Baidu\u2019s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a \u201cmilitary-use intelligent ground robot,\u201d was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China\u2019s seven schools of national defense.A company spokeswoman said: \u201cBaidu develops products and services that improve people\u2019s lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.\u201dStill, there are advantages in China\u2019s developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.\u201cAfter AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,\u201d said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, \u201cthe content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.\u201d Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Mr. Shirky said, \u201cunlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that\u2019s never been Beijing\u2019s favorite characteristic.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and John Markoff from San Francisco.

The play is a classic of American drama; it has been produced four times on Broadway, was adapted into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and is widely read and staged.\u201cI do not question the motives of those that made the decision \u2014 I think they have some fealty to a sense of integrity to Edward Albee\u2019s desires,\u201d Mr. Streeter said in an email. He had planned a non-Equity production of the play this fall at the 35-seat Shoebox Theater in Portland. \u201cBut I had hoped the negative aspects of Albee would die with him.\u201d He added, \u201cI think the benefits of casting Nick with an African-American actor outweigh the drawbacks.\u201dAlbee\u2019s record on nontraditional casting is complex.\u201cI think the play would work beautifully with any number of approaches to cross-cultural casting,\u201d Mr. Bond said. \u201cIt\u2019s a play about the human condition, and any person should be able to play any one of those roles.\u201dLiterary estates are often criticized as overly restrictive by artists who want to make changes and are denied permission.\u201cThis is obviously a new estate, and part of me thought, \u2018Welcome to the club,\u2019 because I have faced these decisions,\u201d said Theodore S.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Internet Is Broken\u2019: @ev Is Trying to Salvage It", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Evan Williams is the guy who opened up Pandora\u2019s box. Until he came along, people had few places to go with their overflowing emotions and wild opinions, other than writing a letter to the newspaper or haranguing the neighbors.Mr. Williams \u2014 a Twitter founder, a co-creator of Blogger \u2014 set everyone free, providing tools to address the world. In the history of communications technology, it was a development with echoes of Gutenberg.And so here we are in 2017. How\u2019s it going, Mr. Williams?\u201cI think the internet is broken,\u201d he says. He has believed this for a few years, actually. But things are getting worse. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot more obvious to a lot of people that it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u201cI thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,\u201d Mr. Williams says. \u201cI was wrong about that.\u201dThe Silicon Valley entrepreneur first drew notice during the dot-com boom, for developing software that allowed users to easily set up a website for broadcasting their thoughts: blogging. By the time Google bought the company in 2003, more than a million people were using it.Then came Twitter, which wasn\u2019t his idea but was his company. He remains the largest individual shareholder and a board member.After fame and fortune come regrets. Mr. Williams is trying to fix some things. So, in different ways, are Google and Facebook, and even Twitter. This is a moment for patches and promises.The trouble with the internet, Mr. Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you\u2019re driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behavior like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them.His goal is to break this pattern. \u201cIf I learn that every time I drive down this road I\u2019m going to see more and more car crashes,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a different road.\u201dBut a new road may have other problems. It may, for instance, be a dead end.Mr. Williams isn\u2019t the only one trying to fix this mess, of course. If he and others can\u2019t find a path forward, if they can\u2019t solve what he calls \u201cthe architecture of content creation, distribution and monetization on the internet,\u201d there are unsettling implications for the future of news and ideas. Maybe it will be all car crashes, all the time. Twitter already feels like that.\u201cA beautiful space for reading and writing \u2014 and little else,\u201d Mr. Williams called Medium at its public debut in 2012. \u201cThe words are central.\u201dEarly chatter was enthusiastic, based on Mr. Williams\u2019s track record and the site\u2019s ease of use. But Medium, which began out of step with nearly all other media, now seems to inhabit a different universe.Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Mr. Williams\u2019s 85-employee hobby. \u201cThe notion that you\u2019re going to succeed as a writing site simply by putting quality first is not compatible with venture capital revenue expectations,\u201d said Bill Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant. \u201cNo one would have funded this if it weren\u2019t by Ev Williams.\u201dMr. Williams\u2019s supporters say that is a feature, not a bug, and that publishing needs all the experiments it can get. But they concede the road will be difficult.Biz Stone was at Twitter with Mr. Williams from the beginning. He joined his old friend at Medium as both a board member and an investor.\u201cEv chose the hardest thing to do,\u201d Mr. Stone says. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to make publishing profitable.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, so does everyone else.\u2019 How far along are we? Somewhere between zero and half a percent.\u201dMr. Williams is 45, bearded and stick-thin. He looks more like a Beatnik poet, staying up until dawn to debate existentialism, than the son of a Nebraska farmer, which he is. Growing up in a place where he felt new people and new ideas were in short supply, he was starved for someone to talk to. Living in a football-loving culture, and hating what he called \u201cthe stereotypical jock mentality, small brains thinking they\u2019re superior because they\u2019re surrounded by big muscles,\u201d did not help, Mr. Williams said.A few years ago, Twitter was viewed as a tool of liberation. It enabled, some believed, the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. Twitter, like the internet itself, was putting tyranny on a short leash.Then the narrative turned darker, with the rise of trolling on the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad thing, Twitter\u2019s role in that,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that he wouldn\u2019t be president if it weren\u2019t for Twitter, then yeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Williams\u2019s remarks.In a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska this month, Mr. Williams noted that Silicon Valley has a tendency to see itself as a Prometheus, stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals. \u201cWhat we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity,\u201d Mr. Williams told the crowd. \u201cSome would say that\u2019s what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Williams\u2019s mistake was expecting the internet to resemble the person he saw in the mirror: serious, high-minded.\u201cI\u2019ve come to realize Ev is extremely intellectual and introspective,\u201d Mr. Stone says. \u201cIf he could wave a magic wand, he\u2019d have everyone write the kind of things he likes, like, \u2018Here are suggestions on climate change.\u2019\u201dIt was just another Utopian dream, Mr. Williams says. \u201cThe problem is that not everyone is going to be cool, because humans are humans,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lock on our office door and our homes at night. The internet was started without the expectation that we\u2019d have to do that online.\u201dWriters want readers and, usually, money. Readers want to be entertained, instructed or outraged. Publishers need revenues and profits. Yet no one has come up with a satisfactory and sustainable way of harnessing the internet to satisfy all these parties without descending into sleaze and clickbait.Money, of course.In the beginning, Medium had an editorial staff that sought out writers and rewarded them modestly for their contributions, just like a traditional magazine. Abby Norman, then in her early 20s and working for the medical records department of a Maine hospital, was pulled in.\u201cAd-driven systems can only reward attention,\u201d Mr. Williams says. \u201cThey can\u2019t reward the right answer. Consumer-paid systems can. They can reward value. The inevitable solution: People will have to pay for quality content.\u201dMr. Williams was late to arrive at this solution. The rest of the media got there long ago.Medium declined to say how many subscribers it has, saying that its effort is still informal. In any case, it\u2019s not going to be an online magazine. Mr. Williams resists the notion that Medium should be seen as a traditional publisher, commissioning, editing and making stuff available.He suggested instead the bookstore model. Bookstores don\u2019t commission material, but they curate it and sell it. \u201cWrite whatever you want, and we\u2019ll pay you based on certain terms,\u201d Mr. Williams says now. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m the publisher, or you?\u201dAs Medium struggles to define itself, the older new communications platforms \u2014 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2014 are trying to deal with their unexpected toxicity.\u201cI think we will fix these things,\u201d Mr. Williams says. Just don\u2019t hold your breath. The work has barely begun, he says. \u201cTwenty years isn\u2019t very long to change how society works.\u201dJames Hong, best known for the popular rating-and-dating site Hot or Not? in the early 2000s, was an angel investor in Medium. He once told Mr. Williams that he had some new ideas about dating sites but feared that if he tackled them, \u201cI\u2019d be working on the same thing my whole entire life.\u201dMr. Williams had pondered for a moment and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the same thing my whole life.\u201dMr. Hong said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a vanity project, it\u2019s his calling. Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan.\u201dThat kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph.\u201cMedium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated,\u201d Mr. Watson says. \u201cBut as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally. And that post-Obama world holds no room for minimalist, distinguished, self-important, elevated thoughtfulness.\u201dSo what\u2019s a mere writer to do? Mr. Watson says he is now working on a screenplay.Medium maintains it is doing well by the metrics it cares about. The company says that the number of posts on the site quadrupled in 2016, and that it has 60 million unique monthly readers. After raising $130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $600 million last year.Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever.Mr. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult, but flat-out impossible. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, and they\u2019re not,\u201d he says.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying not to die, frankly,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve really moved on to other things out of necessity.\u201dAnd yet. Medium hasn\u2019t solved the problem of publishing on the internet, but neither has anyone else.\u201cI\u2019ll pitch them, because I\u2019ve been invested all this time and I\u2019ve hung on and hung on,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d like to see how it all pans out. I\u2019d like to see it through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But we are blissfully ignorant of what that means. We don\u2019t know what data is being bought and sold, because, well, that\u2019s private. The evidence that flashes in front of our own eyes looks harmless enough: We search Google for a new pair of shoes, and for a time, sneakers follow us across the web, tempting us from every sidebar.

{"Headline": "The New Roland Garros Is on Its Way", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Though the 2017 French Open does not begin until Sunday, the tournament has already won a marathon match.\u201cIt\u2019s our project of the century,\u201d said Bernard Giudicelli, the newly elected president of the French Tennis Federation, which runs the event.The project, long contested by environmentalists and some neighbors of Roland Garros, comes with some collateral damage. Sentimentalists, ill-served in general by tennis\u2019s latest building spree, are going to lose some more touchstones. The new 5,000-seat \u201cGreenhouse court\u201d will replace the circular Court No. 1, nicknamed the Bull Ring, one of the most atmospheric and acoustically ideal places to watch a match.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be nostalgic for No. 1, because the Greenhouse court will offer a whole other spectacle,\u201d Giudicelli said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt it will quickly become a monument.\u201dStill, it takes time to build tennis memories. The Bull Ring will be demolished to make way for a large lawn that will be Roland Garros\u2019s version of Aorangi Terrace, better known as Henman Hill, at Wimbledon. It will be a grassy place for a big crowd to watch tennis on a big screen and maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 luxuriate in the sunshine. That would not have been an option during last year\u2019s rain-delayed edition of the tournament, aptly called the Drench Open.With such weather in mind, the federation\u2019s project will also add a retractable roof to the stadium\u2019s centerpiece, the Philippe Chatrier Court, by 2020. The modifications associated with that work will also require the demolition of Court No. 2, with its overhanging tribunes, architectural quirks, intimacy and vintage feel. Its replacement, the new and larger Court No. 14, will be built on the far western end of the grounds.The \u201cnew Roland Garros\u201d will be very new indeed, with hardly anything left from the original, which was built in a hurry in 1928 to provide a suitably grand venue to defend the Davis Cup that France\u2019s four musketeers \u2014 Henri Cochet, Ren\u00e9 Lacoste, Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon \u2014 had finally managed to win.But then at least the tournament is still here in Paris. In 2011, the federation flirted with the idea of moving it out of the city altogether to Versailles or another suburb, before voting to stay put.There has been cause to question that, with the construction delays and well-founded fear that Roland Garros was losing ground in both prestige and means to the other three Grand Slam tournaments: the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the United States Open.The French Open\u2019s total prize money this year of 36 million euros ($40.4 million) ranks third behind the U.S. Open and Wimbledon. Even with the expansion from 8.6 hectares to 11.16 hectares, Roland Garros will still rank last in surface area and the number of roofed stadiums.\u201cI think we need to play the card of our own identity,\u201d Giudicelli said. \u201cFrance is not a continent like the United States. We don\u2019t have the facility that will allow us the vast spaces available to the Australian Open.\u201dThe goal is to emphasize \u201cboutique\u201d and \u201cchic,\u201d although anyone who has had to line up in the drizzle for an overpriced baguette over the years has felt anything but chic.Giudicelli, one of those who spearheaded the expansion project, considers the tournament\u2019s recent difficulties a necessary evil.\u201cIt was the price we had to pay for Roland Garros to remain in the city, to enable people to come out of Line 9 or Line 10 of the M\u00e9tro and get to the stadium in five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is an undeniable strength, as is our proximity to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Eiffel Tower. But we live in a country of law. Our detractors used all the arguments they could so that our project would not happen. We have to respect people\u2019s right to contest our plans.\u201dGiudicelli has no shortage of plans. He is an energetic Corsican who clearly relishes the limelight and comes from a long line of commercial fishermen; he approaches tennis with the zeal of a convert.Giudicelli said he only began to play tennis at age 21 after falling for the sport when he watched Bjorn Borg beat Victor Pecci in the 1979 men\u2019s French Open final. Giudicelli eventually competed in low-level tournaments, became an instructor and helped create a tennis league in Corsica of which he became president.\u201cThere is a bad joke at home that says that Corsicans are lazy, but the day one of them got up and going, he became emperor,\u201d he said, referring to Napoleon.Instead of simply issuing a statement, he made the announcement himself via Facebook Live, one of his preferred communication vehicles since his election in February (he has even done a Facebook Live appearance while driving a vehicle through the California desert).\u201cI feel like he\u2019s flexing his muscles a bit as the new French Federation president,\u201d said Leif Shiras, the Tennis Channel analyst, after the Sharapova wild-card announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was handled in the best way possible.\u201dThose who work with Giudicelli, previously the general secretary of the French federation, say that he is clearly relishing his higher-profile role, and that he also enjoyed maintaining the mystery on the Sharapova decision. Traditionally, tournament directors, not federation presidents, announce tournament wild cards. But Giudicelli insisted that he was not grandstanding.\u201cFrom the moment the request is made, Maria is a player like any other,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cannot be treated separately. We announced the decision when we announced the other wild card decisions.\u201dNonetheless, he did agree to meet with Sharapova separately in March at the tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., when she was still serving her 15-month suspension for a doping violation. Clearly, that is not the usual treatment. But then Giudicelli, for all his enthusiasm for the sport, has sent other mixed signals.The federation presidents who preceded him, Christian B\u00eemes and Jean Gachassin, have been investigated by French authorities for using their position for personal advantage. B\u00eemes was convicted and fined 30,000 euros in 2009 for having held paid posts at the federation and at a French broadcaster that held rights to televise the tournament. Gachassin, the former French rugby star, is under investigation for the illegal resale of French Open tickets.Last year, the French newspaper Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 reported that Giudicelli also was suspected of involvement in such resales, an allegation he denies. But he will soon face charges in Corsica of favoritism in the construction of a new tennis center on the island in 2013. The court date, according to Giudicelli, is June 13, two days after the French Open ends.\u201cI am accused of not having respected the proper procedure, which I did not consider applied to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI fought for 10 years to have this training facility, and never in my life could I imagine being charged for this. This project was a league project, not my project. But I will take responsibility and go explain myself in front of the judge and show my good faith.\u201cIt\u2019s not a joyful moment, but we are in a state ruled by laws and there\u2019s a company that contested this. And the law says if there is contestation, it has to be judged. So it will be judged, even if it\u2019s clear that I prefer the atmosphere next to a tennis court over a court of justice.\u201dThe sport in France could certainly use more of the former and less of the latter, but one thing is undeniable as you stare at the tricolor crane and the big pit in the botanical gardens: A new tennis court is definitely coming.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Disturbing Slumber Party", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported bySocial Q\u2019sMy son had a slumber party with a few friends last weekend. They were all in the 9- to 10-year-old range. Most were boys, but a girl was there, too. In the morning, after the other kids had left, my son told me that one of the boys had given all the kids massages to help them go to sleep. I am at a loss. Are massages at boys\u2019 slumber parties a thing? Is this innocent behavior? Should I alert the boy\u2019s mother?CAITThere was a time, I admit, when I would have placed this question in fourth position (a.k.a., the silly one at the end) \u2014 maybe with a quip about tipping big to diligent service providers. But having been educated, often by readers of Social Q\u2019s, about the serious prevalence of child sexual abuse, in many cases, by other children, let\u2019s take a breath and chart your best course forward.Your son is well past the age when you should have begun speaking to him about unwanted touching, including by other kids. This is not a one-time chat; it should be repeated frequently. So, start with your son: Did the massage make him uncomfortable? Where did the young masseur touch him?Let\u2019s hope this was all in good fun. When I was little, my brothers and I gave each other percussive, karate-chop back massages inspired by the \u201cThree Stooges.\u201d Who knows what behavior this boy is modeling? But I would tell his mother about his party trick. She should remind him to ask permission before touching others (and figure out where these massages are coming from).You may think I\u2019m alarmist. But when studies suggest that around 20 percent of our children are sexually abused before 18, a figure that probably underreports the scope of the problem, no parent can afford to be silent \u2014 even in the context of the world\u2019s weirdest slumber party.My ex-boyfriend of two years lives in a different city, miles away from me. Our relationship faded, and after a year of only occasional phone calls, I asked him to send me clothing that I\u2019d left at his house. He agreed. When no box arrived, I called him. The post office told him the box was lost. It contained never-worn clothing worth $500 and other personal items. He didn\u2019t insure the box. Am I wrong to think that he should assume some financial responsibility for this loss?P.P.I see this as a favor your ex undertook at your request. Did you ask him to insure the box? If not, how would he estimate the value of its contents? It\u2019s also hard to believe that you value them terribly highly, given that you let them languish in a closet for over a year. I\u2019d put this mishap in a category titled: \u201cIt sure would have been nice if he\u2019d offered to split the loss, but he didn\u2019t. Oh, well.\u201d Next time, consider collecting your things yourself.My husband and I have a two-week time share in a vacation spot. It is a two-bedroom condominium with a sofa that opens into a queen-size bed and a cot for a small child. We invited our son and his wife, their two teenage daughters and young son to join us for a week. Our son cannot come because of work, but the rest of the family accepted. Then our son asked if his older daughter\u2019s 19-year-old boyfriend could take his place. We don\u2019t know the boyfriend well, and we\u2019re not comfortable with the teenagers sleeping together, which they do at home. But my son told us: If the boyfriend can\u2019t come, no one will. What should we do?KATHYBullies are not confined to playgrounds (or episodes of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d). And decisions about whom to invite on your vacation are not your son\u2019s to make. Let\u2019s avoid the Rubik\u2019s Cube of sleeping arrangements \u2014 though I offer the possibility of boyfriend-in-sleeping-bag. Consider it, if you want to see your grandchildren. But who wants to go on vacation with an ultimatum?I accidentally gave a large tip to my manicurist. I reached into my purse for a $20 bill, but later realized that I had given her $50. She thanked me profusely for my generosity. This woman has been my manicurist for many years, so I\u2019m fine with my error. I don\u2019t want her to think I want the money back. But I also don\u2019t want her to think the huge tips will continue (almost twice the cost of the manicure). What should I do?D.H.Call me crazy, but I\u2019d be honest. Say: \u201cDoris, I realize I gave you a $50 tip last time. I hadn\u2019t intended to, but I\u2019m delighted I did in light of your many years of excellent manicures.\u201d Otherwise, you will be on pins and needles every time you get your nails done, afraid that your ordinary (but still generous) tip is signifying some unspoken complaint. Clear the air and let the \u201cJungle Red\u201d roll on in peace.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook.Advertisement"}

Both cod and ham are knocked around with chopped pickled peppers and their spicy vinegar. The menu calls this \u201cRhode Island style cod cheeks.\u201d I grew up in Rhode Island and never saw cod cheeks in any form there. Things were simpler then.Mr. Abdoo\u2019s affection for regional specialties is written all over the slate of sandwiches Pig Bleecker serves at lunch. Baltimore pit beef is represented, thinly shaved with charred edges and a horseradish sauce inside an onion roll. So is the New Orleans muffuletta. Cold cuts and smoked mozzarella are piled on a sesame hero roll instead of the customary miniature hubcap, and it\u2019s arguably too sparing with the olive relish. So call it an Italian hero with olives; it\u2019s still a great thing to eat for lunch.Smoke runs through much of the cooking like a rhythm track. A thick-cut chop spends time in the smoker before it goes on the grill; served with battered onions and a peach glaze that\u2019s spicy, tart and sweet, it\u2019s one of the strongest main courses on the dinner menu.Pig Bleecker\u2019s take on Buffalo wings involves not just smoking them but trimming the drumsticks into lollipops, leaving an exposed length of bone for a handle. They\u2019re dressed in butter swirled with a reasonably spicy sauce of red Hatch peppers. You can find that sauce, or something like it, at Pig Beach, along with the Alabama white sauce that turns up as a dip for the celery sticks that come with Pig Bleecker\u2019s wings. I must be a heretic, too, because I like the white sauce more than blue cheese dressing.Pig Bleecker is more domesticated. There is one long communal table made from a single polished slab of wood in the center of the room. Around the wall is a banquette of leather the approximate color of the mustard sauce. Instead of paper towels and wet wipes in an American flag pouch, the tables are set with cloth napkins. The design is crisp and urbane, to the extent that those words can apply to a place with the head of a Texas longhorn mounted on the wall.I might give Pig Bleecker more than an enthusiastic single star if the cooking didn\u2019t sometimes swing and miss. \u201cDeviled steak and eggs\u201d sounds more clever than the thing it describes, deviled eggs with beef tartare piled under the yolks. (At lunch, the eggs are more effectively paired with thin sheets of country ham.) The crudit\u00e9 platter is a gorgeous spread of raw and gently cooked vegetables, and a good buy at $13, but it deserves better than the generic cocktail-party dips.Oddly, given Mr. Abdoo\u2019s time at Del Posto, pasta can be dull. Ravioli filled with juicy bundles of smoked and braised brisket could have used a real sauce instead of melted truffle butter with zigzags of reduced Barolo. Tossing house-made cavatelli with clams and \u2019nduja is a great idea, but I wanted more flavor from the clams and more spice from the \u2019nduja.There is also an Oreo cheesecake that proves not everything gets better when you stuff it into a Mason jar. More than making up for that, though, is the deliciously tart key lime pie with a crunchy nut crust. Then there is a peanut butter milkshake with hot fudge and a buckeye candy on top (creamy and smooth, like peanut ganache), and a hot fudge and brownie sundae. They\u2019re both true to their ice cream parlor roots, and truly good.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResycookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal Country\u2019s Power Plants Are Turning Away From Coal", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byCoal is on the defensive in the nation\u2019s power industry. Even in coal country.The pressure to shift more of the country\u2019s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry\u2019s biggest customers, like General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it \u2014 and keep them from taking their business elsewhere \u2014 utilities are changing their ways.West Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception.Appalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012.Chris Beam, the company\u2019s president, made the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)It\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.And in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201dAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.Coal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201dFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.Last year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201dOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.Appalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201dMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Czeslaw Milosz Still Matters", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn 2011, on the centenary of the birth of the Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz and seven years after his death, a conference about his life and work took place in Sejny, a small town on the Polish-Lithuanian border. Because I had just written his biography, I was invited to discuss \u201cNative Realm,\u201d an autobiographical work, written over half a century before.The book relates his own life experiences, yet at the same time stands as a biography of an intellectual from the eastern \u2014 or, as we Poles prefer to put it to differentiate ourselves from Russia, the central \u2014 part of the continent. In that book and elsewhere, Milosz wrote powerfully about totalitarianism, anti-Semitism and nationalism, the topics that occupied European intellectuals for much of the 20th century.I declared to the audience that in my view many of the author\u2019s political diagnoses were outdated. After all, I thought, most of my students view themselves primarily as citizens of Europe, as countless young people do throughout the European Union. They speak foreign languages, travel and work abroad to get a feel for the world, and generally do not feel under threat. The issues that outraged Milosz were things of the past.It turns out, however, I was deeply mistaken.Someone once said that in his life Milosz had encountered every kind of hell the 20th century could devise, yet also had at times tasted paradise. And, like Dante, he captured both for us.As a boy, he witnessed the demise of the 19th century, which took place on the battlefields of World War I. For a while he lived in Wilno \u2014 then part of Poland, now Lithuania\u2019s capital, Vilnius \u2014 and increasingly became aware of what was happening nearby, just beyond Poland\u2019s eastern border, where the empire of the czars morphed bloodily into the Soviet Union.Like the majority of young intellectuals, he retained leftist leanings, but, at the same time, found himself caught in an ideological quandary. From the mid-1920s and the early 1930s onward, much of the continent fell under the spell of two totalitarian ideologies, communism and fascism. Though they proclaimed concern for the future of humanity and pledged to bring justice and build heaven on earth, what they created bore no relation to their promises. Instead they led millions of people to their deaths.Milosz witnessed World War II and the Holocaust, living through the German occupation of Poland and the terrible, pitiless slaughter that accompanied it. Among his many famous poems is \u201cCampo dei Fiori,\u201d which movingly commemorates the fate of the Uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.After the war, he spent several years in the United States as a diplomat representing the new, communist-run Poland. While he enjoyed reading Faulkner\u2019s novels, translating Auden and Eliot\u2019s poems and meeting Einstein, he was unable to come to terms with what to his mind was a consumerist, soulless society. He frequently felt at odds with communism as well as with capitalism and considered joining a Christian farming community in Paraguay.In 1951, not without misgivings, he defected to the West, enduring the migrant\u2019s life and fate, first in France, where at times he was shunned like a leper by Paris\u2019s Left Bank intellectuals because he had betrayed communism. Albert Camus was one of the few French writers who helped him survive a long period of solitary exile.Still, it was during this period that Milosz produced one of his most famous widely read works, the 1953 book \u201cThe Captive Mind.\u201d In it he examined why so many intellectuals and artists of the time succumbed to, or pretended to believe in, communism. A successful ideology, he wrote, is comforting, an all-encompassing tool to salve our deepest fears and orient our lives. The book brought him international fame, although as a poet he felt uneasy about being pigeonholed as an analyst of Soviet politics.Perhaps a decade ago, it would have been easy to pass off \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d as a relic of the totalitarian 20th century: However, the last decade has demonstrated how the mechanisms of mind control Milosz exposed continue to be deployed throughout the globe.Some people, for example, feel certain that their failures or the collective failures of the state are caused by enemies one can easily pinpoint. They embrace ideologies that demonize liberals, communists, capitalists, Jews and, more fashionably in recent times, migrants and Muslims.The importance of Milosz\u2019s analysis is that it applies to much more than communism and fascism, or even political ideology. Toward the end of his life the British historian Tony Judt was reading \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d with his students and pointing out that there are many different ideologies to which we passively yield and lies we choose to believe in: that wealth will make us happy, that thanks to the latest iPad we will find sense in our existence, that Facebook will bring us closer to others and that, because of all this, we will avoid pain and disappointment.Many of the political and social transmutations that appalled Milosz \u2014 the fears and hatreds \u2014 have been revived. In \u201cNative Realm\u201d he tells of his journey through France in the 1930s and how, walking together with his friends across a bridge joining Switzerland and France, he encountered a sign saying, \u201cGypsies, Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians are forbidden entry.\u201d Change the ethnicities, and one could easily find a similar message along other borders today, and not just in Europe.It could be said that the history of humanity is defined and dictated by two opposing processes: building bridges and raising walls. A bridge brings us closer to others, allows us to get to know them; it is a beginning of or an extension to a road. A wall separates, closes. And although it appears to provide security, it also generates a defensive mentality, the conviction that everything on the other side represents a threat, as the Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski points out.Milosz was deeply critical of the narrow nationalist views of his fellow countrymen, which provoked hostility from many quarters and accusations that he was \u201cbetraying\u201d the homeland. He often said that Poles, Lithuanians, Jews and Russians could live amicably with each other, as his long, deep friendship with the poets Joseph Brodsky of Russia and Tomas Venclova of Lithuania proved.At least in my country, Poland, the end of 20th century and the beginning of the 21st belonged to the bridge builders. Today, however, watchers on the walls \u2014 physical and political \u2014 can be observed there and everywhere.It is hard to comprehend why fanaticism, violence, hatred, fear and a desperate search for security are on the loose again. Could anyone a few years ago have anticipated that George Orwell\u2019s \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d would become a best seller on Amazon?The vision of multicultural societies seems to have vanished; the language of politicians has become more and more nationalistic; people no longer tolerate open discussion, determined to accept only confirmation of their own point of view. That stance makes life much easier, as \u201cThe Captive Mind\u201d shows. Everything that surrounds us has to be familiar. There should be no opponents or outsiders. We should be able to exist in an airtight bubble.In my country, despite surprising prosperity over the last few years, millions of people imagine that they have become worse off than others and that they have been wronged by someone. Is it the Germans? The Russians? The Jews? As a result they vote for the far right. There are more and more young people, like those in the 1930s, who demonstrate, chanting chauvinist slogans against immigrants, leftists and homosexuals. Some among them break the windows of cafes run by migrants. Perhaps they will soon begin burning books.Andrzej Franaszek is the author of \u201cMilosz: A Biography.\u201d This article was translated by Aleksandra and Michael Parker from the Polish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Fast-Rising Czech Conductor Leads the Philharmonic", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byFor his New York Philharmonic debut on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, he could have chosen to show his stuff with a staple or two. Instead, he led works by Dvorak and Janacek, composers from his homeland. The program revealed much about who Mr. Hrusa is as both a musician and a person. And the performances were colorful and exciting, especially Janacek\u2019s dark, teeming and seldom-heard \u201cTaras Bulba,\u201d a rhapsody for orchestra.During the extended opening stretch of the first movement, Mr. Hadelich made it seem like the restless music was searching for a starting point. Hearty yet shadowy, fanfarelike orchestral bursts alternated with his wistful playing of ruminative passages for violin, rich with Slavic fervor and plaintive lyricism. Yet hints of Brahmsian intensity stirred within. Finally, with Mr. Hadelich\u2019s clear, strong statement of the previously halting theme, the movement took off.His lustrous sound and tenderness were ideal for the pensive passages of the slow movement. In the finale, a rustic dance, Mr. Hadelich and the orchestra conveyed the music\u2019s rousing energy, while somehow maintaining a breezy lilt. As an encore, Mr. Hadelich played Paganini\u2019s solo Caprice No. 1, a whirlwind of nonstop arpeggios, dispatched with precision and panache.After intermission, keeping to Dvorak, Mr. Hrusa offered refreshingly straightforward performances of three Slavonic Dances. Then he turned to the Janacek rhapsody, completed in 1918. The three-movement piece depicts harrowing episodes from a creepy Gogol story set during a war between Poland and Ukraine in 1628. Taras Bulba, a Cossack captain fighting for Ukraine with his two sons, kills one son for betraying the cause (over love for a Polish girl) and watches helplessly as the other is killed by his enemies. In the final section, Taras is a brutalized captive burned to death, though not before seeing his valiant troops coming to take up the fight.Janacek tells this barbaric tale through an impassioned, vibrantly orchestrated score, including organ, a continually shifting flow of strangely stirring themes, fractured rhythms, piercing harmonies and crazed dance bits. With his sweeping arm gestures and choreographic swiveling, Mr. Hrusa is a very animated conductor. His approach worked, judging by the plush, enveloping sounds and impressive execution he drew from the Philharmonic players in an auspicious debut.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ad Buyers Have a Say in Whether Real News Survives", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byMediatorPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hey, America\u2019s Advertisers: You got some good news last week, didn\u2019t you?The question now is whether all of this will give advertisers the assurance they need to keep sending the overwhelming majority of their new online ad dollars to Google and Facebook.There is more at stake in the answer than the fortunes of our two online overlords. It will also help determine the fate of the rest of the digital media. And that, in turn, will affect whether cities like this one will be able to maintain a vibrant free press that keeps government honest and voters informed.So, yeah, America\u2019s Advertisers, I\u2019m talking about democracy, and your role in it. News flash: You have one. Let me explain.We are still very much in the midst of a fascinating, often exciting but sometimes scary digital transformation in which advertising dollars are moving to Google and Facebook in a hurry.But as those dollars are moving toward Google and Facebook, they are often moving away from quality news and information providers, starving them of the direct digital revenue they need to pay for fact-based news gathering. Real news costs real money; fake news comes cheap.It\u2019s just the latest bit of upheaval in their joint operation, which is now combined into a single newsroom after The Daily News vacated its own. The former Daily News newsroom is just across a hallway from the Inquirer space here on Market Street, and it still sits tauntingly empty save for an old neon \u201cDaily News: The People Paper\u201d sign, which now sits unlit.The shifting dynamic is especially hard for old-line newspapers, whose lucrative classified ads were rendered obsolete by the likes of Craigslist, and high-margin print advertising fled to the Web. They had hoped to make up the difference through online advertisements. Then Google and Facebook fired up their cash vacuums.Their draw for marketers is all too powerful, and understandable. Advertisers were once happy to pay to reach big, broad audiences with the hope of getting their messages in front of the right customers \u2014 buying the whole cow just to get the milk, it was called \u2014 and they would turn to local newspapers for what once passed for geographical precision. Now they can use Facebook and Google to reach a smaller, more targeted audience, right down to the correct ZIP code.The new environment is forcing newspapers to scramble to come up with a solution that can keep the lights on, and keep the staff large enough to continue to do real, probing journalism, before it\u2019s too late and it\u2019s all over.The country\u2019s still-standing metropolitan dailies are increasingly requiring extra help from benevolent rich people. The Philadelphia Media Network \u2014 the owner of The Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com \u2014 has been lucky enough to have a benefactor in H. F. Lenfest. Last year, he donated the group to a foundation he created, the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which he endowed with $20 million.Last week, the institute followed up by announcing that it had secured $26.5 million more from donors, and Mr. Lenfest committed an additional $40 million in future matching funds, all with a goal of finding \u201csustainable business models for high-quality journalism.\u201dIn an interview, I asked Mr. Lenfest a leading question: Does the diminishing of local newspapers mean open season for corrupt city officials?\u201cI don\u2019t think our city government is corrupt \u2014 but sometimes they need correcting, and that is the responsibility of the newspaper,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere will be a tremendous vacuum if these local newspapers don\u2019t continue to print.\u201dIt\u2019s not hyperbole. I grew up in Philadelphia, reading The Inquirer\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning expos\u00e9s of the Philadelphia court system \u2014 by a team including Buzz Bissinger \u2014 and of the Philadelphia Police Department K-9 unit by William K. Marimow, now the paper\u2019s editor at large.But as David Boardman, who sits on the Lenfest Institute board of managers, told me, the group \u201cstill needs to make a buck\u201d under the terms of its philanthropic support.\u201cUltimately, you can\u2019t continue to contribute to something that is inevitably in decline,\u201d said Mr. Boardman, who is the dean of the Klein College of Media and Communication at Temple University.So the Philadelphia Media Network is preparing for buyouts. And, like all newspaper groups, it is trying to reorganize its newsroom to provide its journalism in new forms that fit with new media consumption habits.But that will not solve the threat that Facebook and Google pose to news providers. They have the user base \u2014 billions \u2014 and engineering prowess that no media company can match, which Stan Wischnowski, the Philadelphia Media Network executive editor, told me, is \u201cputting democracy as a whole at risk because it has put at risk the kind of watchdog journalism we\u2019ve been doing for 187 years.\u201dIt might, for instance, help efforts to increase subscriptions to newspapers with digital paywalls, while making them more adept online and on social platforms.The company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thompson, told investors that The Times seemed to be benefiting from advertisers\u2019 desire to avoid being adjacent to \u201cdishonest or tawdry content.\u201dWe can hope that\u2019s the start of something more lasting, and not a temporary move to a safe harbor until the squall passes.Facebook is working to do its part to help newspapers. Newspapers are trying to modernize. Now it is time for advertisers to do their part to support the people who make the quality content they want to be associated with, and to reconsider their headlong rush away from them.That isn\u2019t a plea for charity. It\u2019s a plea for common sense. If current trends continue, there will be far less quality content to fill the big platforms advertisers are so in love with. They should think about what will be left.The Mediator column on Monday, about the role that advertisers can play in supporting quality news sources, misstated the title of Stan Wischnowski in some copies. He is the executive editor of the Philadelphia Media Network, not its editor in chief.Advertisement"}

White, a 21-year-old student who was quickly arrested. Witnesses described the suspect as eerily composed during the episode near Gregory Gymnasium, and said that when he was confronted by police officers, he did not speak or appear to hurry.Rachel Prichett, 19, a student from Austin, said she was standing at a food truck when she heard screaming, turned and saw a man holding what looked like \u201ca small machete\u201d approaching her, \u201cjust walking calmly with the knife to his side.\u201dThe suspect walked behind a man a few feet away from her, then grasped the man\u2019s shoulder with one hand and with the other hand stabbed him in the back, thrusting the knife \u201call the way in.\u201dMs. Prichett said she fled, running past another victim, his head bloody, who was slumped over a table.In recent weeks, fraternity houses at the university had been vandalized with messages accusing them of promoting racism and rape. Many people on campus speculated Monday that the knife attack was related.But Chief David Carter, of the University of Texas at Austin Police Department, said the authorities did not know of a motive for the stabbings. Speaking at a news conference, Chief Carter said that he was aware of the rumors but that he did not know if the victims, all men, were fraternity members.Mr. White is black. Chief Carter said the four who were stabbed, all age 20 or 21, included three white men and one Asian-American man. One died at the scene, and the others were taken to the university medical center. The authorities did not immediately release the victims\u2019 names.After the attack, unfounded rumors flew of more violence and more assailants on the loose, and there was a bomb threat against a nearby building.A student who said he knows Mr. White socially, William Verastegui, said the suspect had always seemed friendly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to be hotheaded; he didn\u2019t seem to be an angry person or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Verastegui said.The grassy open areas on campus were crowded with students on Monday. The police received the first report of the stabbing at 1:49 p.m. Officers arrived within two minutes and arrested Mr. White without incident.Ray Arredondo, 21, a student from San Antonio, said, \u201cI just saw swarms of people running away from Gregory Gym, and my first reaction was \u2018gun,\u2019 so I ran, too.\u201d\u201cThe cops were on scene, and they were doing CPR on one victim,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was another guy who had lacerations to his head or neck, and a police officer was holding his head.\u201dAnother Twitter user posted a short video showing a man sitting on brick steps, with other people pressing on what appeared to be a bloody wound in his back. Local television news footage later showed what appeared to be that same man being loaded into an ambulance.Lindsey Clark, 20, a student from Richardson, Tex., heard screaming, then saw police officers force the suspect to the ground outside the Jester Center, across the street from the gymnasium.

{"Headline": "A Network Ad Wrangler Undaunted by Facebook and Google", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAfter completing her first year as the head of advertising sales for NBCUniversal, Linda Yaccarino went out to dinner with her husband to celebrate.She soon found herself crying into a bowl of shrimp scampi.The tears were a rare reaction to what she called the hardest year of her career, when Ms. Yaccarino started dragging an ad sales operation for television programming as varied as \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Bravo reality shows into the digital future.Things haven\u2019t gotten any easier in the television ad world, but five years later, Ms. Yaccarino, 54, is still at it. And far from weeping, she has become an outspoken leader in an industry that is contending with far-reaching changes in how people watch television while competing against a host of technology companies that have begun to vie for those same audiences by investing in original video content.Ms. Yaccarino, who oversees $10 billion in annual ad revenue, has drawn particular attention for her vocal criticism of Nielsen ratings, which have long been the standard for how TV ads are bought and sold, and for her use of digital properties that NBCU has either invested in or forged partnerships with, like Snapchat, BuzzFeed and Apple News.\u201cLinda has the ability to stay a step ahead, and I think she\u2019s done that wherever she\u2019s been,\u201d said Julie Rieger, the executive vice president for media at 20th Century Fox, who has known Ms. Yaccarino for more than a decade. \u201cShe is in some ways the Wayne Gretzky of media. It\u2019s not about where the puck is \u2014 it\u2019s about where the puck is going.\u201dAs broadcast television audiences shrink and people spend more time on digital platforms, Ms. Yaccarino has reoriented herself to think of the competitive landscape as stretching beyond NBC\u2019s rival networks to include online behemoths like Facebook and Google. During this week\u2019s annual ritual known as upfronts, when networks trot out their biggest stars and announce new shows in an attempt to lure advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino will surely be promoting the fact that the NBCU universe includes more than 17 cable channels, 50 online destinations and partnerships that reach to all sorts of platforms and devices.During a recent interview in her sun-filled office, Ms. Yaccarino explained the ways that marketers might use NBCU\u2019s properties and partnerships to reach, say, a young, busy mother.First, she wakes up and checks Apple News on her phone, Ms. Yaccarino said. Then she might turn on the \u201cToday\u201d show while making breakfast, catch up on E! on Snapchat at the school drop-off and check stock prices on CNBC or sports scores during the day. In the evening, she\u2019ll tune in to a show like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d then end the evening watching Jimmy Fallon. Each presents a distinct marketing opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s about the media mix,\u201d she said.Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s desk faces two flat-screen televisions mounted side by side, and her office is peppered with photographs of stars like the Kardashians, whom she adores in part because of E!\u2019s success in marketing their reality show. She\u2019s married with two children, but jokes that Jack Pearson, the character from \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d will be her second husband once she figures out what to do with the first. And she professes excitement for the \u201cpinch me\u201d moments in her job, like holding business meetings with Mr. Fallon and talking with Megyn Kelly about her move from Fox to NBC.She has forged new relationships, inviting the sales chief of a rival network to speak at an NBCU innovation event this year and teaming up with AOL for automated advertising a couple of years ago \u2014 when the notion was viewed as \u201cheresy in the TV world,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said.She first oversaw sales for NBCU\u2019s cable channels and was quickly promoted to overseeing all of the network\u2019s ad sales, a move that combined its broadcast, cable and digital properties for the first time.Previously, sales teams for divisions like NBC Sports, Bravo and USA functioned independently of one another. With the new structure, the idea was that if buyers wanted to be on \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d they could also be sold on \u201cModern Family\u201d reruns, Bravo shows and more, providing the network with more scale and efficiency.Wrangling a 1,000-plus person organization and 15 teams into doing that was the grueling part for Ms. Yaccarino. But it also forced her to grow comfortable with acting quickly in an industry where her competitors were changing by the day.\u201cHer job is understanding the marketplace and how to combine the assets she has under NBCU, connecting the dots between all the channels and ensuring the parent company gets as much revenue as possible,\u201d said Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM, the media investing arm of the ad giant WPP. While that may occasionally make it harder for buyers, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what she does, and she does it well.\u201dIf that was Act 1 of Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s time at NBCU, she\u2019s now ready for Act 2.\u201cThe next frontier is: How do we really bring it all together in terms of linear and digital?\u201d she said.\u201cImagine if the advertising-supported ecosystem went away,\u201d she said. \u201cThere would be no Hulu, no Netflix, no Amazon, because that\u2019s what fuels all their content. They\u2019d have to go to 100 percent original, and the cost for the consumer would be absolutely unaffordable. So I think everyone agrees that advertising-supported content needs to remain the main driver or the epicenter of the business. We just need to figure out a way to do it respectfully to consumer behavior today.\u201dThe frustrations have cast old rivalries in a new light. Joe Marchese, who was named the head of ad sales at Fox Networks Group last week, was invited by Ms. Yaccarino to speak at an internal NBCU event this year.\u201cIt was kind of like a Macy\u2019s-Gimbels type of thing for her to invite a senior person from Fox to come up and talk about where the industry is headed,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. But it reflects the challenges networks are facing as some viewers opt out of ads entirely through platforms like Netflix, while at the same time TV ratings numbers are being compared with online ad views on Google and Facebook.TV executives have seethed in the past two years over a frequently repeated remark from Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, who said the social network has a Super Bowl on mobile every day in terms of the people it can reach. While the size of audiences on Facebook and YouTube are undeniable, there is fierce debate over the value of video views on such platforms, particularly when the ads take up only, say, half of the screen, or appear for a couple of seconds without sound.\u201cFrom a consumer experience, we all know what it\u2019s like to experience a Super Bowl as you have people over your home, family, friends, or you go somewhere and you\u2019re watching this communal experience and you\u2019re talking about the show and you\u2019re yelling and screaming and holding your breath and talking about the commercials,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Super Bowl.\u201dShe held up her phone and exaggeratedly swiped the screen without breaking eye contact. \u201cDoes this look like a Super Bowl?\u201d She kept swiping. \u201cThis is not a Super Bowl.\u201dNBC, it should be noted, will air the game next year.While much has been said about technology companies coming for TV advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino said the companies were \u201creally coming for TV content.\u201d She pointed to Twitter\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s deals with the N.F.L. and YouTube\u2019s new ad-supported shows with stars like Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres.\u201cReally, you just can\u2019t snap your fingers and invent that,\u201d she said of premium content.And that is why she believes her focus on aligning with tech companies and reaching a large number of people on a variety of platforms will pay dividends.\u201cIt\u2019s about real audiences, real people who buy stuff, because they experienced your content all throughout the day,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we can do that, then we can really compete with the Google, Facebooks, Twitter, etc., etc., or whoever\u2019s next of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 70.His death was confirmed by Eric Sliz of the Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.Mr. Hampton, who for years called himself \u201ccolonel\u201d before officially adding the abbreviated title to his name in 2000, collapsed onstage at the Fox Theater in the waning moments of a concert in honor of his 70th birthday.He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, Mr. Budney said.The band\u2019s music was an unusual and, for many listeners, bewildering mix of elements, from the blues to avant-garde jazz to Mr. Hampton\u2019s growling vocals. Critics, Mr. Palmer wrote, called its music \u201ceclectic\u201d \u2014 meaning, he said, that it drew from a number of sources and they could not figure out what else to call it.The Hampton Grease Band released an album on Columbia \u2014 Mr. Hampton liked to claim that it was one of the worst-selling albums in the label\u2019s history \u2014 and opened for the Grateful Dead, the Allman Brothers Band and other nationally known acts. It was also known for its twisted sense of humor, which included playing practical jokes.The band once opened a concert for Three Dog Night by playing its own off-kilter versions of that group\u2019s hits, according to a report in The Times. The move elicited boos, and the Hampton Grease Band responded with a lengthy encore. They were, Mr. Palmer quoted a Columbia executive as saying, \u201cthe most outrageous group anybody here ever had to deal with.\u201dThe Hampton Grease Band broke up in 1973. In the decades that followed, Mr. Hampton would form or help form a number of other acts, including the Aquarium Rescue Unit, the Fiji Mariners and the Code Talkers. Along the way he became known as one of the seminal figures of the improvisation-oriented, genre-crossing jam-band movement.Friends and family said Mr. Hampton was also a mentor to many musicians, with a keen eye and ear for talent. His influence on groups like Phish, Widespread Panic and the Dave Matthews Band and his dedication to aiding young musicians\u2019 careers were, they said, perhaps the most lasting element of his legacy.Mr. Hampton\u2019s survivors include his wife, Sara, and a brother, Jim.Many of Mr. Hampton\u2019s associates also noted the seemingly appropriate end to his life.\u201cBruce was the only person I could think of who has ever played at his own funeral, because in essence, that\u2019s what he did,\u201d Scott McKinney, a bluegrass musician known professionally as Fudd who said that he had known Mr. Hampton more than 20 years, said in a telephone interview. \u201cBruce couldn\u2019t script it any better.\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Six years later, as Alitalia stumbled into debt yet again, the government engineered another rescue.But on Tuesday, even a papal decree would not have been enough to save Alitalia from what threatened to be its final stand, as Europe\u2019s most troubled airline filed for bankruptcy once more, this time amid signs that the government, and the Italian people, were fed up from providing life support.Like the Italian state, Alitalia has always been too big to fail. The carrier has already cost Italian taxpayers an estimated \u20ac7 billion over the decade.This time, officials say there will be no new bailout of the airline, which has been a fixture of the economy and one of Italy\u2019s largest employers since it was founded in 1947. No other carriers have come forward to express interest in taking it over, including Lufthansa, which had been cited as a possible white knight.After the Italian government approved the bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, Alitalia will be put into the hands of special administrators charged with devising a last-ditch plan to turn around the carrier within 180 days, sell it, or put it into liquidation.Company officials had said that in order to keep the carrier alive, adjustments were needed in the 12,400-strong work force, which operates about 120 planes and had 22.6 million passengers last year. By contrast, its low-cost rival Ryanair has around 11,000 employees for 300 planes and more than 100 million passengers.But when unions and management negotiated a rescue plan involving 1,600 layoffs, an 8 percent pay cut and more working days a year in exchange for \u20ac2 billion in new financing, employees rejected it.They seemed to be gambling that the state would come to the rescue, given the political and economic consequences of letting Alitalia collapse.In the meantime, the situation has outraged some Italians, who took to Facebook and Twitter to protest spending any more taxpayer money on top of the billions already doled out by the government.\u201cAlitalia bankruptcy is due to bad management and #ConsumerChoice. Italian state shouldn\u2019t give any money to save it,\u201d Luca Bertoletti, the European affairs manager at Consumer Choice Center, an Italian consumer rights organization, said in a message on Twitter.The Middle Eastern airline made new investments and financed a revision of Alitalia\u2019s business plan to compete better with low-cost carriers. But losses started to mount again in 2015, to nearly \u20ac200 million, as Alitalia failed to ward off fierce competition from low-cost airlines, and terrorist attacks in Europe hurt travel.Alitalia sought to recover this year with a plan to slash \u20ac1 billion in costs, cut 2,000 workers and reduce salaries by up to 30 percent. Unions negotiated all those demands down in a deal struck last month that would have released new financing.Instead, pilots and cabin crew rebuffed the accord, throwing Alitalia yet again into an uncertain future.\u201cIt seems that Alitalia workers have all gone nuts,\u201d Simone Filippetti, a finance and economy reporter at the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore, wrote in a column. \u201cWhy did they reject a plan that involved a hard sacrifice but a chance of recovering to instead face the risk of a total company disruption and liquidation, and ultimately all lose their jobs anyway?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Forget Taxes, Warren Buffett Says. The Real Problem Is Health Care.", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byDealBookOMAHA \u2014 \u201cThe tax system is not crippling our business around the world.\u201dThat was Warren E. Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, over the weekend at the company\u2019s annual meeting, known as \u201cWoodstock for capitalists.\u201dMr. Buffett, in a remarkably blunt and pointed remark, implicitly rebuked his fellow chief executives, who have been lobbying the Trump administration and Washington lawmakers to lower corporate taxes.In truth, Mr. Buffett said, a specter much more sinister than corporate taxes is looming over American businesses: health care costs. And chief executives who have been maniacally focused on seeking relief from their tax bills would be smart to shift their attention to these costs, which are swelling and swallowing their profits.It was clarifying to hear Mr. Buffett frame things this way. The need for corporate tax relief has become the lodestar of the corner office, with C.E.O.s rhapsodizing over President Trump\u2019s plan to try to stimulate growth by cutting tax rates for businesses.But as Mr. Buffett pointed out, these chief executives are missing the bigger issue \u2014 the one that should be their Holy Grail. As a percentage of our gross domestic product, the cost of maintaining our American health care system \u2014 hospitals, H.M.O.s, doctor visits, prescription drugs, medical devices, insurance companies, Medicare \u2014 is rising at an alarming rate. And Corporate America pays a big (and growing) chunk of the bill.We\u2019re not talking about the cost of health insurance, which is a fraction of the overall cost.Today\u2019s corporate tax rates, Mr. Buffett seemed to suggest, are a distraction, not a true impediment to growth.\u201cIf you go back to 1960 or thereabouts, corporate taxes were about 4 percent of G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cI mean, they bounced around some. And now, they\u2019re about 2 percent of G.D.P.\u201dBy contrast, he said, while tax rates have fallen as a share of gross domestic product, health care costs have ballooned. About 50 years ago, he said, \u201chealth care was 5 percent of G.D.P., and now it\u2019s about 17 percent.\u201dHis is one of the most cogent arguments for renewing attention on the underlying costs of our health care system \u2014 an issue far beyond the debate around the Affordable Care Act and what it is going to look like if it is repealed and replaced.Mr. Buffett said our global competitiveness had fallen largely because our businesses were paying far more for health care \u2014 a tax by another name \u2014 than those in other countries.At his annual shareholders\u2019 conference, which drew tens of thousands of people to Omaha, he gave a virtual seminar on the economics of health care that chief executives and lawmakers would be helped by hearing. He demonstrated in stark terms that the constant refrain from the business community about taxes should probably be redirected toward trying to bend the cost curve of health care.\u201cWhen American business talks about strangling our competitiveness, or that sort of thing, they\u2019re talking about something that as a percentage of G.D.P. has gone down,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWhile medical costs, which are borne to a great extent by business,\u201d have swelled.He is right: In 1960, corporate taxes in the United States were about 4 percent of G.D.P., which is probably the best way to measure the burden on businesses. Then the percentage fell steadily, reaching its bottom in 1983 before rising slightly over the last several decades. Today, it is 1.9 percent.In the meantime, health care costs as a percent of G.D.P. have skyrocketed, significantly diverging with those of other industrial countries. Our health care costs stand at 17.1 percent of G.D.P., up from 13.1 percent in 1995.The figure in Germany is only 11.3 percent, up from 9.4 percent during the same period. Japan\u2019s is 10.2 percent, up from 6.6 percent. Britain\u2019s health care costs are 9.1 percent of G.D.P., up from 6.7 percent in 1995. And China\u2019s is only at 5.5 percent, up from 3.5 percent.\u201cMedical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,\u201d Mr. Buffett said, using a metaphor he has employed in the past to describe the insidious and parasitic costs of our health care system.Mr. Buffett is a Democrat, but his business partner, Charles T. Munger, is a Republican \u2014 and a rare one who has advocated a single-payer health care system. Under his plan, which Mr. Buffett agrees with, the United States would enact a sort of universal type of coverage for all citizens \u2014 perhaps along the lines of the Medicaid system \u2014 with an opt-out provision that would allow the wealthy to still get concierge medicine.Our bloated health care system, Mr. Buffett asserted, is the true barrier to America\u2019s world competitiveness as well as \u201cthe single biggest variable where we keep getting more and more out of whack with the rest of the world.\u201dBut people don\u2019t talk about it enough. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough for political parties to attack it, but it\u2019s basically a political subject,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in reply to a question I had posed. (I was one of three journalists and three analysts who, along with shareholders, peppered Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger with questions during the meeting.)That\u2019s not to say corporate tax reform won\u2019t help, but it is tiny relative to fixing health care.Indeed, Mr. Buffett said, even if Washington put in place a tax credit for capital investment, he did not think that BNSF \u2014 the railroad company he owns, which spends billions on fixing rail tracks \u2014 would do its job faster or better because of the potential tax credit.\u201cI can\u2019t recall sending anything out to our managers saying, \u2018Let\u2019s do this because the tax law is going to change,\u2019\u201d Mr. Buffett said.Mr. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, added: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change anything at the railroad just for some little tax jiggle.\u201dNeither man, however, is expecting the bigger tax \u2014 health care \u2014 to be fixed anytime soon.\u201cOn this issue, both parties hate each other so much that neither one can think rationally, and I don\u2019t think that helps, either,\u201d Mr. Munger said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Writers Recount Stories of Grief and Joy in Illustrated Panels", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byGraphic LivesWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.At the age of 37, Teva Harrison was diagnosed with advanced metastatic breast cancer, an incurable disease. For a young person with a terminal illness, daily life is an existential crisis, compounded by pain and by the discomfort of fitting in among people to whom mortality remains an uncomfortable abstraction.\u201cIn-Between Days\u201d is part diary, part memoir, part self-help book. Harrison explains that telling her story through drawing was an act of taking back her power from her cancer, \u201cthe boogeyman.\u201d The stark black-and-white drawings, made with the encouragement of her therapist, have the urgency of fighting back. These are accompanied by pages of text, which elucidate them, but occasionally feel redundant \u2014 as though Harrison, or her editor, didn\u2019t quite trust the drawings, by themselves, to add up to a book.The book\u2019s strongest pages deal with social and medical aspects of life with cancer that are the hardest to talk about. Harrison writes and draws the brutal reality of medically induced menopause. She describes what pain management is like: when the constancy of pain must be balanced with the vigilance of narcotic addiction. She writes about the limitations of support groups, where she learns that \u201cthere are no atheists among the Stage IV cancer patients. \u2026 Except for me.\u201d One of the comics comments on the absurdity of being complimented on her cancer-related weight loss.A strip called \u201cTrying on Small Talk\u201d shows Harrison, whose course of treatment didn\u2019t cause her to lose hair or show any visible marks of sickness, attempting to answer the question \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d at parties. This is a fraught question for most people, and doubly so for her. Most people, Harrison writes, don\u2019t know how to talk about cancer or don\u2019t want to. But \u201cthere\u2019s a type of person desperate to talk about cancer: people who want to process the loss of a loved one. And let\u2019s get real. The last thing this cancer patient wants to talk about is dead cancer patients.\u201dUltimately, \u201cIn-Between Days\u201d is about learning to have a life under radically new conditions. Harrison discovers that hope survives in the face of death, that it is inherent to being human. A strip called \u201cActs of Hope\u201d shows bottles of a seven-step skin care regimen, a couple wearing seatbelts in a cab and a roll of recycled toilet paper \u2014 everyday expressions of belief in the possibility of a future. \u201cI hope that I can stay alive for science to find a way to sustain me for a long term,\u201d Harrison writes toward the end of the book. \u201cI am chock-full of hope, mostly because I need it to get through every single day.\u201dThe story begins in Baltimore, in 1941. A Jewish family is listening to Roosevelt\u2019s address on the radio, and the only person in the room who is \u201cnot panicking at all\u201d is the baby in a young mother\u2019s arms. This baby is Ellen Cohen, who would grow up to become Cass Elliot \u2014 a talented and passionately determined singer with a wicked sense of style and humor, a woman who keeps her spirit despite repeated rejection she faces for a single, cruel reason: She is fat, and she doesn\u2019t care to try to lose weight.Bagieu narrates Elliot\u2019s early life chronologically, from alternating points of view: of Ellen\u2019s little sister, her singing teacher, her best friend, her bandmates. A brilliantly affecting chapter is told by Ellen\u2019s adorable, if somewhat Jewishly stereotyped father, Phillip. Phillip is 42 years old and very recently dead. From beyond the grave, he watches Ellen attend his funeral, come home, undress, put his overcoat over her naked body, smoke a joint and curl up in her childhood bed. It\u2019s the tenderest depiction of grief. Phillip is Ellen\u2019s biggest ally, a person who taught her to love music. \u201cThat\u2019s how she is, my Ellen,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s untamed.\u201d Here, \u201cuntamed\u201d is unambiguously a compliment.The only person who loves Elliot more than her own father is P\u00e9n\u00e9lope Bagieu. Her drawings are suffused with delight, like when she shows Ellen\u2019s first singing lesson with her teacher, Shirley. \u201cShe had this kind of bulky body that she didn\u2019t know what to do with,\u201d Shirley says. \u201cAnd then. All of a sudden. There wasn\u2019t a body anymore. There was only that presence. And that voice. That voice!\u201d The sequence concludes with a full-page drawing of the stunned Shirley staring at the huge teenager in front of her, who\u2019d just finished a song, and now stands splay-legged, grinning and half-bowing.Bagieu\u2019s medium is graphite, and she uses its entire range of possibilities: from looping lines to richly built-up shadows that allow for lyrical depictions of snow, moonlight, cigarette smoke. Exuberance and sadness coexist in her drawing style, as they coexist in the character of Cass Elliot \u2014 whose every moment of joy and perseverance seems to overlay deep loneliness and vulnerability.Bagieu is a deft and generous storyteller. She is funny, but she also brings an emotionally unflinching French sensibility to writing about relationships. The book ends in the mid-1960s, as the Mamas and the Papas achieve fame, and a 24-year-old Cass is finally accepted as a true member of the group. Yet the highly dramatic final chapter also makes it clear that it\u2019s also the beginning of their end.I have no idea how close Bagieu\u2019s reimagining is to the real events of Elliot\u2019s life, or if the Mamas and the Papas nerds would argue with her interpretation. All I know is that it made me fall in love with Bagieu\u2019s Elliot, an irrepressible woman who persisted in a hostile world.Kristen Radtke\u2019s memoir, \u201cImagine Wanting Only This,\u201d tells a story of the young writer\u2019s growing fascination with ruins and abandoned places, as she attempts to come to terms with death. Radtke may or may not have the heart condition that caused the early death of her uncle, and, as she travels to ruined sites, she explores the metaphoric link between deteriorating human hearts and collapsing buildings.It\u2019s futile to describe a book by recounting its plot, and this is especially true in this case. Radtke is, first and foremost, a superhuman of illustration, a grandmaster like Adrian Tomine or Chris Ware. Her photo-based, exquisitely executed drawings appear more realistic and seductive than photographs could ever hope to be. Close-ups of hands and faces alternate with expansive landscapes painted in delicate shades of gray, a ray from a flashlight pierces the night, birds swoop up into the sky in silhouette, a ceiling fan morphs into an airplane in the eyes of an insomniac. Not a line is out of place in these drawings, as they depict contemporary reality with uncanny precision. Photographs and films play an important role in the book, and when Radtke uses sequences of subtly changing images to draw time, the sensory experience of \u201cImagine Wanting Only This\u201d becomes almost cinematic.As a storyteller, Radtke is most inventive when she focuses on a single personal insight. Traveling in Europe with her boyfriend, feeling vaguely oppressed and bored with tourist sites, she begins to imagine each of their destinations as a photograph on the wall of their future house. In her drawing of the wall, the travel photos are fully rendered, while the other picture frames contain outlines: one of their future wedding, one of their future children.At times, \u201cImagine Wanting Only This\u201d thins out into a travelogue. This is particularly true of the middle section, where Radtke is traveling through Asia with her friend Mary Helen, who never really emerges as a character. The drawings feel hurried, and there seems to be a lack of personal stake, of narrative tension. Radtke\u2019s poetic language becomes diffuse and begins to resemble platitudes. When she uses first person plural to add gravity to her words, it reads, instead, as a lack of commitment. \u201cWe forget that everything will become no longer ours,\u201d she writes. Do we forget? Who are \u201cwe\u201d?By the end of the book, Radtke is living in New York. \u201cNow I live in a city the news tells me might someday soon be underwater,\u201d she writes. \u201cI like to imagine what this will look like. We all do it. Fantasize disaster.\u201d In the gorgeously eerie drawings that accompany these words, a shark swims between skyscrapers, Grand Central Terminal is flooded, water rushes down the subway stairs and the Manhattan Bridge rises from the bottom of the sea. Whether or not \u201cwe all\u201d fantasize disaster, with Hurricane Sandy still fresh in my memory, I was taken aback by these highly aestheticized depictions of my city\u2019s watery demise. Although earlier in the book Radtke acknowledges the critique of urban exploration and \u201cruin porn\u201d as voyeuristic, on these pages beauty hardens into a cold surface, and Radtke seems like a voyeur in her own life. But this might be the point. As Radtke attempts to engage with an immense idea that is beyond most people\u2019s grasp \u2014 how to live when all things come to an end? \u2014 what ultimately emerges is a portrait of a powerful mind grappling with alienation and loneliness.When Orli Auslander became a mother, she began to feel \u201cbad\u201d (or, rather, guilty) about so many things that she was compelled to keep lists of, and eventually to illustrate, all the things that she felt bad about. The resulting collection of drawings belongs to the brand of humor whose main gag is that mothers are human, rather than perfect. Since \u201cperfect mother\u201d is a construct that even the guiltiest and most privileged of parents don\u2019t really believe exists, the survival of the gag depends on upping the ante, of being ever more \u201chuman\u201d \u2014 that is, more unconventional, more sloppy, more benignly neglectful, more potty-mouthed \u2014 than your predecessors. With \u201cmother is human\u201d themes, like the Mommy Drinks Wine and Swears franchise, proliferating on Facebook for years, this is a difficult task. Many of the things Auslander feels bad about are tame on the scale of upper-middle-class-mom pseudo-guilt: She is high-maintenance, she is competitive, she feeds her kids too much sugar, she lets her 6-year-old listen to Eminem, she buys her kids too many toys. Occasionally though, she goes dark and specific, transcending the theme. One senses that at these times, she really doesn\u2019t feel cute, as in \u201cI Feel Bad No. 40\u201d: \u201cI had the vet rip out my dog\u2019s uterus and ovaries and she\u2019s been incontinent ever since.\u201d In the drawing, the dog looks on ruefully, an unprintable curse above its head. \u201cI Feel Bad No. 29,\u201d \u201cI encouraged my brother to find God,\u201d shows an Orthodox Jewish man surrounded by 10 children, all screaming and brawling. One little boy has a girl on a leash (or is it a chain?), a collar around her neck.Anya Ulinich is the author of the novel \u201cPetropolis\u201d and the graphic novel \u201cLena Finkle\u2019s Magic Barrel.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Facebook Make You Miserable", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byIT is now official. Scholars have analyzed the data and confirmed what we already knew in our hearts. Social media is making us miserable.We are all dimly aware that everybody else can\u2019t possibly be as successful, rich, attractive, relaxed, intellectual and joyous as they appear to be on Facebook. Yet we can\u2019t help comparing our inner lives with the curated lives of our friends.Just how different is the real world from the world on social media? In the real world, The National Enquirer, a weekly, sells nearly three times as many copies as The Atlantic, a monthly, every year. On Facebook, The Atlantic is 45 times more popular.The Las Vegas budget hotel Circus Circus and the luxurious hotel Bellagio each holds about the same number of people. But the Bellagio gets about three times as many check-ins on Facebook.The search for online status takes some peculiar twists. Facebook works with an outside company to gather data on the cars people actually own. Facebook also has data on the cars people associate with by posting about them or by liking them.Owners of luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedeses are about two and a half times as likely to announce their affiliation on Facebook as are owners of ordinary makes and models.In the United States, the desire to show off and exaggerate wealth is universal. Caucasians, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are all two to three times as likely to associate on Facebook with a luxury car they own than with a non-luxury car they own.On Facebook, though, men seem to underplay their interest in artists considered more feminine. For example, on Spotify, Katy Perry was the 10th most listened to artist among men, beating Bob Marley, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Wiz Khalifa. But those other artists all have more male likes on Facebook.The pressure to look a certain way on social media can do much more than distort our image of the musicians other people actually listen to.Sufferers of various illnesses are increasingly using social media to connect with others and to raise awareness about their diseases. But if a condition is considered embarrassing, people are less likely to publicly associate themselves with it.Irritable bowel syndrome and migraines are similarly prevalent, each affecting around 10 percent of the American population. But migraine sufferers have built Facebook awareness and support groups two and a half times larger than I.B.S. sufferers have.None of this behavior is all that new, although the form it takes is. Friends have always showed off to friends. People have always struggled to remind themselves that other people don\u2019t have it as easy as they claim.Think of the aphorism quoted by members of Alcoholics Anonymous: \u201cDon\u2019t compare your insides to other people\u2019s outsides.\u201d Of course, this advice is difficult to follow. We never see other people\u2019s insides.I have actually spent the past five years peeking into people\u2019s insides. I have been studying aggregate Google search data. Alone with a screen and anonymous, people tend to tell Google things they don\u2019t reveal to social media; they even tell Google things they don\u2019t tell to anybody else. Google offers digital truth serum. The words we type there are more honest than the pictures we present on Facebook or Instagram.Sometimes the contrasts in different data sources are amusing. Consider how wives speak about their husbands.On social media, the top descriptors to complete the phrase \u201cMy husband is \u2026\u201d are \u201cthe best,\u201d \u201cmy best friend,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cthe greatest\u201d and \u201cso cute.\u201d On Google, one of the top five ways to complete that phrase is also \u201camazing.\u201d So that checks out. The other four: \u201ca jerk,\u201d \u201cannoying,\u201d \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cmean.\u201dWhile spending five years staring at a computer screen learning about some of human beings\u2019 strangest and darkest thoughts may not strike most people as a good time, I have found the honest data surprisingly comforting. I have consistently felt less alone in my insecurities, anxieties, struggles and desires.Once you\u2019ve looked at enough aggregate search data, it\u2019s hard to take the curated selves we see on social media too seriously. Or, as I like to sum up what Google data has taught me: We\u2019re all a mess.Now, you may not be a data scientist. You may not know how to code in R or calculate a confidence interval. But you can still take advantage of big data and digital truth serum to put an end to envy \u2014 or at least take some of the bite out of it.Any time you are feeling down about your life after lurking on Facebook, go to Google and start typing stuff into the search box. Google\u2019s autocomplete will tell you the searches other people are making. Type in \u201cI always \u2026\u201d and you may see the suggestion, based on other people\u2019s searches, \u201cI always feel tired\u201d or \u201cI always have diarrhea.\u201d This can offer a stark contrast to social media, where everybody \u201calways\u201d seems to be on a Caribbean vacation.As our lives increasingly move online, I propose a new self-help mantra for the 21st century, courtesy of big data: Don\u2019t compare your Google searches with other people\u2019s Facebook posts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Vegetable Forward\u2019 Chef Gets His Own Patch at Loring Place", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.ABC Kitchen signified a small turning point in the appetites of New Yorkers when it opened seven years ago. We had snuffled through much of the previous decade in search of pork shoulders, lamb belly, rib-eyes and marrow bones, and if we didn\u2019t exactly wake up on the first day of 2010 doubled over with regret, some of us were starting to wonder why the bed smelled like bacon.Mr. Kluger wasn\u2019t cooking health food, not with that mayo-spritzed cheeseburger. But a sizable chunk of the nearly 50 dishes were salads or saladlike constructions. Vegetables were everywhere, including on top of the whole-wheat pizzas. The plates jangled with flavor, and very little of it came from animal fat. We might have called the food \u201cvegetable forward\u201d if that term had been invented.When diners stood up at the end of the night, you could almost hear them sighing with relief that they\u2019d had an entire meal in a hot downtown restaurant without eating lard.Yes, these hard surfaces amplify the noise. Yes, they\u2019re trying to fix it.There are more salads at Loring Place, and the saladlike constructions are even more saladlike. At the end of winter, I loved the combination of crisp Bosc pears with soft roasted leeks over thick yogurt, and some sugar-glazed walnuts for ballast. A couple of weeks ago, with pollen in the air, I appreciated the arrival of sweet sugar snap peas, lightly charred and served with bright pink breakfast radishes and shreds of pecorino.In this herbivorous decade, Loring Place isn\u2019t the only restaurant to try grinding flour from local grains, or the only one to get mixed results. The emmer crackers, armored with sunflower seeds, are terrific with a schmear of the excellent and lightly sweet hummus. So are the breakfast radishes lodged in the surface of the hummus.A friend who knows her grains looked dubious when I ordered the house-made whole-wheat spaghetti. I was skeptical, too. (It is almost never as good as it sounds.) Loring Place gets it right, though, and lets it be, tossing it with basil, chiles, grated cheese and some velvety leaves of spinach.The whole-wheat bread, on the other hand, isn\u2019t quite at the point where Loring Place should be charging $6 for a loaf smaller than a football. The crust is impressively sturdy, but the interior is neither tender nor elastic \u2014 it\u2019s dry and crumbly.I liked the whole-wheat pizza crust enough to wish it had been allowed to breathe a little more under a mass of shaved asparagus, maitake mushrooms, jalape\u00f1os and three kinds of cheese.Its only close rival on the menu is the cheeseburger, which comes with bacon made on site, a likably combative pickled-pepper aioli and a cast-iron pan of thick-cut fries that seem to get crunchier as they got cooler, a neat feature.I don\u2019t imagine Mr. Kluger wants us to think of Loring Place as a place for cheeseburgers and square pizza, but a lot of the other main courses aren\u2019t as compelling for one reason or another. Halibut with a market\u2019s worth of mixed mushrooms in miso and lemon juice was an ideal example of how to cook and serve fish, but I can\u2019t say the same about the nondescript king salmon or the sea scallops in a sauce whose naked acidity was intensified by apples marinated in vinegar.Grilled chicken breast with carrot barbecue sauce sounded more exciting than it was; the sauce never kicked in hard enough to rouse the warm peas and rice that seemed to have settled down under the chicken for a long winter\u2019s nap.As much as I want to take Loring Place on its own terms, the menu makes comparisons with ABC Kitchen inevitable, and Loring Place comes off as slightly less interesting. It\u2019s not just that a lot of it feels familiar now; some of it is also unfocused and busy. The plates have more going on, but there\u2019s not as much happening.To be fair, very few restaurants are as interesting as ABC Kitchen was when it opened, and there are solid reasons that reservations at Loring Place are hard to come by. They include the wine list, which packs a few nice surprises, not the least of which is the attention it pays to the $40 to $60 range. And they continue through the smartly nostalgic dessert menu. There\u2019s a sly update on the Hostess CupCake, a tin of cookies, and a vanilla ice-cream sundae with pretzels, toffee and whatnot, modeled on the Dairy Queen Blizzard.An earlier version of this article misstated an ingredient in the whole-wheat spaghetti dish. It contains basil, chiles, grated cheese and spinach; there is no tomato.A review last Wednesday about Loring Place misidentified the firm that designed the restaurant\u2019s interior. It is Cycle Projects, not Cycle Architecture & Planning.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResycookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australian Senator Breast-Feeds in Parliament, and the World Notices", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 With the complete disregard for politics that is a characteristic of youth, Alia Joy Gates made her position clear: She would not wait to be breast-fed. It did not matter that her mother, Senator Larissa Waters, had work to do in the chamber of the Australian Senate.She was 11\u00bd weeks old and, for crying out loud, a girl\u2019s gotta eat.Ms. Waters said in an interview that she was a bit stunned by the reaction.\u201cBreast-feeding is a normal and natural thing that women have been doing since time immemorial, and in that sense, it\u2019s quite strange to me that it caused such a sensation,\u201d she said during a break from voting in the Senate. \u201cWhat it really says is that we need more young women in Parliament so that when we breast-feed our babies, it\u2019s not considered news.\u201dThe response, not unlike what occurred after a lawmaker in Iceland was photographed breast-feeding while defending a bill in the country\u2019s Parliament, reflects the degree to which maternal functions are still considered bold and political acts in institutions dominated by men.Even as the sight of women publicly breast-feeding has become more common in many places around the world, mothers are still often publicly shamed, which has, in turn, provoked a backlash from mothers that has gone global.In Australia \u2014 where 73 women serve in Parliament, representing 32 percent of all federal lawmakers, compared with 19 percent in the United States Congress \u2014 the issue of child-rearing and lawmaking has come up before. In 2003, Kirstie Marshall, a lawmaker in the state of Victoria, was asked to leave the state\u2019s Parliament for breast-feeding her 11-day-old baby because of a rule that bans \u201cstrangers\u201d or unelected members in the house (presumably including infants).Last year, after a previously failed attempt, Australia\u2019s federal Parliament changed its rules to allow for breast-feeding and at least some family contact.Ms. Waters \u2014 an Australian Greens party member, like Ms. Hanson-Young \u2014 said she figured that at some point she might end up taking advantage of the new rule. But she did not think much about it this week as the budget debate dominated the chamber\u2019s discussion.\u201cI just accepted that when the baby was hungry, I would feed her,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if that so happened to be when I was in the chamber, I knew that was permissible, and I didn\u2019t really think much beyond that, to be honest.\u201dIn the Senate, the response was muted. Most lawmakers said nothing or praised Ms. Waters afterward, though one conservative lawmaker made a comment about the Greens party wanting to take home wounded possums and \u201csuckle them back to health,\u201d which struck Ms. Waters as inappropriate.\u201cThat was about half an hour after I\u2019d given her a feed, and I thought that was in very poor taste,\u201d she said.And some outside the chamber accused her of seeking publicity.Still, breast-feeding fights, in the senator\u2019s view, seemed to be a bit, well, boring. After praising her husband, Jeremy Gates, who left a job in digital marketing to be a stay-at-home father, Ms. Waters said that she looked forward to focusing on lawmaking, even while breast-feeding.\u201cWe can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd whilst you need support in order to juggle the job of being a parliamentarian and a mom, we are perfectly capable of performing that juggling act generally when we have great family support, which I\u2019m lucky to have.\u201dAs she spoke, a tiny coo could be heard in the background. Then an itty-bitty cry.Was Alia there? I asked.\u201cYeah, she\u2019s just been having a feed while we\u2019ve been talking,\u201d Ms. Waters said. \u201cI\u2019m multitasking.\u201dTacey Rychter and Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from Sydney.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Few in St. Louis Knew Confederate Memorial Existed. Now, Many Want It Gone.", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byST. LOUIS \u2014 The angry, divisive fight over public symbols of the Confederacy has swept through Columbia, S.C., Birmingham, Ala., and New Orleans. This week, the debate made its way some 600 miles north, up the Mississippi River, to St. Louis, the home of a Confederate memorial many residents did not know was in their midst.Here in a graceful public park stands this city\u2019s own grand monument to the Confederacy, a 32-foot-tall granite column adorned with an angel and bronze sculpture of a stoic group of figures. It rises in a thicket of trees, next to a trail teeming with runners, bicyclists and wanderers.Many residents said that until very recently, they had no idea that the 103-year-old memorial honored Confederate soldiers.\u201cNot till they started making all that hoopla over it,\u201d said Larry Randall, 54, who was setting off on a bike ride one afternoon this week in front of the memorial. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming out here for years. I never paid it no mind.\u201dMr. Randall, who is African-American, said he understood why some people are now calling for it to be removed. \u201cIf it\u2019s causing problems, then they should get rid of it. Or maybe just polish the words off,\u201d he said. \u201cI could give a hoot.\u201dThis monument has emerged from obscurity in the last few weeks, as four prominent memorials to the Confederacy and its aftermath in New Orleans were pulled down amid protests. The debate has rippled across the South. On Wednesday, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama signed a measure that blocked the \u201crelocation, removal, alteration, renaming or other disturbance\u201d of \u201carchitecturally significant\u201d monuments that have been on public property for at least 40 years. In Hampton, Ga., a museum said on its Facebook page that it would close next week after a county official asked that it remove all Confederate flags from its building.Here, a vocal group of activists has turned its attention to this city\u2019s Confederate Memorial, arguing that it, too, should be carted away, out of its prominent place in Forest Park, one of the most beloved public spaces in St. Louis.The antimonument activists have a powerful lineup of city officials on their side, including Lyda Krewson, the newly elected mayor of St. Louis, who said that she favored removing the Confederate Memorial from the park permanently.\u201cMy own opinion is that it is hurtful,\u201d Ms. Krewson, who is white, said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIt reveres something that, you know, we\u2019re not proud of.\u201dShe passes the memorial during her weekly drive to the grocery store, usually with her 9-year-old son in tow. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is set the record straight,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Confederates, in my opinion, were traitors. And in this country, we honor patriots.\u201dOther St. Louisans are resisting the move, arguing that removing it would be tantamount to blotting out the history of the Civil War. Some have said that the enormous monument is too heavy and expensive to move, particularly when it doesn\u2019t have an obvious new home. Still others say that the monument has rarely attracted attention for more than a century \u2014 why should St. Louis be caught up in a debate that, in their view, belongs to the Deep South?\u201cMy first choice would be that everyone forget it was there, like before,\u201d said George Stair, 77, who paused at the monument on an evening walk with his wife, Jane Yu, who agreed that it should stay.Mr. Stair gazed at the sculpture. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s O.K. to honor ordinary soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople went to Vietnam even though they didn\u2019t agree with it.\u201dMissouri, once a slave state, was torn between North and South during the Civil War, a border state where families and neighbors sympathized with warring sides and were often pitted against one another.\u201cIt was a divided state, which explains why we have so many of these problems here today,\u201d said Mark L. Trout, the executive director of the Missouri Civil War Museum outside St. Louis. (Mr. Trout said his museum would be happy to accept the memorial as a gift, though he did not have a place for it to be displayed at the moment.)One opponent of the statue, Amy Maxwell, said that people from both groups were carrying handguns, and at one point someone snatched the Confederate flag and ran off, instigating a chase from the pro-monument group.Sometime during the night, the monument was spray-painted in blue with the phrases \u201cThis is treason\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Workers were seen on Wednesday morning removing the words.Out for a run on Wednesday, Ms. Maxwell, a 22-year-old student at Saint Louis University, paused in front of the memorial, stepped around the metal barriers and spat on it.Ms. Maxwell, who is white, said she planned to demonstrate every week until it is removed. \u201cIt would be nice to have some black abolitionists memorialized in this city.\u201dDorothy Bohnenkamp, 51, a psychotherapist who was born and raised in St. Louis, was taking her usual run in the park on Wednesday, directly past the memorial.She said she had rarely given the monument a thought until recently, when it appeared in the news, and was not cheering for its removal.\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t see where it represents anything specifically related to racism,\u201d Ms. Bohnenkamp, who is black, said. \u201cSo they take it down. What does that represent? It\u2019s still the same history.\u201dMs. Krewson, the mayor, said she would like to act quickly, drawing up a plan for removal within the next three weeks. She has seen cost estimates of close to $130,000, and envisions using a mix of public and private money for the project.For now, the memorial has become an object of curiosity in the park. Passers-by stopped to inspect the monument, snapped cellphone pictures and traced their fingers over the worn and stained surface.Ayana Parker, 12, was exercising with her mother, Shalonda Bolden, in the park when they paused to read the lettering on the memorial.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that it\u2019s honoring soldiers,\u201d Ayana said. Her mother gently explained that the memorial was honoring Confederate soldiers in particular.\u201cIt\u2019s for the people who wanted to keep slavery?\u201d Ayana said, her eyes returning to the monument. She grew quiet. \u201cOh.\u201dMs. Bolden said she didn\u2019t believe the memorial should be destroyed. \u201cThey should put it in a museum so people can get an explanation of what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201dAlan Blinder contributed reporting from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Dumplings to Hunt, by Way of Hong Kong", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Visitors to Hong Kong who have an appreciation for dumplings, an eye toward low prices and faith that a single Michelin star reliably predicts quality will tend to eat at one of two places. Those who are more attracted to Cantonese dim sum classics will almost certainly end up at a location of the locally based Tim Ho Wan chain. The ones whose idea of a perfect dumpling is a xiao long bao with hot broth sealed inside will head to a branch of Din Tai Fung, which was founded in Taiwan. The very hungry ones will go to both.Many items can be found for about the same price (nothing is over $6) in other dim sum parlors. Now that the lines have died down considerably, it\u2019s clear that the versions at Tim Ho Wan are good, but very few are throw-half-the-day-away good, and some have a rote quality that tends to creep into all but the most vigilant chains.True, the har gow wrappers are thinner than you expect, the shrimp inside firmer. The black bean sauce with steamed spare ribs tastes especially savory; the abalone sauce on the chicken feet a bit richer than the typical oyster sauce.The pan-fried turnip cakes contain flecks of dried shrimp that send their particular intensity in all directions. Soft as bread pudding inside, they are firmly seared, giving them an undertone of char and a hint of smoke somewhere off in the distance. The beef balls, under ragged veils of tofu skin, are the lightest and airiest I\u2019ve ever eaten.But the rice rolls, a point of pride for the chain, are white bogs of starch that blot out the underseasoned fillings of beef, pork or shrimp. I\u2019ve tried all three in New York, and they\u2019re never quite there, while the pork liver rice roll I tried at a Tim Ho Wan last month in Sydney, Australia, buzzed with ginger and scallions inside its thin and delicate wrapper.The barbecued pork buns, which make the Hong Kong airport location of Tim Ho Wan the first and last stop in town for some passengers, have been a work in progress in New York. The flaky pastry, somewhere between a Parker House roll and a Southern buttermilk biscuit, shows off Mr. Mak\u2019s finesse. The crackled surface, made of short crust dough blooped out of a pastry bag, doesn\u2019t taste like much but somehow makes the buns more exciting to eat.The trouble has been with the gooey, half-sweet filling. Back in January, there wasn\u2019t much of it, and it lacked conviction. In March, it was only slightly more sure of itself. This month, I finally had one that was richly flavored, well proportioned to the bun, and very hot.9 PhotosSteamed egg cake is another signature dish, or, as Tim Ho Wan puts it, one of the \u201cbig four heavenly kings.\u201d A square tan slice of it is so plain it looks like the last thing left on the table of a PTA bake sale, but it\u2019s consistently airy and wonderful, with its homey taste of molasses. It\u2019s not a dessert. It seems to go with everything on the menu.In Australia, the osmanthus jelly, which is a dessert, was a shimmering, translucent amber, saturated with the spring-fever flavors of peaches and flowers. The New York version has been rubbery, as dark as beef bouillon, and strangely bland. Far more appealing are the coins of French toast pressed together around a center of egg custard, a cross of two Hong Kong snacks bred expressly for the New York market.Mr. Chen\u2019s dumpling cooks wear masks over their mouths as they work behind glass at the end of the dining room, which gives them the air of fast-moving surgeons. The first thing you notice about their soup dumplings is that they are pretty. In other restaurants, they are baggy, saggy water balloons ready to spill their guts on impact. At Pinch, they stand upright like Hershey\u2019s Kisses, and their skins, though very thin, don\u2019t rupture when squeezed between chopsticks. A single dumpling fits quite comfortably in the mouth.Once you bite down, the broth that pours out is not as lip-smackingly gelatinous as it could be, but it\u2019s still rich and full of flavor. The best and most unusual is filled with chicken soup, and you wouldn\u2019t want it any thicker than it is. It\u2019s very good.As finely made as those are, I somewhat preferred the non-soup dumplings: the steamed half-moons stuffed with gingery flakes of fish; the ones with a dark core of minced mushrooms and truffles; or the pan-fried semicircles filled with juicy saut\u00e9ed beef, found only at lunch and brunch.Pinch also makes the best Sichuan won tons, shaped like clothesline ghosts and swimming in chile oil, that I\u2019ve tasted outside a Sichuan restaurant. Sean Tang, who owns Pinch with a cousin, Tony Li, and Mr. Chen, has said he wants the menu to be \u201cregion agnostic.\u201d Occasionally this results in stuff I might cook at home with a recipe from an American magazine, like the humdrum fried rice with steak or the pork ribs in cumin and chile seasoning. A magazine would call them Spicy Sichuan Ribs. They aren\u2019t.In general, though, the conceit works. Other Sichuan-style dishes, like the ma po tofu, make up in balance what they may lack in heat. From Taiwan, there\u2019s a highly credible three-cup chicken cooked with all dark meat (it makes a difference), as well as a hypnotically good stir-fry of cabbage with red chiles and thin slices of browned bacon.Snow Crab in a Chinese Restaurant has a generic name but a nongeneric flavor, with spicy black bean sauce over glass noodles and crab meat. The Wind Sand Chicken is a whole roast bird suffused all the way down with five-spice seasoning, then buried under a golden drift of fried garlic.It costs $45, which will strike Chinatown regulars as a large number. It will seem almost a bargain to anyone who eats in other restaurants that have wine lists like Pinch\u2019s, which takes in p\u00e9t-nats and skin-contact wines in styles from forbidding to friendly.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Twitter Is Being Gamed to Feed Misinformation", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAfter last year\u2019s election, Facebook came in for a drubbing for its role in propagating misinformation \u2014 or \u201cfake news,\u201d as we called it back then, before the term became a catchall designation for any news you don\u2019t like. The criticism was well placed: Facebook is the world\u2019s most popular social network, and millions of people look to it daily for news.But the focus on Facebook let another social network off the hook. I speak of my daily addiction, Twitter.Though the 140-character network favored by President Trump is far smaller than Facebook, it is used heavily by people in media and thus exerts perhaps an even greater sway on the news business.But the biggest problem with Twitter\u2019s place in the news is its role in the production and dissemination of propaganda and misinformation. It keeps pushing conspiracy theories \u2014 and because lots of people in the media, not to mention many news consumers, don\u2019t quite understand how it works, the precise mechanism is worth digging into.Here\u2019s how.One way to think of today\u2019s disinformation ecosystem is to picture it as a kind of gastrointestinal tract.At the top end \u2014 the mouth, let\u2019s call it \u2014 enter the raw materials of propaganda: the memes cooked up by anyone who wants to manipulate what the media covers, whether political campaigns, terrorist groups, state-sponsored trolls or the homegrown provocateurs who hang out at extremist online communities.Then, way down at what we will politely call the \u201cother end,\u201d emerge the packaged narratives primed for widespread dissemination to you and everyone you know. These are the hot takes that dominate talk radio and prime-time cable news, as well as the viral Facebook posts warning you about this or that latest outrage committed by Hillary Clinton.How do the raw materials become the culturewide narratives and conspiracy theories? The path is variegated and flexible and often stretches across multiple media platforms. Yet in many of the biggest misinformation campaigns of the past year, Twitter played a key role.Specifically, Twitter often acts as the small bowel of digital news. It\u2019s where political messaging and disinformation get digested, packaged and widely picked up for mass distribution to cable, Facebook and the rest of the world.This makes Twitter a prime target for manipulators: If you can get something big on Twitter, you\u2019re almost guaranteed coverage everywhere.For determined media manipulators, getting something big on Twitter isn\u2019t all that difficult. Unlike Facebook, which requires people to use their real names, Twitter offers users essentially full anonymity, and it makes many of its functions accessible to outside programmers, allowing people to automate their actions on the service.As a result, numerous cheap and easy-to-use online tools let people quickly create thousands of Twitter bots \u2014 accounts that look real, but that are controlled by a puppet master.\u201cBots allow groups to speak much more loudly than they would be able to on any other social media platforms \u2014 it lets them use Twitter as a megaphone,\u201d said Samuel Woolley, the director for research at Oxford University\u2019s Computational Propaganda Project. \u201cIt\u2019s doing something that I call \u2018manufacturing consensus,\u2019 or building the illusion of popularity for a candidate or a particular idea.\u201dHow this works for conspiracy theories is relatively straightforward. Outside of Twitter \u2014 in message boards or Facebook groups \u2014 a group will decide on a particular message to push. Then the deluge begins. Bots flood the network, tweeting and retweeting thousands or hundreds of thousands of messages in support of the story, often accompanied by a branding hashtag \u2014 #pizzagate, or, a few weeks ago, #sethrich.The initial aim isn\u2019t to convince or persuade, but simply to overwhelm \u2014 to so completely saturate the network that it seems as if people are talking about a particular story. The biggest prize is to get on Twitter\u2019s Trending Topics list, which is often used as an assignment sheet for the rest of the internet.Hundreds of accounts with few or no followers began tweeting links to the story. By the next morning, #SethRich was trending nationally on Twitter \u2014 and the conspiracy theory was getting wide coverage across the right, including, in time, Mr. Hannity.A Twitter spokesman said the company took bots seriously; it has a dedicated spam-detection team that looks out for bot-based manipulation, and it is constantly improving its tools to spot and shut down bots.What\u2019s more, because the media is large and chaotic, it is often unclear what role, exactly, bots play in ginning up interest in a story. Conspiracy theories went big long before Twitter was around. If you removed Twitter from the equation, wouldn\u2019t Sean Hannity have picked up the Seth Rich rumor anyway?\u201cHuman users didn\u2019t do a good job of separating bots from other humans,\u201d Mr. Ferrara said.Because they operate unseen, bots catalyze the news: They speed up the process of discovery and dissemination of particular stories, turning an unknown hashtag into the next big thing. A trending hashtag creates a trap for journalists who cover the internet: Even if they cover a conspiracy theory only to debunk it, they\u2019re most likely playing into what the propagandists\u2019 want.\u201cIf you can make something trend, you can almost make it come true,\u201d said Renee DiResta, a technologist who studies bots.And if that\u2019s the case, why believe anything?Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giving \u2018The Philanthropist\u2019 an Infusion of Youth", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 If you\u2019re going to revive a young man\u2019s play, why not cast it with young people? That seems to be the thinking behind the peculiar new West End production of \u201cThe Philanthropist,\u201d the Christopher Hampton play that was written when its author, now age 71, was 23. The director Simon Callow\u2019s revival is at Trafalgar Studios through July 22.Since its Royal Court debut, Mr. Hampton has won a Tony Award (for the musical \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d) and an Oscar (for \u201cDangerous Liaisons,\u201d adapted from his own play \u201cLes Liaisons Dangereuses\u201d), and has been feted as the English-language translator of Yasmina Reza and Florian Zeller \u2014 both of whom are Broadway and West End names.But in revisiting a play that received its own Tony nomination upon its 1971 Broadway premiere, Mr. Hampton has acceded to Mr. Callow\u2019s idea to cast the parts younger than usual, in some cases by a decade or more. (In an interview in the program, Mr. Hampton makes the point that his own script calls for actors of the generation sought by Mr. Callow, even if the received wisdom over time has aged the roles upward.)While the approach might be expected to enliven a bittersweet piece about an emotionally clotted academic named Philip (played here by Simon Bird) all but done in by his benign impulses, the result in practice lessens the import of a tricky text that needs delicate handling if it is to land. Itself an inversion of Moliere\u2019s \u201cThe Misanthrope,\u201d the classic account of a societal truth-teller who can\u2019t help but spread bile, \u201cThe Philanthropist\u201d considers how it might feel to be maligned for being agreeable. What happens when that same docile individual turns out to be nursing intensifying self-doubt?Its last London outing, at the Donmar Warehouse in 2005, delivered a stealthy but undeniable sting, due in no small measure to leading actor Simon Russell Beale\u2019s indrawn pathos in the central role. This time around, the bulk of the heavy lifting falls to Mr. Bird, who seems still to be circling the role of Philip, as if not yet entirely sure where he and it connect. (This is a production one can imagine gaining in assurance as the run continues.) An anagram-happy philologist who is engaged to one woman but ends up spending the night with another, Philip finds against expectation that his affability and decency prove an affront to others.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d appears to be Philip\u2019s default response to more or less any situation, his genial obtuseness a prompt for others to lay into him by return; even his fianc\u00e9e, Celia (a brittle Charlotte Ritchie), finds him \u201cas emotional as a pin cushion.\u201dProvoked to take a stand on something or merely to respond, Philip retreats behind his inoffensive veneer: \u201cI always like things,\u201d he maintains near the start, and it isn\u2019t until later that we clock the extent to which this character\u2019s greatest misgivings \u2013 anger, even \u2013 are reserved for the affectless man of words that is Philip himself.The actors tend to adopt one tone and stick with it. Playing a fellow academic don by the name of Don, Tom Rosenthal deliver his lines as if keeping time with some unseen machine gun, while Matt Berry as the vainglorious Braham \u2013 a novelist who revels in his own obnoxiousness \u2013 brays more or less throughout and makes one wonder what he might be like as Bottom in \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d The happy exception is the round-faced model and actress Lily Cole, whose nuanced portrayal of Philip\u2019s casually discarded Araminta hints at a tragic-seeming past that exists in marked contrast to Philip\u2019s hollowed-out present.Indeed, in a play defined by violence in the world just out of view \u2014 the prime minister, we\u2019re told, has been assassinated, along with most of his cabinet \u2014 Cole\u2019s Araminta suggests someone wise beyond her years who has known her fair share of upset, some of it quite shocking. Raising a long leg on to the sofa as if staking out her perch, her very presence testifies to the vagaries of experience, in contrast with a fleeting bedmate in Philip who has yet to live.If violence exists on the periphery of \u201cThe Philanthropist\u201d \u2014 and, in one startling instance, at its very center \u2014 the tone elsewhere on London stages is flat-out abject. \u201cWhisper House,\u201d the Duncan Sheik-Kyle Jarrow musical at The Other Palace through May 27, represents the first British outing for a venture that was introduced in San Diego in 2010 \u2014 between Mr. Sheik\u2019s two Broadway forays with \u201cSpring Awakening\u201d (2006) and \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d (2016).I can\u2019t imagine much onward life for its current iteration, if a recent sparsely attended matinee is any gauge. A ghost story set in and around a Maine lighthouse during World War II, Adam Lenson\u2019s production couples gloomy portentousness (the set looks like a cesspool) with much intoning of lines to the effect that we\u2019re \u201cbetter off dead.\u201d While the story of a young boy sent to live with his termagant of an aunt tips the musical terrain toward Benjamin Britten-infused pop, what\u2019s on view largely wastes a talented cast, who are forced to deal with lines like \u201cwe\u2019ll be like lighthouses, you and me.\u201d As musicals go, \u201cWhisper House\u201d is awfully wispy.At another point during \u201cWhisper House,\u201d we are informed that the world is ending, which probably wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to the restless, wild-eyed presence that is the actress Maureen Beattie, as she paces the intimate confines of the Royal Court Theater Upstairs in Simon Stephens\u2019s new play, \u201cNuclear War.\u201dAn experimental offering from the Tony-winning author of \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\u201d and \u201cHeisenberg,\u201d the play, which closed on Saturday, yoked its apocalyptic title to a dance-theater tone poem \u2014 a dramatic shard, really \u2014 spoken by Ms. Beattie. One thinks inevitably of Beckett, had the Irish master written about Facebook, waffles, and \u201cerotic zombies.\u201dFour black-clad performers, who appear masked or barefoot or both as required, engage in a sort of call-and-response with Ms. Beattie and flesh out what Mr. Stephens describes in the published text as a \u201cseries of suggestions for a piece of theater.\u201dInterpretation will vary, especially among those looking for some version of Armageddon to surface in Ms. Beattie\u2019s ruminations. Instead, the performance, directed and choreographed by Imogen Knight, struck an incantatory mood and elicited an expectant, respectful hush from its audience.I noted some relief, too, once the lights came up, that the evening\u2019s spectators were pleased \u2014 as anyone at a play entitled \u201cNuclear War\u201d would surely be \u2014 to be able to make their way toward another day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Europe\u2019s Election Season, Tech Vies to Fight Fake News", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 In the battle against fake news, Andreas Vlachos \u2014 a Greek computer scientist living in a northern English town \u2014 is on the front lines.As Europe readies for several elections this year after President Trump\u2019s victory in the United States, Mr. Vlachos, 36, is one of a growing number of technology experts worldwide who are harnessing their skills to tackle misinformation online.The French electorate heads to the polls in the second round of presidential elections on May 7, followed by votes in Britain and Germany in the coming months. Computer scientists, tech giants and start-ups are using sophisticated algorithms and reams of online data to quickly \u2014 and automatically \u2014 spot fake news faster than traditional fact-checking groups can.The goal, experts say, is to expand these digital tools across Europe, so the region can counter the fake news that caused so much confusion and anger during the United States presidential election in November, when outright false reports routinely spread like wildfire on Facebook and Twitter.Researchers have tried to learn from the United States\u2019 run-in with fake news, but the problem in Europe has mutated, experts say, making it impossible to merely replicate American responses to the issue.But with fake news already swirling around Europe\u2019s forthcoming elections, analysts also worry that technology on its own may not be enough to combat the threat.\u201cThere\u2019s an increased amount of misinformation out there,\u201d said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, a think tank in Riga, Latvia, that will hold a hackathon with local coders in May to find potential tech solutions to this trend. \u201cState-based actors have been trying to amplify specific views to bring them into the mainstream.\u201dNot everyone, though, has embraced Facebook\u2019s response.Since last year, Google also has funded almost 20 European projects aimed at fact-checking potentially false reports. That includes its support for two British groups looking to use artificial intelligence to automatically fact-check online claims ahead of the country\u2019s June 8 parliamentary election.\u201cWe\u2019re trying something new,\u201d Mr. Dieudonn\u00e9 said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy answer for this complicated issue.\u201dNot all potential solutions, though, are being driven by Silicon Valley\u2019s big beasts.Using a database of verified articles and their artificial intelligence expertise, rival groups \u2014 a combination of college teams, independent programmers and groups from existing tech companies \u2014 already have been able to accurately predict the veracity of certain claims almost 90 percent of the time, Mr. Pomerleau said. He hopes that figure will rise to the mid-90s before his challenge ends in June.\u201cThis is just Round 1 of what we want to do,\u201d said Mr. Pomerleau, who expects the teams to share their work with fact-checking groups worldwide. \u201cNext, we want to move toward multimedia content like videos.\u201dIn the rush to find solutions to fake news, some within the industry are taking a decidedly more low-tech approach.Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, recently started a crowdfunding campaign to create a news organization that would combine professional journalists with digital volunteers, who would contribute to reports in a way similar to how articles are created on Wikipedia.\u201cThe real impetus for this was fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to get behind topics, and then we\u2019ll hire staff to cover them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a role that Delip Rao previously had at Google. He was a researcher, not an executive.Advertisement"}

That is new.\u201dIs this the \u201cauthentic\u201d Mexican food that many admirers of the cuisine have tried to recreate? No. But the struggle over authenticity may be giving way to something more rewarding: a worldwide conversation about Mexican food that is respectful and inquisitive.How did Mexican food, often viewed by those beyond the country\u2019s borders as cheap, dull and heavy, move to being seen as artful, fresh and fascinating?\u201cIt began with more Mexican people being able to travel, with the internet, with a younger generation who started to care about food being fresh and healthy,\u201d said Gabriela C\u00e1mara, the chef and owner of several influential restaurants in Mexico City and Cala in San Francisco.Chefs were taught to prefer mediocre European ingredients, like frozen fish and dried morels, over excellent local ones.Much of the shift is due to her mentor, Enrique Olvera, who opened the ambitious restaurant Pujol in Mexico City in 2000, went to New York to open Cosme and Atla, and has become an international avatar of the possibilities of Mexican cuisine. Like Mr. Redzepi in Denmark and David Chang in the United States, Mr. Olvera is a chef who pushed his country\u2019s fine-dining transition from stuffy, Eurocentric and strict to creative, local and informal.There are plenty of complex, elaborate dishes in Mexico, like chiles in nogada or mole poblano, but Mr. Olvera decided long ago not to translate them into high-end restaurant food.\u201cIf you are going to cook those things, you\u2019d better get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cover of a really good song: When you\u2019re listening to it, you\u2019re really craving the original.\u201dSetting out to learn everything from real Oaxacan moles to traditional Aztec chocolate would have been impossible, he said \u2014 and for most customers, meaningless.\u201c\u2018Authentic\u2019 has become a very unimportant and irrelevant conversation for me,\u201d he said.Instead, Mr. Olvera took the training he had absorbed the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and began spinning his own threads of flavor, memory and technique. His most famous dish, cobia al pastor, recombines a traditional taco filling of fatty pork grilled with pineapple into a plump local fish fillet that is marinated in chile paste, then saut\u00e9ed in butter, served with a pur\u00e9e of caramelized pineapple and a crisp, palate-prickling dice of raw onion, cilantro and serrano chiles.Outside Mexico, Mr. Olvera\u2019s influence is greatest in the United States, where many young chefs, particularly Mexican-Americans, have made pilgrimages to his kitchen and are building on his style.Val Cantu, the chef at Californios in San Francisco, serves a tightly assembled menu of more than a dozen tiny, complex dishes based on Mexican ingredients. His homage to beans includes corona bean mousse, cranberry bean pur\u00e9e and black bean broth, topped with a dot of caviar and gold leaf. \u201cI like the contrast of the humble and the luxurious,\u201d he said.Not everyone does. Both restaurants have sometimes had to placate confused or outraged customers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people get up and leave halfway through the meal,\u201d Mr. Cantu said ruefully. \u201cThey say that this isn\u2019t Mexican food.\"But is it? \u201cI try to think of it the way the artist Bruce Nauman did,\u201d Mr. Cantu said. \u201cHe said, \u2018If I\u2019m an artist, and I am in my studio, the work I produce there is art.\u2019\u201cIf I am Mexican, and I am making food, that is Mexican food.\u201dChefs like Mr. Redzepi, however, cannot make such a tidy claim.Noma Tulum has proved controversial: The meal\u2019s $600 price, along with the optics of a European chef helicoptering in to show the world\u2019s wealthy gastro-tourists what Mexican food can be, has bruised some feelings.Mr. Redzepi says he is alert to the issues, does not pretend to be cooking Mexican food, and has made efforts to benefit the local community at every stage, including free meals for Mexican culinary students. But he is also firm that the price simply reflects the cost of the operation: construction, refrigeration, research, ingredients and the mass relocation of employees and their families (including Noma\u2019s on-staff personal trainer and several school-age children) for over three months.His interest in Mexico is not new or whimsical: The Noma Tulum menu extends from a core list of ingredients developed over dozens of visits to the Yucat\u00e1n, and honed by research trips around the country and work with Mexican chefs. Still, ingredients that are fundamental for Mexican cooks are unfamiliar to him, especially chiles.\u201cIn Denmark, we are all about dairy, acidity, fat and umami,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said. (At Noma, he said, where all the ingredients are native to the Nordic region, the kitchen doesn\u2019t even use black pepper.) \u201cTo discover this whole area of taste that is new to me \u2014 not just fresh chiles but dried and smoked, roasted and pickled \u2014 as a chef, it\u2019s extraordinary.\u201dIt should also be recognized that in parts of the country with less agriculture and fewer tourists, like Durango and Puebla, the culinary picture is not as rosy.And, he said, even chefs in Mexico have a long way to go in learning about the food of their own nation. From north to south, Mexico covers the same distance that exists between Ireland and Greece, and Mexican cuisine is not easy to draw a line around.\u201cChefs come here to have real cochinita pibil,\u201d he said, referring to the region\u2019s Mayan-style pit-cooked pig. \u201cAnd then they tell me that they like the one in Mexico City better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption in the accompanying slide show misstated the given name of the chef at Taco Mar\u00eda in Costa Mesa, Calif. He is Carlos Salgado, not Roberto.An earlier version of this article misstated the neighborhood in which the restaurant Atla is located. It is NoHo, not the Lower East Side.An article last Wednesday about the rise of \u201cmodern Mexican\u201d cuisine misidentified the hotel where the restaurant Ella Canta will open.

{"Headline": "\u2018It Made Me Into a Person With a Mission\u2019: Readers React to Motherhood", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported bySome mothers talked about the strains of caring for a newborn while suffering from postpartum depression and how the biological need to nurture remains, even after losing a child. Others, including fathers and adoptive parents, shared their perspectives on raising children.\u201cThe psychological experience described in my article affects new parents in all kinds of families,\u201d Dr. Sacks said. \u201cI thank the readers who pointed this out and enriched the discussion. Parenting is more than the oversimplified myth of bliss that has been idealized by our culture.\u201dBelow is a selection of comments that have been edited for length and clarity.Becoming a mother was the most transforming thing in my life. It made me, a party girl, a smoker and drinker, into a person with a mission \u2014 raise my son the best way I could. I read all child-rearing books I could find, I breast-fed my baby until, close to him being 1 year old, he refuse to take my breast anymore. He was too busy to do so. He was an easy baby and an amazing young kid and then a lovely youth.My husband and I raised him with immense love. We encouraged him to spread his wings and fly away, and to be absolutely sure that we would always be there for him to turn to.He is now a wonderful man.The only thing is, we never tried to have another child, fearing that one does not win the lottery twice. And we sometimes regret it.Right up front: I appreciate and deeply respect the experiences of the many caregivers discussing this topic. There are many ways to be maternal (and parental).However, the process of becoming a biological mother is more than a neat package of anatomical and psychological descriptors.My daughter (my third child) lived for just three hours after her birth. But for the following 12-18 months, my body wasn\u2019t part of that reality. On what felt like a cellular level, my body needed to be next to her, to touch her, to feed her, to nurture her ... because the biological process of gestation had made her as much a part of my own physical self as she had been in utero. No amount of talk therapy or \u2018getting on with life\u2019 could change that.It is this monumental \u2014 and irreducible \u2014 fact that sets \u2018bio-moms\u2019 apart from other superbly qualified parents.I\u2019m lucky. I had my baby in Germany. I had a very difficult time with the birth but this was tempered by the fact that I had an amazing suite of doctors, midwives and nurses, who all worked together and placed just as much importance on the well-being of the mother as they did the baby.In Germany, every woman has the right to a midwife who visits you at home for weeks afterward (fully paid by insurance). With all my reading, I still had a million questions and she was there to answer them and check on the progress of my baby. Nobody in Germany expects that mothers are superheroes. Most take a year off, and get supplemental money from the state. I used to snicker a bit at this. Then I had a baby.12 weeks postpartum came and when I pictured having to leave him in day care, the tears streamed down my face. I was lucky, as I worked part-time from home and hired a nanny for 10 euros/hr to help me. When he was screaming and I knew there was nothing I could do, I did not feel guilty handing him over to her for a much-needed mental break.My grandmother said, a good mother is always a little bit selfish. The U.S. needs to support parents far more than they do \u2014 children are our collective future.My life was transformed when I became a father. Something I still don\u2019t really understand happened when my daughter was born and I started giving her those middle of the night feedings. That\u2019s when my experiences decades earlier during the war began returning \u2014 some strange sort of veil was ripped away. And that\u2019s when I had to confront my legacy from my father, and decide that I couldn\u2019t raise my child the way he raised me.Becoming a mother through adoption is transformative, too, and this article ought to have at least mentioned it, because the adjustment \u201cpostpartum/ante-bonding\u201d issues are similar, yet greatly compounded by society\u2019s view that adoption is \u201cnot as good\u201d as \u201cthe real thing.\u201dAdoptive moms can be deeply depressed because grief over infertility traumas linger and the stresses of the adoption process are intense, because of the repressed guilt of having the privilege to take and love someone else\u2019s child, the huge responsibility to give that child \u201ca better life,\u201d the feeling that other people \u2014 especially biological moms \u2014 are watching you and your children especially closely, waiting to prove that \u201cbiological is better\u201d when you or the kids may falter in any public way (tantrums, school problems, troubles with authority, etc., that bio-kids struggle with as well), and because, in the case of transnational/transracial adoptions, people still don\u2019t believe loving a child who looks \u201cso different\u201d could possibly ever work.I commend the author for emphasizing that the transition to motherhood is psychologically very difficult for many women, even though they want with all their hearts to be a \u201cgood mother.\u201d Yet by not mentioning adoptive moms, she perpetuates society\u2019s view that they are somehow unreal, unnatural, less fit beings. Adoptive moms are working doubly hard \u2014 to become the mother they\u2019ve always wanted to be, and to be the mother the child\u2019s bio-mother could not be.I am a gay dad with twin sons, born through a process of IVF and surrogacy. I\u2019m the primary nurturer as well as the primary breadwinner. You know, juggle, juggle, juggle. In my own world, a number of close friends and more distant relatives and acquaintances seem quite interested in my own journey into \u201cmatrescence\u201d but I never see anything like it acknowledged in articles like this.While I accept that I belong to a tiny, tiny minority of parents, it still seems weird to me that articles like this equate \u201cmotherhood\u201d with conventional biological motherhood, and define out of the equation everyone else: women who adopt, women who use donated eggs, women who use their own eggs but have a surrogate carrier, women who use donated eggs and a surrogate carrier, stepmothers, women with blended families, etc. And not to mention men, who apparently have no emotional or physical involvement with raising children, and who apparently don\u2019t suffer from any of the constricted social roles and expectations that the article discusses regarding women.I waited 8 years to have a second child. I was terrified to repeat my postpartum experience, so in an effort to change my own perception of self-worth, I applied to a Ph.D. program during the last trimester of my second pregnancy.I was accepted only a few weeks after my daughter was born. The trick I played on myself worked. The overwhelming sense of being \u201cjust a mother\u201d never pulled me under as it had the first time.Still, I\u2019m 3 years into my program now and not a day goes by that I don\u2019t wonder if there might have been an easier way to slay that particular dragon...As a woman who has fostered 3 babies (who all were reunified with family) and is now 7 months pregnant with my first biological child, I think motherhood is what you make it.I felt like a mother when I fostered, and love those children dearly. I consider this new baby to be my 4th child, not my first. Yes, hormones are powerful. But the parental instinct is also powerful. Every parent struggles, but half the battle is making sure you use/build/develop your support network. Whether that\u2019s ice cream with a friend who\u2019s also in the trenches of parenting or a good therapist (or both).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Conservative Christian College Protest of Mike Pence", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byOn CampusBut the announcement that Mr. Pence would be commencement speaker this year drew considerable backlash. Alumni and students flooded administrators\u2019 inboxes with emails protesting the decision, and faculty members have called for boycotts. Many who oppose the decision say that hosting Mr. Pence will serve as an endorsement of the current president.This is an interesting crossroads for the school. Grove City is proud of its image as a steadfastly conservative Christian oasis in the increasingly liberal landscape of higher education. On campus, conservative politics and conservative faith usually go hand in hand. Students study the politics of Ronald Reagan and the literature of C. S. Lewis as well as the Bible.Most of us were raised in Protestant evangelical households, and more than 16 percent of the 2,500 students were home-schooled. Some students have had little exposure to popular culture or liberal politics. A few seem to see their conservative political affiliation as a ticket to eternal salvation.But the 2017 election exposed a rift between ideological and political conservatism. Evangelical voters have long demanded that politicians exemplify Christian character and morality in the public sector. In Donald Trump, however, evangelicals were confronted with a candidate who pledged allegiance to conservative ideals, but embodied none of them.Many of the issues evangelicals care about \u2014 marriage, abortion and religious liberty \u2014 are more dependent on a conservative Supreme Court than a conservative president. Divorced, disrespectful and domineering, Mr. Trump might not have been the first choice of many Christians, but he was certainly more likely than his Democratic opponent to advance cultural conservatism on the court.Plenty of young evangelicals I know, however, were not persuaded by that argument. Claire Waugh, a senior from Woodbridge, Va., told me that she refused in November to have a Trump vote on her conscience, and that she hates to see the country being \u201cled by a man who spews vitriol against anyone who is unlike him, a man who tries to invoke God\u2019s name when he is acting utterly ungodly.\u201dAnd for many on campus, Mr. Pence\u2019s reputation for being a very faith-oriented politician does not make up for his being Mr. Trump\u2019s vice president. \u201cIt baffles me that a Christian institution, that supposedly values every human life and facilitates Christian education and beliefs, would allow someone as divisive as Mike Pence to come speak,\u201d said Megan Baak, 22, a senior from Lancaster, Pa. \u201cIn an age where hate, violence, divisiveness and partisanship are so prevalent, I am shocked that Grove City would bring one of the most controversial political figureheads to our campus for graduation.\u201dLong before Mr. Pence tied himself to Mr. Trump, he was a good friend of Paul McNulty, Grove City\u2019s president. Mr. McNulty was deputy attorney general for three years under President George W. Bush, and he and Mr. Pence became particularly close after their wives met while working at the Christian school both couples\u2019 children attended. In announcing that Mr. Pence would give the commencement address, Mr. McNulty told our school paper that when his son died four years ago, the Pences \u201coffered amazing support\u201d to his family.Nobody doubts the strength of their friendship. But it is not a good enough reason to invite a member of the Trump White House to commencement. By being politically accommodating to the administration of a faithless man who enacts damaging policies, the school is sending graduates a message that undermines the intention of this institution.My hope is that Mr. Pence, as a Christian, will use his platform here to encourage graduates to apply their faith toward the greater good. Presumably, if he can harness his faith toward the same end, he may make a difference as a voice of reason and compassion in the White House. A Christian politician is not one who builds power by fueling toxic, fear-inflating rhetoric. Perhaps Mr. Pence can still break away from the chaos President Trump has cultivated.I have been taught to repent of fear, anxiety, defensiveness, mockery and anger. So, however na\u00efve as it may sound, I want to remain hopeful \u2014 both about Mr. Pence\u2019s commencement address and the direction he could take our country.Molly Wicker is a junior at Grove City College.Advertisement"}

But when you tell me that people are too fat to date, it really gets me down. Can you stop that, please?\u201d Fat shaming, be gone.But let\u2019s be candid. This route only silences him from voicing thoughts he will continue to think. (Is that enough for you?) To truly change his heart, you will have to engage him more deeply. \u201cAre you really saying that some extra weight makes a person inherently unworthy of a date with you? That\u2019s a pretty shallow view.\u201dMany people in your friend\u2019s position will claim mere personal preference.

Or maybe it\u2019s easier to find commonalities among the bad dates and avoid those. Just keep going. Each relationship unfolds in its own time. And when three dates in a row are duds, you have my permission to dump your half-awesome guy.A month ago, I invited three colleagues (with their spouses) to dinner at my house. I used group-text to invite them. Two replied immediately that they would love to come, but had to check the date with their spouses. The third never replied. The two who were checking never got back to me. The date is this weekend. My husband thinks they are all rude and I should cancel. I feel insulted. I was looking forward to dinner, but didn\u2019t write them again. I didn\u2019t think it was my responsibility. Any ideas?N.A.If it\u2019s any consolation, I hear this story nonstop \u2014 and not just with text invitations, but also those that come by email, phone and actual cards in the mail. Undoubtedly, you and your husband are correct: Your colleagues have behaved rudely, and writing again was not your responsibility. But look where standing on ceremony has left you: feeling insulted and disappointed.Next time, consider following up with a phone call (or another text, if you are wedded to the passive, digital approach). Exceeding your responsibility may make you happier in the end. Worth it! As for your current predicament, send a closing text: \u201cSorry the date didn\u2019t work.\u201d People are strange. The last thing you want is for them to show up unexpectedly at your door.An old friend suffered a terrible tragedy.

{"Headline": "As C.E.O. Pay Packages Grow, Top Executives Have the President\u2019s Ear", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "The top 200 chief executives, who make more than last year, are holding meetings with President Trump, who is considering rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations.Supported byPerhaps the pay surge reflects the times: Stocks are coming off a strong run. Unemployment is low. The economy is percolating.And President Trump is not only promising to roll back what he calls excessive business regulations but also listening keenly to what corporate America has to say. Since taking office on Jan. 20, the businessman-turned-politician has met with hundreds of executives, including at least 41 of last year\u2019s 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, a New York Times analysis shows.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Mr. Rutledge, 63, stormed to the front of the pack after closing his company\u2019s mega-merger, a $65 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller competitor.For that, he got a big bump in pay. The year before, his compensation totaled $16.4 million.This combination \u2014 the gains in pay for chief executives, the president\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut corporate tax rates \u2014 sets the stage for perhaps the most consequential moment for corporate governance since the financial crisis of 2008. Rising executive compensation only widens the gap between top executives and most American workers. Mr. Rutledge, for instance, made about 2,617 times the average American worker\u2019s salary of $37,632, according to figures maintained by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Discrepancies like that helped fuel the populist frustration that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, led to the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act.Yet the president\u2019s team is considering rolling back a Dodd-Frank rule that, starting next year, would make it much easier for employees at a publicly traded company to compare their own pay to the chief executive\u2019s.In the meantime, pay for top executives is reaching staggering levels. Mr. Rutledge\u2019s compensation swelled to $98 million largely thanks to a stock options award valued at roughly $78 million. The Charter board awarded Mr. Rutledge that grant, which runs through 2020, about a month before completion of its big merger in May 2016.Over all, technology company chief executives are well represented on the list of 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, along with executives from financial services companies and media companies. The best-paid female chief executive is Oracle\u2019s Safra A. Catz, whose total package was valued at $40.9 million, making her the eighth-highest-paid C.E.O. in 2016.Mr. Trump, who sees himself as the nation\u2019s C.E.O., is hardly the first president to savor the company of corporate executives. But he\u2019s made the pageantry of meetings with C.E.O.s at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has dubbed the southern White House, a priority during his first few months in office. The visits have become an opportunity for the president to trumpet the progress he says his administration is making in creating jobs and reducing regulations.But Mr. Trump may be getting a one-sided perspective on policy recommendations by spending so much time with a large swath of highly paid executives \u2014 at least 307 since Inauguration Day \u2014 whose views on taxes and economic inequality tend to differ from those of average Americans.Unleashing business by reducing regulations was the subtext of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s meeting on March 24 with Mr. Trump.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a lighter regulatory environment had enabled the company to commit to locating those new jobs in the United States over the next four years, and to spend billions on broadband infrastructure.What is clear from the Equilar study is that many C.E.O.s were doing quite well even before Mr. Trump took office. Average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives list \u2014 which changes from year to year \u2014 rose about 2 percent, to $19.7 million, from 2015. For the 200 specific individuals on this year\u2019s list, 2016 was especially kind. Those executives saw an average gain of 16 percent over what they received in 2015.On a percentage basis, Ronald D. Croatti at UniFirst, one of the nation\u2019s largest uniform manufacturers and distributors, had the biggest bump in pay last year. Mr. Croatti, 74, died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia, the company said. His pay package in 2016 rose 740 percent, to $17.69 million, according to Equilar.Steven Sintros, chief financial officer for UniFirst, said Mr. Croatti\u2019s large compensation package merely reflected the way companies are required to report the valuation of stock grants.In all, Equilar reports that the median salary for chief executives at all publicly traded companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion came in at $6.14 million, down slightly from $6.19 million in 2015.Elon Musk, the brash inventor and chief executive of Tesla Inc., clocked in with a $99.7 million pay package in the Bloomberg survey. But Mr. Musk did not appear in the Equilar survey because Equilar valued stock grants, even ones spread out over several years, at the time they were awarded, as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.The total compensation for Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric slid 33 percent in 2016, to $17.7 million, according to Equilar. His payout under the company\u2019s long-term compensation plan fell by about $6 million, and his annual bonus shrank by $1 million to $4.3 million, according to the company\u2019s proxy. In 2016, G.E. shares rose just 4 percent compared with 12 percent for the S.& P. 500.Mr. Immelt remained on the list, however. Notable extremely wealthy chief executives who did not appear include Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Both own enormous quantities of their companies\u2019 stock, but their compensation in 2016 was not high enough to qualify.The list also excludes executives who run big divisions but not entire public companies, even when they make more than the corporate boss.Digging deeper, Equilar found that Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart\u2019s online operation, had the biggest payout of all executives at publicly traded companies, earning an eye-popping $243.9 million in total compensation.His total pay was more than 11 times greater than the $21.8 million pay package awarded to C. Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive.Another big winner was Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google at Alphabet. Mr. Pichai got a compensation package worth just under $200 million. Like Mr. Lore, Mr. Pichai gets a small base salary and most of his compensation is in stock grants. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s board awarded Mr. Pichai stock valued at $198.7 million.By comparison, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, draws an annual salary of $1 a year. He hardly needs the salary: Forbes estimates the net worth of the co-founder of Google at $45 billion.The Equilar study points up a trend in compensation: Companies are increasingly moving away from cash bonuses and toward stock grants to reward top executives.Many large investors favor them because they give corporate executives an additional incentive to produce results that increase a company\u2019s share prices. Some critics, however, contend that stock grants and stock options can encourage executives to cut costs and take other short-term steps that don\u2019t invest in a company\u2019s long-term prospects.Supporters of stock grants are winning. Over the past five years, the median cash bonus awarded to the 200 best-compensated C.E.O.s declined to just under $3 million, from $3.37 million, according to Equilar. Meanwhile, the median value of stock awarded to those chief executives last year was $9.2 million.\u201cThe issue with cash bonuses is that they have become a given for most executives,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer with the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs. \u201cThere are still companies where they award the same bonus year after year, and the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect any value added.\u201dMs. Mastagni said a cash bonus \u201cis not money at risk,\u201d as is a grant of stock.The board at AMC Networks \u2014 which has produced hit television shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d \u2014 has decided to phase out the long-term cash award for its chief executive and other top executives. AMC\u2019s compensation committee decided that a stock award \u201cbetter aligns the interests of its senior officers with those of stockholders.\u201dBut in 2016, Joshua W. Sapan, AMC\u2019s chief executive, hit the daily double of sorts. Mr. Sapan got a big cash award of $15.1 million, which will become much smaller in 2018 under the board\u2019s policy. But he also got a big stock award, valued at $13.2 million, consistent with the board\u2019s new directive on corporate pay. In all, Mr. Sapan\u2019s total $30.5 million pay package soared 72 percent over 2015, even as the company\u2019s stock dropped nearly 30 percent last year.No matter how you look at it, the pay gap between corporate executives and most everyone else in America keeps getting bigger.Some 50 years ago, the typical chief executive made just 20 times what an employee did, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By comparison, it calculated that the average C.E.O. today made 347 times the average salary of an American laborer, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $37,632.Reversing this ever-widening pay gap is a union rallying cry, especially at companies that have been shedding jobs in the United States.Take Mondelez, the global snack company. Outside the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on May 17 in Chicago, union members protested its decision to eliminate 600 jobs at a local factory that makes Oreo cookies, and shift some operations to Mexico.\u201cMondelez is emblematic of everything that is wrong with our economy, which works for C.E.O.s, but not for working Americans,\u201d said Brandon Rees, who works in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Office of Investment.Irene B. Rosenfeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 2016 pay package valued at $15.8 million, according to Equilar, a decline of 13 percent. Michael Mitchell, a Mondelez spokesman, said the company\u2019s compensation program is \u201cwell aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201dBut Mr. Rees said the company\u2019s failure to hit certain performance targets, and a 13 percent decline in Mondelez revenue last year, accounted for the decline in her compensation, adding that her pay package was still too high. He said she had focused too much on cutting costs and share buybacks, and not enough on investments that would keep jobs in the United States.Amid populist anger over income inequality, the S.E.C. in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information in 2018 on the disparities between pay for chief executives and rank-and-file workers. That so-called pay-ratio rule would give investors and employees another metric for evaluating C.E.O. pay.The chairman of Business Roundtable is Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase and the 25th-best-compensated chief executive in the Equilar survey. His pay package rose 49 percent last year, to $27.2 million. Mr. Dimon, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s C.E.O. advisory group, visited the White House on Feb. 3 and has praised the president for awakening \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the economy.Alan Johnson, managing director of the pay consulting firm Johnson Associates, said he supports the opposition to the pay-ratio rule because it \u201cis a cooked-up thing to embarrass firms with a lot of part-time workers.\u201d He added that focusing on compensation leads to \u201cpay envy\u201d and does not do anything to address a fundamental problem, which is that average workers need better job training and job assistance programs.But Susan R. Holmberg, a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal public policy group, said that if the pay-ratio rule encourages employees to join unions, it is a good thing for workers, since it could lead to future wage gains.Mr. Trump \u201cran on this populist message,\u201d she said, and it is odd that the administration would be taking another look at the pay-ratio rule, because \"C.E.O. pay is the No. 1 populist issue.\u201dStill, there is some progress on the pay inequality front.This year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Equity Index Fund and the New York State Common Retirement Fund reached an agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company, to include new language on executive and employee compensation in its proxy statement. It says the company is taking a \u201cnon-elitist\u201d approach by awarding stock options to all of its 5,500 employees, not just to executives. The change has helped lead the union and the New York pension system to withdraw a proposed shareholder amendment on the issue of pay.Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokeswoman, said the revised language in the company\u2019s filings did not reflect a change in policy but a \u201cbroader effort to include more detailed and accessible language.\u201dAs for Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, his total compensation for 2016 was $28.2 million, almost 40 percent less than the year before, and nearly matching the 32 percent slide in the company\u2019s share price.Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said company boards need to be sensitive to issues of income inequality. \u201cI have no problem with someone doing well, who creates value,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think a company and a board as they look at compensation need to make sure everyone down the chain is also benefiting from the performance of the company.\u201dBoards need to consider not only how much top executives are getting paid, she said, but also whether rank-and-file workers are being compensated fairly too. The crucial question is this, Ms. Sheehan said: \u201cAre they investing enough in the human capital in the company?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia. He was 74, not 73.An article last Sunday about executive compensation misidentified a company that Charter Communications \u2014 whose chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge made the most last year among chiefs of 200 public companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion \u2014 took over. It was Time Warner Cable, not Time Warner.Kitty Bennett contributed research. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Not the Government, Is Building the Future", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut don\u2019t be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn\u2019t just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Answering Your Climate Questions", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byAt the end of the day, based on the scientific evidence I\u2019ve seen, weighed against the credibility of opposing counterarguments, with Pascal\u2019s Wager thrown in as a tiebreaker, the need and urgency for righteous behavior is a no-brainer.Hi Len,There\u2019s no need to convince me on your first two points. Our 45th president is a man who seems to regard rumor as fact, opinion as evidence, wishes as truth \u2014 and truth as whatever he can get away with. Hence the conspiracy theories about his predecessor\u2019s birthplace, the lies about the size of his Inauguration Day crowds, and so on. As for your reference to some evangelical voters, it\u2019s astonishing that so many in this country seem not to have gotten past the Scopes trial.And, lest there be any remaining doubts: I subscribe to the theory of evolution, I vaccinate my kids, I don\u2019t smoke because it causes cancer, the earth is not flat, and the world is warming.Now to your second paragraph: The human race is forced to confront multiple environmental threats with limited economic resources. We have to make hard choices about how we assess the threats and how we allocate the resources \u2014 knowing all the time that information is imperfect and economic and environmental conditions are subject to change over time. Climate change is one of those threats, but not the only one: think of malnutrition, \u201cordinary\u201d pollution, land mismanagement and so on. We need a serious debate not only about how to allocate those resources, but also about whether we have the tools right now to make a switch to less carbon-intensive energy sources in a way that doesn\u2019t impose its own set of grave and unanticipated economic and environmental problems.I\u2019ll offer some examples of what I mean in my answer to Susan Fitzwater\u2019s questions below.a) dropping fire insurance on our houses,b) refusing vaccinations for ourselves and our kids,c) dropping routine medical checkups,d) taking 50 percent of our retirement portfolios to the casino.I could go on and on. We might save a lot of money (or even make some at the casino!), but the potential for catastrophe is high enough that most of us would not take these risks.Hi Susan,As with my answer to Len, you\u2019ll get no argument from me. Insurance is prudent even when the risks are statistically rather small, such as the possibility of fire in a home. We should continue to invest in fundamental climate research and promising clean-tech, and we should redouble our investments in proven non-carbon energy sources, particularly next-gen nuclear power.But also as with my previous answer, my question is this: How much? Homeowners will buy fire insurance, but they\u2019ll also weigh the price in light of their overall needs. We need to hedge against prospective risks. We need to provide for current needs. The climate-advocacy community sometimes conveys the impression that all of this is not just necessary, but relatively straightforward and affordable. I wish it were that simple.In other words, to say we want to take out insurance for climate change is perfectly sensible. But whether we know we\u2019re buying the right insurance, at the right price, is less clear, and it behooves us to look closely at the fine print before we sign on.Hi Jason,Of course polling isn\u2019t science! It\u2019s an art, but one that increasingly is based on rigorously tested assumptions, sophisticated mathematical models, computer algorithms, behavioral analysis and so on. It\u2019s an effort to peer into the future under conditions of dynamic uncertainty. And, in that sense, it\u2019s not altogether different from climate modeling. The climate is an intensely complex system. Seemingly tiny differences in terms of inputs can make dramatic differences in terms of results. We should be humble about what we can know a year into the future, never mind a century, and we should be refining our assumptions continuously. That calls for more investment in science, not less.As for the polls being right, they were right in almost all respects \u2014 but the respects in which they were wrong made, alas, all the difference.Hi Nils,Interesting question, because it helps explain why so many people are drawn to the subject of climate change. To wit, it\u2019s not just a matter of pure science. It\u2019s also about morality, or at least a particular version of it. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always thought there\u2019s a quasi-religious dimension at work in climate-change advocacy, which not only describes the science but offers a catalog of prescribed (or proscribed) behaviors, and which tends to demonize people who aren\u2019t wholly in tune with their assumptions.Be that as it may, let me turn the question around on you. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s 100 percent true, but we make the world worse with the wrong response?\u201d My answer to Susan offers two examples in which hasty responses created unanticipated and damaging environmental consequences. After all, even if you\u2019ve diagnosed the cancer correctly doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t harm the patient with the wrong prescription. I\u2019m urging sensible readers to be thoughtful about this, to look before we leap, to be aware that \u201cdo something!\u201d may be satisfying as a moral reaction to a given problem but rarely makes for smart policy.Hi Elizabeth, On the contrary, it would have been more abrupt and expensive had we started earlier, because the technologies of the 1980s would have been inadequate for the needs of a modern society. It\u2019s only now that technologies are coming into play that allow us to develop large numbers of reliable, battery-powered cars, to use one example.For yet another example of what I mean, consider Germany\u2019s \u201cenergy revolution,\u201d an incredibly ambitious bid by Angela Merkel\u2019s government to wean itself from fossil fuels. An in-depth report in Der Spiegel (admittedly from 2013) notes some of the effects:All this, again, is to say that we need to stay humble in our approach to large problems. To borrow terms from economist William Easterly, we need to be \u201csearchers\u201d for solutions, not top-down \u201cplanners.\u201d Let\u2019s place a lot of small bets in our approach to the problem and find what works, rather than place expensive bets that risk large failures. My column, above all, is a plea to second-guess ourselves. That goes for me, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sanctuary Bills in Maryland Faced a Surprise Foe: Legal Immigrants", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byELLICOTT CITY, Md. \u2014 When lawmakers in Howard County, Md., a stretch of suburbia between Washington and Baltimore, declared their intention to make the county a sanctuary for people living in the country illegally, J. D. Ma thought back to how hard he had worked studying English as a boy in Shanghai.Stanley Salazar, a native of El Salvador, worried that the violent crime already plaguing Maryland\u2019s suburbs attributed to immigrant gangs would eventually touch his own daughters.Hongling Zhou, who had been a student in Beijing during the Tiananmen Square uprising, feared an influx of undocumented immigrants, and their children, would cripple the public schools.At first blush, making Howard County a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants had seemed a natural move: The county has twice as many Democrats as Republicans and a highly educated population, full of scientists and engineers. One in five residents was born abroad.But the bill met stout opposition from an unlikely source: some of those very same foreign-born residents.In passionate testimony before county legislators, and in tense debates with liberal neighbors born in the United States, legal immigrants argued that offering sanctuary to people who came to the country illegally devalued their own past struggles to gain citizenship.Some even felt it threatened their hard-won hold on the American dream.Their objections stunned Democratic supporters of sanctuary here and helped bring about the bill\u2019s demise in March. A similar proposal for the state collapsed this month in the Maryland Senate, where Democrats also hold a two-to-one advantage. Some of the same immigrants spoke out against it.The failure of the sanctuary bills in Maryland reveals a potentially troublesome fissure for Democrats as they rush to defy Mr. Trump. Their party has staked out an activist position built around protecting undocumented immigrants. But it is one that has alienated many who might have been expected to support it.What follows are the stories of four immigrants in Maryland who oppose sanctuary status \u2014 people whose voices have rarely been heard in the long debate over how to fix the nation\u2019s immigration system.Some supporters of sanctuary had dismissed them as white-collar professionals whose personal struggles could not compare with those of undocumented people now facing possible deportation.But anyone who thought their journeys were easy, these immigrants said, has never walked in their shoes.Growing up in China, J. D. Ma shared a small room with his parents and sister in a communal apartment in a working-class district of Shanghai. They had to take turns with two other families \u2014 14 people in all \u2014 to use a single bathroom.His maternal grandfather, a history teacher, was sent to a labor camp in 1957 under Mao Zedong. The family eventually received a letter saying he had committed suicide.But still, they considered themselves lucky: They lived in the city. They had running water.From the age of 9, Mr. Ma was pushed to learn English by his mother. \u201cStudy harder,\u201d she told him. \u201cScore higher.\u201d At 12, he won entry into a highly selective boarding school where he toiled for 13 hours a day.Today, Mr. Ma, 45, is a patent attorney, living in a stately home in Clarksville, Md., after years of study at universities in New York, Utah and Virginia and a first career as a software engineer. His wife, also a Chinese immigrant, works for the National Weather Service. Two-thirds of their daughter\u2019s second-grade classmates have parents from China or India.Mr. Ma sees his whole life as a struggle to achieve his Americanness.\u201cBeing in America is such a high privilege,\u201d he said, sitting in his brightly painted kitchen. \u201cAs an immigrant I really feel it.\u201d He added: \u201cYou cannot easily give that privilege to somebody without going through some kind of process. It\u2019s like giving lots of gold for one dollar.\u201dMr. Ma voted for Hillary Clinton. But hearing liberals talk about undocumented immigrants confuses him: The fact that their entering the country broke the law is somehow sidestepped, like a crude remark at a polite dinner party. Democrats oppose deportation on the grounds that it breaks up families, Mr. Ma said. But so do other aspects of the justice system \u2014 without setting off the same outcry.\u201cIf a single mother commits a crime and has to go to jail,\u201d he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, we can\u2019t do that, because it will break her family.\u2019\u201dThis perspective baffled the sanctuary bill\u2019s supporters.Why, they asked, were naturalized citizens like Mr. Ma so threatened by the act of protecting people living in the country illegally \u2014 many of whom had worked just as hard, and put down roots of their own, thanks to years of lax immigration enforcement and an economy that depended on their labor?Undocumented immigrants, after all, live much more tenuous existences. Mr. Ma said that a liberal friend had chided him for not understanding his own advantages, compared with \u201cpeople who were here babysitting and doing all the cleaning and cutting grass for people.\u201dMr. Ma has thought about this argument a lot. But he has concluded that it is irrelevant to the broader issue of legality.Rather than treating the nation at large as complicit, he focuses on personal responsibility.\u201cJust because you are a productive member of society, working hard, mowing lawns, that should not be the reason to give you that gold,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kind of jammed something down America\u2019s throat. You said, \u2018I understand you haven\u2019t given me permission to contribute, but I want to contribute. So here I am doing it.\u2019\u201dMany Hispanics welcomed Democrats\u2019 efforts to make Maryland a sanctuary. Stanley Salazar, 37, did not.A carpenter in Silver Spring, he compares living in the country illegally to being a guest in someone\u2019s home: Be on your best behavior. Make your bed and do the dishes. Any misbehavior \u2014 drinking and driving, for example \u2014 could mean you are no longer welcome.Mr. Salazar, who is from El Salvador, knows this because he himself was illegal.He first visited the United States when he was 10. His mother, a biology teacher, had a sister in Reno who had married an American. Mr. Salazar still remembers being amazed by his first all-you-can-eat buffet, and playing an arcade game called Paperboy, in which you raced on a bike, tossing newspapers and dodging obstacles on a suburban street.His journey back, and to American citizenship, was long, but compared with more recent immigrants\u2019, relatively painless: He left law school in El Salvador in 2001 and traveled to Maryland on a tourist visa, but violated its terms by painting houses for cash. After several extensions, his visa expired. But he spoke English, thanks to his mother\u2019s tireless teaching. She had a green card. And he had a driver\u2019s license, a bank account and a car. By 2007, he had his own green card.Now, he lives in a small house with his wife, their daughters and his mother, 73, who rides the subway into Washington every morning to her job serving sandwiches in a museum.Mr. Salazar thinks sanctuary would be bad for Maryland. He bases this on what has already happened in Montgomery County, where he has been part of a Hispanic population boom.The Salvadoran gang MS-13 has gained strength in the area recently, the authorities say, partly because of an influx of undocumented children arriving without their parents. The young arrivals are more susceptible to recruitment by gangs.Mr. Salazar sees the statistics: At least 16 homicides in the county have been attributed to gangs since June 2015. About half have been linked to MS-13, including the killing of a 15-year-old girl in Gaithersburg.\u201cI have three daughters right now and I\u2019m thinking about them,\u201d Mr. Salazar said, sipping a milkshake at a Burger King in Gaithersburg. \u201cDon\u2019t I have the right to be afraid that this kind of stuff is increasing?\u201dBut that burden is borne unequally, he said. The high school Mr. Salazar\u2019s daughters would attend, where more than 40 percent of students receive subsidized lunch, is ranked far below one in affluent Bethesda, where fewer than 5 percent qualify.Mr. Salazar dismisses proponents of sanctuary as liberals living in areas that are insulated from the potential consequences. He believes politicians \u201care using us like flags,\u201d casting immigrants as blameless victims.But immigrants are people with flaws, he said. They need a way to gain legal status, not a safe space to remain here illegally.\u201cWe are not unicorns jumping over rainbows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are people. This is life. And life is hard.\u201dOn a recent spring afternoon here, a school bus bumped down a residential street, passed a woman wearing a bright green sari and came to a halt in front of a brick house with a lawn worn from soccer games and a well-used goal. The son and daughter of Biplab Pal stepped down and scampered home.Immigrants have been coming here for years: Koreans at first, Indians more recently. Mr. Pal, 43, arrived in 2008, drawn by good schools. A third of the children in his son\u2019s fourth-grade class are Indian-American. Their parents are highly educated: Mr. Pal\u2019s real estate agent has a Ph.D. in biochemistry.Gregarious and sharp-witted, Mr. Pal talked with Indian friends about the Howard County sanctuary bill. They did not like it.Some told of sacrifices like missing a parent\u2019s funeral back in India, because traveling home could jeopardize the yearslong pursuit of a green card. With so many people waiting in line for years, the idea of providing sanctuary for those who had broken the law left a sour taste.The more pressing priority, they told him, should be improving legal immigration.\u201cYou see the Indians get very angry because they have suffered so much to get a green card,\u201d said Mr. Pal, sitting at a table laden with Indian sweets. \u201cThey think a country with one-sixth of the world\u2019s population should have more slots. But instead, everybody is fighting for illegal immigration.\u201dMr. Pal got his own green card in just a few months, as part of a special category reserved for inventors and researchers. His company makes software that tracks the functioning of factory equipment.He had a different objection to sanctuary: He believed it would lead to an increase in crime.He used to live in Los Angeles, in a neighborhood with many undocumented immigrants and lots of crime. He saw a connection.But now the talk is of sanctuary, which Mr. Pal believes would amount to an invitation. \u201cDo we really want more illegal immigrants in our country?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the answer is yes.\u201dMost undocumented immigrants are Latino, and some sanctuary supporters believe that the Asian-Americans who oppose it \u2014 and who came to this country by airplane to earn graduate degrees \u2014 look down on those who crossed the border on foot, as a matter of race, class or misplaced fear.Perhaps legal immigrants should be more understanding, Mr. Pal said, but that might be asking too much.\u201cFrankly speaking, each immigrant has their own little story of how they struggled in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tell the truth, illegal people have suffered 1,000 times more. But people only see their own suffering.\u201dHongling Zhou was born in 1966, the year Mao Zedong started the Cultural Revolution. Politics followed her throughout her young life.She was a graduate student in math when the 1989 student movement ignited protests across the country. She remembers days of protesting and nights staying up late talking about change. When the military killed hundreds of protesters in Beijing, she could not bear to stay.\u201cWe left after that \u2014 a lot of us left after that,\u201d she said, sitting at her kitchen table.At Indiana University, she earned a master\u2019s degree in statistics while working part time in a hospital. Now, Ms. Zhou lives in Clarksville, Md., with her husband, a software engineer who also emigrated from China, and their son and daughter.She knocked on doors for a presidential candidate before she could even vote \u2014 in 2004 in Pennsylvania for John Kerry. She was angry about the war in Iraq. Her first vote after becoming a citizen in 2007 was for Barack Obama.But never has she been more politically active than during the short life of the sanctuary bill in Howard County.Ms. Zhou first learned of it on WeChat, a messaging app popular among Chinese-Americans. She talked to friends and neighbors. Nobody liked the idea. Many were afraid that carving out a safe space for illegal immigrants would mean that more would come, and that public-school classes would swell and teachers would be spread thin.So on a cold night in early January, about a dozen people gathered around Ms. Zhou\u2019s long wooden dining table, drafted short speeches and took turns delivering them over steaming bowls of sweet bean soup with chia seeds. Most, she said, had never done anything more political than vote.\u201cI read my draft, but then I totally changed it,\u201d Ms. Zhou recalled. \u201cI talked a lot about how many years it took to get citizenship, and I actually started crying. One person said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that!\u2019 And someone else said, \u2018Let her cry!\u2019\u201dBut Ms. Zhou saw things differently. Immigrants double up in houses, she said. They rent apartments or mobile homes. Her cleaning lady, who she recently discovered is undocumented, lives in a trailer in the county.Though she opposes sanctuary, Ms. Zhou said that immigrants in the country illegally should be given a chance to gain citizenship, not be deported. But that is a nuanced position, and these are polarized times.Ms. Zhou and several dozen opponents posed for a group photograph after testifying in Annapolis. They were smiling. Many wore yellow T-shirts made for the occasion.On Facebook, someone commented: \u201cTrump Terrorists.\u201dMs. Zhou felt stung, but also confused. All she had done was disagree.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indonesia Governor\u2019s Loss Shows Increasing Power of Islamists", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The popular governor was the clear front-runner.Despite his religion, a Christian in Muslim-majority Indonesia, Gov. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama of Jakarta held a commanding lead in the polls.Then, in a campaign speech in September, he made a fatal reference to a verse of the Quran. A video, edited to make it seem that he had said the Muslim holy book was misleading people, went viral on Facebook.\u201cA half-minute destroyed his career,\u201d said Komaruddin Hidayat, a former rector of Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta.But in recent years, the radical Muslims who have been trying to turn Indonesia into a strict Islamic state have gradually gained influence, accruing an array of significant victories.Local laws are where the Islamists have made the biggest gains. Since 1998, with the introduction of democracy and the decentralization of power to the local authorities, more than 440 local ordinances have been adopted imposing elements of Islamic law, or Shariah, like requiring women to wear head scarves or restricting alcohol sales, according to Michael Buehler, a senior lecturer at the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, in his book \u201cThe Politics of Shari\u2019a Law.\u201d\u201cReligion has become politicized in local elections, and we saw that emerge in a big way in the election for governor in Jakarta,\u201d said Melissa Crouch, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who researches Asian legal systems. \u201cDemocracy gives a greater space to everyone, including greater space for radical Islam.\u201dBut the Islamists have kept up the pressure on a variety of fronts.The blasphemy law, rarely used before 2004, has been deployed in more than 120 cases, helping build support for the Islamists and silence dissent, said Andreas Harsono, the Indonesia representative for Human Rights Watch.While such efforts by hard-core activist groups are not new, what stood out in the governor\u2019s election was their tacit acceptance by moderate Muslims, many of whom took offense at a perceived insult to their religion.The radical groups organized the protests, demanding that the governor be jailed or killed and warning Muslims of dire consequences if they voted for a Christian. The sight of an estimated half million people at a rally in December was shocking in relatively cosmopolitan Jakarta even if, as has been reported, many protesters had been bused in from the more conservative hinterlands.Neither of Mr. Basuki\u2019s rivals publicly questioned the blasphemy accusation, instead forging alliances of convenience with the radicals.Even President Joko Widodo, an ally of Mr. Basuki\u2019s, appeared unexpectedly at the December rally alongside Mr. Habib, thanking the crowd for holding a peaceful rally.Both appearances demonstrated how much influence the militants had gained during the election campaign.One of the groups behind the rallies was Hizbut Tahrir, an organization dedicated to creating a state governed by a harsh form of Shariah, including stoning adulterers and amputating the hands of thieves, said Ismail Yusanto, a spokesman for the group in Indonesia.\u201cFrom the Islamic perspective, the state should exist for only one purpose,\u201d he said, \u201chow to implement Shariah.\u201dThe group is banned in many Muslim-majority countries.\u201cThis is an ideology that has the potential to threaten democracy,\u201d said Yenny Wahid, director of the Wahid Institute, an Islamic research center founded by her father, the former president Abdurrahman Wahid.She likened the appeal of these laws to the populist proposals offered by President Trump. \u201cBuild a wall. Chop off people\u2019s hands. These are very simplistic solutions to people\u2019s problems,\u201d she said.What the Islamists have in mind already exists in Aceh Province, on the northern tip of Sumatra. The province began instituting Shariah law in 2001 after gaining autonomy in an attempt to end a long-running separatist war.\u201cWhen Aceh was granted autonomy, it opened a Pandora\u2019s box for Indonesia,\u201d Mr. Harsono said. Some locals point out with pride that they have become a model for the rest of the country.Four civilians and four attackers were killed in the midday attack on a police post in a busy commercial district. The police said the attack had been organized by an Indonesian member of the Islamic State in Syria.About 450 Indonesians who tried to join the Islamic State have returned home, most caught in Turkey or other countries before reaching Syria. Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, said most of the returnees were noncombatants who did not pose a significant threat.More worrisome, she said, are some two dozen Islamic State recruits who returned from Syria with training and combat experience.In recent years, the police have kept the militants under tight control, apprehending or killing dozens and foiling planned terrorist attacks.For the radical political groups, which profess nonviolence, the question is whether they can capitalize on their success to play a role in the 2019 presidential election.In opposing Mr. Basuki, the Islamists were part of a broad coalition led by Prabowo Subianto, a former general who ran for president in 2014 and may run again. It also included Christians, among them Hary Tanoesoedibjo, a billionaire businessman who is Mr. Trump\u2019s business partner in Indonesia and has his own ambitions for national office.During a victory celebration the day after the election at Indonesia\u2019s national mosque, Mr. Prabowo publicly thanked leaders of the campaign, including Mr. Rizieq of the Islamic Defenders Front and Bachtiar Nasir, a Salafist leader.Later, Mr. Prabowo dismissed concerns that he may have entered into an unholy alliance with the extremists. They were part of a \u201cgrand coalition,\u201d he said.\u201cIf we demonize and we consider certain groups to be not qualified to join the political discourse,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is not a healthy attitude.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The process is just an impulse. I make the photos and smile if the subject looks at me.\u201dMr. Wagner often stands near subway stops to see the foot traffic. This photo was taken on Broadway, a main strip in Brooklyn, right under the subway. \u201cThey just caught me visually,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they looked striking and interestingly put together.\u201dKeston, left, and Cedric, both 11, live in Mr. Wagner\u2019s neighborhood. He photographs them often. This photo was taken around the time that Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old in Texas, was fatally shot by a police officer. \u201cThey are not far from that age,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cIt hits so close to home: That could have easily been you, that could have easily been Keston. So that American flag holds so much weight.\u201d\u201cIt was so tender and so sweet and so sincere,\u201d Mr. Wagner said of the way this woman knelt to talk to a girl he thought may be her daughter. \u201cAnd it was visually just really beautiful the way they just fell into the center of the sidewalk and everything else formed around them.\u201dThis photo was taken in Downtown Brooklyn. Mr. Wagner liked that there is a hidden message in this image: \u201cI just love the way her jacket kind of fell in front of the trash bin and highlighted the word that says \u2018love.\u2019\u201dThis photo was taken on Nostrand and Fulton Avenues, a spot Mr. Wagner likes to frequent; because the streets are wide and the buildings low, he is able to capture light and space. He thought this couple was very stylish, but also liked showing all the other people who made up the scene. \u201cThe guys next to the subway are Jehovah\u2019s Witness, and there is also a delivery guy in the background,\u201d he said. \u201cJust people occupying the street that are part of the neighborhood.\u201d Bodegas are a lifeline in New York City, and this photo was taken at one in Brooklyn. Mr. Wagner was reminded of his past when he saw these two: \u201cIt made me think about when I was in high school, you know, trying to talk to the girls and be cool. There is a sense of agency that kids have over their own life in New York that is really interesting. They are out, they are on the bus and on the subway. They are moving around in a different kind of way than I grew up with in Omaha when I was in my parents\u2019 car.\u201dMr. Wagner is very interested in documenting moments in parent-child relationships. \u201cIt feels like this silent moment in this busy downtown street,\u201d he said. Mr. Wagner spends a lot of his time photographing on the subways. So why was he drawn to this scene? \u201cIt was a windy morning and it was blowing her hair, and there was just something about all the movement,\u201d he said. \u201cI don't even think she noticed me.\u201dThis photograph was taken near some basketball courts in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where children from the neighborhood were playing. Mr. Wagner was initially drawn to this boy\u2019s braids, jean jacket and Jordan sneakers. But he then sought to capture an introspective moment. \u201cI feel like he should be so happy, but he looks so bored and he looks off alone by himself,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I liked the contrast of this: what he\u2019s doing, but how he actually feels.\u201dSomething about this woman reminded Mr. Wagner of someone he knew in Omaha.

I definitely felt a spark when we met, but kept it to myself. Months later, I bumped into him at a yarn shop. He invited me out. I told him I would like to go but wanted to ask my friend for her blessing first. When I did, she said, \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d \u2014 without further explanation. How bad would it be for me to disregard her answer? (Note: I am pushing 40 and don\u2019t feel sparks every day.)AMISave your breath, Ami. You had me at yarn shop. A mate who knits has long been my fantasy \u2014 or a nurturing doctor in certain subspecialties. Sadly, I failed on both counts. So, let\u2019s see if we can grab this brass ring for you.You characterize McCrafty\u2019s ex as \u201can old friend.\u201d But this raises questions: Is she a close friend? In the Venn diagram of your social circles, is there considerable overlap? And could you live with her rejecting you for overruling her preference (and badmouthing you to your pals in common)? This is a lot to stake on a mere \u201cspark,\u201d no?Still, your friend\u2019s knee-jerk refusal to bless the date, after having seen this fellow for just a few months, seems selfish. You can always approach her again, if her adamant reply strikes you as out-of-keeping with her better nature. But I might skip this step and simply weigh your desire to go to dinner with the knitter against your friend\u2019s opprobrium. We can\u2019t have it all. So, which means more to you?If you decide to see him, let your old friend know as soon as you have an inkling things may work out. It will be better for her to hear it from you. And if you decide to move forward \u2014 on which I pass no judgment \u2014 a note for next time: Don\u2019t ask permission if you don\u2019t care about receiving it. (Also, email me the second you get to quiet nights knitting cashmere socks and listening to Joni Mitchell, understood?)I am the grandmother of a 2\u00bd-year-old. I take her to a park in Chicago where she loves to play. Lately, a 4-year-old boy charges at her every time we arrive, throwing his hands in the air and roaring. It frightens her, and she asks to go home. His nanny, who is not a native English speaker, seems indifferent; she just keeps chatting with the other nannies. How should I handle this?SUSANScore one for the playground at Washington Square Park. That boy (and his minder) would be in shackles in 15 minutes. I\u2019m not sure why you have written off the nanny simply because she is speaking another language with her associates. This is her job. Say: \u201cExcuse me. Your boy is scaring my granddaughter. Please have him stop screaming and running at her. She\u2019s just a toddler.\u201dThe nanny may surprise you and handle this brilliantly. If she doesn\u2019t, speak to the boy yourself. While remaining mindful that you are speaking with a child, say: \u201cStop it! You\u2019re frightening her. And that\u2019s mean.\u201d Or escort the boy to his nanny and work out an agreement. What may seem like blowing off steam to them is playground bullying to you (and me). You\u2019re an adult; shut it down.My husband and I are in our early 30s. We work hard, in tech and finance, and we\u2019re saving to expand our family someday. Recently, we declined an event invitation from his relative because of its cost. Shortly after, we accepted another invitation from him, assuming it was for drinks, which turned out to be a restaurant dinner for 15. When the bill came, this relative asked my husband to pay one-third. He did! I was annoyed at my husband for not pushing back, and at the relative who probably asked my husband to pay more because he\u2019s \u201cin finance.\u201d How to proceed?ANONYMOUSFor starters, get on the same page with your husband about your budget. Maybe he\u2019s looser with the reins and you\u2019re a little tighter? But if you\u2019re pooling money, agreement is required. He may want to include some spending that seems crazy to you, like paying more at family events.

Until, that is, the advent of social media.And Donald J. Trump, also 70, took to Twitter to \u2014 never mind.While brand-boosting celebrities and reality-show-hosts-turned-presidents may be too easy a mark, anyone who is friends on Facebook with a person of a certain age has witnessed similar behavior. Seniors used to maintain a wary distance from new technology, perhaps calling in someone younger to help them record an outgoing message on an answering machine or set up an AOL address.Reverse role-modeling may be the reason for their \u201cCocoon 2.0\u201d-like regression. When those younger than you are engaging in callow activities on the internet \u2014 selfies, boasting, acronym-filled rants, links to ostensibly humorous videos \u2014 and getting validated for it, peer pressure can alter the conduct of any user, even one eligible for Social Security.\u201cThe one way you can tell it\u2019s an older person using social media is when they pass on some mass-consumption piece titled \u2018Check this out LOL\u2019 that calls attention to itself while telling you it\u2019s supposed to be funny,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Grady, 57, a reporter for the public radio station WNYC in New York. \u201cThat\u2019s a guarantee it\u2019s not going to be funny.\u201dNot helping their cause is that older people are late adopters, Mr. O\u2019Grady said, and thus still unfamiliar with online mores.\u201cWe all had to learn together how to absorb the common etiquette that we go by on social media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re prone to those tonal mistakes more than younger people for whom it\u2019s their native language.\u201dBeyond aping youngsters, there is something inherently juvenile about social media. To begin with, it elevates superficiality, speed and the image \u2014 all youthful preoccupations \u2014 over depth, deliberation and text, which we associate with mature adults.Part of the challenge with presenting this august appearance is that social media is as much about the self as it is about connecting with others. Frequently, of course, it functions as a convenient forum for disseminating news and photos to far-flung relatives and friends. Instances of blatant narcissism, however, are at odds with what we expect of older adults, who have supposedly shed the petty, puerile vanities of the developing ego.And yet the senior set is still susceptible to the insecurities sparked by evidence of peers\u2019 seemingly happier lives.\u201cEven at my age, it\u2019s easy to feel competitive, jealous, left out on social media,\u201d said Tracy Pennoyer, 63, a clinical psychologist focusing on diagnostic evaluations of children and adolescents in Westport, Conn. \u201cIt stirs up those feelings and juvenile thoughts of \u2018I\u2019m not cool\u2019 that I might have had when I was younger. You think you\u2019ve outgrown those decades ago, but no, they\u2019re right there, waiting to pop out.\u201dThe desire for online approval, through \u201clikes\u201d and heart symbols, can reduce even a sturdy sexagenarian to a fragile middle schooler. \u201cThe concrete venue does bring out past emotions you might have considered to be a time that\u2019s gone in your life,\u201d Dr. Batcho said.Ms. Pennoyer, an amateur photographer, frequently posts her pictures to Facebook and Instagram and understandably finds herself paying attention to how much engagement they inspire. She recalled seeing Facebook photos of an acquaintance\u2019s birthday party to which she was not invited. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been invited, and if someone had just mentioned it to me, I wouldn\u2019t have cared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you actually see a picture of a table with 20 people, it\u2019s in your face.\u201dAs for activities incongruous with seniority, Dr. Batcho theorized that some adults behave childishly, online and off, because of shifting household demographics and unsatisfied nostalgia.\u201cBack when people had larger families, they revisited childhood several times through their kids,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, when family size has shrunk, they have unfulfilled needs.\u201dYet an even stronger impulse may be our culture\u2019s fixation on denying death, strengthened by the medical progress of our age.\u201cThe hope that some scientist is going to come up with an anti-aging potion and keep us immortal or that we\u2019ll come back to life cryogenically \u2014 that hope was never present in human history,\u201d Dr. Batcho said. \u201cIn older literature, there was more of an acceptance of the finality of death. Now we have this sense that even if you can\u2019t live forever in your own physical state, you can pass on your legacy. One reason Facebook and social media have become so accepted is because of the promise, for better or worse, that it\u2019ll be there forever. That\u2019s our way of being immortalized.\u201dPerhaps some relics of our digital lives are best left unpreserved, especially since certain technological functions are tricky for those with declining faculties.\u201cI\u2019m not very good at emojis,\u201d Ms. Pennoyer said. When her daughter recently texted her something about her and her fianc\u00e9, she tried to send back an emoji of a couple holding hands, though the graphic was too small for her to see clearly.\u201cShe asked, \u2018Why did you send an emoji of two boys?\u2019\u201d Ms. Pennoyer said.Nevertheless, she doesn\u2019t feel any pressure to keep up with the young Joneses.\u201cI\u2019m constantly told by my son that our generation has ruined Facebook and that they\u2019ve moved onto other things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be part of whatever they do.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Jim O\u2019Grady, a reporter for WNYC.

And that has prompted a flurry of last-minute mobilizations among the cultural elite to rally left-leaning abstainers, including by the actor Mathieu Kassovitz and the directors Agn\u00e8s Varda, Jacques Audiard and Bertrand Tavernier.In writing her radio riff, Ms. Aram said she had listened to friends and young people. \u201cWhat struck me is the irresponsibility of some of the \u2018Neither-Nor\u2019 supporters,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cI think that equating Le Pen and Macron and standing under a \u2018Without Me May 7\u2019 banner, hoping that other people are going to stop the National Front is totally irresponsible.\u201d\u201cIn terms of threats to liberal democracy, threat No. 1 is the National Front,\u201d Mr. Todd said in an interview. \u201cBut the forces behind Macron, the people who are pro-Euro, pro-Europe, pro-Germany, are a major threat to democracy.\u201dHe said he had voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round and didn\u2019t believe Ms. Le Pen would win on Sunday, so he would sit out the vote. \u201cIt\u2019s the usual French theater,\u201d Mr. Todd said. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the verge of falling into Nazism or fascism at all.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Bruckner compared Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s refusal to back Mr. Macron to the German Communist party leader in 1933 urging Communists to vote against the Socialists rather than against the Nazis. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he said.\u201cThe French are nostalgic for an ideological, utopian communism, which never existed,\u201d he added.But he added that it was \u201ca very serious political error\u201d that some supporters of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon won\u2019t support Mr. Macron, as it could propel a more dangerous politician into office.Mindful of the possibility of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s victory, cultural figures have ratcheted up their pro-Macron activities in recent days while organizations that normally don\u2019t take sides in elections are weighing in.On Thursday, the Acad\u00e9mie des C\u00e9sars, which doles out France\u2019s version of the Academy Awards, issued a statement offering its \u201cunreserved support\u201d for Mr. Macron.And that same day, at a reception at France\u2019s Culture Ministry to present the French films in competition in this month\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, Audrey Azoulay, the outgoing culture minister, urged France\u2019s film world to help defeat the National Front. \u201cThe far right\u2019s imagery is very strong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to show a different image\u201d of France, she added, \u201cto show its differences and complexities.\u201dDaphn\u00e9 Angl\u00e8s contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Challenge of Perfect Phyllo", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byYou think you\u2019re pretty good at something until you meet someone who has been doing it for 41 years. Such was my experience, at least, with the apparently simple act of rolling out pastry very, very thin.My first steps into the world of food were, as I\u2019ve written here before, as a pastry chef. And even when I focused on the savory side of things, the fact that I\u2019d cut my teeth in the pastry kitchen had instilled a base-level confidence. I was delighted with the cherry-and-almond strudels I made from scratch in cooking school, for example, accentuating the folds and creases in the paper-thin pastry with bits of intentionally burned confectioners\u2019 sugar and butter. Later, when I became a pastry chef and often used commercial strudel pastry and phyllo rather than making my own, I thought the process was like riding a bike: Once you\u2019ve learned, you never forget.The first is from Le Saf Saf, a restaurant in the coastal town of La Marsa, near Tunis, that was home to a friendly camel and was known for its brik parcels. Here, tissue-paper-thin warka pastry \u2014 like phyllo but a bit more robust \u2014 was filled with harissa, egg and tuna before being quickly folded and fried. The result was so crisp and thin you could see the egg through the skin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it,\u201d I made the mistake of saying after watching a few being made.Snapshot No. 2 comes from Istanbul, where a national love of sweets tips into obsession when it comes to baklava, the simple dessert of phyllo pastry, nuts and syrup or honey. I visited one of the city\u2019s most celebrated baklava factories, Karakoy Gulluoglu, where production of the pastry is elevated to an art form.The master baker, Mustafa, is a fifth-generation baker. I can\u2019t remember the last time I was both so in awe (while watching him work) and so terrified (while trying to help him work) of the same person. After a team prayer and cheer, balls of dough were rolled and stretched again and again at a remarkable pace. They became thin enough to see through and so much like a billowy bedsheet that they could be flapped up in the air as if a bed were indeed being made.Making pastry like this requires \u201chard work, attention, meticulous care and love,\u201d Mustafa told me. Check, check, check and check, I thought, reassuring myself. He had failed to mention that 41 years of experience would also help. What followed was nothing short of comedy as I got lost in the clouds of flour resulting from my trying to \u201chelp\u201d and to roll out the pastry at a pace that would keep it from drying out.In the third and final snapshot, I\u2019m in Marrakesh, trying my hand at warka sheets, used throughout Morocco in all sorts of savory and sweet stuffed parcels: an egg-filled brik like the one I\u2019d had at Le Saf Saf, cheese- or meat-packed triangles, cinnamon and nut-filled \u201ccigars.\u201dFouzia took me into her home kitchen and showed me the \u201ccheats\u2019 way.\u201d Setting a frying pan atop a pot of boiling water, we brushed the runny batter onto the base of the pan. The crepe that soon appeared was, thankfully, magically easy to peel off the pan. At last, I was able to focus on making something with the pastry, rather than humiliating myself with making the pastry in the first place.My hope with these snapshots is to reassure you that, compared with the experts, we\u2019re all on training wheels when it comes to making thin laminated pastry. Don\u2019t be scared. Take delight in the fact that it isn\u2019t necessary for home cooks to make their own. There is enough good ready-made phyllo available. Brands do vary, though, so make sure that what you start with is of good quality. Scrunch a sheet in one hand: If it\u2019s brittle and falls apart, it won\u2019t be a dream to work with. If it springs open, the quality is excellent. From there, just be liberal with the melted butter (this allows the sheets to separate and rise in the oven) and work quickly when brushing the sheets to prevent their drying out.And to Drink ...Selecting a wine for this rich yet piquant tart is simple. All you need is a crisp, similarly tangy dry white. If you want to be regionally thematic, you could start with an assyrtiko from Santorini, but why stop there? Italy is full of such wines, like Etna Bianco or fiano, to name just two. So is France, where you could choose from a Corsican vermentinu, a minerally Sancerre, an aligot\u00e9 from Burgundy, a Muscadet or even a Chablis. Dry ros\u00e9s from all over would be fine as long as they aren\u2019t too fruity, and a sea-scented Manzanilla sherry would be delicious. It\u2019s hard to go wrong unless you insist on a red, and with the right people and this delicious dish, even that wouldn\u2019t be bad.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Pacific Overtures\u2019 Revival Is Bare Yet Flowering", "Date": "2017-06-18", "News": "Supported byJohn Weidman, who wrote the musical\u2019s book, says that, for him, the idea was born in an East Asian history class at Harvard. Why had he never been taught about America\u2019s brutal \u201copening\u201d of Japan and its consequences?Though pointing in different directions, both questions shaped the show that resulted. Viewed one way, \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d is a chronicle, stuffed with real names and documentary evidence, of the arrival of American warships at Uraga in July 1853, and what came after. At the same time, it is one of the most startling artworks ever created for Broadway: a series of panels stripped as bare as possible so the whole may flower with feeling.The sometimes-glorious, sometimes-lackluster revival that John Doyle has staged in Classic Stage\u2019s 200-seat Off Broadway home takes that less-is-more proposition nearly to a point of no return. Unlike Harold Prince\u2019s original production at the 1,500-seat Winter Garden, with its jaw-dropping Boris Aronson scenery and costumes by Florence Klotz, Mr. Doyle starts from zero and adds only what he feels he must. He\u2019s an essentialist, not a minimalist.The single set, of his own design, resembles two Japanese scrolls unfurling to the floor, where they join to form a runway much like the hanamichi used in Kabuki. The costumes (by Ann Hould-Ward) are contemporary and neutral, with only the occasional flash of bright color: a madam\u2019s red shoes, a fisherman\u2019s stars-and-stripes neckerchief. There are few props and one piece of furniture: a stool.Such choices would appear to fit the show\u2019s aesthetic no less than they do Mr. Doyle\u2019s, as theatergoers familiar with his pared-down revivals of \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cPassion\u201d \u2014 and, more recently, \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d \u2014 will recognize. But \u201cPacific Overtures,\u201d as originally conceived, is more complex than it seems, both in its perspective and its plot.The story focuses on two characters whose lives cross and then, in a way, flip, much as the roles of the United States and Japan did historically. Kayama (Steven Eng) is a minor samurai who is promoted to prefect of police in order to head off the arrival of Commodore Perry and his gunboats. Manjiro (Orville Mendoza) is a fisherman who, having been rescued at sea by an American ship six years earlier, has just returned to Japan after living in Massachusetts. It\u2019s he who warns the shogun of Perry\u2019s imminent arrival and helps Kayama prevent the landing party from touching Japanese soil.But as Kayama grows enamored of Western culture, Manjiro, who earlier sang of America as of a distant lover, grows disgusted with its arrogance. In the extraordinary song \u201cA Bowler Hat,\u201d we hear and see their crossover happen: Kayama learns to smoke cigars and read Spinoza while Manjiro pours the tea ceremony and mantles himself in samurai robes.Most of all, the numbers astonish with their narrative nimbleness. In \u201cPlease Hello,\u201d the United States and four cartoon European powers clamor for trade rights, each in an apt musical style: a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song for Britain, a cancan for France. In \u201cSomeone in a Tree,\u201d the fateful meeting between the Japanese and the Americans is recalled years later by a soldier who lay under the floorboards of the treaty house (and could hear but not see what was going on) and a boy looking down through the eaves (who could see but not hear).But in \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d only the foreigners speak pidgin; the Japanese speak with great dignity about their dreams and despoilment. That works beautifully in Mr. Doyle\u2019s production, which is delicate and focused enough to make small gestures, such as the closing of a parasol, pay. But to the extent that the Americans are meant to be hooknosed barbarians \u2014 as the Reciter, played by a stately George Takei, calls them in his narration \u2014 a great deal more vulgarity and verve are needed.Mr. Doyle is allergic to those qualities. With the authors\u2019 permission, he has cut the boffo \u201cChrysanthemum Tea,\u201d a number in which the shogun\u2019s mother wittily poisons him. Mr. Sondheim considers it \u201cessentially a Jewish mother song,\u201d and he should know, but it is also part of a crucial stylistic counterweight that\u2019s largely missing here. (Also cut is the furious \u201cLion Dance\u201d that ended the first act with a bang.) The lack of variety that results from these choices can be dulling, and the lack of clarity that results from a cast of just 10 actors playing dozens of characters (the original cast numbered 31) means that the shock you are meant to feel as Japan hurtles toward a violent modernity is diminished. The same is true with Jonathan Tunick\u2019s lovely if brassless new orchestrations.But as Mr. Doyle must have intended, something else is enhanced. The portrait of history as the sum of transactions between individuals who usually seem irrelevant was never as powerful as it is here. When Kayama and his wife, Tamate (Megan Masako Haley), sing \u201cThere Is No Other Way\u201d \u2014 written to be performed by unnamed \u201cobservers\u201d \u2014 an abstraction is personalized. And when Ms. Haley touchingly reappears as a girl mistaken for a geisha by British sailors, it suggests a connection that a plusher production would miss.Probably no version of \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d could achieve all of the show\u2019s global and local, exquisite and bombastic effects at once. Still, with its promises to \u201cexpel the barbarians\u201d and let \u201cJapan be Japan again,\u201d it may at this moment benefit more from Mr. Doyle\u2019s understatement than it would from a grosser, glossier treatment. So let\u2019s call the screen half full \u2014 which, with Mr. Sondheim\u2019s songs, is more than enough.Advertisement"}

For the six years since the Syrian conflict began, I\u2019ve used these basic tools \u2014 and widely accessible information \u2014 to verify images broadcast on television.My investigation into the veracity of the alleged April 4 chemical attack began with a YouTube video of bombs dropping over Khan Sheikhoun. Using social media, I found and interviewed people who had witnessed the bombings. I obtained exclusive video and photos of the buildings that were bombed from residents of the town. Using GPS coordinates and other mapping techniques, I determined their exact location.Our investigation into the question of whether a chemical attack took place in Syria on April 4 relied on a fairly novel combination of forensic mapping techniques with analysis of witness content to enhance our reporting. Our work confirmed, conclusively, that a chemical attack had taken place in Khan Sheikhoun, and provided a concrete example of what we mean when we talk of video and the way it can strengthen our storytelling.In combination with graphics and on-the-ground reporting, our video forensic work also showed conclusively that the attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun took place hours before Syria \u2014 and its Russian allies \u2014 say that it occurred and cast doubt on the official account of the attack that Russia provided.Here\u2019s what we found:GeolocationKhan Sheikhoun is a town of many minarets. We started our investigation by mapping these towers; they provide identifiable reference points that we linked to images in the first videos from the morning of the attack. We also mapped distant hills, the alignment of fields and houses, roads out of the town and a large mound in the center of the town.Take a look at the Google Earth/DigitalGlobe satellite image above. I placed an electronic pin on every towering minaret in this image and identified each by the shadows they cast. When I couldn\u2019t easily determine whether a particular structure was a mosque or a minaret, I referred to historical satellite imagery, available on Google Earth, to examine older images, taken from alternate camera angles or on clearer days when shadows were more distinct.By zooming in on terrain view, another feature of Google Earth, I simulated how the town looked from the ground. Terrain view doesn\u2019t provide an exact 3-D replica of the town, but it shows the contours of the ground as hills rise and fall. This allowed me to match the position of minarets against distant hills as the video shows, and put myself in the cameraman\u2019s shoes.Analyzing the camera position, it was clear that the video was filmed in Khan Sheikhoun, it was not video from another town. I established that the camera was positioned to the north of the town and was looking south.The location was important because it helped us to ascertain what time the video was filmed, which we could estimate based on the sunlight illuminating the minarets on the video.The uploaderWho filmed it? I examined the uploader\u2019s YouTube, Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook profiles. In his social media history, he regularly talks about events in Khan Sheikhoun. His cover photos are pictures of Khan Sheikhoun. This and other information in his profiles indicated that he was a journalist or activist who lived in the town.His YouTube account contained several videos of bombings and other events related to the conflict that were filmed from the same northerly vantage point. The voice-over on these videos was the same voice that we heard on the April 4 video.Why was this important? It gave me confidence the video was shot by someone who regularly films events in his hometown \u2014 not someone who copies and reposts videos from elsewhere.Time of the attackThe Syrian foreign minister, President Assad and a Russian military spokesman said the attack took place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that day. Video forensics, however, proves that it took place much earlier.My colleague Neil Collier made contact with the uploader, Mohamad Salom, and interviewed him at length. He corroborated the time of the bombing as early morning, soon after 6:35 a.m.Our network of sources in Syria put us in touch with other town residents. A second witness who had filmed the attack sent us more footage that I verified using the same mapping techniques. We interviewed this witness and found that the time frame he presented corroborated Mr. Salom\u2019s account.Doctors at hospitals in the area coordinate support services using WhatsApp, and a medic sent me screenshots of messages they sent in the hours after the attack. The Times\u2019s Beirut bureau chief, Ms. Barnard, and Ms. Saad, a Times reporter in Beirut, verified the messages with two independent medical sources. The timing of these communications was consistent with what additional open source material indicated was the time that multiple casualties connected with exposure to chemical agents was reported.All of this occurred hours before Russian and Syrian officials acknowledged that regular bombing missions had been carried out in Khan Sheikhoun. No other bombing runs were reported that morning until warplanes hit a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun after midday.Video-enhanced investigative work helped us set the record straight.What was hit?A Russian military spokesman suggested that Syrian aircraft bombed a \u201clarge depot\u201d on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town where, he alleged, \u201cterrorists,\u201d or opposition forces, manufactured chemical weapons.However, there were no visible depots near the strike points on the videos taken that morning. Small buildings were hit, and people described them as homes.Note that the videos show conventional bombing and do not depict chemical weapons. However, witnesses told us that the chemical weapons were dropped in the same bombing mission and took place near the conventional strike points.Using TerraServer and DigitalGlobe, I got new and old satellite images of the town, zoomed into the buildings\u2019 coordinates and saw that the damage matched exactly what we see in the photos. As does the rubble in the streets.The satellite verification also corroborated our interviews and established precisely what was hit \u2014 those small buildings that residents described as people\u2019s homes.Large depotRussia said that a \u201clarge depot\u201d was bombed on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town. The only large buildings near the strike points that match this description are a bakery and a grain silo. I found archive footage on YouTube showing they had been targeted in the past. But satellite imagery from April 6 showed that they had suffered no recent damage.We neither received nor found evidence of any other points being hit in the eastern parts of the town that morning. This casts further serious doubt on Russia\u2019s story.The craterTown residents pointed to a crater on the road by the grain silo and bakery where the chemical weapons attack reportedly took place. Fresh scarring in the video indicated the crater was new and, again, before-and-after satellite imagery confirmed this.Though we are not certain what caused the crater, circumstantial evidence and witness testimony establish the crater as the site of the attack. Several town residents say planes passed over the town twice and dropped bombs across it.Rebel-held parts of Syria have a network of spotters that monitor warplanes. They share information with residents and rescuers in an effort to warn of impending strikes. According to information our Beirut bureau received that day, spotters saw a fighter plane over Khan Sheikhoun twice within a few minutes that morning. This corroborates the accounts we received from witnesses.Another activist who works in the town sent me a map marking where the chemical attack happened. This matched our satellite location of the crater. The source said the \u201cpopulation within the vicinity of [this] place were poisoned.\u201dOur investigation does not prove who is responsible for the attack, nor does it attempt to. The O.P.C.W. said it intends to search the site as soon as it is safe to do so. What our investigation shows is how the visual evidence debunks Russia and Syria\u2019s claims about what happened that day. The evidence builds on the testimony gathered by others and puts Syria and Russia\u2019s account into serious doubt.This investigation offered a promising occasion to use new technologies to bolster and extend our reporting into new areas, and it nicely illustrates the importance and possibilities forensic mapping and visual storytelling present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drag Queen Story Hour Puts the Rainbow in Reading", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byStory hour, long a mommy-and-me staple, had never looked so colorful.She stood well over six feet tall, the reader at the Hudson Park branch of the New York Public Library in Greenwich Village, her height aided by six-inch heels on purple patent leather boots. Her outfit was an oxymoronic neon camouflage bodysuit and a purple tutu. A tuft of fuchsia hair curled from under a spandex headdress with fabric-covered cylinders lined up in a row, like a Keith Haring-inspired Mohawk.As she entered, the adults clapped politely, but the preschool- and kindergarten-age children huddled on a rug went wild. With the elation typically reserved for a \u201cFrozen\u201d character, one toddler screamed \u201cYay!\u201d and clapped furiously, squirming in his mother\u2019s lap.\u201cMy name is Harmonica Sunbeam,\u201d the reader said, in a voice used to loud rooms. As a warm-up, she had the children sing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d and then march vigorously in place. \u201cI\u2019m getting you ready for Zumba,\u201d she said to laughter from the over-6 set.She sat down and read aloud from \u201cMorris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress\u201d by Christine Baldacchino. The book is about a boy who wore a beloved dress to school every day. At one point, Morris\u2019s friends inform him that he isn\u2019t allowed to play on their imaginary spaceship, because \u201castronauts can\u2019t wear dresses.\u201d\u201cYes, they can!\u201d one child cried out.\u201cNo, they can\u2019t,\u201d said another.The debate continued as Harmonica Sunbeam listened. Then she leaned down, addressing the children in a conspiratorial stage whisper.\u201cHas anyone ever said anything mean to you?\u201d she asked. The children responded with yeses and nos. \u201cSometimes it happens.\u201d\u201cI saw a Facebook post about it,\u201d said Rachel Aimee, the Drag Queen Story Hour coordinator for New York, \u201cand as soon as I saw it, I said, \u2018Oh, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u2019\u201d (Ms. Aimee, who doesn\u2019t get paid for her work, plans on incorporating the program as a nonprofit.) She held the first reading at Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn last August and caught the eye of Kat Savage, the children\u2019s librarian at the Park Slope branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. Subsequent library events were a huge success, bringing in hundreds of patrons and the news media. That, in turn, caught the attention of Hudson Park\u2019s children\u2019s librarian, Stevie Feliciano.Later this spring and summer, the Drag Queen Story Hour will expand to Harlem and Inwood in Manhattan and to the Bronx.\u201cAt first we identified branches that we thought would be excited by it,\u201d said Eva Shapiro, the early literacy coordinator for the New York Public Library. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want any surprises. Some neighborhoods are less familiar with the concept. But so far everyone has been thrilled.\u201dMs. Aimee agreed, adding, \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t read the comments by trolls on the website.\u201dTo the program organizers, children and drag queens are an obvious pairing.\u201cChildren love dressing up and being imaginative in what they wear,\u201d Ms. Aimee said. \u201cThey see drag queens as people who are doing the same thing, expressing themselves creatively and having fun with it. Also, kids have a much more fluid understanding of gender than most adults do.\u201dShe quoted one of the young attendants as saying, \u201cDrag queens make story time funner.\u201dAlisa Soriano, a kindergarten teacher at the Little Red School House in Manhattan who attended the session with Harmonica Sunbeam, said: \u201cWe teach a lot of inclusive books, as well as classics. We talk about, \u2018What do you do when you see someone who\u2019s different?\u2019\u201dAfter reading a few more books from the library\u2019s preapproved list \u2014 some, like \u201cMorris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s Okay to be Different\u201d by Todd Parr, address themes of diversity and gender expression, while others are simply story time favorites \u2014 Ms. Sunbeam distributed scarves and asked the children to shout out their favorite ice cream flavors, an exercise that inspired a more contentious debate than that over the astronaut\u2019s dress. Then they broke for a paper crown decorating session.It had been her first story hour session, and afterward Harmonica Sunbeam sat down, visibly perspiring. As is the case with all readers, library staff members taught Ms. Sunbeam how to engage the children, with questions (\u201cWho likes rainbows?\u201d) and to manage crowds of often restless youngsters. However, the differences between a rowdy drag show audience and a group of kindergartners are not as pronounced as one might imagine.Little kids can be wild, Ms. Shapiro said. \u201cWe like to joke that they\u2019re kind of like drunk adults,\u201d she said.When asked to pinpoint the main difference between story hour and an evening drag show, Ms. Sunbeam said jokingly, \u201cI\u2019m sober.\u201dShe gestured to her headdress. \u201cOne of the girls said, \u2018You kind of look like a rooster,\u2019\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cA boy asked me what superhero I was.\u201d To that question, she gave her standard answer: Wonder Woman.\u201cWe all learn every day in life,\u201d she said, as the last of the children filed out the door. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lesson in everything you do.

{"Headline": "Take a Walk Down Memory Lane. It Can Be Healthy.", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byAround this time of year, every year for the last 10 or so, I have indulged in a strange but comforting ritual. I see the Facebook photos of tassels turning, I get the feels \u2014 lots of them \u2014 and then I plunge into the depths of my music library to rediscover Vitamin C\u2019s \u201cGraduation.\u201dOne listen \u2014 much like one potato chip \u2014 seldom satisfies. So I lean in, playing the song on repeat, often while flipping through pages of my high school yearbook until, eventually, normal levels of subconsciousness set in.Of course, the feelings elicited by the song have a name: nostalgia. And it\u2019s spreading on college campuses nationwide right about now.Thankfully, there are people who study this stuff, and because of them, our way of thinking about nostalgia has turned upside down in recent years. We even know the sorts of things that can trigger it. (Trigger warning: The rest of this post may make you long for the past.)The outlook got only slightly brighter and broader over the next several hundred years when experts began defining nostalgia as \u201cimmigrant psychosis,\u201d a form of \u201cmelancholia\u201d and a \u201cmentally repressive compulsive disorder.\u201dIn 2006, Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides and their colleagues published a study that changed the paradigm. Nostalgia, the study found, was a positive thing; thankfully, because most people say they experience it at least once a week, and some more than that.Researchers say it\u2019s a \u201cphenomenon\u201d \u2014 a high-order emotional experience more on par with love than, say, fear. It\u2019s about yourself and those close to you; big moments in your life or memorable settings. Experts have found that people turn to nostalgia when they are trying to avoid something unpleasant or feeling lonely, to counteract their social anxieties.And it works. Nostalgia helps bring your psychological state back into balance. It elevates your mood and your deflated self-esteem. Researchers say you come out of the experience with a stronger sense of belonging.Say you\u2019re moving to the other side of the country for a new job. That disruption can trigger a bout of nostalgia in which you recall childhood fishing trips with your dad. You think back fondly, and realize, \u201cHey, I still love to fish, and I still love my dad.\u201d So you begin to feel like there\u2019s some continuity between your past and present, like you\u2019re living a full and meaningful life. And in that context, the cross-country move that\u2019s been stressing you out may suddenly seem less daunting.In a Skype interview, Dr. Wildschut and Dr. Sedikides cautioned against using nostalgia as your primary way to cope with problems. Talking to a friend, for example, might be a better way.\u201cIf other things fail, nostalgia is a back up,\u201d Dr. Sedikides said, \u201cand it\u2019s not as bad as people think.\u201dA recent study out of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, involved showing students born in the 1990s the introductory scenes of cartoons that were popular when they were children.Some that produced nostalgia were:Scooby DooRugrats Research suggests that music is also a quick way to spark nostalgia. It can elicit both positive and negative emotions, and sometimes we purposely decide to leverage it when we want to feel sad, said Jeff T. Larsen, a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.Researchers have found that whereas upbeat songs may bring out the happy in you, slower songs can draw out both happiness and sadness simultaneously.My Vitamin C song, for instance, has both upbeat and somber undertones. But Dr. Larsen hypothesizes that \u201cthe most important ingredient is the personal meaning\u201d I attach to the song.Meaningful music sends all the good times flooding back, he says.Even if those times were complicated.Perhaps no one, Dr. Sedikides said, explains the power of nostalgia as a marketing technique more eloquently than Don Draper in \u201cMad Men.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Star Wars (always Star Wars), which has managed to somehow evoke nostalgia for over four decades.\u201cThe products and franchises that do it right don\u2019t do carbon copies, but they try to extract the core elements that made something special, and then add new elements or take the ideas in new directions that make it feel fresh,\u201d Dr. Routledge said.Sound familiar?The research proves that yes, nostalgia makes you want to cry.So I\u2019ll just leave this right here. I hope you have \u2026 oh, nevermind.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Wants to Be Everywhere With Everyone", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Sometimes you just need to have a party, even if there\u2019s nothing special to celebrate.That was Google\u2019s situation on Wednesday, when it held its annual conference for developers on a perfect spring day in the outdoor amphitheater adjacent to its Silicon Valley campus.There were no headline-making announcements, no big reveal of the sort that Steve Jobs would make (iPod and iPhone) in his glory years at Apple. The tech world moves too fast these days for companies to save products for an annual event; they appear when they\u2019re finished. But the conference must go on anyway.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, began by talking about Google\u2019s impressive reach. Seven of its products \u2014 including Search, YouTube and Maps \u2014 have more than a billion users each. The Android operating system software is on more than two billion devices.Google\u2019s ambition, as Mr. Pichai and the speakers that followed him made clear, is to knit all those devices and services together. Google users \u2014 which means just about everyone, in Google\u2019s vision \u2014 will interact with the company all day long and do it so seamlessly that they barely notice it.\u201cIn an A.I.-first world, we are rethinking all our products,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Simply pointing a phone at a restaurant would bring up reviews of it. And a search for a small product \u2014 a screwdriver, say \u2014 in a vast hardware store would be enabled by what Google calls Visual Position Service.\u201cGPS gets you to the door, and then V.P.S. can get you the exact item you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s virtual reality team leader. With an audio interface, V.P.S. would be a gift to the vision-impaired.Google Home, introduced at I/O last year, was rushed out to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo. While Google does not release sales figures, analysts say Home lags far behind the Echo, which recently announced new features that Home does not have. Perhaps Google can catch up or perhaps Home will become another Google Buzz, a social network that failed a few years ago.The same caution goes for Google\u2019s efforts in virtual reality. It is developing its first stand-alone headsets, done in partnership with Qualcomm, Lenovo and HTC, which will be released this fall. But Facebook and Samsung already have their own well-publicized V.R. initiatives.At the end of the keynote, Mr. Pichai discussed a new initiative called Google for Jobs that will pull data from partner sites to making job-hunting easier.One major job listing site, Indeed, is not one of Google\u2019s partners. Within a few hours of the keynote, the company fired back. \u201cWe are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone\u2019s life,\u201d said Chris Hyams, the president of Indeed, in a statement.That makes another battle joined.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Terence Crawford\u2019s Greatest Fight May Be With Himself", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byTerence Crawford will defend his world super lightweight title against Felix Diaz in the main event at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.But that might be the least daunting test Crawford faces in his immediate future.Next month, the appeal of his misdemeanor convictions last September \u2014 for property damage and disorderly conduct after a dispute in an Omaha auto body shop \u2014 comes before a judge, and he could wind up in jail.Two months ago, he reportedly pulled out a gun to break up a brawl between two female acquaintances, prompting the Omaha police to detain him for questioning. He was released, the gun was returned and no criminal charges were filed after Crawford produced a concealed-carry permit.But both episodes are reminders that although boxing has taken Crawford around the world and given him a measure of wealth, fame and perspective, in some ways he has never left the gritty environment in which he grew up.The result is that Crawford, four months from his 30th birthday, is something of a contradiction. He grew up angry, his formative years filled with too many forays into gang life. And based on those episodes in Omaha, his hometown, that anger still seems capable of getting him into trouble.And yet he has grown, too, through two eye-opening trips to Rwanda with a mentor who was once his fourth-grade teacher, and through his decision to open a nonprofit boxing gym in the neighborhood where he grew up.\u201cHe\u2019s a person who people will love if he\u2019ll only allow them to,\u2019\u2019 said Jamie Nollette, the fourth-grade teacher who steered him toward Rwanda after reconnecting with him years later.\u201cTerence\u2019s greatest strength is also his greatest weakness,\u2019\u2019 she added. \u201cTerence is so strong-willed, and when he feels betrayed, it\u2019s hard for him to get over that. He feels like he\u2019s trying so hard to do the right things, to be a good person, but people only see a small picture of him, and that\u2019s not who he really is.\u2019\u2019As a boxer, of course, Crawford\u2019s narrative is less complicated. He is unbeaten in 30 fights, with 21 knockouts, and his name appears on just about every list of the top five pound-for-pound boxers.It would be a lasting affirmation for the path he chose as a wayward inner-city kid \u2014 finding that boxing was something he was good at. He won many amateur tournaments before earning Pan Am gold in 2007, turned pro a year later and then kept winning, capped by his 2014 victory over Scotland\u2019s Ricky Burns for the World Boxing Organization lightweight title in Glasgow.Along the way, his career nearly derailed after a street-corner dice game in Omaha in 2008. A bullet fired by a gang member smashed through the windshield of the car he was driving, rattled around the interior and lodged itself in the back of his skull. But Crawford was able to drive to the hospital and suffered no permanent damage, other than the quarter-sized dent behind his right ear.In a recent interview, he recalled his first reaction to what had happened \u2014 \u201cI was furious. I wasn\u2019t thinking about nothing but revenge. I wanted to find the guy and kill him.\u201d \u2014 and how, gradually, he was able to calm down and reason with himself.\u201cI realized that wasn\u2019t doing me any good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t going to get me where I wanted to so I just started focusing on boxing, and everything just changed for me, dramatically. I took it as a wake-up call. It was like God blessed me with a second chance.\u201dAs Crawford emerged as a boxer, Nollette left the teaching profession, moved from Omaha to Arizona, and found her calling with a nonprofit organization that drills wells for drinking water in Africa. Eventually, a former colleague told her that Terence Crawford, the rambunctious 9-year-old who always tried to get her attention, was now a prominent boxer.She sent him a congratulatory message through Facebook and was pleasantly surprised when she quickly received a response.\u201cI know it\u2019s easy to say now, but Terence was always my favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really just always would want to do something to make me proud, and I could tell he needed that positive reinforcement.\u201dCrawford said: \u201cWhenever anyone asked me who my favorite teacher was, I would always say \u2018Miss Nollette.\u2019 I just always felt she cared about me.\u2019\u2019The two met for lunch and Crawford asked if he could accompany her to Rwanda. Six weeks later, that is where they were, learning about a method of reconciliation that seemed as foreign to him as the African food.The concept was simple, yet mind-boggling, and Crawford said he regarded the scene with disbelief.\u201cWhere I come from,\u201d he told his traveling companions that night at dinner, \u201cwe believe in an eye for an eye. That\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dAnd yet, Crawford admitted, he could not help thinking about the program\u2019s message \u2014 that, in effect, anything is possible.There was more, some of it painful. While in Rwanda, Crawford, Nollette and others on the trip attended a memorial to the genocide victims.\u201cTo actually see the little baby skulls that\u2019s cracked and broke from getting hit in the head with axes and stuff like that \u2014 it\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cI never knew things like that even happened.\u201dCrawford learned, too, about the joy Rwandans could find in the things that a child from north Omaha took for granted.\u201cYou think we got it bad in Omaha, or in any city in the United States, and then you go to a different country and you see how bad they got it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou give those people a balloon and they\u2019ll cherish it like you gave them a chunk of gold.\u201dBack in Omaha, Crawford began laying the groundwork for the B&B Boxing Academy, which requires its young members to bring their report cards to maintain their status, and which offers tutoring and mentoring services.But he also ran into trouble. The body shop incident occurred in April 2016 after a dispute with the owner, whom Crawford believed had overcharged him for subpar work on his car. Crawford lowered his car from a hydraulic lift and pushed it out of the shop, which caused a reported $5,000 worth of damage to the shop\u2019s equipment.He was convicted on two of three criminal counts \u2014 an assault charge was dropped \u2014 and was sentenced to 90 days, which was later reduced to 53. He served only eight hours before he was released, pending his appeal next month.Then came the incident in March. \u201cI try to tell him he can\u2019t get involved in those things anymore,\u201d Nollette said. \u201cBut believe me, 10 years ago would have ended a lot differently. He\u2019s come a long way.\u201dCrawford acknowledges there is residual anger from his childhood. \u201cAs a kid, my temper was on Cloud 10,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you say, I would just jump on you, you know?\u201d But he also has the awareness that there is another way.He has reconciled with his father, whom he long resented for often being away in the Navy while he was growing up. Both of Crawford\u2019s parents, Terence Sr. and Debra, will be at Saturday\u2019s fight.Nollette, a mother of three, will instead be attending the high school graduation of her son, Sam. But her family will watch the fight on TV.Crawford said he remembered how he used to feel because his parents were never at any of his boxing tournaments. \u201cYou look around and you see everybody else\u2019s parents cheering them on, and it makes you feel bad. These are the things you can\u2019t get back.\u201dSo when his young son, Terence III \u2014 one of five children he has with his longtime girlfriend, Esha Person \u2014 competed in a wrestling tournament last month, Crawford left his training camp in Colorado Springs to watch him compete in Reno, Nev.He was being a good father. He is intent on being a role model. He is also within reach of greater riches as a boxer. And looming is that court case next month. It is a complicated and ongoing story.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Sharapova Is Denied a Wild-Card Spot in the French Open", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byThe five-time major tournament winner Maria Sharapova will not be granted a wild-card entry into the French Open, the president of the French Tennis Federation, Bernard Giudicelli, announced Tuesday.The federation also declined to offer a wild-card spot in the qualifying tournament to Sharapova, who has won the French Open twice.Currently ranked No. 211, Sharapova had not acquired enough ranking points to earn direct entry into the French Open, leaving her with no opportunity to compete in the first Grand Slam tournament to be contested since her return.\u201cShe has handled her suspension with dignity and respect,\u201d said Giudicelli, who announced the decision, along with the other wild-card entrants, via a Facebook Live stream. \u201cBut nonetheless, though there can be a wild card after an injury, there cannot be one for a return from doping. So it is up to Maria day after day, tournament after tournament, to find alone the strength she needs to win the big titles without owing anything to anyone.\u201dGiudicelli said the decision to deny Sharapova a place in the tournament, which begins May 28, had been a difficult one. He added that he had tried three times to inform her by telephone of the decision on Tuesday, without success.\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that the C.A.S. has reduced her sanction,\u201d Giudicelli said, referring to the arbitration court, \u201cit is still a violation of the tennis antidoping program.\u201dThe court \u201crecognized that Maria was the only one responsible for her misfortune,\u201d he said.Giudicelli added: \u201cIt is not for me today to question that decision. I respect, and we should respect, the decision that was first taken by the International Tennis Federation\u2019s independent tribunal and then considered on appeal by C.A.S.\u201dThe match began less than an hour after Giudicelli\u2019s announcement. Sharapova did not hold a news conference after the match and released a statement that did not address the decision.\u201cI apologize for having to withdraw from my match today with a left thigh injury,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be getting all the necessary examinations to make sure it is not serious. I want to thank the tournament for giving me the opportunity to play this special event again.\u201dGiudicelli, a Corsican who was elected president of the French federation in February, indicated shortly after his election that it would be \u201cvery complicated\u201d to give Sharapova a wild card. But he met with Sharapova in March during the tournament in Indian Wells, Calif., in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate that took place while Sharapova was still suspended.Giudicelli said at the time that he and the French Open tournament director, Guy Forget, would discuss the subject. Giudicelli emphasized that no decision had been made, raising hope among Sharapova\u2019s team and supporters that the French Open might follow the lead of the WTA Tour events. The WTA event in Strasbourg, a clay-court tournament the week before the French Open that the French Tennis Federation once operated but ceded to a private agency with deep connections to the federation, had even offered Sharapova a wild card.Giudicelli said he made the final decision about the French Open \u201cafter hearing from lots of people internally\u201d at the French federation. He said none of the other members of the administrative team were in favor of awarding Sharapova a wild card.\u201cI think we were all on the same wavelength,\u201d said Giudicelli, who said he had not consulted the leaders of the other three Grand Slam tournaments.But not everyone in the tennis community was in agreement, including Steve Simon, chief executive of the WTA Tour.\u201cWe all are part of the antidoping program, and we support both the results and the disciplinary actions that come from it, but I think the basis on which they levied their decision is adding additional penalty or discipline to the decisions that were set down by C.A.S.,\u201d Simon said in a telephone interview from St. Petersburg, Fla. \u201cThe basis for this just extends the penalty.\u201dJustin Gimelstob, a Tennis Channel analyst and member of the ATP board of directors, said in reference to Giudicelli on Monday that he was \u201cvery concerned this new president is going to try to make a statement and shut her out of the tournament.\u201dGimelstob added, \u201cIf he does that, it\u2019s a huge travesty and a mistake.\u201dOpinion is clearly divided. Lucic-Baroni said after Tuesday\u2019s match that she thought the French federation had made \u201cthe correct decision.\u201d\u201cI feel it is, let\u2019s say, brave of them, because everybody is pressured,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to see Maria. That\u2019s fine. But if you want to do the right thing, you have to do the right thing. If you want to invest more money in doping tests, then you can\u2019t award a person who failed a doping test, no matter how you guys want to wrap it up and make it sound pretty.\u201dGiudicelli acknowledged outside pressures but said commercial interests were not a valid reason to give Sharapova the wild card. He said any lack of star power caused by the withdrawals of Serena Williams and Roger Federer also did not influence his thinking.\u201cThe choice was not easy, because Maria is a champion and she won our tournament twice, and she\u2019s a star,\u201d Giudicelli said. \u201cBut she cannot be treated separately. It\u2019s on the court she should show her singularity. It\u2019s a Grand Slam tournament, not a rock concert where we invite the best singers on the planet. It\u2019s a tournament where each player can be challenged by another player.\u201dHe said he and Forget felt that \u201cthe tournament is stronger than the players, and the defense of the interests of the tournament takes priority over the defense of the interests of the players.\u201dThere were mixed signals on Tuesday, however. The French federation did award a wild card into the men\u2019s qualifying tournament to Constant Lestienne, a French player who was banned for seven months last year for placing bets on 220 matches through online accounts between February 2012 and June 2015. Half of the sentence was suspended.Shortly before last year\u2019s French Open, the French federation stripped Lestienne of his wild card into the main draw because of the pending investigation. Giudicelli was asked why the same logic that applied to Sharapova did not apply to Lestienne this year, too.\u201cBecause Constant has paid his debt,\u201d Giudicelli answered. \u201cHe made a mistake and paid his debt and accepted to start again on the circuit, and he showed, I would say, his will to come back to the high level. At some stage, there is no reason, once again, to refuse him this wild card because he was part of the group in terms of ranking who were in contention.\u201dOthers think Sharapova has already paid her debt.\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough thing, and I think Maria, she already finish her penalty,\u201d Svetlana Kuznetsova, a fellow Russian player, said Monday in Rome. \u201cShe served it. So once again, I wish it could be over and we can move on.\u201dClearly, that time has not yet come, and with Wimbledon set to announce its main-draw wild cards on June 20, there could be more mixed emotions ahead.Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

Canadian doctors performing medically assisted deaths told me this is common, by the way. The suffering of many people nearing death is psychological, from their loss of abilities and purpose.Ms. Vaile, 80, was a single parent, an interior designer, an avid traveler and, in her 30s, an activist for assisted death with the lobbying group Dying With Dignity.

I saw my mother suffer, especially during the last year, so I can totally understand why people would choose just to go. However, as Christians, we believe that our lives are brief moments, and that it is not so much about how we died; it is much more about where we will spend eternity. This, too, is respectful, just as the decision of this Canadian gentleman.

{"Headline": "U Can\u2019t Talk to Ur Professor Like This", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byOn CampusChapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 At the start of my teaching career, when I was fresh out of graduate school, I briefly considered trying to pass myself off as a cool professor. Luckily, I soon came to my senses and embraced my true identity as a young fogey.Over the past decade or two, college students have become far more casual in their interactions with faculty members. My colleagues around the country grumble about students\u2019 sloppy emails and blithe informality.His webpage covers matters ranging from appropriate email addresses (if you\u2019re still using \u201ccutie_pie_98@hotmail.com,\u201d then \u201cit\u2019s time to retire that address\u201d) to how to be gracious when making a request (\u201cdo not make demands\u201d).Why are so many teachers bent out of shape because a student fails to call them \u201cProfessor\u201d or neglects to proofread an email? Are academics really that insecure? Is this just another case of scapegoating millennials for changes in the broader culture?Don\u2019t dismiss these calls for old-fashioned courtesy as a case of fragile ivory tower egos or misplaced nostalgia. There is a strong liberal case for using formal manners and titles to ensure respect for all university professionals, regardless of age, race or gender. More important, doing so helps defend the university\u2019s dearest values at a time when they are under continual assault.Later in the 19th century, etiquette manuals proliferated in bookstores, and Americans began to emphasize elaborate social protocols. As colleges expanded and academic disciplines professionalized, they mimicked the hierarchical cultures of the German research universities, where students cowered before \u201cHerr Professor Doktor.\u201dBut today, on the other side of the civil rights revolution, formal titles and etiquette can be tools to protect disempowered minorities and ensure that the modern university belongs to all of us. Students seem more inclined to use casual forms of address with professors who are young, nonwhite and female \u2014 some of whom have responded by becoming vocal defenders of old-fashioned propriety.Angela Jackson-Brown, a professor of English at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., told me that \u201cmost of my students will acknowledge that I\u2019m the first and only black teacher they\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Insisting on her formal title is important, she said: \u201cI feel the extra burden of having to go in from Day 1 and establish that I belong here.\u201dWhen Professor Jackson-Brown began teaching in the 1990s, most students respected her authority. But in recent years, that deference has waned (she blames the informality of social media). \u201cI go out of my way now to not give them access to my first name,\u201d she said. \u201cOn every syllabus, it states clearly: \u2018Please address me as Professor Jackson-Brown.\u2019 \u201dShe linked this policy to the atmosphere of mutual respect that she cultivates in her classes. These days, simply being considerate can feel like a political act. \u201cAfter this recent election, I\u2019ve had several female students come to me and say, \u2018I\u2019m noticing differences in how men are treating me.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set standards for them that they may not see outside the classroom, places where you\u2019d think there would be decorum.\u201dThis logic resonates with some students. \u201cHaving these titles forces everyone to give that respect,\u201d Lyndah Lovell, a graduating senior at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., said. \u201cThey know they have to use these manners with everyone. Even if the underlying thoughts of prejudice will still be there to some extent, you give these thoughts less power.\u201dInsisting on traditional etiquette is also simply good pedagogy. It\u2019s a teacher\u2019s job to correct sloppy prose, whether in an essay or an email. And I suspect that most of the time, students who call faculty members by their first names and send slangy messages are not seeking a more casual rapport. They just don\u2019t know they should do otherwise \u2014 no one has bothered to explain it to them. Explaining the rules of professional interaction is not an act of condescension; it\u2019s the first step in treating students like adults.That said, the teacher-student relationship depends on a special kind of inequality. \u201cOnce I refer to them as I would my best friend, I eliminate that boundary of clarity,\u201d Ms. Lovell told me. She recalled how awkward she felt when the head of the research lab where she worked asked undergraduates to call him Willy. \u201cAll my friends were saying: \u2018Oh, man, do we do this? He has a Ph.D. He\u2019s a professor. Is it O.K. to do this?\u2019 Sometimes I do, but he\u2019s a great mentor, and it\u2019s confusing. A lot of us like to preserve that distance.\u201dAlexis Delgado, a sophomore at the University of Rochester, is skeptical of professors who make a point of insisting on their title. \u201cI always think it\u2019s a power move,\u201d she told me. \u201cJust because someone gave you a piece of paper that says you\u2019re smart doesn\u2019t mean you can communicate those ideas to me. I reserve the right to judge if you\u2019re a good professor.\u201dBut she ruefully recalled one young professor who made the mistake of telling the class that he didn\u2019t care if they used his first name. \u201cHe didn\u2019t realize how far it would go, and we all thought, this is awkward,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no desire to be friends. I only wanted to ask questions.\u201dDuring office hours, we have frank conversations about career choices, mental health crises and family tribulations. But the last thing most students want from a mentor is the pretense of chumminess.Ms. Lovell said the very act of communicating more formally helps her get some distance on a personal problem. \u201cWhen I explain my difficulties and struggles, I try to explain in a mature way,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know: How would someone older than me think through this?\u201dThe facile egalitarianism of the first-name basis can impede good teaching and mentoring, but it also presents a more insidious threat. It undermines the message that academic titles are meant to convey: esteem for learning. The central endeavor of higher education is not the pursuit of money or fame but knowledge. \u201cThere needs to be some understanding that degrees mean something,\u201d Professor Jackson-Brown said. \u201cOtherwise, why are we encouraging them to get an education?\u201dThe values of higher education are not the values of the commercial, capitalist paradigm. At a time when corporate executives populate university boards and politicians demand proof of a diploma\u2019s immediate cash value, this distinction needs vigilant defense.The erosion of etiquette encourages students to view faculty members as a bunch of overeducated customer service agents. \u201cMore and more, students view the process of going to college as a business transaction,\u201d Dr. Tomforde, the math professor, told me. \u201cThey see themselves as a customer, and they view knowledge as a physical thing where they pay money and I hand them the knowledge \u2014 so if they don\u2019t do well on a test, they think I haven\u2019t kept up my side of the business agreement.\u201d He added, \u201cThey view professors in a way similar to the person behind the counter getting their coffee.\u201dBut if American culture in general \u2014 including many workplaces \u2014 has become less formal, are professors doing students a disservice by insisting on old-fashioned manners?When Anna Lewis left a Ph.D. program in English to work at a technology firm, she had to learn to operate in a different culture. Yet she has noticed that the informality of the tech industry can mislead new millennial employees.\u201cThey see they can call everyone from the C.E.O. down by their first name, and that can be confusing \u2014 because what they often don\u2019t realize is that there\u2019s still a high standard of professionalism,\u201d she told me. \u201cAt the intern level, these things are basic, but they require reminders: show up to meetings on time; be aware that you, yourself, are fully responsible for your work schedule. No one is going to tell you to attend a meeting.\u201d In other words, young graduates mistake informality for license to act unprofessionally.\u201cThere is some value in being schooled in more formal etiquette, developing personal and professional accountability, a work ethic and a level of empathy, which is very much valued in the tech industry,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.Here\u2019s an analogy: We should teach students traditional etiquette for the same reason most great abstract painters first mastered figurative painting. In order to abandon or riff on a form, you have to get the hang of its underlying principles.That means that professors should take the time to explain these principles, making it clear that learning how to write a professional email and relate to authority figures is not just preparation for a job after graduation. The real point is to stand up for the values that have made our universities the guardians of civilization.And if you\u2019re going to write an angry email telling me how wrong I am, I beg you: Please proofread it before you hit \u201csend.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Remember \u201cschools without walls\u201d or the \u201cnew math\u201d? Chromebooks are simply the latest fad. There is little evidence that computers in classrooms produce student outcomes superior to traditional teaching methods, at least when the latter are implemented properly.Elite private schools have computers, but they are far less central to the educational process. Instead, smaller class sizes and better teachers are emphasized. However, these are a lot more expensive than Chromebooks.SCOTT OCHILTREE, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:The big question everyone should be asking here is: Are we educating our kids to become active citizens or passive, unquestioning consumers? Which society do you want your kids to live in?To the Editor:I am the parent of two elementary-school children. Our school district has Google accounts for all the schoolchildren, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My children have learned how to use word processing, create spreadsheets, make and give presentations, and use email \u2014 all at a young age in a safe environment. They can log into their accounts from anywhere, do their homework (it even saves their work automatically every few seconds), communicate with their teachers and classmates, and even submit their homework online. All their work is saved and accessible anywhere, anytime. They both have cellphones and can also access their accounts on their phones.To the Editor:Chromebooks might make a teacher\u2019s job easier, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they will produce better educated and more responsible citizens, more creative kids or a highly skilled work force. The distractions that Chromebooks present offset many of the advantages. If Google or Apple or Facebook were serious about providing a useful tool for students, the platform would have looked much different. It would have limited access to the web, disallowing all sites but those with strictly educational value. We would never use textbooks jammed with advertisements, inappropriate pictures or games.I know there is no getting this toothpaste back in the tube, but the last thing children need is more screen time. Google has been virtually giving out Chromebooks like lollipops. It knew full well that the temptation to stray from schoolwork into cybertainment would be inevitable, providing Google with infinite data mining and marketing research opportunities.The Chromebook movement at the high school level has also spawned some very creative ways to \u201cshare\u201d homework, classroom assignments and screenshots of tests.RICK BOBRICK, MEDUSA, N.Y.The writer is a junior high school science teacher.To the Editor:Google\u2019s education apps group director, Jonathan Rochelle, questions the value of teaching students the skills of mathematical thinking when students can just \u201cask Google for the answer.\u201d The purpose of education should not be to teach students how to mindlessly search the internet and locate the answer to a question. Whether the class is mathematics, history, literature, science, civics or the arts, a good teacher will encourage students to think critically for themselves, ask their own questions and discover answers.It is hard for this reader to accept that a laptop with a bunch of apps will ever teach students more meaningfully than a skilled and inspiring teacher standing up in front, armed only with chalk, and challenging students to think.DAVID E. COHEN, WYCKOFF, N.J.To the Editor:This article gave copious details about how the tech giant Google won over numerous school districts around the country, and beat out Microsoft, but I wish it had focused more on what the Google tools were, and how they helped students gain knowledge and acquire inspiration.I was appalled by a quote from the director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, who disparaged rote memorization of equations in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dDuring my years in junior high school I learned the formula for solving quadratic equations and how it worked, and as an aerospace physicist for more than 40 years, I found I needed it often. By being stored in my memory it was at my immediate disposal.Of course we should use computers as we do libraries to look up information. But certain fundamental rules, laws, processes and shortcuts should be memorized, so they are conveniently available.

It figured out how to level the playing field across different types of schools and districts to help close the digital divide. And it has helped spawn a new generation of digital citizens who are learning how to use technology in a social, positive manner geared toward learning. Schools can be left scrambling to find ways to give each student full access to a good education. At low cost and with easy-to-use tools, Google has skinned the cat.Yes, Google also has almost unfettered access to a new generation of consumers. That\u2019s a price worth paying given the high returns to students in the form of contemporary, relevant learning.MATT LEVINSON, SEATTLEThe writer is the author of \u201cFrom Fear to Facebook: One School\u2019s Journey.\u201dTo the Editor:The article raises many valid concerns about the infiltration of Google into the lives of our children. The question, however, as to \u201cwhether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers\u201d is no longer relevant. They must be one and the same. I hope the public schools can embrace and facilitate this reality.PAUL FIEDLER, NEW HAVENAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Today: How to Beat the Hackers", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byNew York TodayGood morning on this shining Tuesday.Many of us assume our computer isn\u2019t vulnerable \u2014 perhaps because we don\u2019t use a PC, have strong passwords or update our operating systems regularly.We ran some of those assumptions by local computer security experts to see if they\u2019re true.I have a Mac, so I\u2019m not at risk.Not quite.\u201cMacs are definitely protected from cyberattack, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are invulnerable,\u201d said Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is an expert in digital forensics and security.I\u2019m good about not opening suspicious mail, so I won\u2019t be hacked.Great, but not good enough.Attacks through email are only one type of hacking, Professor Wandt said, and they are becoming more sophisticated. Don\u2019t open any link or attachment that you are not expecting to receive, even from people you might know, unless you confirm that they sent it.To avoid other types of hacking, maintain strong passwords, stay off public hot spots (like airport Wi-Fi) and get antivirus and malware protection for Windows systems, Professor Wandt said.I keep my computer\u2019s operating system updated, so I\u2019m good.Yes, with a caveat.Updating your system is critical, said John Otero, the director of the cybersecurity program at St. John\u2019s University and a former commanding officer of the computer crimes squad for the New York Police Department. But even a recently released update can be insecure or cause unforeseen problems, he said.Professor Otero and Professor Wandt suggested waiting a few days before installing updates to allow bugs to be fixed.I use a password manager, so my passwords are strong and well protected.Yes, but be careful.Password managers can help prevent someone from hacking your computer using the password, said Thaier Hayajneh, an associate computer science professor at Fordham University, but it\u2019s important to store your key securely. If hackers were to find it, they would have access to all of your stored passwords.Also, after using a public computer, you should immediately change your password from your home computer or phone, Professor Hayajneh said.I should buy extra encryption software if I really want to protect myself.Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201cThe average person today doesn\u2019t need third-party encryption software,\u201d Professor Wandt said. Most new Apple and Windows products have encryption built into their operating systems. (Once again, just be sure to turn it on.)Here\u2019s what else is happening:The Teleregister, as it was called, replaced the \u201cboard boys,\u201d who would use chalkboards to display stock prices.Less than six months later, the technology would be used to display a horrifying event in real time.Inside the stock exchange, people watched stock prices unwind on ticker tape, \u201clike friends about the bedside of a stricken friend.\u201dBrokers frantically tried to sell stocks, \u201charassing the clerks like impatient travelers trying to find out in two minutes\u2019 time the best route to Kalamazoo.\u201dOn that day, The Times reported, \u201cThere were no smiles. There were no tears either. Just the camaraderie of fellow-sufferers. Everybody wanted to tell his neighbor how much he had lost. Nobody wanted to listen. It was too repetitious a tale.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics, It Seems, Has Jolted Even the Idiot Box Awake", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byMediatorThe Idiot Box is wising up. But is it waking up?The idea is catching fire.As the big broadcast networks and ad buyers descend on Manhattan this week for the start of the annual advertising sales season known as upfronts, that Colbert-Fallon role reversal says everything you need to know about the political charge that\u2019s shaking up the television world.The thinking at the time had it that people wanted a party-like-it\u2019s-1999 late night experience, which Jimmy Fallon and Mr. Corden offered and Mr. Colbert, then struggling in the ratings, presumably did not. Now, as Alexander Nazaryan wrote in the Newsweek piece on Mr. Fallon\u2019s new standing, \u201cAmericans want rage.\u201dActually, it seems, a good subset of them want \u201cwoke.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to declare this the age of \u201cWoke TV,\u201d but that seems to tread too close to Pepsi/Kendall territory.When applied to television, both usages are in play. And, given that they\u2019re often referring to television that appeals to people distraught over the Trump presidency, perhaps the genre should be referred to as \u201cResistance TV.\u201dWhatever you call it, it\u2019s not for everyone. There\u2019s no concurrent surge in scripted television shows capturing the pro-Trump zeitgeist, though there would seem to be an audience for one (\u201calt-TV?\u201d).He says he\u2019s working on a new show that will do that.Resistance/Woke/Whatever-You-Want-to-Call-It TV didn\u2019t dominate the Top 10 shows this television season. According to Nielsen, among the most-watched shows were the sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which has an average audience of 14 million people on CBS; the zombie thriller \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the second-most watched show, with an average audience of more than 11 million people on AMC; \u201cThe Voice\u201d with more than 10.6 million people on NBC; and \u201cThis is Us\u201d with nearly 10 million people tuning in on NBC.The audience for the new streaming hit \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may pale in comparison, given that Hulu had 12 million users at the last official count. (Netflix counts nearly 99 million.)But something\u2019s going on for sure, considering that Hulu says the show\u2019s premiere a few weeks ago was the biggest in the company\u2019s short history.Based on the Margaret Atwood novel of the same name, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is about once-modern women forced into indentured servitude to bear children. The production team\u2019s embrace of the political moment is extraordinary by historical television standards.\u201cWe think that Planned Parenthood is an essential part of the fabric of this country and we don\u2019t want to back away from having an association,\u201d said the show\u2019s executive producer, Warren Littlefield.Mr. Littlefield probably wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to sign off on that kind of overtly political cross promotion in the job he\u2019s best known for, the former president of NBC Entertainment.His own career progression says it all. He helped preside over NBC\u2019s rise to the top of the broadcast television ratings, drawing audiences of tens of millions with hits like \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d That was \u201ca show about nothing,\u201d the perfect subject for those carefree days before September 11.That brings me to the key ingredients in all of this: television\u2019s nichification and a leap into original programming by the streaming services, which, led by Netflix and Amazon, took spending on original programming to almost $50 billion last year, according to Boston Consulting Group.In this Peak TV era, there\u2019s room for everything, especially shows that hit the political moment. That doesn\u2019t mean being merely topical or overt. \u201cThe idea of, \u2018Hey, be politically aware, deal with the politics of the moment\u2019 \u2014 good,\u201d David Nevins, the Showtime chief executive told me. \u201c\u2018Be politically correct\u2019 \u2014 the caricature of lefty identity politics \u2014 not so interesting.\u201dQuality has to be part of the equation. The money is there to do it, and the market is there for it. And this is where the idiot box\u2019s self-improvement comes in.That raises the question: If television got us here, can it get us out?The Mediator column on Monday, about the popularity of political issues on television shows, misstated the surname of the writer of an article on the online magazine The Root who commented about the interest in a new Netflix show \u201cDear White People.\u201d He is Jason Johnson, not Jones. The column also misidentified the celebrity who was the face of a Pepsi commercial that appeared to incorporate a Black Lives Matter protest.

{"Headline": "Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of India\u2019s leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States.The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers.\u201cBuilding talent pools that define the future of America is what we want to do,\u201d said Ravi Kumar S., Infosys\u2019s president, in a phone interview from Indiana.Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence, will be the first beneficiary of Infosys\u2019s hire-American efforts. The company intends to open a new technology and innovation office in or near Indianapolis in August, recruiting 100 new workers this year and several hundred more next year, with a goal of adding a total of 2,000 employees by 2021.Infosys said it would seek out three other sites for American expansion, looking for places that are close to clients and universities and where state and local governments are willing to offer significant economic incentives. The company already has an innovation hub in Silicon Valley.The majority of Infosys\u2019s business is in the United States, and it typically receives several thousand H-1B visas every year to bring in mostly entry-level Indian programmers who move from project to project at companies in industries like banking, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing and energy.Infosys has hired more American college graduates in the last couple of years, said Mr. Kumar. And now clients in the United States want the company to have even more people on site locally. So it must expand its American work force significantly, he said.A look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.\u201cWe polled our customers and a lot of our newest locations require a lot of presence,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThis year, we are taking it to scale.\u201dMr. Kumar declined to say whether Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrant workers had influenced its decisions.Whether Infosys follows through on its ambitious goal of hiring 10,000 Americans in the next two years remains to be seen. The company, which employs more than 200,000 people globally, has slowed its overall hiring to a trickle as revenue growth has stalled. Mr. Kumar said the American expansion plans depend on expected client demand, as well as whether it can find and train enough college graduates with skills in artificial intelligence and other technical fields that it needs.Indiana\u2019s governor, Eric Holcomb, aggressively pursued Infosys, the company said at a news conference with Mr. Holcomb. Infosys already had a small work force of about 140 people in the state.In February, Indiana state officials were approached about a potential investment by Infosys executives via the Indiana India Business Council, a local business group, according to Jim Schellinger, the state\u2019s secretary of commerce.Mr. Schellinger and his team traveled to India in mid-March, meeting with Infosys\u2019s senior leadership and visiting its campuses in Bangalore and Mysore to make their pitch for the state. At the end of the month, Infosys representatives sat down with Mr. Holcomb and agreed to go ahead with plans to invest in the state.\u201cThey\u2019re going to hire a wide variety of people including people with four year degrees as well as two-year ones,\u201d said Mr. Schellinger. \u201cThese are high wage jobs, including software developers and architects.\u201dMr. Holcomb was ebullient at Tuesday\u2019s announcement in Indianapolis, thanking Infosys for showing confidence in the state\u2019s tech work force.\u201cYou can\u2019t even spell Indiana without starting with India,\u201d he said. \u201cToday is just the beginning of a great partnership.\u201dThe state is offering Infosys incentives worth up to $31 million for the project. Indiana intends to give the company $500,000 in training funds and $15,250 in conditional tax credits per new job created.Infosys argues that it saves money for major American companies and allows them to operate more efficiently.Critics say that companies like Infosys have taken advantage of the H-1B program, which is designed to complement the American skilled labor force, by bringing in workers who ultimately undercut it by taking lower wages. While the program is relatively small, accounting for about 85,000 visas per year, it has become a lightning rod in the debate about large companies outsourcing American jobs.The proposed changes to the H-1B visa program have alarmed Indian companies and government officials, since Indians receive about two-thirds of those visas. The country\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, discussed the visa issue with Mr. Trump in February, and Indian tech executives raised it with members of Congress during a visit to Washington about two months ago.\u201cOur objective was to make sure that a well-thought-out process was put in place,\u201d said R. Chandrashekhar, president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, India\u2019s leading tech trade group, in a phone interview after Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order.Like American tech companies, the Indian outsourcers have trouble finding enough qualified Americans to fill jobs, he said. \u201cIf the Indian companies are not able to get the skills that are needed in the U.S. and not bring in skilled workers from somewhere else, then the only option is to move the job out of the United States or leave the job undone,\u201d he said.As one of the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, Infosys could be hit hard by changes to the system. Major American technology companies like Facebook and Qualcomm also use the program to hire foreign talent, arguing that they cannot find enough skilled workers in the United States. Still, outsourcing companies like Infosys have caused the most controversy.One suggestion \u2014 that H-1B visas be given to companies paying the highest wages \u2014 could particularly affect outsourcing companies like Infosys, which usually do not offer wages as high as the likes of Facebook. To that end, new operations in America could help offset those difficulties.Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalistic approach to business puts international companies in a difficult position. But for many Asian companies, it is a position they are familiar with, with the rhetoric reminiscent of the politics of business in their home countries. In recent years, India has introduced a so-called Make in India industrial policy to push companies like Apple to build out manufacturing plants in the country. Both Japan and China often exhibit the kind of economic nationalism that the Trump administration has championed.Still, their pledges won an endorsement from Mr. Trump. It is not clear whether such moves will ultimately help win political advantages from a president who has been skeptical about the benefits of trade agreements.Nelson D.

{"Headline": "Leave Your Safe Spaces: The 2017 Commencement Address at Hampden-Sydney College", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOn CampusMembers of the class of 2017: congratulations.Very soon, you will hold in your hands the diploma of a great and storied college. Very soon, you\u2019ll be gone from this gorgeous campus; this nurturing, stimulating, protective environment \u2014 a place that, in a manner of speaking, has been your safe space for these past few years.So let me ask you: Are you ready \u2014 really ready \u2014 to leave this safe space?I\u2019ve been thinking about safe spaces a lot lately. For those of you with the good fortune never to have heard the term, a \u201csafe space\u201d is not, as you may suppose, a concrete-reinforced room where you can ride out a tornado. It isn\u2019t a bulletproof car, either.Instead, a \u201csafe space\u201d denotes a place, usually on campus, where like-minded people \u2014 often sharing the same race, gender, sexual orientation or political outlook \u2014 can spend time together without having to encounter the expression of any ideas or opinions that they do not endorse.Here\u2019s an example. In the fall of 2014 a student at Brown University got wind that her school was going to host a debate between two women, one a feminist and the other a libertarian, on the subject of campus sexual assault.The student feared that exposure to such a debate could be \u201cdamaging\u201d to people in the audience, some of whom might find their experiences of sexual assault \u201cinvalidated\u201d by what the debaters had to say.So the student organized a \u201csafe space.\u201d As described by the essayist Judith Shulevitz in The New York Times, the space was a room \u201cequipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play-Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma.\u201dNow that sounds harmless enough. And if such a space offered comfort to the people who used it, so much the better.After all, if a college or university should accept the principle of a \u201csafe space\u201d in a single designated room, why should that same principle not extend to the classroom, the lecture hall, dormitories, college newspapers, chat rooms, social media and so on?I\u2019m sorry to say that the process I\u2019m describing \u2014 Orwellian though it seems to me, in that it turns supposed victims into moral bullies \u2014 is increasingly becoming a dominating fact of life on colleges and universities across America.In the name of being \u201csafe,\u201d it is becoming increasingly difficult for campus administrators to guarantee the physical safety of controversial visiting speakers.In the name of being \u201csafe,\u201d the job security of professors and administrators has been put at increasing risk \u2014 lest they espouse, teach or merely fail to denounce a point of view that contradicts the political certitudes of the moment.In the name of being \u201csafe,\u201d students with traditional religious values or conservative political views now feel decidedly unsafe about expressing their views on campus.And in the name of being safe, we are gravely jeopardizing the central task of any serious liberal education, which is not \u2014 or not merely \u2014 the transmission of knowledge.It is, rather, the cultivation of a certain kind of spirit: a passion for inquiry; an insistence on asking hard questions and challenging received wisdom; a reveling in argument; a productive tension between self-confidence and self-doubt; a robust faith in the ultimate attainability of truth; and a humble acceptance that our understanding of the truth will almost always be something less than complete.This is what education is, or ought to be, about. This is how we educate young men and women toward the moral and political responsibilities of democratic self-rule. This is how we lay the conditions for scientific and social progress. This is how we lay sturdy foundations for a truly civil society. Thomas Jefferson said it best in his first Inaugural Address: \u201cError of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\u201dThis should be a standard for every free society \u2014 and for every great college and university.From everything I have read about Hampden-Sydney, this is the education you have received here. I hope you use it well. But I need to level with you: You\u2019ll be facing an uphill battle.Across the country, hundreds of thousands of your peers are also celebrating their commencements, receiving their diplomas, starting out in the world. But not all of their educations have been liberal in the truest sense of the word.Instead of being educated to a cultured skepticism, too many have been educated to a fervent certitude. Instead of embracing, or at least respecting, heterodox or unsettling ideas, they prefer to retreat into settled convictions. Instead of wanting to engage controversial discussions, they\u2019d just as soon shut them down.And instead of wanting to emerge at last from the cocoons of their \u201csafe spaces,\u201d they want to extend the domain of those spaces into the next stages of their lives.Now, don\u2019t get me wrong: The \u201cthey\u201d in those sentences consists, for the most part, of nice, well-intentioned, intelligent, hard-working and often high-achieving people.Today, we live in a world that makes it easy to continue inhabiting these safe spaces, above all when it comes to politics, public policy and ideology.On social media, you follow, share, \u201clike\u201d and retweet the people you agree with \u2014 while you ignore, unfriend, remove or block those you don\u2019t.If you\u2019re a conservative news junkie, Fox News is your safe space, even if you\u2019d probably never call it that. You can watch it for days \u2014 indeed, weeks, months and years \u2014 on end without ever encountering a persuasively contrary opinion, at least one that isn\u2019t instantly derided as unworthy of serious consideration. If you\u2019re a liberal, it\u2019s the same story on MSNBC.When you open the op-ed pages of a newspaper, you\u2019ll turn first to the columnist with whom you already know you\u2019re likely to agree, so that you can see your already-correct opinions repeated and ratified once more. As for the writers with whom you disagree \u2014 whether it\u2019s Krugman or Stephens, Kristof or Krauthammer \u2014 you\u2019ve already concluded that they\u2019re idiots or liars, so you\u2019ll either skip over them or read them with smirking disdain.And so it goes. We all believe that the system of checks and balances is a good idea for a well-functioning and prudent government. But where are the checks and balances in our own thinking \u2014 the check that whispers, \u201cYou could be wrong\u201d; the balance that suggests, \u201cThere\u2019s another way of thinking about it\u201d?This is what I fear we are at risk of losing in America today. Too many of our schools are producing students who have never learned properly to engage, understand or accept an alternative point of view. Too many of our citizens want to hear only from the people whose views they already share, and who will never change their minds about a thing. And too many of our media outlets see no problem in catering exclusively to these increasingly narrow and illiberal tastes.We worry a lot these days about political polarization, the unpleasant choices such polarization leaves us with at the ballot box, its effects on what used to be our common values, our shared sense of nationhood. What we fail to recognize is that this polarization is a result of us getting exactly what we want \u2014 only to rue the consequences.A month ago, I chose to do my small part in trying to swim against this particular current. After 16 productive and happy years as a conservative writer with the staunchly conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, I decided to switch teams to the mostly liberal editorial page of The New York Times.In case you\u2019re wondering, my opinions are just as conservative, reactionary and antediluvian as they\u2019ve always been. My salary is pretty much the same. And, no, I wasn\u2019t pushed out of my last job.But I did have a gnawing sense that it was time to stop talking to my own side, preaching to my own choir. I wanted to write for an audience that might not be wholly receptive \u2014 and might even be openly hostile \u2014 to what I have to say.In short, I thought it was time to leave my own safe space: to take the gamble that I might be able to sway readers not always inclined to agree with me, and to accept the possibility that they, in turn, might sway me.Has it been fun? Yes. Has it been rough? A bit. Has it been worth it? Ask me again in a few years. But I\u2019m optimistic.So here\u2019s my advice to you: Get out of your own safe spaces. Define what your intellectual comfort zone is \u2014 and leave it. Enhance your tolerance for discordant voices. Narrow your criteria for what\u2019s beyond the pale. Read the authors or watch the talking heads with whom you disagree. Treat those disagreements as a whetting stone to sharpen your own arguments. Resist the temptation to call people names.By all means master the art of being pugnacious in argument \u2014 but as a pugnacious dialogian, not a petulant didact.Go beyond that. Befriend your intellectual adversaries. Assume that they\u2019re smart, that their motives are honorable and that they are your fellow travelers in a quest to better understand a common set of challenges. Master the civilized art of agreeable disagreement. Try to remember that words are not weapons, and that politics is not warfare, and debate is not a death sport. Learn that \u2014 in politics no less than in marriage \u2014 it\u2019s a bad idea to go to bed angry with one another. Have an argument, then have a drink, together.Members of the class of 2017: Do not close your ears to opposing points of view. Otherwise you cannot learn. Do not foreclose the possibility that you might change your mind. Otherwise you cannot grow. Do not lose sight of the fact that you are not in possession of the whole and only truth. Otherwise you will fail to notice your mistakes, and so suffer their consequences.Above all, do not forget that the world would be a duller and darker place if everyone thought as you did, and if all our thoughts were safe ones, and if there were nothing to bestir our minds, and inflame our senses, and rouse our consciences, and churn the warm but too-placid waters in which we swim at our own peril.Safe spaces, physical and intellectual, are for children. You are grown-ups now. If your diplomas mean anything, it\u2019s that it is time you leave those spaces behind forever.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charcoal or Gas? Depends on What You\u2019re Grilling", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byGas or charcoal? It is a question that has bedeviled American consumers and cooks for decades, since the first LazyMan propane grill went on sale in the 1950s and left the Smiths with their briquette-fueled brazier looking jealously over the fence at the Joneses and their new outdoor science stove.In the abstract, there is no one correct answer. You can have affirmative responses to the use of either fuel. You can stack them as high as summer corn.For instance: You get great smoky flavor and an unparalleled crust from cooking over or beside coals or wood. That said, on a Wednesday night there is little easier than lighting a gas grill after softball practice and cooking a bunch of brats for the team. There are positives and negatives to each form of fire, depending on what you are cooking, and when and for how long.\u201cWe are way past \u2018versus,\u2019\u201d said Adam Perry Lang, a barbecue chef from New York who built his career on food enhanced by the flavors and scent of wood smoke. Mr. Lang said that at home, he often cooked over propane, and that, in some cases, he actually preferred gas to charcoal or wood. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten very good,\u201d he said of gas grills. \u201cYou can make some really, really good food with a gas grill.\u201dA lot of people do, or try to. Roughly 180 million Americans have some kind of grill in the yard, on the patio or sitting out on the deck, according the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Association, a trade group. Of that number, said Eric Davis, a spokesman for the association, roughly 62 percent have gas grills, and 50 percent own charcoal-fired ones \u2014 which suggests that at least 12 percent (or something in the neighborhood of 20 million Americans) might employ both gas and charcoal grills in their pursuit of outdoor cooking joy. Mr. Davis is among them. \u201cMy gas one is a little more convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cIt all depends on how much time I have.\u201dGas grills are, of course, a marvel of expediency, and among the simplest ways to keep heat and smoke out of your kitchen during the summer months. They are ideal, said the chef Josh Cohen, who owns bars and restaurants across north Brooklyn, for cooking fish, for roasting vegetables, for making a fast dinner of sausages and peppers. He suggested brining thin fillets of fish in a solution of salt and sugar for about 10 minutes, then patting them dry and grilling them gently on one side over gas on a hot, clean, lightly oiled grill. \u201cOnly about three to five minutes, and you\u2019re good,\u201d he said. There is no need to flip them until you\u2019re putting the fish on a platter to serve.What gas grills are not good for, Mr. Cohen and others said, is high-heat searing. Even the ones that scored highest in The Sweethome\u2019s testing were ultimately unsuited for cooking a pricey, well-marbled steak, or even a good hamburger, unless you deploy a cast-iron pan or steel plancha on top of the grates to help concentrate the heat and allow the meat to cook in its own fat.Matt Hinckley, a chef and the proprietor of Hinckley\u2019s Fancy Meats in Orlando, Fla., said he did just that. \u201cApartments aren\u2019t geared for cast-iron searing,\u201d Mr. Hinckley said. \u201cIt sets off the smoke detectors every time. People watch these TV chefs making a cast-iron pan white hot and throwing a steak on it. I can do it outside and get a great sear on my steak, without compromising the air quality of my living conditions.\u201dFor Mr. Hinckley, who said he cooked over propane \u201cprobably 70 percent of the time,\u201d a gas grill is simply easier to deal with for daily cooking, especially in the dense humidity of an Orlando summer. \u201cIt\u2019s great for low and slow grilling,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially with the fattier cuts, propane requires less maintenance. Those flare-ups over coals can cause problems.\u201dMr. Lang is of the same mind. \u201cYou put a really well-marbled steak over live fire,\u201d he said, \u201cit can be really volatile.\u201d For meats high in fat, he also recommends a gas-fired grill or the use of a pan or plancha. \u201cStart the meat in the pan,\u201d he said, \u201crender some fat, then kiss the steak onto the fire at the end for a crust. You want browning to occur before you start the caramelization. That\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201dAs for cooking over charcoal or wood? It is a technique practically as old as humankind. It is not particularly difficult, as any cave man would tell you. But it is more complicated than simply turning a knob on a stove. You have to build and bank and tend a fire. You have to pay close attention to where it is hot and where it is not.Grilling that way may not be the best use of time on a weeknight, but on weekends \u2014 or any time you can get free to concentrate on your cooking \u2014 a charcoal grill cannot be beat. (That is not just idle opinion. The Sweethome\u2019s side-by-side testing of both hamburgers and barbecue chicken cooked on gas and charcoal grills delivered a flavor win to charcoal by a wide margin, regardless of the model.)Good things to grill over charcoal? Steak, in Mr. Hinckley\u2019s opinion, so long as it isn\u2019t too fatty or too slicked in oil. \u201cI\u2019m always going to go toward charcoal for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to generate enough heat with a propane grill.\u201d Also: chicken, pork, fruit and anything that will be cooked long enough in the presence of smoke and indirect heat to qualify as barbecue.For his part, Mr. Lang suggested \u201cchoice cuts, less fatty proteins, even skinless chicken\u201d for the charcoal grill, where they can pick up the scent of the smoke beneath them. \u201cYou can just lacquer them like in Japanese cooking, with a baste,\u201d he said.But he cautioned that much the same could be done on a propane grill.\u201cI love everything about wood and charcoal, but not at the expense of people stepping away from grilling altogether because it\u2019s complicated to light and tend a fire,\u201d Mr. Lang said. Grill on gas if you have to, or if you want to: \u201cThere\u2019s no B team anymore,\u201d he said.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keith Olbermann Was Once Cable News\u2019s Liberal Standard-Bearer. Now He\u2019s Missing Its Boom Times.", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byNotebookKeith Olbermann doesn\u2019t look much like a warrior. His gray hair is giving way to white, his midsection threatens the buttons of his sport coats and he walks gingerly, with a gnarly limp from an aging knee. When I visited him in late January, he was ill, hoarse and racked with fits of coughing. But when he hobbles into his studio and sits, a table shields his less flattering proportions, accentuating broad shoulders and an icy blue gaze. And when he starts to speak \u2014 confidently, quickly, alternately gesticulating or pretending to read from a stack of papers \u2014 he looks more like the man he used to be: the broadcaster who helped not only revolutionize sports news, but also invent a new mode of liberal cable-news political commentary.His current show \u2014 a series of web shorts titled \u201cThe Resistance\u201d \u2014 is not on cable and was not supposed to exist at all. It began last September as \u201cThe Closer\u201d: six- or seven-minute monologues, written and performed by Olbermann and posted twice a week, on YouTube, the web and social media, by GQ magazine. It was expected to end after Election Day, but Trump\u2019s win changed that. On Nov. 16, one week after Hillary Clinton conceded the election, Olbermann sat down at the desk of a spartan set constructed mostly of blankets, inside a cavernous photo studio on the 24th floor of 1 World Trade Center, and declared war on Donald Trump. \u201cSince no Democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of Politics Inc. to take on the responsibility of the resistance,\u201d he said, \u201cI, with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement, volunteer myself.\u201dA dozen years ago, from behind a desk on MSNBC, Olbermann reached career highs railing against President George W. Bush, as well as the Republican Party, conservative media and rivals like Bill O\u2019Reilly. Back then, less than a decade after the debut of Fox News, the political right had already created an enormously profitable and influential universe built on partisan news and, more centrally, white rage. Liberals were scrambling to figure out what a left-leaning response to it might look like. Only a few scattered voices (Jon Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Michael Moore\u2019s documentaries, Al Franken\u2019s books) were breaking through, and some grand plans (like the Air America radio network) struggled to make an impact anything like their right-wing counterparts. It was Olbermann \u2014 the anchor whose five-year stint at ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter\u201d helped bring a wry, freewheeling humor to sports news \u2014 who answered the question of what a fiery liberal television commentator might look like. After Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004, Olbermann\u2019s show, \u201cCountdown,\u201d began injecting commentary into its news reports, thrashing against the administration and right-wing media with a sense of righteous rage. Its ratings soared, and Olbermann kept up his pious lectures through Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 election. \u201cI think I helped open a door for criticism against Bush and particularly the politicizing of terror in 2005, 2006, 2007,\u201d he told me.These were the years during which Olbermann had a prime-time cable-news show, millions of loyal viewers and a salary to match. Things are obviously different now. During the last week of April, he appeared as a guest on the first episode of \u201cThe President Show,\u201d a Comedy Central program hosted by a Trump impersonator. \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d the faux president asked, \u201cthere\u2019s a love-hate relationship between the mainstream media and the Donald Trump administration in a way that\u2019s actually enhanced my presidency?\u201d Olbermann agreed: \u201cYes, I think 100 percent. You\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship.\u201d It was hard to know quite what to make of the interview \u2014 hard to tell how seriously the impersonator was taking Olbermann, and hard to tell how seriously to take Olbermann\u2019s own self-mythologizing \u2014 but very easy to recall that \u201cThe Resistance\u201d will lose its reason for being the instant Trump\u2019s presidency ends.Olbermann has a favorite historical figure, Cincinnatus, whose story he likes to tell. It goes like this: Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was a Roman consul and military leader until 460 B.C., at which point he retired to a modest farm and planned to work happily for the rest of his days. He plowed his fields in peace for two years. Then, one day, he was interrupted by visiting Roman senators, who told him he\u2019d been named dictator \u2014 and that a Roman army was being besieged by plebeians on nearby Mount Algidus. Cincinnatus raised an army and marched it to Mount Algidus, defeating the plebeians in a day. Rome was in his debt; he had control of the military and full dictatorial powers. He could have ruled Rome for life, but he didn\u2019t. This is the part Olbermann loves: not that Cincinnatus saved Rome, but that afterward, he simply returned to his farm.\u201cHis dogs!\u201d a producer volunteered. But Olbermann corrected her. \u201cSports.\u201dOlbermann says they first crossed paths in 1984, when Olbermann was a young sportscaster and Trump was the loud new owner of the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League, which folded in 1986 after only three seasons. Two decades later, Trump joined Olbermann under NBC\u2019s corporate umbrella, as the star of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which first aired in January 2004 \u2014 the year Bush was re-elected, and the year before \u201cCountdown\u201d became a beacon for millions of liberal fans. One of those fans, Olbermann says, was Trump, still in the days when he moved in left-leaning New York circles and donated mostly to Democratic campaigns. According to Olbermann, Trump would tell him stories about how liberal he was, encouraging him to keep attacking Bush and commending him for championing the rising career of Barack Obama. (The Trump White House declined to comment.) This, Olbermann told me, is why he thinks Trump is mentally unfit for office: He can\u2019t reconcile the man he knew with the one who ran for president, and is unnerved by the difference. The Trump he knew, he claims, had \u201cno bluster.\u201d Accounts from others who have known Trump for decades say his personality has been entirely consistent \u2014 even if it makes him prone to professing different beliefs depending on the situation.On \u201cThe Resistance,\u201d Olbermann insists that Trump is genuinely mentally ill; in person, he says that his psychologist friends, despite never having treated the president, have remotely \u201cdiagnosed\u201d Trump with any number of mental illnesses, up to and including psychopathy. The argument feels wishful and familiar, bringing to mind challenges to Obama\u2019s birth or religion from fearful, frustrated or opportunistic voices on the right.Another thing Olbermann might find difficult to reconcile is the reversal in the two men\u2019s fortunes. Twelve years ago, Olbermann was a player in the American political scene, with \u201cCountdown\u201d helping solidify MSNBC as the chief cable-news destination for liberal commentary; Trump, meanwhile, was emerging from a corporate bankruptcy into a role as a reality-TV host. Then came 2011. That January, Olbermann left MSNBC three months after being suspended for donating to three Democrats\u2019 campaigns. In March, Trump entered the political conversation by insinuating that President Obama might not be an American citizen. Now Trump is president, and Olbermann is not on television at all.In the same way that Olbermann\u2019s work alongside Dan Patrick on \u201cSportsCenter\u201d created a generation of highlights shows and sportscasters following their wry, geeky style, the work Olbermann did on MSNBC birthed its own replacements. He is quick to name the mainstays of the network\u2019s current prime-time lineup \u2014 Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell \u2014 as people who guest-hosted for him years ago. This is an important year for each of them. Liberals woke up on Nov. 9 under a cloud of dread that hasn\u2019t dissipated in the months since, creating a crucial moment for left-leaning political commentators on TV. In April, MSNBC\u2019s weekday prime-time viewership was larger than CNN\u2019s \u2014 the third straight month the network placed second among the cable news\u2019s big three, trailing Fox News. Maddow, MSNBC\u2019s biggest star and the tentpole of its evening lineup, has the most-watched and fastest-growing prime-time show on cable news.Olbermann was valuable during the Bush years because although political outrages abounded, no one else on TV seemed all that outraged. When stolid Tom Brokaw was the prevailing type, Olbermann was angry and sanctimonious. Liberal political commentary has shifted in the years since. The most prominent liberal commentators now, like Maddow and Hayes, are more grounded and forensic, delving into policy without drifting away from its human impact. This mode positions them and their fans on the left as smart, sane and righteous people in an age when so many prominent figures on the right \u2014 from Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh to the president himself \u2014 profit mostly from being angry and loud. It also has a dramatic range that Olbermann, known mostly for fiery to-camera oratory, tends not to.Olbermann told me he talked to MSNBC for over a year about rejoining the network, but they asked him for a show with no commentary; he didn\u2019t see the point. (An MSNBC source familiar with the situation confirms that there were talks, but says they fell through for a variety of reasons.) Olbermann also told me he had negotiated with CNN: \u201cThere was an offer, then there wasn\u2019t an offer, then there was an offer. And Trump didn\u2019t like me, and apparently exerted influence on that.\u201d (A CNN spokeswoman says there were brief preliminary conversations about Olbermann joining its HLN spinoff, not the flagship channel, and that they took place well over a year ago, without any involvement from Trump.)In March 2016, Olbermann wrote a column for The Washington Post announcing that he was moving out of Trump Palace. Trump responded in an email to CNN Money the following month. \u201cKeith is a failed broadcaster, and the people in the building couldn\u2019t stand him,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe is just trying to use \u2018Trump\u2019 to get publicity and stay relevant. The prices of Trump apartments are today the highest they\u2019ve been. When people find out he is leaving Trump Palace, prices will probably go up.\u201d It was the last time Trump would publicly acknowledge him.Back in 2010, Olbermann used a Major League Baseball blog he was running to take a shot at one of ESPN\u2019s most celebrated personalities, Bill Simmons. \u201cI am again left to marvel,\u201d he wrote, \u201chow somebody can rise to a fairly prominent media position with no discernible insight or talent, save for an apparent ability to mix up a vast bowl of word salad very quickly.\u201d Simmons responded in a tweet: \u201cKO, please know the feeling is mutual. You\u2019re my worst case scenario for my career in 12 yrs: a pious, unlikable blowhard who lives alone.\u201dIt was cruel because it was factual. Olbermann is a bachelor with no children. His loves of history and sports seem less like escapes than parts of his job. He seems to have lived for little else until four and a half years ago, when he adopted his first dog. He\u2019d never owned one before. \u201cI avoided it for many years through, like, 12 girlfriends,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen one time the girlfriend was young enough that the family dog was dying.\u201d They went into a pet store and emerged with a Maltese. A year later, he adopted a second. \u201cAnd after I got them, I was calling all my friends who had dogs and saying, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you tell me this is the meaning of life?\u2019 \u201d Olbermann now spends two hours a day outside with his pets; before the election, when the idea of a Trump presidency still seemed unlikely, he shot an episode of \u201cThe Closer\u201d in which he examined whether Trump had ever owned a dog. (He couldn\u2019t find any evidence.) When he dies, he imagined, \u201cmy last thoughts would be about the dogs. My next-to-last thoughts will be a flashback to how much I enjoyed \u2018SportsCenter.\u2019 \u201d Then he corrected himself. \u201cI think my last thoughts will be: I pushed back against bad things.\u201dHe tracks his show\u2019s traffic obsessively and appears to spend much of most days on Twitter, sharing links to episodes and directing antagonistic tweets at Trump. He emailed me several times after we met with the average number of page views \u201cThe Resistance\u201d was earning, boasting that the number of views per episode was between three and four million \u2014 numbers that would rival Fox News\u2019s prime-time audience and surpass those of MSNBC and CNN. The difficulty with this comparison is that Olbermann isn\u2019t a television anchor anymore. His work is online, where a \u201cview\u201d consists of three seconds on Twitter or Facebook, and 30 on YouTube. Television is a commitment: You can\u2019t watch 10 shows at one time, so your choice to tune in at 8 to watch Tucker Carlson is a choice against Chris Hayes or Anderson Cooper. Online, you can open dozens of tabs, click away and never come back.\u201cHe\u2019s still looking out the side of his eye at cable,\u201d his GQ editor, Geoff Gagnon, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s his world. For years he lived in a profession shaped by certain values, by certain viewership metrics, that judge success in a certain way.\u201d Cincinnatus\u2019 fight required him to leave his peaceful farm, but Olbermann is currently fighting to return to the place he feels most at home. \u201cIf CNN called tomorrow and said, \u2018We resolved the thing from two years ago; do you want to do the 9 o\u2019clock?\u2019 I\u2019d sign,\u201d he admitted, \u201cand then go, \u2018By the way, what are you paying me?\u2019 \u201dAs we ate our oysters, an older couple got up from a nearby banquette and, on their way to the exit, approached Olbermann. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d the man said. \u201cI do miss you. Just terrible.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Olbermann replied warmly. When the man apologized for interrupting, Olbermann cut him off. \u201cNo, please. Watch me online,\u201d Olbermann said. \u201cGo to GQ.com; I do commentaries three days a week.\u201d\u201cYou know, the news is just terrible,\u201d the man said.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same without you,\u201d his wife agreed.\u201cThank you,\u201d Olbermann said again. Then: \u201cFind me online; I\u2019m doing the commentaries online.\u201d\u201cGQ.com?\u201d the man asked.\u201cGQ.com.\u201d\u201cCable news,\u201d the old man lamented. \u201cThere\u2019s no news.\u201d And then the couple turned away.Greg Howard is a David Carr fellow for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bangladesh Police Raid Gay Men\u2019s Gathering", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 The police in Bangladesh raided a monthly gathering of gay men at a community center on the outskirts of Dhaka early Friday and arrested 27 men on suspicion of drug-related offenses, officials said.The men, mostly college and graduate students in their 20s, were found with drugs, condoms and lubricant, but because they were not observed to be engaging in sex, the police did not charge them with homosexuality, which is a crime in Bangladesh. The police also arrested the owner of the community center.Neighbors had complained to the police that outsiders were coming into the area, Keraniganj, and accused them of engaging in \u201csuspicious, illegal activities,\u201d said Jahangir Hossain Matubbar, the commanding officer of an elite police unit.\u201cYesterday when we arrested them, they did not complete the homosexuality act,\u201d Mr. Matubbar said. \u201cThey were preparing for that.\u201dThese attacks have taken place against a backdrop of other violence carried out by Islamist militants against secular activists and writers in the country.In the raid on Friday, the police confiscated 250 grams of marijuana and stimulants known as \u201cyaba,\u201d made from methamphetamine, at the community center.Mr. Matubbar said that the men arrested at the community center lived in different parts of the country and communicated through Facebook. He said that the group had been formed at least six months ago, and that it met about once a month. Its members would pool their resources to rent the community center for a night for about $124, he said.\u201cWe were very suspicious about them,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a long time they have been gathering there.\u201d He said people in the area were concerned about whether any \u201cillegal activity or any militant activity\u201d was taking place at the meetings.\u201cPeople informed us and we rushed there to find why they had been gathering there,\u201d he said.Human rights activists and gay rights advocates have long opposed the law against homosexuality in Bangladesh, which dates back to the colonial era.\u201cWhy are these young people arrested?\u201d Imran Sarker, an activist and blogger, asked. \u201cWe always opposed that law.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a 23-Year-Old With Mild Anxiety and a Charmed Life Became the Lying, Sobbing, Lovesick Toast of Broadway", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Ben Platt wrecks himself onstage in \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d Surviving it takes practice \u2014 and has made him a favorite to win a Tony Award.Supported byEven if you don\u2019t know Mr. Platt, this is the instinctive response to his performance, a nightly display of almost unbearable anguish and likely to earn him a Tony Award on June 11. You\u2019re stunned by the intensity of it, and then you immediately think of the toll it must take on him night after night. It seems impossible to sustain, and yet he\u2019s been doing it now since mid-November, a feat that has made him not just musical-theater famous, but also Met Gala, late-night-TV, Time 100-most-influential-people-in-the-world famous.A lot has been said about the extraordinary physicality of Mr. Platt\u2019s performance: the hunched posture he maintains throughout the show, the facial tics and nail-biting and the repetitive worrying of his fingers at the seam of his pants, the way in which he never for a moment loses this finely grained physical expression of Evan, even in the midst of the 11 songs that he performs, three of which are wrenching solos. He conveys such longing and loneliness and guilt and shame in those songs, with his voice, of course, but also through the pained contortions of his body and face.It\u2019s hard to think of a character in a musical who is so relatable to so many people in the crowd each night \u2014 teenagers struggling with anxiety, parents clinging to whatever fine thread still connects them to their kids, people who are ashamed of something they\u2019ve done or who fear they are unlovable. It seems like a more intense level of responsibility, psychologically speaking, than most Broadway stars have to bear.\u201cI have my own issues with anxiety and self-love, just like everybody does,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to suggest that just because I\u2019ve been given this role, I know how to fix other people\u2019s problems. I want to honor what\u2019s happening, the way people are responding, but \u2014 I\u2019m still trying to understand where to draw the line.\u201dAfter small talk with a family friend in the blue room (\u201cI remember your two very cute children!\u201d), he had the final hurdle of his performing week: the fans. He was off to sign autographs and then head straight uptown to his apartment to do nothing but order from Seamless and watch TV and embark, literally, on \u201c20 straight hours of mouth-shutting.\u201dAt the bottom of the stairs, an imposing-looking bodyguard was waiting to shadow him while he greeted the crowd that had gathered beyond the stage door. It was four or five people deep, and everyone erupted when he stepped outside.What follows is the gut-twisting cascade familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever borne the weight of, or been wounded by, a lie that can\u2019t be contained. Evan encourages the Murphys to believe he and Connor were friends; he grows close to the family, their grief alleviated by the stories he tells them of his relationship with their son, and Zoe begins to fall in love with him; eventually he gives an excruciating address at a school assembly, which on the surface is about Connor, but really is his own fantasy of connection and unconditional love. A video of the address goes viral, and Evan becomes a kind of hero for the world\u2019s lonely souls. There\u2019s no reeling the lie back in.Mr. Platt said he was initially being considered for the \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d role of Jared, the title character\u2019s wisecracking friend, who spends much of the musical hurling abuse at Evan but is all in on the deception once he senses that Evan\u2019s newfound social status might elevate his own. \u201cI think Benj was the one who wanted to give me a shot to be the hero of the story, though,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cAnd he convinced everybody that I should read for the lead.\u201dI know what he means. It\u2019s like trying to describe why Stephen Curry is good at basketball. There\u2019s an element of genius there that can\u2019t really be captured. On the other hand, it\u2019s not so mysterious at all. Stephen Curry is the son of one of the greatest shooters in N.B.A. history. And Ben Platt grew up in Beverly Hills, the son of the theater and film producer Marc Platt, the producer of the Broadway blockbuster \u201cWicked\u201d and the Oscar-winning movie \u201cLa La Land.\u201d\u201cHe was part of this big musical-theater-obsessed family,\u201d Mr. Pasek said, \u201cand because of that he\u2019s an incredible student of the form. He was basically an empty vessel that got filled with show tunes.\u201dIt\u2019s true, Mr. Platt said, that while other kids were playing sports or video games, he was listening to \u201cGypsy\u201d: \u201cI spent a lot of time turning over furniture and trash cans and staging \u2018Cats\u2019 in my backyard.\u201d And it\u2019s true, too, that being the son of Marc Platt opened doors for him. \u201cIt would be totally disingenuous if I didn\u2019t acknowledge that being my father\u2019s son has helped me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also made me aware of how lucky I am, and how hard I have to work to prove I deserve these opportunities I\u2019ve been given. I hope this\u201d \u2014 meaning his performance as Evan \u2014 \u201ckind of puts that question to rest.\u201dMr. Levenson told me he didn\u2019t learn who Mr. Platt\u2019s father was until a year into knowing him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t wear that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d have no idea that he comes from L.A. and that community.\u201dWill Roland, who ended up with the role of Jared, put it most succinctly: \u201cHe\u2019s a freak. What else can I say?\u201d\u201cI live a pretty monkish existence,\u201d Mr. Platt said.\u201cIt won\u2019t always be like this,\u201d he added. (His contract is up in November.) \u201cBut I feel as long as I\u2019m doing this role, everything I do has to be in the service of that. I don\u2019t want there to be a single performance where people leave feeling like they didn\u2019t get the best I could offer. If that means denying myself some things, that\u2019s O.K. I don\u2019t think anything can be genuinely fulfilling or powerful if it\u2019s not taking some kind of a toll. For now, I\u2019m definitely willing to let that toll be taken.\u201dThere are levels to the monkishness. On the purely physical, he sleeps nine or 10 hours a night, eats no gluten or dairy and goes for long stretches each day in silence to rest his voice. He takes zinc and oregano supplements and constantly hydrates. He has two physical therapy sessions a week, \u201cto make sure I don\u2019t develop tree-trunk neck and to keep my posture from becoming too much like Evan\u2019s.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a losing battle, though. My posture\u2019s horrible now.\u201d (He also bites his nails and cracks his knuckles obsessively, in a way he never did before, he said.)His longtime voice coach, Liz Caplan, comes to his dressing room twice each week. She was there recently, a few days after he\u2019d missed his first performance since 2015. \u201cI got a yeast infection on my vocal cords,\u201d Mr. Platt said. \u201cI really wanted to get through the run without missing a performance.\u201d It was during Passover, and his entire family, parents and siblings and nephews, were in town to be with him. He didn\u2019t speak for two days. \u201cI whiteboarded my way through the seders,\u201d he said.Ms. Caplan massaged the muscles around his larynx and had him put peppermint oil in his nose. \u201cWe need to Roto-Rooter out his sinuses,\u201d she said. They went through a series of exercises that gradually grew more intense, his range expanding and volume rising. \u201cUse the knees,\u201d she said. \u201cLet the hip flexors help you.\u201d As he started to belt more, he lifted one leg and bent at the knee, to relieve pressure on the vagus nerve and, as Ms. Caplan described it, \u201ckeep the neck and upper body from straining and separating.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re putting notes into his body in a positive, non-stressed way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then when he\u2019s onstage in those unhealthy positions, he\u2019ll be able to access them.\u201dIt\u2019s a gesture you see him repeat in the show, most notably in the second-act aria, \u201cWords Fail,\u201d in which he confesses to the Murphys that everything he\u2019s told them is a lie. He\u2019s standing before them, hunched and sobbing. It seems an impossible posture from which to project a song, but he\u2019s incorporated the leg-lifting into his character so that it reads to the audience like a bodily expression of intolerable emotion. \u201cThere are all these other little places where I lean back and fill my diaphragm, and then go back into it,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, because I\u2019m crying so hard, spaces where I know I can swallow the mucus that\u2019s coming down. We put all these little things in place, and now they\u2019re just there, they\u2019re second nature, so I can just let it fly.\u201dIt\u2019s harder to describe how he manages the emotional strain, he said. \u201cI look at Rachel\u201d \u2014 Rachel Bay Jones, who plays Evan\u2019s mother and has also been nominated for a Tony \u2014 \u201cand if we\u2019re dropped in, it\u2019s just there. I don\u2019t have to work for it at all. If for some reason it\u2019s not, then I have to go into things in my own life, and that\u2019s much harder. It\u2019s harder to do and harder to come back from afterward.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say what those personal things were. When I spoke with Ms. Jones, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t really know how he does it, especially at such a young age. We all have those parts of ourselves we don\u2019t find attractive and don\u2019t want to show thousands of people. It takes so much work to strip away our protections around those things. But he\u2019s able to let his guard fall away so naturally, and just be.\u201dI asked her if she had any idea why, and she was quiet for a moment. \u201cI think it\u2019s \u2014 he has this incredible relationship with his family,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI think his awareness of what it would be like to not have that, to lose that, is so deep.\u201dIn a recent phone interview, his mother, Julie Beren Platt, said: \u201cI contemplate Ben\u2019s emotional well-being every day. He\u2019s very mature. But he\u2019s also 23 and should be out with friends and meeting people. I worry about how much time he spends alone.\u201dShe and her husband alternate coming to New York to be with him, she said, and Ben has a close group of friends from high school, the Harvard-Westlake School, who are all actors in New York. \u201cBeanie Feldstein\u201d \u2014 Jonah Hill\u2019s younger sister \u2014 \u201cis his nearest and dearest,\u201d Ms. Platt said. \u201cAnd Beanie is a block away in \u2018Hello, Dolly!\u2019 The two of them quietly keep each other company in between shows, which they\u2019ve done since ninth grade when they were in \u2018Guys and Dolls\u2019 together.\u201d (He watched news of the Tony nominations at home with his mother and friends, celebrating with gluten-free pastries.)Ms. Platt talked about her and her husband\u2019s traditional Jewish upbringing, and how it was important to them to raise their own five children in the same way, in part to \u201cprotect them from Marc\u2019s world, to teach them to be committed to a community larger than themselves and to live a grounded life.\u201dHis mother isn\u2019t leaving that to chance. Part of her job, she said, is \u201cto be very diligent about stopping and saying: \u2018Let\u2019s process this wonderful thing that\u2019s happening to you right now. Let\u2019s think about who came to see it today. What did that feel like to have them come backstage?\u2019 I\u2019m equal parts worry and celebration, but I want to help him focus on the celebration.\u201d\u201cTo-ny! To-ny!\u201dOutside the stage door on that Sunday afternoon, a brief chant broke out, rooting Mr. Platt on to the award that he hadn\u2019t yet been nominated for. He raised his hands in a gesture that seemed to say \u201cThank you, and I\u2019m humbled,\u201d but also, \u201cPlease stop.\u201dHe moved down the line, signing what had to be more than a hundred Playbills and ticket stubs and posters, nodding and briefly responding to people telling him how moved they are by his performance, that they suffer from anxiety, too, or their kid does, or their sister, and that they\u2019re so grateful for what he\u2019s done. Two girls who had been standing there since midway through the second act (they came in from Long Island because they\u2019d heard he comes to the stage door on Sundays) cried as they told him they\u2019d seen the show three times and they loved him.He had this glazed, slightly pained look on his face that was hard to describe. It made me think there must still be a little transition period, even after all of these performances, between Evan onstage and Ben in real life, between all of that raw exposure and the self-preserving retreat from it.That\u2019s a lot to project onto a moment, I know. It might be more accurate to just say he was very tired. Whatever the case, I liked the idea that even as we all stared, projecting ourselves onto him, he was slipping back into his own skin, and for the next 48 hours, anyway, he didn\u2019t have to be anything other than a 23-year-old in New York, listening to show tunes and waiting for his Seamless order to arrive.A capsule summary on the cover this weekend for an article about the actor Ben Platt misstates the number of times he performs the title role each week in the musical \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d It is eight times, not seven. (The error also appears in the article, which begins on Page 10.) In addition, the article misstates the year in which Mr. Platt performed the title role during the musical\u2019s original eight-week run at the Arena Stage in Washington. It was 2015, not 2014.Advertisement"}
