{"Headline": "Gabourey Sidibe: By the Book", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byBy the BookThe actress and author of \u201cThis Is Just My Face\u201d found herself rereading Ruthie Mae Bolton\u2019s \u201cGal,\u201d \u201ceach time understanding more and more, the blessing and the burden of being a black woman.\u201dWhat books are currently on your night stand?What\u2019s the last great book you read?\u201cThe Grownup,\u201d by Gillian Flynn. I love Gillian Flynn books. They are all so dark and filled with twisted characters who are dirty, yet posing as squeaky clean. I love her sadistic characters. Fake psychics, sociopathic adults and children alike. You never know what\u2019s bubbling under the surface of any of them, and it\u2019s always so fun to uncover the mystery within the creeps she creates.What classic novel did you recently read for the first time?What\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of? \u201cGal,\u201d by Ruthie Mae Bolton. It was one of the first books my mom and I traded. She read it first and then I did at probably too young an age to understand the complexities of being a child of the South in the 1960s who is not only witness to abuse but also subject to abuse, and what strength of character was needed to then become caretaker of her abuser. I might\u2019ve been around 12 when I first read \u201cGal,\u201d and I found myself rereading it every five years or so, each time understanding more and more, the blessing and the burden of being a black woman.What\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?\u201cShrill,\u201d by Lindy West. She gets me. The last book to make you cry?\u201cShrill,\u201d by Lindy West. She gets me. The last book that made you furious?\u201cThe Radical King,\u201d edited by Cornel West. Reading these writings of Martin Luther King Jr., I felt infuriated that he preached for love and acceptance and tried his best to battle hate, but that still all of his work was seen as terroristic and he was gunned down. I\u2019m mostly pissed because today isn\u2019t different enough from then. #BlackLivesMatter is somehow considered to be racist hate speech, and the movement is being likened to the K.K.K. I was furious reading King\u2019s words on love, because even after everything, he died fighting for us from a place of love. What\u2019s the proper way to protest, then? Rage doesn\u2019t work, love doesn\u2019t work, and silence definitely doesn\u2019t work. What will help us be seen as human, so that this endless cycle of violence against people of color and the injustice we face can come to an end? Can it ever? If a man like King who fought with love couldn\u2019t do it, what hope do we have? It\u2019s an unanswerable question for me. I know that rage isn\u2019t the answer, but lately it\u2019s all I seem to feel concerning the state of our country.What do you read for solace? For escape? For sheer pleasure?For escape, I read David Sedaris. It feels like I\u2019m always on a six-hour plane ride, and I love to take that time to listen to a Sedaris audiobook. His tales about his family, or living in Japan or France, or his part-time job as an elf during Christmas, whispered in my ear as I try my best to sit still and pretend I\u2019m not smelling a million farts trapped in business class, are very soothing.What are your favorite books about acting or about Hollywood? Which writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most?What moves you most in a work of literature?I\u2019m best moved by characters who are between a rock and a hard place. Who feel trapped but aren\u2019t really sad about it. Just inconvenienced by their circumstances. Sadness is too easy an emotion. People hardly ever talk about being inconvenienced as an emotion.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? I love good mystery! As a child, I was obsessed with the \u201cClue\u201d series, as well as \u201cFear Street,\u201d by R. L. Stine. Some killer was always on the loose, and I loved trying to figure out who it was. I also loved the Two-Minute Mysteries series. I avoid self-help books. It\u2019s just\u2026shut up. You don\u2019t know my life. Tell me a story. If I get something from it on my own, that\u2019s wonderful! Do not tell me what to do.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? Do you like reading on set? I prefer paper. I love a book I can hold in my hand. I love dog-earing pages to give it character. My house has four bookshelves in it, and I want to fill them all with books. I can\u2019t do that with an iPad. Although I travel a ton, so I listen to audiobooks on planes. I tend to read more than one book at a time. It can take me months to get through one book because I\u2019m so greedy. I read whenever my brain isn\u2019t too occupied. I don\u2019t read on set. I don\u2019t get to read at all when I\u2019m working. I just can\u2019t divide my brain between reading for work and reading for fun. I\u2019ve seen other actors do it and I just can\u2019t!What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I have a picture book of X-rays of different household items that people have gotten stuck up their butts. That\u2019s pretty surprising.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?When I was a kid, my parents got me a joke book. I hated children then even though I was a child myself, but having a joke book helped me to engage with kids my own age in order to attempt to make them laugh. This helped me to come out of my shell a bit and to realize that I wanted to be a comedian when I grew up. That was pretty great. Even though I didn\u2019t grow up to be a comedian, I use comedy all the time to engage with strangers, even though I\u2019m really shy. No matter what any bathroom wall in America says about me, I assure you, I\u2019m very shy.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?  If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? The president cannot read. You\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?Oh God! So many! I put down books all the time and never pick them up again. Sometimes because I just didn\u2019t really like the book, but also just because I have to go to work, and I forget about reading until whatever project I\u2019m working on is through. Someone gave me \u201cThe Four Agreements\u201d as a gift, and I\u2019m still pretending to have read it cover to cover. I got bored around Page 4, and so I Googled what the four agreements are, and I just try to be impeccable with my word, I try not to assume, I try to not take anything personally, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a fourth agreement I pretended to make, but I forgot it.\u2026Damn. Maybe I really should\u2019ve read it.\u2026Nah.Whom would you want to write your life story?I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone else to write my life story. That\u2019s pretty much why I did it myself. If anyone else had written it, parts of it would surely be fiction. If I ever want my life story to be fiction, I\u2019d like for Zane to write it and turn it into an erotic journey. Somebody has to!What do you plan to read next?An expanded version of this interview is available at nytimes.com/books.Advertisement"}

Transit-starved communities from Coney Island to Canarsie continue to be stranded by the city\u2019s transportation system.For many of our carless residents, commuting is difficult, with limited options. Subway stations are sparse, and the prospects for extending existing lines are far from being realized.Buses are notoriously unreliable, and active modes of transportation like cycling are still dangerous in many parts of Brooklyn and other boroughs.Ferry service to southeast Brooklyn that achieves travel-time reductions for locals and tourists will fuel sustainable economic development in neighborhoods still recovering from Hurricane Sandy while capitalizing on our waterfront as a great opportunity equalizer.Instead of deepening old geographic divides, let\u2019s chart a new course.ERIC L. ADAMS, BROOKLYNThe writer is Brooklyn borough president.To the Editor:If the current and past administrations truly wanted to \u201cthink outside the grid\u201d to ameliorate New York City\u2019s beleaguered public transportation system, they would be more imaginative than positing ferries and bicycles as partial solutions.Underused railroad tracks abound in the city. For instance, the Amtrak line along the Hudson has but a few trains a day; it could easily accommodate commuter service on the congested Upper West Side.More visionary would be to institute an intraborough link using the rail corridor that goes from the Brooklyn Army Terminal in the west, through the bowels of Brooklyn and Queens, before arcing north to Astoria.

{"Headline": "Transit Hubs: A Growing Lure for Developers", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetRail stations, it turns out, are delivering much more than passengers to surrounding neighborhoods.Young workers who prefer to walk or take the train \u2014 rather than drive \u2014 to eat, work and shop are pushing up property values and reshaping the way developers approach their plans.Few places make this shift more evident than the Somerville suburb of Boston. A new Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway station was crucial to bringing Partners HealthCare to a new 825,000-square-foot office building at the Assembly Row complex last year, said Chris Weilminster, the president for the mixed-use division of the developer Federal Realty Investment Trust.The station, which opened in 2014, has also driven Federal Realty\u2019s broader development of Assembly Row, which broke ground in 2012. The trust has transformed a 45-acre industrial site \u2014 a barren expanse of broken concrete and scrub \u2014 into a neighborhood where housing, offices and restaurants rub shoulders along streets intended to be inviting to pedestrians. Public spaces throughout the development bump up against the Mystic River shoreline.A second, $280 million phase will add commercial space and homes, including condominiums on top of a boutique hotel.\u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate the importance that the investment in transit infrastructure has had,\u201d Mr. Weilminster said. \u201cAssembly Row would not be what it is today without the station. We wouldn\u2019t have built it.\u201dPutting a commercial development near a rail station also reduces the need to build parking, which can be costly. And even millennials who do not use the train may not require a parking space; many are indifferent toward car ownership, particularly given the rise of taxi and car service technologies like Uber and Zipcar.Such trends give transit-oriented developments an edge over traditional suburban office parks when companies are searching for space, real estate experts say.\u201cClearly, any sort of big transit infrastructure program can act as a huge stimulus for the development of surrounding real estate,\u201d said Scott Homa, a director of United States office research for Jones Lang LaSalle, a global property company. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to emerge as a universal theme across the U.S.\u201dOffice buildings with access to transit are outshining those without, fetching rents nearly 80 percent higher. That amounts to $45.57 a square foot versus $25.39 a square foot, according to a report released this year by Jones Lang LaSalle. Those same buildings have a vacancy rate 3.7 percentage points lower than offices without transit access.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a factor when tenants are making their final choice,\u201d said E. Nelson Mills, the chief executive of Columbia Property Trust, a New York-based landlord that owns about 7.8 million square feet of office space, primarily in New York, San Francisco and Washington.Just to the east, in Herndon, Va., MRP Realty bought eight office buildings on 32 acres from Liberty Property Trust last year, for $97 million. The office park is near the future Innovation Center Metrorail station, projected to open in 2020. MRP Realty is renovating three buildings and it plans to tear down smaller, out-of-the way office properties to make way for townhouses, apartments and retail space.\u201cOffice decision makers have Metrorail on their radar because it gives their employees an option to commute, which makes it easier to recruit,\u201d said Matthew Robinson, a principal in MRP Realty\u2019s Washington office. \u201cBut we have the ability to add mixed-use development at the site, and that was a key component.\u201dDevelopers swooped in to add offices in new and rehabilitated buildings. Google and Uber are among the companies that have moved into the neighborhood over the past several months, and McDonald\u2019s announced last year that it would move its headquarters there from the suburb of Oak Brook.\u201cFulton Market is clearly the shining star in Chicago right now,\u201d said Todd M. Caruso, a senior managing director of the real estate company CBRE Group. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be hearing of more major companies moving there in the coming months.\u201dBert Gregory, a partner with the architecture firm Mithun, which designed the new Weyerhaeuser headquarters and is working on apartments in the Spring District, recalled a conversation a few years ago in which a developer told him that rail stops had replaced intersecting freeways as \u201c100 percent\u201d sure-to-succeed locations.Noting the developer\u2019s prescience, Mr. Gregory said he had recently realized that all of his active projects were within two blocks of transit lines. One of those includes turning the site of The Oregonian\u2019s former printing press buildings into housing, as part of a mixed-used project just outside downtown Portland.\u201cTransit is the nature of development interest and of developer focus today,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Turmoil Is High, but Wall Street\u2019s Fear Gauge Is Very Low", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIt has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.As political risks have increased at home and abroad, complacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.This trend, which began soon after President Trump\u2019s victory in November, culminated on Monday, when the VIX index, known widely as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, dipped briefly below 10 \u2014 the first time it had done so in more than 10 years, in the months before the financial crisis.The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.On Tuesday, the VIX turned up, to close at about 10.6 \u2014 but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levels, the VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continue, regardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.\u201cThe pricing of risk is at near historic lows, and the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,\u201d said Julian Emanuel, a stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. \u201cAnd all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201dSince the VIX reached a recent peak of 22 in the days before the election in November, it has fallen sharply as equity markets have rallied in the belief that the president\u2019s promises to slash regulations, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure would buoy the economy.The gauge generally moves in the opposite direction of the stock market. So with the major stock indexes having hit highs, it would make sense that the VIX would reach these unusual lows.But what is less clear is why investors have been so willing to ignore so many outcomes that would send stocks reeling.This means that even as Mr. Trump has difficulties in getting his bills passed, investors are not abandoning the stock market, but are switching out of stocks tied directly to a Trump recovery, for example, banks and industrial companies.The net effect of this rotation is a stock market that goes up and a VIX that goes down.\u201cThere has been this epic disconnect between soft and hard economic data,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cAnd investors are just not willing to sell out of their stocks right now.\u201dRussell Rhoads, the director of education at the VIX\u2019s home, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, calls the high level of faith investors have shown in the president\u2019s promise to reinvigorate the economy the Trump put.Now, Mr. Rhoads says, investors are making a similar wager on Mr. Trump.\u201cWe used to have the Greenspan put, maybe it is the Trump put now,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said, citing a propensity of investors to stay in the market despite political ups and downs. \u201cHe is so business-friendly \u2014 there is a view that whatever happens he will do things that spur economic growth.\u201dUnlike a stock index like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the VIX is not driven by stock prices but by the prices of options to buy or sell the S.&P. For that reason, it is a forward-looking indicator \u2014 30 days to be precise \u2014 that measures how volatile traders think the market will be before the option expires.One reason for the gauge\u2019s recent equanimity, Mr. Rhoads said, is that even when investors purchase options to sell the S.&P. index at a certain level (betting that the market will fall) to insure against a sell-off, they are at the same time keeping their broad exposure to stocks.It is this tricky balancing act that has kept the VIX at these low levels.Mr. Rhoads, a student of financial market history, noted that the index is what is known as \u201ca means reverting vehicle.\u201d This means that even if it stays at these low levels for a while, the index will spike up when the next bout of fear hits the market.\u201cIt\u2019s like a rubber band that stretches and stretches until it pops,\u201d Mr. Rhoads said. \u201cEveryone might be too confident right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 54 Years, We Fell in Love. After Five Months, I Got Leukemia.", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byOpinionI thought I\u2019d fallen into my own romantic comedy.I write them for a living. My sister Nora and I wrote \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail,\u201d among others. How people fall in love is my specialty.Here is where it begins.Now we were 72 years old. We are talking 54 years ago. \u201cWe went to a Columbia football game. There were snow flurries,\u201d Peter told me when I confessed in my return email to having absolutely no memory of our dates.He was now a psychiatrist, a Jungian analyst, living in the Bay Area.There were confluences. He\u2019d had similar problems \u2014 with AT&T \u2014 trying to disconnect his wife\u2019s line after she died. The last trip they took together had been to Syracuse, Sicily. My most recent novel, \u201cSiracusa,\u201d was set there. Peter loved it, he told me. He knew the way to a writer\u2019s heart.\u201cDo you want to talk further?\u201d he wrote. \u201cClearly I do.\u201dI\u2019d have sworn that I had no interest in meeting a man or, frankly, taking off my clothes in front of one. I was content. I had great friends. I\u2019d had a wonderful marriage.And yet when Peter opened his arms, I leapt into them.Of course, first I Googled.After mistaking several other men for him, I learned that he had written two books on sexual exploitation. He had testified on behalf of abused women in court. An activist on behalf of women? Is this a feminist prank? He\u2019d recently hiked the Grand Canyon. He sent a photo of himself in a canoe. He was great looking.After consulting my friend Jessie, who has excellent judgment and who approved of his email, I wrote back. Something charming, I hoped. Yet I was careful to mention that I never hike except across Greenwich Village for a pastry. Peter did sound seriously interesting, but there was no way I was going near the Grand Canyon.Within days we were emailing several times a day. I remember thinking, there is no point in being anything other than who I am, so I was honest about my life, my loss, the complications of survival, and he responded in kind.There we were, like Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail,\u201d emailing our hearts. Or was it like \u201cSleepless in Seattle,\u201d since we were on opposite coasts?After about two weeks, he wrote the inevitable: \u201cDelia, I think we should talk on the phone.\u201dSoon we were logging hours late at night. Not FaceTime or Skype, simply phone calls \u2014 voices connecting the way I did when I was young. He drove to Nevada to canvass for Hillary Clinton, and we talked the four hours there and the four hours it took him to drive back. I couldn\u2019t think or write or sleep. I realized, I\u2019m falling in love. I am 72 years old, how is this possible? All this before Peter said, \u201cDelia, I think we should meet.\u201dThe next weekend he flew to New York.The day of our date, I had an excellent blow-dry. I spent way too much time considering what to wear. I was tongue-tied at dinner. I believe I asked him his favorite color. My brain was jumbled by his presence, by the ghost of my husband who would only want me to be happy, but still.When we left the restaurant, Peter kissed me. On the corner of Bowery and Houston, let it be marked forever.The next morning I freaked out. We were supposed to meet in Washington Square Park. I couldn\u2019t go. I called Jessie. \u201cHe has a backpack,\u201d I told her.\u201cEvery man in Northern California has a backpack,\u201d she said, \u201cget over to the park.\u201dPeter and I sat on a bench and talked for hours. I was scared. At our age death is sitting there, right in front of you. You can reach out and touch it. And I remember saying, the way people say things they mean but don\u2019t: \u201cNo one should have to go through twice what we both went through. If I get sick, I give you total permission to leave me.\u201dAnd Peter said, \u201cI could never do that.\u201dThis is not a romantic comedy. It\u2019s not a comedy at all.In the full disclosure necessary at our age, I told Peter that I had abnormal cells in my bone marrow, discovered in a biopsy seven years earlier. But every six months I would visit Dr. Gail Roboz, director of the leukemia program at Weill Cornell Medicine, and she would give me a blood test and tell me I was fine. Peter was not put off.Within weeks of our first date, we were taking long trips together, including one to the edge of the Grand Canyon. And then I went in for my next blood test, on March 9, and found out that I had leukemia.It was A.M.L., acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive form. I would start chemotherapy in the hospital the next week, Dr. Roboz said, on CPX-351, a drug in clinical trials, not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Leukemia. A.M.L. My sister had died of this disease.But it wasn\u2019t the same disease, Dr. Roboz told me. Abnormal chromosomes and mutations make A.M.L. behave very differently in different patients. My version was not like my sister\u2019s, and was, Dr. Roboz believed, a good candidate for CPX-351. This is why I could get the drug, through Weill Cornell\u2019s compassionate-access program.I felt grateful for that, but I wished so much that this drug or something suited to Nora had existed when she was sick. I was lonely for her, more than ever.Like my sister, I started lying. I told lots of lies to people I love. To people I work with. About why the screenplay wasn\u2019t in, why I had to miss appointments. I\u2019m a terrible liar. I said whatever came into my head. I even borrowed a friend\u2019s eye disease. All I could think was, if I tell one person and they tell another, my news would be public, published as: \u201cHer sister died, she\u2019s dying, too.\u201dI had to protect my hope.Peter flew in the day after I found out. He was sitting at the breakfast table, I was making us French toast, and he said, \u201cWe should get married.\u201d He stood up. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t a practical decision. We both understood that the illness had given us an even clearer recognition of our love. On Monday we got a marriage license and bought a ring. On Tuesday I checked into the hospital.We want to marry, we told Dr. Roboz, who turned out to be able to arrange that, too. We read our vows that Peter wrote all about miracles, and the Rev. Cheryl Fox, the hospital chaplain, pronounced us husband and wife in the dining room on the hospital\u2019s 14th floor. I was one CPX-351 treatment in, two more to go.Peter took a leave from his practice and slept in my hospital room. There was not one moment when he wasn\u2019t positive. Not one. A long hospital stay is like being in a tunnel, a blur of people taking your vitals, meals arriving that you don\u2019t want to eat, forcing yourself to walk the corridors to keep up your strength. Fear and hope battling for your heart and mind. Every night, when I fell asleep in my hospital bed, I saw Peter across the way on a cot, reading, waiting for me to fall asleep before he did.Twenty-five days later I was out of the hospital. I had a final bone marrow biopsy and the official news: I was in remission.Remission. A remarkable word to hear.Within a week I was writing again. Peter and I went to the opera. But I continued to avoid friends and family. When I saw people dear to me, I presented a version of my life that didn\u2019t exist (even omitting a marriage \u2014 how to explain that!).All this secrecy became too great a burden; it isolated me. It simply didn\u2019t suit.And I hope very much that the F.D.A. approves this drug. It should be available to everyone who could benefit from it. I have an obligation to tell.I look at Peter and wonder how this miracle happened to us. My sister, of course. She had the foresight to suspect 54 years ago that we were made for each other (\u201cM.F.E.O.,\u201d as a character says in \u201cSleepless\u201d). Thank goodness he reads The New York Times. Thank goodness he has the most generous heart. Did I mention that CPX-351 doesn\u2019t make you lose your hair? I suppose I could say that\u2019s not important when it\u2019s life and death, but losing your hair is huge. A heartbreak. It matters. Everything mattered. Especially love.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is China the World\u2019s New Colonial Power?", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "The Money IssueThe rising superpower has built up enormous holdings in poor, resource-rich African countries \u2014 but its business partners there aren\u2019t always thrilled.Supported byDylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o\u2019clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. \u2014 China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u2083O\u2088, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u201cWe had a big ceremony that day,\u201d Teng says.One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u2019s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u2019s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u2019s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future \u2014 his own and his country\u2019s \u2014 under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. \u201cI never imagined,\u201d he says, \u201cI would end up halfway around the world.\u201dJust north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u2019s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u2019re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u2019s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u201call-weather friends.\u201d (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u201cWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u201d Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u2019s minister of finance, told me. \u201cThe Chinese say, \u2018We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u2019\u2009\u201d But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u201cThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u2019s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u201cwin-win cooperation.\u201d And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u2014 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u2014 might never be built without them. China\u2019s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u201cWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u201d Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u201cNow we\u2019re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u201dFor some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u2019t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u2014 financed by the Chinese \u2014 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u2014 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u2014 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u2019s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u201cFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u201dThe question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u2014 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u201cYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u2014 or the worst,\u201d says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u201cChina in Africa Podcast.\u201d \u201cThe beauty is in the complexity.\u201dThe couple\u2019s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u2019s most remote places: I\u2019ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u201cMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u201d Rose told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re still Chinese first and foremost.\u201dLike many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u2014 and thousands more across Africa.On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u2019s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u2019s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u2019s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u2019 poor quality \u2014 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u201cMany Namibian children didn\u2019t even have shoes before we got here,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u201dOne of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.Huang\u2019s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u2019s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u2019s elections since its independence \u2014 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u2019s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u2019s founding father, as \u201cmy special adviser.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u2019s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u2014 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)Huang\u2019s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u2019s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u2019s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u2019s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u2019s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u201cI kept warning Jack,\u201d says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t get too close to the fire. You\u2019ll burn your fingers.\u2019\u2009\u201dSean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u2019s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u2019t expected to venture far beyond his village\u2019s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u2014 a legacy of the government\u2019s restrictive family-planning policy \u2014 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u201cbare branch\u201d (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u201cI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u201d he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u2019an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u2019s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even recognize me,\u201d he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u2019s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u2019 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u2019m making now.\u201dIn Teng\u2019s first job after graduation \u2014 at the Beijing-based Uranium Resources Company, a C.G.N. subsidiary \u2014 he learned about the company\u2019s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u2019s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u2019s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u201cThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u201d Teng says.To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u2019s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u2019s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u201cHusab was my salvation.\u201dThere is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u2019s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.Nearly 88 percent of China\u2019s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u2014 and shed the ignominious title of world\u2019s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u2014 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u2019s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u2019s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told The Guardian that the plan is \u201cinsane.\u201dC.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u2019s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u2014 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u2019s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u2019s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u201cThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the implementation can be hell.\u201d Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u2019t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u2019 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u2019s convenient for them to review and plan \u2014 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u2014 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u201cWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u2019s all part of the \u2018going out\u2019 policy.\u201dMining is hardly China\u2019s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u2019s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u2014 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u2014 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u2019s incursion into Africa.Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u201dSuch criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u201cWe\u2019re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u201d says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u2019s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u201cWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u201dNamibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u2019s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u201cIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u201dThe pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u2014 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u2019s own Namibian Chamber of Environment, the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u2014 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u2014 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\u201cYou are abusing China\u2019s good nature,\u201d one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u201cOnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u201d\u201cNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u201d Brown replied. \u201cI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u201d\u2029When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u201cThey got quieter and quieter,\u201d Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u201crotten apples\u201d tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u201cListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u201d he says he argued. \u201cOr we can come together to solve this problem.\u201d The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u2019s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u2014 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of corporate social responsibility. \u201cIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u201d he says, \u201cso they have to be part of the solution.\u201dPoaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u201cLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u201d my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u201cThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u201d In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u201cBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u201d says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u201cBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u201dPublic anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the environment. One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u2019s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u2019s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u2019s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u2014 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.Three months after Brown\u2019s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u2019s recent ban on all ivory sales \u2014 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star Yao Ming \u2014 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u2019s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u2019 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u2019s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u2014 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u201cWhen my \u2018friend\u2019 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u201d Geingob told a local paper later. \u201cThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u201dHuang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u2014 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u201ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u201d The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u2019s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u201cAll the while they were yelling, \u2018Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u2019s the rhino horn?\u2019\u2009\u201d Xia recalls. \u201cI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u201dIt\u2019s a chilly Saturday in April \u2014 the antipodal winter is coming \u2014 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive \u2014 or latitude \u2014 to venture out into the alien environment, especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea \u2014 but had no idea where it was.The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China \u2014 thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue \u2014 Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He\u2019d married the visitor \u2014 mission accomplished \u2014 joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng\u2019s other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China\u2019s continued rise. \u201cThis is an important thing for China, \u201d he says, \u201cand I want to be a part of it.\u201dThe Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises \u2014 and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It\u2019s not just the shared food, culture or language \u2014 or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh environment. What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Caring About Tech News", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsLook at all the sides Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s AlphaGo Defeats Chinese Go Master in Win for A.I.", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 It isn\u2019t looking good for humanity.The world\u2019s best player of what might be humankind\u2019s most complicated board game was defeated on Tuesday by a Google computer program. Adding insult to potentially deep existential injury, he was defeated at Go \u2014 a game that claims centuries of play by humans \u2014 in China, where the game was invented.The human contender, a 19-year-old Chinese national named Ke Jie, and the computer are only a third of the way through their three-game match this week. And the contest does little to prove that software can mollify an angry co-worker, write a decent poem, raise a well-adjusted child or perform any number of distinctly human tasks.In the first game, Mr. Ke made several moves that commentators said were reminiscent of AlphaGo\u2019s own style. Wearing a blue tie and thick-framed black glasses, the boyish Mr. Ke kept things close in the early going. By AlphaGo\u2019s own assessment, it did not have a big statistical advantage until after the 50th move, according to a DeepMind co-founder, Demis Hassabis.Mr. Ke, who smiled and shook his head as AlphaGo finished out the game, said afterward that his was a \u201cbitter smile.\u201d After he finishes this week\u2019s match, he said, he would focus more on playing against human opponents, noting that the gap between humans and computers was becoming too great. He would treat the software more as a teacher, he said, to get inspiration and new ideas about moves.\u201cAlphaGo is improving too fast,\u201d he said in a news conference after the game. \u201cAlphaGo is like a different player this year compared to last year.\u201dGo, in which two players vie for control of a board using black and white pieces called stones, is considered complex because of the sheer number of possible moves. Even supercomputers cannot simply calculate all possible moves, presenting a big challenge for AlphaGo\u2019s creators.AlphaGo instead relies on new techniques that help it learn from experience playing a large number of games. This time, Mr. Hassabis said, a new approach allowed AlphaGo to learn more by playing games against itself. In the future, computer scientists hope to use similar techniques to do many things, including improving fundamental scientific research and diagnosing illnesses.AlphaGo\u2019s victory represents a marketing success for Google and Alphabet. The Mountain View, Calif., software company pulled out of mainland China seven years ago rather than submit to the country\u2019s censorship requirements. But it has continued to express interest in the vast market, which has the world\u2019s largest population of internet users.Notably, the Go match took place in the city of Wuzhen, where the Chinese internet authorities hold an annual conference on cyberspace regulation.\u201cAlphaGo truly had a big impact\u201d in China, said Wang Shengjin, a professor at the department of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing. \u201cBefore, we would be discussing how to apply the technology, but it was hard to be clear exactly how to do it, so AlphaGo gave us a vivid example of that.\u201dStill, China showed some skittishness at game time. Despite huge interest, many Chinese became consternated when it became apparent there was no obvious live video of the event online. A site that follows Chinese censorship orders, China Digital Times, posted a translated notice from the government calling for all websites to block the broadcast.\u201cAnything that demonstrates that something special about China has turned out to be just another artificial intelligence problem that Google is better solving than any other company is additionally problematic,\u201d said Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University Shanghai, \u201cbecause it threatens the specialness of the culture.\u201dThe Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s main digital censor, did not respond to a request for comment.While AlphaGo had already racked up an impressive record against humans over the past year, the match against Mr. Ke offered a final showdown. Like AlphaGo, Mr. Ke had beaten South Korea\u2019s Mr. Lee in several recent major competitions.After Mr. Lee\u2019s loss, Mr. Ke had said publicly on Chinese social media that the program \u201ccan\u2019t beat me.\u201dMr. Ke\u2019s tone changed earlier this year, after he lost three online speed games to the program. At that point, he said on Chinese social media that computers seemed to be showing that some of what humanity thought about the game was incorrect.Mr. Ke will have two more chances to get the better of AlphaGo with games on Thursday and Saturday. Most experts do not give him much of a chance. But last year, his rival Mr. Lee surprised, winning one game against AlphaGo out of five after a brilliant and unconventional move stumped the software.Carolyn Zhang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senator John Kennedy (No, Not That One) Embraces Anonymity", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John Kennedy shuffles alone through the Capitol basement, reveling in his bag of walnuts, unrecognized and unbothered as reporters chase his colleagues for comments on the daily swirl.He has mostly shunned the Beltway social circuit favored by his peers, splitting his leisure hours between the Senate gym\u2019s elliptical machine and an apartment stash of Sam\u2019s Club hamburgers, imported from his Louisiana home in a Walmart freezer pack.There is a saying here about the upper chamber, especially in modern Senate classes overstuffed with ambition and self-regard: Every senator looks in the mirror and sees a president.\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said, shrugging a little, before one such appearance on the Fox Business Network recently. He handed back the phone with his hair still askew.John Neely Kennedy, a 65-year-old Republican freshman on this baffling campus, is almost certainly not going to be president of the United States. He is, in fact, the only senator for whom a simple Google search is a humbling exercise, thanks to that nettlesome John Fitzgerald Kennedy.Yet in an era of self-promotion, self-importance and transparent bids for national prominence among even the greenest of lawmakers, Mr. Kennedy has negotiated his first months on the job as something of a throwback in Washington\u2019s crackling tumult \u2014 a Southern-fried Waldo for the Trump age, drifting through the volatility in plain sight, if only anyone were looking.Sprawling investigations. Endless executive chaos. Tweets that move markets.Eh.\u201cI\u2019m going to work out,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said quietly on a recent evening, wandering off in a Senate tunnel. The building was buzzing with word of a memo from James B. Comey, the deposed F.B.I. director, detailing the president\u2019s efforts to stifle his Russia-tinged work.Mr. Kennedy said he would read the articles later.Of course, the faces can blur in any Congress: warm, forgettable, mostly white, usually male. But in measures both numerical and anecdotal, Mr. Kennedy has emerged as a Senate pacesetter in unwitting anonymity since his election in December. He is distinguished visually by a jowly, closed-mouth smile \u2014 more dutiful driver\u2019s license photo than strapping congressional portrait \u2014 and a penchant for removing his tie before getting all the way back to his office, slipping wordlessly past the swarm of scribes.They ask not what Mr. Kennedy is doing for his country. They ask not anything at all.Except, occasionally: \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d wondered Nicole Linsalata, a reporter for WSVN in Miami, one of several Capitol regulars to inquire in recent weeks upon seeing a peer in the senator\u2019s vicinity.\u201cHuh,\u201d she said of the answer, absorbing the famous surname. \u201cHe\u2019s missing the bone structure.\u201dOn Twitter, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s footprint is similarly light. None of the six other senators elected last year has fewer than 11,000 followers. One of them, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, has 400,000.Mr. Kennedy clocks in at a cool 3,500 or so, buttressed by efforts to goose engagement recently with an image of him holding a black Labrador retriever puppy.The calendar has also been unkind. A peculiar election schedule in Louisiana, which did not hold its Senate runoff until more than a month after the presidential contest, left Mr. Kennedy to celebrate his victory long after most of the public had moved on from congressional races.Still, after several months on the job, Mr. Kennedy insists he prefers an inconspicuous approach, despite an outsize profile back home, where he is invoked as a possible future candidate for governor. A four-plus-term state treasurer who was, until a decade ago, a member of the Democratic Party, he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate twice before the voters were convinced. He replaced Senator David Vitter, a Republican now best known for a 2007 prostitution scandal.The senator, gregarious in person, has passed most of his Washington down time reading, he said, holding forth with fluency on chronic disease management and flood insurance and expressing broad support for President Trump, with whom he campaigned before his December victory. He walks to work from his apartment near the Capitol, trudging through the elements on balky knees.\u201cEverybody up here wants to be president of the United States. And the scary thing is everybody up here thinks they\u2019re qualified,\u201d he said in an interview from his Senate office, where he works among Mardi Gras beads, assorted soldier figurines and a personally meaningful stapler from the mid-1990s.\u201cThere are one or two jerks,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are three or four folks who believe they\u2019re one of the founders of the country. But most are very, very nice.\u201dHe was asked to name the jerks.\u201cNahhhhhh.\u201dIn a body consumed with seniority and glad-handing, Mr. Kennedy has registered at least generally among his peers, traveling last month with a congressional delegation to China and Japan, where he discussed importing Louisiana rice.\u201cProfessional presence,\u201d said Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who also made the trip.\u201cHe\u2019s awesome,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, mustered, a bit generically, before taking a phone call and speed-walking away.At committee hearings, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s extreme nonseniority has often positioned him as the final questioner in line, where a heady blend of weary speakers and still-rolling C-Span cameras has produced a handful of viral video turns.During the Supreme Court confirmation proceedings for Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Kennedy seemed to rankle some Republicans by sporadically venturing off message, including a puckish question about whether the judge had ever been to Russia.And when James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, testified before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Kennedy took an ill-fated comedic swing after the witness said he had experienced \u201cmany encounters with media\u201d in his career.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Mr. Kennedy shot back. Silence greeted him. Hart Senate Office Building 216 can be a tough room.\u201cIt didn\u2019t kill in the room, and it shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and discerning veteran of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d who has become friendly with Mr. Kennedy. \u201cBut it was fast. And I was appreciative of how fast it came back, which tells me that he thinks a certain way.\u201dMr. Franken paused for a beat. \u201cThey can\u2019t all be great,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I judge on a higher bar. I worked with Dan Aykroyd and Dana Carvey and Steve Martin and Gilda Radner.\u201dThere have been others from the opposition to impress. Walking to a vote recently along the Capitol\u2019s outdoor plaza, Mr. Kennedy found occasion to tease Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, about tax season. \u201cPay your taxes, Bernie! We need the money!\u201d he cried out, for reasons that perhaps defied immediate explanation.\u201cHe grinned,\u201d Mr. Kennedy recalled of the encounter. \u201cSo that\u2019s not bad.\u201dIt is not bad. And there is plenty more not-bad where that came from, friends and colleagues say, for those inclined to listen.\u201cLoves duck hunting,\u201d said Ron J. Henson, Mr. Kennedy\u2019s successor as state treasurer.\u201cDisarming humility,\u201d said Mr. Roemer, his former boss, admiring that Mr. Kennedy was \u201cnot sprinting\u201d toward any cameras.But in the Capitol, there is always a chance. His office has pushed him to pursue more television interview offers, often in the safe harbors of Fox, but Mr. Kennedy has shown a willingness to take on all comers in the halls when approached.On a recent morning, Kylie Morris, a correspondent for the British \u201cChannel 4 News,\u201d sidled up \u2014 after asking a stranger who the senator was \u2014 with a string of queries about Mr. Trump.Mr. Kennedy agreed to listen. \u201cI went to school in your country,\u201d he noted. Ms. Morris nodded politely.The senator plowed incident-free through a few minutes of questions before excusing himself. He had a committee room to find.A moment later, with Mr. Kennedy out of earshot, a reporter from an ABC affiliate leaned in.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Planning a Trip With the Help of Google Home", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byTest RunRoughly six months later, it\u2019s doing things it couldn\u2019t before, like tracking flight prices, giving directions and providing same-day updates on traffic to airports.The first and most important thing to know about Google Home is that while it speaks several human languages, it also has a language of its own.Google recommends starting each interaction with \u201cO.K., Google\u201d (\u201cHey, Google\u201d works as well), which will prompt the speaker into receiving a query properly. It will light up and flash its signals when it\u2019s ready.Patience is also crucial. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, it may not be because of what you\u2019re asking, but because of how you\u2019re asking it. For example:Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when does flight 3459 from Delta Air Lines arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not sure how to help. But my team\u2019s helping me learn.\u201dHuman: \u201cO.K., Google, when does Delta Air Lines flight 3459 arrive at La Guardia Airport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cDelta 3459 from Pittsburgh to New York City is delayed and arrives in 32 minutes.\u201dI found this stage of my mock journey the most helpful and practical. Whether you need help deciding where to go or when to go there, Google Home has ideas.One of the neater tricks is asking it about what time of year is best to visit a city.Human: \u201cO.K., Google, when is the best time to visit London?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAccording to Visit London, autumn is a lovely time to visit London, as the weather is mild (11 to 15 degrees Celsius)\u201d \u2014 52 to 59 Fahrenheit \u2014 \u201cand you can enjoy a variety of annual events, from Total Thames Festival to Halloween celebrations. To read more, look for the link in your Google Home App.\u201dOn my iPhone\u2019s Google Home app, there was a link to a visitlondon.com page with more details.Just ask it how much flights are to the city of your choice and give it your dates, and you\u2019ll get the current price and be asked if you want email updates when the price changes.Human: \u201cOK Google, how much are flights to Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving in two weeks start at $181. Do you have any dates in mind?\u201dHuman: \u201cMay 12th to May 15th.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cRound trip flights from New York City to Toronto leaving May 12th and coming back on May 15th start at $215. I can keep track of the cheapest flights for those dates. Would you like to receive emails with updates?\u201dHuman: \u201cYes, please.\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright, you\u2019ll receive an email if the price changes.\u201dI did get an email a few days later letting me know that cheapest flight was now $262.While you\u2019re finishing packing, looking for your passport and checking (twice) to make sure the burners are off, you can get a quick update on how long it might take to get to the airport.Human: \u201cOK Google, how long will it take to get to LaGuardia airport?\u201dGoogle: \u201cWith light traffic, it will take 8 minutes to drive to LaGuardia airport.\u201dThis sense of direction is not something Google Home had when it first came out, an example of its evolving capabilities. Before long you will also be able to book a car to the airport via voice, as the company says hands-free calls will be an option in the coming months.But when asking the assistant for directions, you do not yet get the detail you would if you were searching on Google Maps. When I asked Google Home how to get to La Guardia, it gave me only a general idea: \u201cvia 77th Street and Grand Central Parkway.\u201dSimilarly, if you\u2019re trying to get from Point A to Point B once you\u2019re in your destination city, Google Assistant gives you basic information, but it defaults to car directions, so you must specify how you want to get there.Human: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto to the CN Tower in Toronto?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cAlright. The best way to get from Hockey Hall of Fame to CN Tower by car is via Front Street W and will take about 6 minutes in heavy traffic.\u201cHuman: \u201cO.K. Google, how do I get from the Hockey Hall of Fame to the CN Tower by public transport?\u201dGoogle Home: \u201cFrom Young Street and Front Street West take 121 towards west, 121 departing in 5 minutes.\u201dGoogle will also give you the hours of operation if you ask, but cannot tell you what a ticket costs.At lunchtime, you\u2019re better off asking a local for recommendations or searching Google Maps the old fashioned way (on your smartphone).I asked Google where I could \u201cfind a good sandwich near the CN Tower in Toronto,\u201d and was given three highly-rated restaurants, but Sorella Sausages and Good Bite Restaurant were both roughly five miles away from CN Tower.This technology is still in its early stages, so unless you\u2019re already using Google Home as part of your daily routine, chatting with it is more of a fun thing for travelers to experiment with than a replacement for what you would normally use to help plan a trip. But the foundation is strong and its potential is exciting, and, as Google Home will sometimes tell you when it\u2019s stumped, it\u2019s \u201clearning more every day.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How We Beat the House \u2014 in Tallying the Health Care Vote", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byThe project started with a simple question from a graphics editor, Tom Giratikanon: \u201cWhat is the fastest we can get votes from Congress onto our website?\u201d (Tallies are usually available on the House or Senate website about an hour after the vote.)Every few days, Tom offered another idea about how we could get data faster. I called every press office and contact I could find. I hassled our congressional reporters. I tried to reverse engineer what other news organizations were doing.Then, while watching senators vote on President Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees on C-SPAN, Tom noticed that a clerk reads the votes out as they come in. We considered trying speech-recognition on the audio but discovered that two people listening to the vote count could easily type them in real time and get them on our site within seconds. Our readers loved the live coverage.Unlike in the verbal tally in the Senate, though, the House vote is displayed on four scoreboard-like panels inside the chamber. And the panels aren\u2019t visible on C-SPAN. It was time to do some in-person research.I learned the rules of the House chamber. We could bring laptops, and there would be internet access. But the House press gallery forbids photography; we would have to type out descriptions of any visuals we wanted to capture. We also faced another challenge: hand-entering 431 votes split among four wall-size screens. Worse, the press seats were beneath the screens, making them hard to see. Several ill-placed wall lamps added to the difficulty. And once the voting period ended, the screens turned off, and the vote tally disappeared.On my test runs, the press area of the chamber was empty. I learned that most reporters in the Capitol spend very little time in the chamber. They know the exact path senators and representatives walk from their offices to the chamber for a vote. They stand along that path and wait to ask questions.Tom used my on-site reports to make a Google sheet that looked similar to the panels in the House chamber, saving us precious seconds as we rushed to get the votes entered. Wilson worked to make the page easy to read even with 431 votes. Many others pitched in to help. The final dispatch had 13 bylines.On the morning of the vote, we got to the chamber in time for some procedural votes \u2014 so we could do a practice run. I stashed a recovery banana in my backpack for after the vote. Kevin Quealy, an Upshot graphics editor and a runner, strapped on a heart monitor left over from a previous Sports-data experiment. We waited through hours of speeches and clapping, booing and heckling from the members. The press gallery filled up. We jockeyed for the best angles at the scoreboards and coordinated via the Slack messaging app. House Speaker Paul Ryan fidgeted in his seat.I sat still among the chaos and tried to remember to breathe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Court Files Raise Question: Was Dylann Roof Competent to Defend Himself?", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byBut the information that Mr. Roof worked so hard to suppress has now become public, as Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court this month finished unsealing thousands of pages of psychiatric reports and transcripts from the November and January hearings. The documents provide, for the first time, a multidimensional portrait of a withdrawn but strikingly intelligent misfit whose tastes ran to Dostoyevsky, classical music and NPR but who said his \u201cdream job\u201d would be working at an airport convenience store. He exhibited disturbingly introverted behavior from an early age \u2014 playing alone, never starting conversations \u2014 but received little treatment for what defense experts later concluded was autism and severe social anxiety, with precursor symptoms of psychosis.Although Mr. Roof\u2019s guilt was never in doubt, his trial left largely unanswered how an awkward adolescent had progressed from reclusive consumer of internet hate to ruthless and remorseless jihadist (his word). The evidence that went unseen affords a rare glimpse of the back story of one of the country\u2019s most horrific hate crimes. And it raises a life-or-death question: If the 12 jurors had been allowed a full accounting, might at least one have been persuaded to spare the young mass murderer from lethal injection?\u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to think I did it because I have some kind of mental problem,\u201d Mr. Roof, now 23, told the judge. \u201cI wanted to increase racial tension.\u201dAt a competency hearing, Dylann Roof sought to represent himself at trial.Mr. Roof also said it was important that he be seen as \u201ca perfect specimen,\u201d unblemished by mental illness, reported Dr. Ballenger, a former chairman of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina. Mr. Roof told another examiner that he might then be rescued after a white nationalist takeover, pardoned, and perhaps even installed as governor. With an autism diagnosis, he told Dr. Ballenger, \u201ceverybody would think I am a weirdo.\u201dIn early November, Mr. Roof sabotaged them by sending a handwritten letter to the prosecution, knowing it could be introduced as evidence: \u201cWhat my lawyers are planning to say in my defense is a lie.\u201d Judge Gergel took seriously enough Mr. Roof\u2019s occasional threats to stab Mr. Bruck that he warned the lawyers against placing pens within his reach.In early November, Mr. Roof sent a handwritten letter to prosecutors.The defense experts depicted a boy born into a strained marriage that ended when he was 5, whose home and school shifted with his mother\u2019s relationships. Dr. Rachel Loftin, the defense expert who first diagnosed Mr. Roof\u2019s autism while he was in jail, wrote that his condition might have been exacerbated by \u201ca chaotic home environment, including exposure to domestic disputes and possible violence.\u201d Mr. Roof performed well in elementary school, but began smoking marijuana at age 13 and soon graduated to prescription drugs and alcohol. His grades plummeted, and he dropped out in 10th grade.Report by Rachel LoftinFamily members reported that for the next five years, Mr. Roof secluded himself in his room, often online, rarely communicating or leaving the house. He never dated. His older sister managed to lure him to a restaurant on his birthday only by dangling a $40 bribe. He showed little initiative to work or become independent. The one time he held a job, with a landscaping firm for two months, he ate lunch apart from co-workers and rarely spoke. He wore a hoodie \u201clike a cocoon,\u201d his mother\u2019s boyfriend said.Mr. Roof\u2019s compulsive obsessions, according to the lawyers and examiners, ran from the brand of his acne wash to the fit and fabric of his clothing to a delusion that his forehead was misshapen (he obscured it with his trademark bowl haircut). He so feared being looked at that he begged his mother not to pull up alongside other cars.The psychiatrists characterized the slightly built Mr. Roof as both childlike and grandiose, and noted his flat affect, incongruent jokes and dearth of empathy.When his mother visited him in late December, her first trip to jail since suffering a heart attack on the trial\u2019s opening day, he asked not about her health, but incessantly about why she had not purchased the pants he wanted to wear to court. At the close of another visit, Mr. Roof\u2019s teenage half sister bade him farewell: \u201cI love you, Dylann, even if you don\u2019t love me back.\u201d\u201cO.K.,\u201d he answered.Records show that Mr. Roof\u2019s only contact with mental health providers came in 2009, when he made three visits to a clinic near Columbia, S.C., after threatening suicide to his mother. He reported persistent anxiety when around others and was given a prescription for an antidepressant, which he reportedly declined to take.The documents include references to racist talk by Mr. Roof\u2019s father, a house contractor, but there is no suggestion it was fundamental to Mr. Roof\u2019s upbringing. Rather, the competency evaluators accepted his assertion that, spurred by the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, he searched Google for \u201cblack-on-white crime,\u201d came across hate-purveying websites and experienced a racial awakening.\u201cBefore he did this research, he said he always had uncomfortable feelings that he could not explain,\u201d wrote Dr. Donna Maddox, the defense team\u2019s forensic psychiatrist. \u201cAfterwards he felt suddenly better.\u201dPsychiatric EvaluationAbsent alternate influences, wrote Dr. Loftin, clinical director of the autism center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, \u201cDylann pursued his preoccupation with racism with an autistic intensity.\u201dDr. Ballenger, who was making his first competency determination, interviewed Mr. Roof for 13 hours and reached a contrary conclusion.His report noted that Mr. Roof\u2019s I.Q. of 125 placed him in the 95th percentile, and that he spoke coherently and logically. Once you understood Mr. Roof\u2019s priorities, he wrote, his thinking about self-representation made a certain sense. Dr. Ballenger diagnosed several anxiety disorders, but not psychosis.Judge Gergel, deeply concerned that the strongest mitigating evidence in a capital case would be quashed, initially warned Mr. Roof he would not let him represent himself.\u201cThat is not, I believe, a proper defense in a situation like this, basically to let the government present its case and the jury then decide,\u201d the judge said at the close of the first hearing.\u201cMy thought about his wisdom, or lack of wisdom, in deciding to self-represent is not the issue,\u201d Judge Gergel said. \u201cI watched him for two hearings. He has the capacity to represent himself.\u201dThe judge accepted Dr. Ballenger\u2019s view that Mr. Roof\u2019s strategy arose from political zealotry, not mental illness, and dismissed Mr. Bruck\u2019s warnings that his intelligence masked deeply delusional thinking. \u201cIf this defendant were incompetent to represent himself,\u201d he wrote, \u201calmost no defendant would be competent to represent himself.\u201dRuling on the question of self-representation.For Mr. Roof, the decision meant that the jury would learn almost nothing about him beyond the brutal heartlessness of his crime. In April, he was moved to the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., site of the federal death row. Judge Gergel has appointed new lawyers for his appeals.Twitter: @ksacknytAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Fires Former Google Engineer at Heart of Self-Driving Dispute", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber said Tuesday that it had fired Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer brought in to lead the company\u2019s self-driving automobile efforts who was accused of stealing trade secrets when he left a job at Google.What Mr. Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for nearly $700 million last year, is the key question in a closely watched lawsuit that pits one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies against Uber, a richly financed up-and-comer.The stakes are enormous for both businesses. Google was a pioneer in autonomous car technology and has spent nearly a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars on its effort, which is now run through Waymo, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. And Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said the future of his ride-hailing company, privately valued at nearly $70 billion, hinges on work being done to create cars that can drive themselves.The dismissal of one of Uber\u2019s most prized technical talents also points to the risks of the star engineering culture that has emerged in Silicon Valley in recent years, leading to giant paydays for a small group of employees.Uber agreed to pay $680 million \u2014 mostly in company equity \u2014 in exchange for the company\u2019s technology and a team of experienced self-driving technology engineers. Mr. Levandowski and his staff would also be entitled to a small percentage of any profits earned from an Uber-owned, self-driving trucking business developed under Mr. Levandowski\u2019s direction.But just months after the acquisition, Waymo sued Uber in civil court, claiming that Uber was using trade secrets stolen from Google to develop Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles \u2014 a plan Waymo alleges was aided by Mr. Levandowski.\u201cOver the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,\u201d Angela L. Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel for employment and litigation, wrote in an email to employees. \u201cOver that same period, Uber has urged Anthony to fully cooperate in helping the court get to the facts and ultimately helping to prove our case.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe take our obligations under the court order very seriously, and so we have chosen to terminate his employment at Uber.\u201dJohnny Luu, a spokesman for Waymo, declined to comment.Uber had little choice but to cut ties with Mr. Levandowski, legal analysts said. The company risked being tarnished if it continued to stand by him, as if it were indirectly condoning his actions.\u201cI don\u2019t think this was an easy decision, but at the end of the day, Uber did what it had to do,\u201d said Elizabeth A. Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida\u2019s law school and an expert in trade secrets law.Firing Mr. Levandowski provides Uber \u201ca way to cut off liabilities potentially and highlights that they were not acting willfully,\u201d said Russell Beck, an intellectual property lawyer and founding partner at the Boston law firm Beck Reed Riden.But firing Mr. Levandowski could mean that he becomes a witness against Uber if he were to claim, for example, that Uber executives looked the other way while he used proprietary information from Waymo to advance Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts. Uber has repeatedly said that it has developed its autonomous car technology on its own.\u201cIt makes it easier for Mr. Levandowski to cut a deal, because he\u2019s no longer associated with Uber,\u201d Ms. Rowe said.More grave for Mr. Levandowski are potential criminal charges. Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the Waymo versus Uber civil case, referred the matter to the United States attorney\u2019s office to look into possible theft of trade secrets. The action opened Mr. Levandowski \u2014 and perhaps Uber \u2014 to the possibility of criminal charges if the Justice Department decides to pursue the case.Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr. Levandowski, did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. Court transcripts show Mr. Levandowski\u2019s lawyers have advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment right.Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a small pool in Silicon Valley with the specialized know-how to lead efforts on self-driving cars. Technology companies and traditional automakers alike are sometimes paying tens of millions of dollars per employee.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Levandowski, however, may not see his rich payday from Uber. He has been employed at Uber for less than a year and none of his shares have vested, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement, nor has he met certain project milestones determined at the time of acquisition. Typically, shares in Uber reach vested status over a multiyear period.Uber will also face hardship as a result of the dismissal. Mr. Levandowski, who has dedicated his entire professional life to the study and development of robotics and self-driving research, was integral to nearly every component of the company\u2019s autonomous operations.Eric Meyhofer, a former deputy of Mr. Levandowski, will lead the autonomous vehicle project, overseeing hundreds of engineers working in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and soon in Toronto.Uber has also experienced a string of executives departing, including Jeff Jones, president of the company\u2019s ride-sharing operations, and Amit Singhal, the senior vice president for engineering, who left after accusations of sexual harassment while working at Google were unearthed shortly after he started at Uber.This week, Josh Mohrer, a general manager at Uber who had been embroiled in controversy, left to join a venture firm. And the results of an investigation into Uber\u2019s companywide culture are expected to be delivered to the company\u2019s board of directors on Wednesday.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Pedro, Calif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Discovers the Dangers of Governing at Daredevil Speed", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump was determined to leave his mark on Washington quickly. Now the city is leaving its bruising mark on him, with the same astonishing swiftness that has been a hallmark of his lightning-strike political career.Mr. Trump has worn out opponents, journalists, members of Congress, foreign leaders, his staff \u2014 and now himself \u2014 with a breakneck barrage of executive actions, policy proposals and reversals, taunts, boasts and drowsy-hour Twitter assaults, all meant to disrupt American politics as usual.But the president, who set a killing pace during his first four tumultuous months in office, has now been knocked off balance by an accelerating inquiry into possible collusion by his presidential campaign with Russia, as well as the backlash against his firing of the F.B.I. director who was leading the investigation.Ten days of shocks, kicking off with Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise ouster of James B. Comey on May 9 and continuing through the revelation on Friday that the president had called the F.B.I. chief a \u201cnut job\u201d in front of Russian officials, have left the West Wing reeling.Aides talked about living in dread of \u201c5 o\u2019clock,\u201d marking the arrival of the daily dump of damaging leaks or fresh reports of staff infighting.What unnerves Mr. Trump and his staff the most is the eerily familiar tempo of these disclosures. It is as if some unseen adversary has copied Mr. Trump\u2019s own velocity and ferocity in an attempt to destroy him, several people close to the president said. Sources are shuttling all kinds of information about Mr. Trump to reporters at a pace the White House cannot match.Congressional Republicans, fearful that their hopes of passing tax overhaul and health care bills are vanishing, are no less alarmed. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, urged the president to conduct his affairs with less \u201cdrama,\u201d and others are openly urging Mr. Trump to plan beyond the short time horizon of a reposted message on Twitter.\u201cWashington feels like a kiddie soccer game \u2014 tons of frenzy but no strategy,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, who has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.\u201cAll our leaders \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, Congress and the executive \u2014 need to be thinking bigger than the news cycle and planning for the policy challenges of five and 10 years in the future. Are we going to have restored public trust or further eroded it? That\u2019s the question each of us should be asking.\u201dIn a telling turnabout, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team are hoping to slow the tempo set by the president and his hard-charging chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.They have suggested that he calm down, spend less time on Twitter, and avoid making decisions too quickly.Most of his top staff members were suggesting pumping the brakes when the president was suggesting that he was leaning toward quickly hiring Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator, as Mr. Comey\u2019s replacement.Among an otherwise fractious staff, there seems to be one point of unanimity: They want to buy the president, and themselves, time to maneuver, to reset and to recover from a rapid succession of devastating blows.But catching their breath is no easy feat while working for a president who posts Twitter messages impulsively, often cuts off briefers after a few minutes and issues iron commands on spur-of-the-moment emotions.\u201cDuring the campaign, Donald Trump never stopped to refuel, and he speeded up through every caution flag,\u201d said Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 press secretary, who helped lead the effort to defend against Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks during the campaign.\u201cBut when you run every single race at a daredevil pace, well, eventually you are going to get into a pretty violent wreck,\u201d he added.Brian Ott, a Texas Tech professor who has analyzed Mr. Trump\u2019s use of social media, said: \u201cThe velocity at which this is happening right now is absolutely unprecedented. News is breaking so fast the stories are stepping on each other.\u201dSo far, Mr. Trump, who lives by a hammerhead shark\u2019s swim-or-die credo, has shown no signs of slowing down.While aides took pains to describe what they called his calm reaction to the appointment last week of Robert S. Mueller III as a special counsel in the Russia investigation, in reality he expressed anger from the start.By the next morning, he was in a fighting mood, lashing out in a series of early-morning Twitter posts.For all of its perils, the Mueller investigation presents the White House with time to regain lost momentum and switch the dial back to governing.\u201cI believe that the appointment of Mueller is actually great news for Trump in the short and medium term,\u201d said Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of the conservative National Review and a frequent Trump critic. \u201cIf he plays it right, he can do what Bill Clinton used to do, which is to say, \u2018I want to talk about the investigation, but we have to wait and see what the investigators come up with.\u2019 That would give him some breathing room.\u201cThe problem, of course, is that Trump is going to be Trump.\u201dBefore the Comey story exploded, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff viewed the nine-day overseas trip that the president began on Friday as a way to press the pause button.One staff member even Googled the top speed of Air Force One \u2014 631 miles per hour \u2014 to see just how quickly he could escape the troubles of Washington.The president wasn\u2019t quite so eager to leave.Mr. Trump, according to several people in his inner circle, pressed to shorten the trip to five or six days. He argued that he could get more done \u201cat my desk\u201d than kibitzing with European leaders or staging photo ops in the Holy Land.While Mr. Trump was the first candidate to fully weaponize Twitter, now that he is president, the rapid speed of social media has been turned against him.Many of the advantages that Mr. Trump had as a fast-moving outsider candidate \u2014 namely his ability to ridicule adversaries into submission on cable or social media \u2014 aren\u2019t nearly as useful in the presidency. Twitter is far less effective in defense than offense, and unflattering fact has much greater power than Twitter bombast to set the narrative of a presidency.Twitter could ultimately be the means of his undoing, current and former White House officials said.\u201cFor Trump, at this point, social media isn\u2019t helping \u2014 it\u2019s an accelerant,\u201d said Bob Bauer, President Barack Obama\u2019s first White House counsel, who was known for his caution during his two-and-a-half-year West Wing tenure.\u201cI think the Watergate example is overused, and we don\u2019t know where all of this will lead, but just think about the slower pace of that investigation,\u201d Mr. Bauer said.\u201cIt took a long time for people to know what Nixon was thinking and feeling. Then they heard those tapes,\u201d he added. \u201cNixon\u2019s fortunes declined markedly when people heard it all in real time \u2014 all those four-letter words, his disrespect for institutions, his crudity. Trump is tweeting all of this in real time. Just think about that. He\u2019s creating tapes with those tweets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ford Moves to Trim Its Ranks as Its Chief Faces a Test", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byDETROIT \u2014 It was not long ago that Ford Motor was considered the healthiest of the Detroit automakers.Unlike General Motors and Chrysler, Ford survived the financial crisis that began in 2007 without the help of bankruptcy or a government bailout, and had appeared well positioned to take advantage of the booming American auto market.But investors have taken a more pessimistic view, raising questions about the leadership of its chief executive, Mark Fields.Ford\u2019s stock has declined about 40 percent since Mr. Fields took over three years ago, and 10 percent since Jan. 1, even as the overall market has risen. And with profits slipping, Ford is under pressure to engineer a turnaround \u2014 starting with Wednesday\u2019s announcement that it would cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia.The cutbacks are relatively small given Ford\u2019s global work force of 202,000. Yet it appears to be just the beginning of a long retrenchment for the nation\u2019s No. 2 car company, and a critical test for Mr. Fields and his strategy to vault Ford into the high-tech race to develop self-driving cars and electric vehicles.\u201cI think Ford is in a tough spot,\u201d said David Whiston, an analyst with the investment firm Morningstar. \u201cThere\u2019s no one or two silver bullets that will make the stock rally.\u201dCutting costs while investing in advanced technology is, indeed, a difficult balancing act. Ford is trimming salaried employees, G.M. is cutting production shifts at some factories and Fiat Chrysler has idled plants that make passenger cars. Automakers have also increased discounts to move bulging inventories of unsold models.Ford, for its part, is tamping down expectations for its all-important North American division, which accounts for a vast majority of its profits. The company\u2019s earnings fell more than 30 percent in the first quarter, and Mr. Fields has said the full-year results will also be down from 2016.But it is proving hard to sell Ford shareholders on diminished results in the short term, while the company continues to invest heavily in future technology \u2014 particularly when it is competing with Silicon Valley heavyweights like Google on self-driving research.Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Fields should be bolder in remaking the company by reducing its car lineup further \u2014 and possibly getting out of the unprofitable small-car business entirely.But most have generally supported Ford\u2019s twin-barreled approach. Brian Johnson of Barclays, for example, said the company\u2019s strategy was sound, and contrasted its \u201cunsplashy\u201d actions with the stock-market hype surrounding the upstart electric carmaker Tesla.\u201cAs opposed to making Twitter claims around full autonomy and electric trucks, Ford has an underappreciated strategy toward electrification and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote in a research note.The anticipation for Tesla\u2019s future has helped it pass Ford and G.M. in market value, even though it makes a fraction of the cars that Ford produces. And Tesla already has two distinct electric cars on the road, while Ford is limited to selling niche, battery-powered versions of conventional models.The business pressures add up to a moment of truth for Mr. Fields. His predecessor, Alan R. Mulally, was given credit for steering Ford through the recession and simplifying its product lineup through his \u201cOne Ford\u201d strategy. Much of Ford\u2019s emphasis during his tenure was on smaller, fuel-efficient passenger cars, which have since lost favor with customers because of low gas prices.And while G.M. and Chrysler floundered with high costs, shifting strategies, and constant turnover of senior executives, Ford seemed a model of consistency.\u201cThe One Ford plan was an elegant and powerful blueprint that became the mantra of the firm\u2019s reinvention from the last crisis,\u201d said Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. \u201cThere are important lessons here.\u201dMr. Fields is clearly trying to sharpen his focus after an extended board meeting last week. William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s chairman, admitted at the company\u2019s recent annual meeting that he was frustrated by the stock price.The first sign of how Mr. Fields is responding to the drumbeat of negative news came on Wednesday, when the company said it would offer early retirement packages and buyouts to 10 percent of salaried workers in certain business units in North America and Asia.Those separation packages, however, do not include employees in product development, information technology and the company\u2019s Ford Credit arm. The company said factory jobs were also unaffected.The cutbacks are aimed at \u201creducing costs and becoming as lean and efficient as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement. At the same time, Ford said it was committed to \u201cinvesting aggressively, but prudently\u201d in new operations devoted to future technology.Ford is holding its own in selling truck and sport-utility vehicles, but it has big problems in passenger-car segments, where sales have plunged almost 25 percent so far this year.By comparison, sales of cars at Toyota and G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet division are down only about 11 percent during the same period.One analyst said Ford\u2019s cars were older in comparison to its rivals, and need to be updated to better compete. \u201cThe Fusion was pretty cutting edge when it was redesigned in 2013, but now it looks dated,\u201d said the analyst, Jessica Caldwell of the auto-research site Edmunds.Ford also has a big hole in the subcompact S.U.V. segment, and has gained little traction in the market from its hybrid gas-electric models.The larger issue is whether Mr. Fields could tinker with the current strategy enough to convince investors that Ford has a bright future.Those investments were intended to help Mr. Fields reach an ambitious goal. Last summer, speaking at Ford\u2019s research center in Silicon Valley, he vowed that the company would begin mass producing a self-driving car \u2014 with no steering wheel and no pedals \u2014 by 2021.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Uber and Waymo Ended Up Rivals in the Race for Driverless Cars", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported bySo Mr. Kalanick spent much of 2015 raiding Google\u2019s engineering corps. To learn about the technology, he struck up a friendship with Anthony Levandowski, a top autonomous vehicle engineer at \u201cG-co,\u201d Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pet name for Google.The friendship developed into a partnership. Mr. Levandowski left Google last year to form Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up. Uber acquired it months later for nearly $700 million. Mr. Kalanick subsequently appointed Mr. Levandowski to run Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle research.The implications are set to reverberate far beyond the courtroom. Any setback for Uber will shake up the driverless car industry, which is locked in a bitter race to introduce and commercialize autonomous cars. Silicon Valley tech titans and Detroit automakers are making huge investments \u2014 bets that autonomous vehicle technology will usher in a new age of how people get around. For some companies, especially traditional carmakers, their very survival is at stake.That aggressiveness has spurred an intense rivalry with Waymo. Waymo\u2019s legal pursuit of Uber and Mr. Levandowski is out of corporate character; Google has tended to refrain from suing former employees who move to competitors. Many at Google and Waymo are incensed at Mr. Levandowski and how he may have betrayed them for a rich payday, according to current and former employees.\u201cThis is a race where every single minute seems to count,\u201d said Carl W. Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, who has followed the Waymo-Uber case.Uber and Waymo declined to comment for this article.Uber and Google once considered each other allies. Google\u2019s venture capital arm, now known as GV, spotted Uber\u2019s potential early and invested more than $200 million in the fledgling ride-hailing network in 2013.David Drummond, then Google\u2019s chief legal counsel and an early Uber enthusiast, took a seat on Uber\u2019s board. At one point, Google promoted Uber as a transportation option in the Google Maps app, and Uber drivers relied on Google Maps.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.But the relationship crumbled as the two companies\u2019 paths converged. Google began testing its own car-pooling service inside Waze, a mapping app it owns. Uber eventually moved away from relying solely on Google Maps.Around then, the friendship between Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Kalanick deepened, according to people close to both men. After \u201cjam sessions\u201d between the two \u2014 essentially brainstorming meetings where they would walk and talk over the future of driving \u2014 Mr. Kalanick\u2019s pedometer would clock in with thousands of steps.Both men had little love for Google. Mr. Levandowski had grown impatient with the pace at Google\u2019s self-driving car unit, which was suffering from infighting and had been slow to move forward with some of its plans, according to two people familiar with Mr. Levandowski.Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, had realized the growing threat from Google. Uber\u2019s reliance on Google Maps was making him nervous, especially after Google started \u201crate-limiting\u201d Uber\u2019s use of the service, asking Uber to pay for access over time.Mr. Kalanick also had a personal ax to grind with Mr. Brin. The night before the 2014 tech conference, Mr. Kalanick received a call from Mr. Drummond, who said Mr. Brin might raise the possibility of Google\u2019s dabbling in the ride-hailing market onstage the next day \u2014 a way to monetize autonomous vehicles \u2014 according to three people familiar with the conversation. Google stopped short of saying it planned to introduce such a service, but Mr. Brin showed Google\u2019s self-driving car.Mr. Kalanick was shocked at what he saw as a potential strike against Uber, according to people with knowledge of the event. He and Mr. Brin were supposed to clear the air at a private dinner that evening, but they spoke only briefly. After Mr. Brin\u2019s presentation, Mr. Kalanick later called Mr. Drummond to vent for what he considered an unexpected ambush from a friend and partner.In February of this year, Waymo sued Uber. Uber had crossed the line, Waymo said in legal documents, with Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up created as a way for Uber to steal trade secrets and copy its designs for lidar \u2014 short for light detection and ranging, a crucial hardware component in an autonomous vehicle.Before Mr. Levandowski left Google, Waymo claimed, he and other Google staff members who would become Otto employees took thousands of files of research, as well as valuable supplier lists, manufacturing details and other technical information. Mr. Levandowski then tried to cover his tracks, according to the complaint, wiping his laptop\u2019s hard drive of its data.The behavior could be traced to December 2015, Waymo said. At the time, Mr. Levandowski searched Google\u2019s network for login details for a document repository for the autonomous vehicle program, whose code name was \u201cChauffeur.\u201d He then installed software that let him download 9.7 gigabytes of data on Google\u2019s driverless car program. A few days later, Mr. Levandowski put a memory card into his laptop for eight hours, according to Waymo.Waymo discovered the deception inadvertently when it was copied on an email from a supplier, with drawings of Uber\u2019s design for its lidar. The designs bore a \u201cstriking resemblance\u201d to Waymo\u2019s designs, the company said.\u201cOtto and Uber have taken Waymo\u2019s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time and expense of independently developing their own technology,\u201d Waymo said in its lawsuit.On Monday, the federal judge in the case said Waymo had shown \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that Mr. Levandowski \u201cdownloaded over 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company.\u201d He ordered Uber to return any files to Waymo. The judge had separately referred the case to the United States attorney\u2019s office, raising the possibility of criminal charges for those involved.The case is headed to trial this year, but Mr. Levandowski is planning a break from the legal action. He and Eric Meyhofer, another Uber self-driving car executive, are discussing a trip to Indiana, according to two people familiar with the plans. There they intend to watch the Indianapolis 500 over Memorial Day weekend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Stock Market, International Is Actually First", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIf you had taken his words at face value, you might have expected that big American companies that make nearly all of their money in the United States would flourish in a new, America First environment.But that\u2019s not the way it has turned out, at least not in the stock market so far.Shares of American companies that make nearly all of their sales domestically have lagged behind those that generate most of their revenue outside American borders. In fact, those globalized companies \u2014 I\u2019ll call them International First companies \u2014 have outperformed America First companies by a wide margin.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, ran the numbers at my request. He found that 113 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index make at least 50 percent of their sales outside the United States. Their fortunes depend, to a large extent, on the rest of the world\u2019s economic trends.By contrast, the America First category contains 161 S.&.P. 500 companies that make at least 90 percent of their sales within the United States. The group includes retailers like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Target, railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern, and regional natural gas and petroleum companies like Southwestern Energy, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural. All of their fortunes are determined mainly by events and policies within the United States.While each stock has its own story, Mr. Hickey said he found a clear pattern in the overall data. From the presidential election on Nov. 8 through this past Tuesday, he said, shares in the International First group gained an average 13.56 percent, compared with only 8.15 percent for the America First shares, for a spread of 5.41 percentage points.Why have the internationally oriented companies outperformed the domestically focused ones? Several factors explain the discrepancy.First, the initial wild enthusiasm in financial markets for Trump policies faded.\u201cThere was a lot of optimism by people in the markets about America First policies right after the election,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, \u201cbut in 2017 in actual terms, that has been completely flipped.\u201dSoon after the election, when the Trump rally in the overall stock market had the most momentum, the America First companies did outperform the International First group. The markets may then have been reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s publicly stated views, which he summarized in his inaugural address this way: \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\u201dAmerican companies with little foreign exposure maintained an advantage in the stock market until mid-March, when the tables turned and the International First group pulled ahead.More precisely, measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar peaked in strength on Jan. 3 \u2014 with a 6.53 percent gain since the election \u2014 and then began to plummet. On Thursday, the dollar was still stronger than it had been on Election Day, but by less than 1 percent.Some of that decline may have been simple mean reversion, a tendency of markets to return to an average level after a big move. But there was more to it than that.Domestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda. That helps globalized companies.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about America First policies these days,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming clear that even if you don\u2019t get thorough tax policy reform done or a big infrastructure stimulus program done, the stock market isn\u2019t falling apart. Instead, the stocks that are leading the market now are not America First plays, they are international plays \u2014 companies geared toward international exposure that benefit from a weaker dollar and better growth overseas.\u201dThen there is the tax question. Despite the political turmoil in Washington, tax cuts and a possible windfall for the International First companies remain on the table. The administration still aims at repatriating at least some of the $2 trillion in stranded overseas corporate cash and ending the taxation of newly minted corporate profits earned abroad. Market analysts are already calculating the potential benefits to companies with substantial foreign earnings and big cash hoards, like Apple.Put all of that together, and you get a recipe for a rally in International First companies. America First may be the administration\u2019s slogan, but for the most part, the stock market has been ignoring it.Advertisement"}

In the process, victims allowed spammers to raid their contact lists and send even more email.\u201cWe are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs,\u201d Google said statement posted on Twitter. \u201cWe encourage you to not click through and report as phishing within Gmail.\u201dIt is not clear who created the spam email or how many people it has affected.In a second statement, on Wednesday evening, Google said that it had disabled the accounts responsible for the spam, updated its systems to block it and was working on ways to prevent such an attack from recurring.If you receive suspicious email, here are some tips:1. Do not click, even when the email is from your mother.Even when you receive links from trusted contacts, be careful what you click. Spammers, cybercriminals and, increasingly, nation-state spies are resorting to basic email attacks, known as spear phishing, which bait victims into clicking on links that download malicious software, or lure them into turning over their user names and passwords.Find out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last four years.A quarter of phishing attacks studied last year by Verizon were found to be nation-state spies trying to gain entry into their target\u2019s inboxes, up from the 9 percent of attacks reported in 2016.In this case, the malicious emails all appeared to come from a contact, but were actually from the address \u201chhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com\u201d with recipients BCCed.2. Turn on multifactor authentication.Google and most other email, social media and banking services offer customers the ability to turn on multifactor authentication. Use it. When you log in from an unrecognized computer, the service will prompt you to enter a one-time code texted to your phone. It is the most basic way to prevent hackers from breaking into your accounts with a stolen password.3. Shut it down.If you accidentally clicked on the Google phishing attack and gave spammers third-party access to your Google account, you can revoke their access by following these steps:Revoke access to \u201cGoogle Docs\u201d (the app will have access to contacts and drive).4. Change your passwords ... again.If you\u2019ve been phished, change your passwords to something you have never used before. Ideally, your passwords should be long and should not be words that could be found in a dictionary. The first things hackers do when breaking into a site is use computer programs that will try every word in the dictionary. Your email account is a ripe target for hackers because your inbox is the key to resetting the passwords of, and potentially breaking into, dozens of other accounts.Make your password long and distinctive. Security specialists advise creating acronyms based on song lyrics, movie quotations or sayings. For example, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d movie quotation \u201cLeave the gun. Take the cannoli,\u201d becomes LtG,tTcannol1.5. Report it.Report any phishing attacks to Google by clicking the downward arrow at the top right of your inbox and selecting \u201cReport Phishing.\u201d Companies count on those reports to investigate such scams and stop them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Democrats See a Launching Pad in Trump", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Democratic leaders in California are in near-constant combat with President Trump these days, pushing back on his policies on immigration, health care and the environment. They are girding for massive cuts in financial assistance, dirtier air and the potential of drilling along the Pacific Coast.Yet by one rudimentary measurement \u2014 climbing up the political ladder \u2014 Mr. Trump may not entirely a bad thing for Democrats here. At a time when this state\u2019s political leadership is in the midst of a generational transition, top Democrats \u2014 while clearly in fundamental disagreement with much of what the new president is doing \u2014 see in him as a way to draw attention and position themselves in crowded fields to run for governor, lieutenant governor and, potentially, United States senator.Hence, the frequent assaults on Mr. Trump from a chorus of Democrats running for higher office, or thinking about it: Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom; the attorney general, Xavier Becerra; the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti; and his predecessor, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, to name a few.Basking in the Trump spotlight this week is Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the state Senate. Mr. de Le\u00f3n took the lead in announcing ambitious legislation that would accelerate California\u2019s drive to reduce carbon emissions, requiring the state to get 100 percent of its retail electricity from renewable resources by 2045.\u201cHe is clearly eying a next step,\u201d said Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs.Mr. de Le\u00f3n, in an interview, was quick to point out that he has, since Election Day, been one of the leading critics of the new president. \u201cI\u2019ve always been strong on these issues regarding Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I took advantage and became opportunistic and jumped in front of the parade in a New York minute to lead the resistance. Look at my record.\u201dThat said, because of term limits, Mr. de Le\u00f3n has to step down next year. Asked what the next step in his own political career is, he responded obliquely.\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I know,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The tallest tower in San Francisco will also be a beacon of public art.The installation is the vision of Jim Campbell, an artist and M.I.T.-trained engineer known for his work with LED lights.The presentation before city planners on Thursday was a courtesy.

{"Headline": "Washington Is Abuzz With Surround Sound of Scandal", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byWashington MemoJulian Epstein, who was the chief counsel for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, said Mr. Trump essentially brought this on himself with his \u201cclumsy and self-defeating\u201d attempts to rid himself of Mr. Comey in the midst of an active F.B.I. investigation into any ties between his campaign associates and Russia.\u201cWith the appointment of Mueller, they have now totally lost control of this train and have very limited ability to manage the widening crisis around it,\u201d Mr. Epstein said. \u201cThis will go down as one of the most inept and counterproductive efforts of damage control that we\u2019ve ever seen in public life.\u201dThe president and the White House tried to get through the day by going through the motions of regular governing, much as Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Mr. Clinton did when facing investigations. Mr. Trump flew on Air Force One to Connecticut for the Coast Guard Academy commencement and returned to the White House to interview candidates to replace Mr. Comey. Vice President Mike Pence hosted a reception for Asian-American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Ivanka Trump convened a meeting to talk about human trafficking.But there was nothing regular about the day and there may not be anything regular about many of the days to come. Even before the latest developments, Mr. Trump\u2019s legislative agenda was going nowhere. So many journalists swarmed the Capitol on Wednesday trying to buttonhole lawmakers about Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Mr. Comey that the Senate press gallery sent out a warning about \u201cSenate hallway congestion.\u201d\u201cFor President Trump, the drip, drip, drip of scandal has sidetracked, for example, health care and tax reform,\u201d said James Robenalt, author of \u201cJanuary 1973: Watergate, Roe v. Wade, Vietnam and the Month That Changed America Forever.\u201d\u201cIf this continues, the paralysis, as with Nixon, will cause a loss of confidence overseas, our enemies will be emboldened, and at home the Republican agenda will stall.\u201dWhile Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, became the first lawmaker to call for impeachment and Representative Justin Amash of Michigan became the first Republican to say the allegations in Mr. Comey\u2019s memo, if true, could be grounds for impeachment, the prospect of such a process remained distant. Both Nixon and Mr. Clinton faced a House that was in the hands of the opposition party when impeachment proceedings began. Mr. Trump is relying on his fellow Republicans as a firewall.But that did not stop talk, especially on the left. The pace of political life has only accelerated and intensified since Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment in 1974 and Mr. Clinton was impeached in 1998 and acquitted in a Senate trial the next year. Google Trends reported more than 20,000 searches on the phrase \u201cTrump impeachment\u201d on Tuesday as news of Mr. Comey\u2019s memo emerged.At the White House, nerves were on edge as well. When a White House spokesman makes a point of attributing everything to the president rather than making assertions in his own voice, it suggests a trepidation about vouching for accounts that may eventually be contradicted by the president himself.So when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, briefed reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday, he carefully quoted Mr. Trump, answering many questions with phrases like: \u201cThe president is confident\u2026\u201d \u201cThe president has been very clear\u2026\u201d and \u201cThe president does not believe\u2026\u201dAfter Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment was announced, the White House issued a statement in the president\u2019s name, not that of any of his representatives. And whether he knew it or not, Mr. Trump echoed Mr. Clinton\u2019s approach, that he was focused on his day job. \u201cI will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said.In the end, he said, \u201call are caught up in the vortex.\u201dFollow Peter Baker at @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thailand Warns Facebook After Video Seems to Show King in Crop Top", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byThe standoff is the latest sign of a clampdown on online speech by a military junta that seized power in a 2014 coup, and the latest test for Facebook, which has struggled to balance local laws and cultural expectations with its core identity as a network where people are free to share ideas and news.\u201cThe government\u2019s moves to restrict Facebook indicate that it is solidifying ideologically around the monarchy, making it the cornerstone of its overall efforts to stem political freedom,\u201d said David Streckfuss, author of \u201cTruth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and L\u00e8se-Majest\u00e9.\u201d\u201cIts main tactic will be to refashion this law, already much abused, into an offensive weapon designed to eliminate all forms of political opposition,\u201d he said.Takorn Tantasith, secretary general of Thailand\u2019s National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, told reporters on Tuesday that 131 Facebook pages that were deemed to violate computer crimes or l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws had not yet been removed.He said that the government had obtained a court order to block 34 of the pages and was still working on the others, and that Facebook had agreed to cooperate. He did not say which pages or what was on them.\u201cWe must thank Facebook for cooperating with us and complying with Thai law,\u201d he said.Mr. Somsak\u2019s post has been blocked in Thailand, and neither the government nor Facebook has publicly said whether it was one of the 131 in question.Also this month, the domestic news media quoted the Thai Internet Service Provider Association as saying that it would be forced to shut down Facebook by Tuesday morning if the company had not removed all 131 pages. That shutdown did not occur, and the standoff was not receiving much attention on social media in the country on Tuesday.The l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law carries a maximum jail term of 15 years.The video has been blocked in Thailand but was still available outside the country on Tuesday.Facebook, which opened an office in Thailand in 2015, declined to answer questions about its operations in the country or the pages that the government wants to remove. A spokeswoman, Clare Wareing, said only that the company\u2019s policy was to comply with requests by governments to restrict access to content that officials believed violated local laws.\u201cWhen we receive such a request, we review it to determine if it puts us on notice of unlawful content,\u201d Ms. Wareing said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf we determine that it does, then we make it unavailable in the relevant country or territory and notify people who try to access it why it is restricted.\u201dFacebook has faced political blowback in the region for posts on its social network.In Thailand, Facebook has done its best to show respect to sensitivities around the monarchy. After King Bhumibol\u2019s death, the network completely suspended advertisements in Thailand on its site for a week.Yet the government\u2019s new demands have presented a distinctly new challenge for the company: While it can say it is following local laws in taking down videos of the king, its actions may embolden other world leaders to expect the same treatment.Facebook\u2019s website says that, after requests from the Thai Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, it restricted 40 pieces of content from last July to December that reportedly violated l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws, up from 10 in the previous six months.\u201cDespite good cooperation between the regulator and the ministry to prevent illicit content on websites over the last two years, the government hopes for more, and expects better\u201d results by May, he said.Last week, the commission said it had identified about 6,900 web addresses that required blocking, including about 600 total from Google, Facebook and YouTube. Google and YouTube had removed the addresses of their own accord, the commission said, and Facebook removed 178 of the 309 Facebook pages that the government had cited, also of its own accord. But 131 other Facebook pages were encrypted, it said, so it would seek the company\u2019s help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Networks Offer Taste of TV\u2019s Ad Future. Marketers Are Hungry for More.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAmerica\u2019s biggest television networks invited advertisers to New York institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center last week, giving them an early glimpse at their fall lineups and treating them to lavish parties and a parade of stars including Stephen Colbert, Kim Kardashian and Tony Romo, all with the aim of attracting billions of dollars in advertising by the end of the summer.The tradition dates to the 1960s, when viewing habits were entirely different. And while the networks have spent the past few years trying to convince marketers of their digital prowess despite falling ratings and new platforms for watching TV, Silicon Valley seemed to cast an especially long shadow this year.\u201cMost networks are starting to recognize that the standard model of 18 minutes of 30-second spots in a 60-minute show will never grow and is probably not sustainable,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD. \u201cJust making more compelling shows is not going to solve that problem.\u201cThat goose continues to lay golden eggs; they\u2019re just smaller every year,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThis is the same challenge the record companies had: How fast do you shift to a new model at the risk of your existing, lucrative one?\u201dTurner Broadcasting, which owns channels like CNN, TBS and TNT, especially impressed advertisers with its presentation. The company emphasized its willingness to experiment with new, longer formats for traditional commercials and said it would continue to reduce the number of ads it runs during shows. It is risky to cut back on ad inventory, especially as ratings decline, but the company contends that doing so creates a better viewer experience and more effective, engaging commercials.Turner also highlighted its new data and audience-targeting collaboration with its rivals Viacom and Fox Networks Group and the number of video-on-demand rentals its properties commanded in the first quarter.\u201cI was really kind of blown away by Turner,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, an executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who oversees paid media investments. He said the company\u2019s presentation, as well as some of the new advertising ideas discussed by Fox Networks Group and CBS, addressed the major concern that he and other marketers shared: How do you compete for consumers\u2019 attention, especially as they move to block ads and turn to platforms like Netflix, where running commercials is not an option?\u201cIf the consumer\u2019s in control, you have to figure out how to adapt your consumer experience to the device they\u2019re going to consume your content on,\u201d he said.The Fox group also discussed a new system for measuring the effectiveness of ads on its online properties to help marketers determine which versions to use just hours later on traditional TV.That fits into a broader narrative in the TV industry, in which executives have long complained that as Americans increasingly watch shows on an array of devices, and do so outside the three- or seven-day windows that are now measured, networks are not getting full credit for their total audience figures.Joe Marchese, Fox Networks Group\u2019s new ad sales chief, dismissed Facebook\u2019s claim that it could offer advertisers a \u201cSuper Bowl on mobile every day,\u201d saying that the number of video ad minutes available in Fox\u2019s prime-time broadcasts \u201cdwarf\u201d those on YouTube and Facebook.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales chief, expressed skepticism that people \u201cliking\u201d an ad or product on Facebook actually led to sales. And Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, cited Amazon, Apple and Google as companies that, like the network, were \u201call about mass audience\u201d while noting that all three also paid to advertise with CBS.Still, the new ideas about advertising did not dominate the presentations, in part because the concepts are still evolving but mostly because the traditional way of selling TV ads remains the biggest moneymaker for the networks.\u201cThe statement used to be \u2018digital pennies for TV dollars,\u2019\u201d said Mike Law, executive vice president for video investments at Amplifi, Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s investment arm. \u201cNow it may be digital nickels for TV dollars, but the vast amount of revenue these networks are generating is coming from TV. In a marketplace we think will be down a little bit in spend volume, networks getting their fair share of revenue is critical to them.\u201dThat may have to change, particularly now that networks have given marketers a taste of new possibilities. Mr. Paskalis of Bank of America, for one, was left wanting more.\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see the most, frankly, is even more focus on user experience and opportunities for marketers to join the conversation around the programming than just advertise adjacent to the programming,\u201d Mr. Paskalis said.

{"Headline": "Amazon to Share New Building With Homeless Shelter in Seattle", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region\u2019s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came.Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary\u2019s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall.Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators.\u201cI see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,\u201d said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary\u2019s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. \u201cYou come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you\u2019re in, and then you say goodbye. That\u2019s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.\u201dIn an interview at the current Mary\u2019s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon\u2019s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d on the design and construction of the shelter\u2019s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary\u2019s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff.\u201cToo often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,\u201d Ms. Roman said. \u201cKeeping them as neighbors is nice.\u201d\u201cIts reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. \u201cDoing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.\u201dAmazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle\u2019s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.One of the residents of Mary\u2019s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon\u2019s support for the organization at the shelter\u2019s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s people out there who really do care,\u201d Ms. Abbott said.Mr. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon\u2019s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Schoettler made the invitation to Ms. Hartman of Mary\u2019s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s permanent,\u201d Mr. Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, \u201cUntil homelessness is solved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Best Consumer Self-Advocacy Tool You\u2019ve Never Used", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byYour MoneyEven semiprofessional consumers like me run into our share of problems. These are particularly irksome, since we should probably know better than to find ourselves on the wrong end of a busted product or poorly delivered service.So this week, I\u2019m pleased to share with you the single best tool I\u2019ve ever found for getting my money back or my money\u2019s worth. In fact, it has never failed me.It\u2019s called the Executive Email Carpet Bomb (E.E.C.B. for short) \u2014 a well-written message to the right group of corporate executives, whose email addresses are often pretty easy to figure out. A group of renegades at a blog called Consumerist first published the concept 10 years ago this month.Consumerist was originally part of the Gawker Media empire, and Joel Johnson was the founding editor who helped set the tone for its punk-rock, bottoms-up approach. A former phone company support representative, he brought to the blog strong memories of former customers bursting into tears when he saved them piles of money. \u201cWhen people were taken advantage of, I wanted them not to get kicked into the sewer of customer-service phone numbers,\u201d he said in an interview this week, describing the kind of assistance he wanted the site to provide.Here are the instructions: First, the E.E.C.B. is a last resort. Exhaust all other options before bringing out this heavy weaponry. Don\u2019t turn to this until after speaking with a supervisor on a help line, stopping into the bank branch and so on. After all, if everyone bombards senior executives whenever anything goes wrong, the E.E.C.B. will stop working.Second, write a note that is pointed but polite. \u201cMake it cogent and understandable and perhaps even warm and funny,\u201d said Meg Marco, who was a senior editor at the time of the E.E.C.B.\u2019s coinage and now runs Consumerist, these days a sibling brand to Consumer Reports.Keep it short. State the problem quickly. Make a reasonable ask. Don\u2019t threaten to bomb the factory, which an old friend of mine did when two lamps that he had purchased failed in rapid succession. (The stern letter he received in return went up on a dorm room wall.) And try to avoid being one of the crazy-sounding people companies never want to hear from. \u201cDon\u2019t send a rant,\u201d Ms. Marco said.A letter from Ron Lieber, the Times\u2019s Your Money columnist, to executives at Jewel-Osco about a dangerous condition at a grocery store that was affecting neighbors (including his mother).So how well does the E.E.C.B. work? Again, I\u2019ve never had it fail, though I\u2019ve had to resend the note once or twice. I\u2019ve used it at American Airlines more than once, and at Best Buy when it sold me a defective backpack. (Even though a warranty claim should, in theory, have gone to Samsonite, Best Buy stepped up and refunded the money, which I promptly spent on another backpack at Best Buy as a way to express appreciation.) Hertz eventually did the right thing, too, after hitting us with insurance charges that we had specifically declined.When I sent the missive on my mother\u2019s behalf to a variety of Albertsons and Jewel-Osco executives last summer, I heard back from Mike Withers, Jewel-Osco\u2019s president. I checked back with him this week to see whether he had looked me up at the time, but he said that he had not.\u201cI do personally answer most complaints that come to me,\u201d he said in an email from Portugal, where he was visiting his sons. \u201cIf they sent it to me, I assume that they want to hear from me.\u201dI generally don\u2019t pester the president or chief executive, but Jewel-Osco is a small enough part of the Albertsons empire that I figured it was worth a shot. Often, I\u2019ll hear back from someone in an executive customer service department of some sort, after my email gets sent along. And that\u2019s great, too. These agents generally have ninja powers that allow them to cut through red tape, issue refunds or find facts.I\u2019d hoped to speak to Mr. Popken, who wrote the original E.E.C.B. post back in 2007, to tip my cap and congratulate him on a job well done. He now works for a big company himself, however, NBC News. Emily Passer, a spokeswoman there, said Mr. Popken would not be able to help me, and would not explain why on the record.So here\u2019s an E.E.C.B. to NBC News:Dear Colleagues in Truth-Telling, How did we get to a point where journalism organizations won\u2019t let their journalists talk to other journalists about their great journalism? You have many talented people there, and it really wouldn\u2019t hurt to let them talk to other reporters every so often about the impactful work that they\u2019ve done for you or others.

Or unaware of the many discount programs for seniors. Or simply thinking about something else.All are reasons that seniors may not ask for or receive the discounts they qualify for at myriad retailers. After all, a Walgreens cashier can\u2019t be expected to automatically deduct the 20 percent senior discount the chain offers on certain Tuesdays. And many shoppers \u2014 particularly those who are just in their 50s, for whom there are fewer offers \u2014 aren\u2019t in the habit of asking if a discount is an option.The Senior List, for instance, lists dozens of restaurants where older people can qualify for discounts of 10 percent or more, including such major chains as Applebee\u2019s, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Burger King and Chili\u2019s.Retired Brains offers more categories of discounts, like apparel, travel, groceries and entertainment. Who knew that baby boomers and others over 62 could get 10 percent off clothing at Banana Republic and 5 percent off at Greyhound? Or that a 55th birthday qualifies purchasers for 10 percent off Best Western hotels and Midas auto services? (Discounts and deals may vary by the individual store or franchise.)The goal, said Steve Mitchener, who developed Sciddy as a website in 2011 and turned it into an app last year, is to eliminate the \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d nature of senior discounts.Although there is significant overlap among all the senior discount lists \u2014 Sciddy, too, lists Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Banana Republic and others already mentioned here \u2014 the difference is the automatic reminder.For example, \u201cIf you go to Applebee\u2019s, it\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Hey, don\u2019t forget to ask for your senior discount,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mitchener said. Phones not on mute get a ka-ching! notification in addition to a visual cue.Mr. Mitchener, who is 59 and lives in St. Louis, said that he chose the name Sciddy because it is catchy, but that some of his customers have made up their own acronyms. \u201cThe best one yet is \u2018Senior Citizen Instant Daily Discount for You,\u2019\u201d he said.He has six children and seven grandchildren, so he grew accustomed to looking for \u201ckids eat free\u201d signs. Then he realized that, even though he hasn\u2019t considered retiring and won\u2019t for several years, he is old enough to rack up considerable savings when he picks up the check for his large brood, whether at restaurants or the department stores where he and his wife take their grandchildren back-to-school shopping.\u201cSometimes people say to themselves, \u2018Big deal, it\u2019s a 10 percent discount,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mitchener said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re walking down the aisle at the grocery store and your phone pings you and says, \u2018When you get up to the cash register, ask for your discount,\u2019 you\u2019re going to do it.\u201dMost users pay off the cost of the app through savings within the first month, he said.The app\u2019s nine categories for savings include travel (hotels and rental car companies), entertainment (movie theaters, golf courses and concert halls) and pets. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know you can be 55 and save money at the vet\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Mitchener said.Sciddy has identified 260,000 senior discounts, and Mr. Mitchener thinks as many as a million may be available nationwide, including individual stores within franchises. For example, some Dairy Queens offer senior discounts, but others don\u2019t.His team scours the country daily for establishments to add, including those individual franchises. Some Sciddy enthusiasts help by way of a forum where they post new finds and also exchange notes about their experiences with how well, or how poorly, a business honored a discount. A frequent topic is carding, or the need to prove one\u2019s age to get a discount: \u201cIt hardly ever happens,\u201d Mr. Mitchener said.As it is, the age-discount playing field may be becoming more level, as the various programs expand by going after people in middle age. AARP has been sending 49-year-olds invitations to join its organization and reap the rewards of membership on their 50th birthdays. In 1984, it lowered the minimum membership age to 50 from 55.Many of the newly eligible \u201cdefinitely are not aware that they qualify for discounts,\u201d Ms. Chatzky said.At the Senior List, which draws 100,000 visitors a month, Amie Clark, a founder, said her discount lists are one of the top two attractions. The other is reviews of medical alert systems.\u201cWomen 55 and up are our most frequent visitors,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cI think a lot of them come on looking for medical alert systems for their parents, and then they find they can save some money for themselves through the discount lists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Google Took Over the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Education DisruptedThe tech giant is transforming public education with low-cost laptops and free apps. But schools may be giving Google more than they are getting.Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The sixth graders at Newton Bateman, a public elementary school here with a classic red brick facade, know the Google drill.In a social-science class last year, the students each grabbed a Google-powered laptop. They opened Google Classroom, an app where teachers make assignments. Then they clicked on Google Docs, a writing program, and began composing essays.Looking up from her laptop, Masuma Khan, then 11 years old, said her essay explored how schooling in ancient Athens differed from her own. \u201cBack then, they had wooden tablets and they had to take all of their notes on it,\u201d she said. \u201cNowadays, we can just do it in Google Docs.\u201dIn the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google\u2019s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products \u2014 effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.Today, more than half the nation\u2019s primary- and secondary-school students \u2014 more than 30 million children \u2014 use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America\u2019s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.In doing so, Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education \u2014 prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas. It puts Google, and the tech economy, at the center of one of the great debates that has raged in American education for more than a century: whether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers.The director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, touched on that idea in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dSchools may be giving Google more than they are getting: generations of future customers.Google makes $30 per device by selling management services for the millions of Chromebooks that ship to schools. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable.That doesn\u2019t sit well with some parents. They warn that Google could profit by using personal details from their children\u2019s school email to build more powerful marketing profiles of them as young adults.\u201cMy concern is that they are working on developing a profile of this child that, when they hit maturity, they are able to create a better profile,\u201d said David Barsotti, an information technology project manager in the Chicago area whose daughter uses Google tools in elementary school. \u201cThat is a problem, in my opinion.\u201dMr. Rochelle of Google said that when students transfer their school emails and files to a personal Google account, that account is governed by Google\u2019s privacy policy. \u201cPersonal Gmail accounts may serve ads,\u201d he said, but files in Google Drive are \u201cnever scanned for the purpose of showing ads.\u201dGoogle, a unit of the $652 billion Alphabet, is the latest big contender in a decades-old battle among tech companies to hook students as future customers. \u201cIf you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource Consulting, a research company.Google captured these next-generation users so quickly by outpacing its rivals in both educational product development and marketing.In 2013, while other tech firms seemed largely content to sell their existing consumer and business offerings to schools, Mr. Rochelle, a co-developer of Google Docs, set up a team at Google to create apps specifically for schools.10 Photos\u201cTeachers really helped to drive adoption of Google in the classroom, while Apple and Microsoft continued to leverage traditional sales channels,\u201d said Phillip DiBartolo, the chief information officer of Chicago Public Schools.But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app \u2014 effectively bypassing district administrators. In both cases, Google found itself reined in.Mr. Bout said that student data in Google\u2019s core education services (including Gmail, Calendar and Docs) \u201cis only used to provide the services themselves, so students can do things like communicate using email.\u201d These services do not show ads, he said, and \u201cdo not use personal data resulting from use of these services to target ads.\u201dSome parents, school administrators and privacy advocates believe that\u2019s not enough. They say Google should be more forthcoming about the details it collects about students, why it collects them and how it uses them.\u201cIf my daughter came home and logged on to Google Docs on my computer at home, they\u2019ll know it was now coming from this address,\u201d said Mr. Barsotti, the Chicago-area project manager. \u201cIf this is truly for educational purposes, what is their business model and why do they need to collect that?\u201dMr. Casap quickly persuaded university officials to scrap their costly internal email service (an unusual move at the time) and replace it with a free version of the Gmail-and-Docs package that Google had been selling to companies. In one semester, the vast majority of the university\u2019s approximately 65,000 students signed up.And a new Google business was born.This became Google\u2019s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers.The strategy proved so successful in higher education that Mr. Casap decided to try it with public schools.\u201cThat caused the same kind of cascade,\u201d Mr. Casap said. School districts around the country began contacting him, and he referred them to Mr. Nelson, who related Oregon\u2019s experience with Google\u2019s apps.By then, Google was developing a growth strategy aimed at teachers \u2014 the gatekeepers to the classroom \u2014 who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. \u201cThe driving force tends to be the pedagogical side,\u201d Mr. Bout, the Google education executive, said. \u201cThat is something we really embraced.\u201dAlthough business practices like encouraging educators to spread the word to their peers have become commonplace among education technology firms, Google has successfully deployed these techniques on a such a large scale that some critics say the company has co-opted public school employees to gain market dominance.\u201cCompanies are exploiting the education space for sales and public good will,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, the president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm. Parents and educators should be questioning Google\u2019s pervasiveness in schools, he added, and examining \u201chow those in the public sector are carrying the message of Google branding and marketing.\u201dMr. Bout of Google disagreed, saying that the company\u2019s outreach to educators was not a marketing exercise. Rather, he said, it was an effort to improve education by helping teachers learn directly from their peers how to most effectively use Google\u2019s tools.\u201cWe help to amplify the stories and voices of educators who have lessons learned,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it can be challenging for educators to find ways to share with each other.\u201dAt Chicago Public Schools, the teacher-centric strategy played out almost perfectly.\u201cWe were bootlegging using Google apps,\u201d Ms. Magiera recalled in a phone interview. \u201cI just knew I needed my kids to collaborate,\u201d she said, touching on one of Google\u2019s own main arguments for its products.Chicago administrators like Lachlan Tidmarsh, then the school district\u2019s chief information officer, visited Ms. Magiera\u2019s classroom to observe. Mr. Tidmarsh said he concluded that if individual teachers were already using Google\u2019s services, the district should officially adopt the platform \u2014 to make sure, for instance, that younger children couldn\u2019t email with strangers.Ms. Magiera\u2019s advocacy came at an ideal moment. Chicago Public Schools was looking to trim the $2 million a year it was spending on Microsoft Exchange and another email service; it had opened bidding for a less expensive program.Quickly, though, a data privacy and security issue emerged, exposing a culture clash between Google\u2019s business practices and a major school district\u2019s values.Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, Mr. Wagner said, and followed up by emailing links to those policies \u2014 terms that the company could change at any time. \u201cOur lawyers were a little bit apoplectic when they were given links to security things,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a link that can change.\u201dMr. Nelson, the former education official in Oregon, reported similar frustrations over student privacy when his state negotiated a contract with Google. \u201cThat\u2019s why it took 16 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Bout of Google said that the tech company had \u201calways taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.\u201d He added that \u201ceven early versions\u201d of the company\u2019s agreements for its education apps had \u201caddressed\u201d the federal education privacy law.Today, Google\u2019s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law.Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesman said.\u201cWe were always enthusiastic to tell the Google story,\u201d Mr. Tidmarsh said. \u201cI would like to think dozens of school districts switched, based on our success.\u201d(Ms. Magiera has since occasionally worked as a paid speaker for education technology organizations that train teachers on Google\u2019s tools.)\u201cYou can see it radiate out from certain geographic hubs, and that is very deliberate,\u201d Mr. Bout said of Google\u2019s growth strategy for education. \u201cWe are taking a very geographic approach because we know it works.\u201dBy then, Google had developed a simplified, low-cost laptop called the Chromebook. It ran on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and revolved largely around web apps, making it cheaper and often faster to boot up than traditional laptops loaded with locally stored software.But there was one interested audience: public schools. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks.Mr. Casap didn\u2019t talk tech specs. Instead, he held the audience spellbound as he described the challenges he had faced as a Latino student growing up on welfare in a tough Manhattan neighborhood.His message: Education is the great equalizer, and technology breaks down barriers between rich and poor students.In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students in his blue-collar district near O\u2019Hare International Airport faced similar struggles. On the spot, Mr. Markey said, he abandoned his previous plans to buy Microsoft Windows laptops for 3,500 high school students. Now he wanted Chromebooks for them instead.\u201cI went up to Jaime immediately after the presentation and said, \u2018Are you guys ready to ship these?\u2019\u201d Mr. Markey said.Then Mr. Markey went back to his district to inform administrators and teachers that he wanted to order an unproven device that most of them had never heard of. \u201cIt was a tough announcement to make,\u201d he conceded.It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools. Districts administering new online standardized tests needed laptops for students to take them on. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.Another attraction: The Chromebook\u2019s cloud-storage approach made sharing among students easier. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used.\u201cThat is one of the big reasons we took off in education,\u201d said Rajen Sheth, who oversees Google\u2019s Chromebook business. \u201cIn less than 10 seconds, a student can grab a Chromebook and be off and running.\u201dThe Chromebook\u2019s price and usability fit neatly into Mr. Casap\u2019s argument that, for students, access to technology was an issue of fairness. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be vendors in the space,\u201d he said of Google\u2019s education philosophy in an interview last year at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex. \u201cI wanted us to be thought leaders, to have a point of view.\u201dAs he spoke, a group of students trooped past wearing purple superhero capes emblazoned with the logo for Microsoft OneNote, a rival classroom service. Spotting the capes, Mr. Casap said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d He added dryly, \u201cI love gimmicks.\u201dSome critics, though, contend that the equity argument for technology is itself a gimmick that promotes a self-serving Silicon Valley agenda: playing on educators\u2019 altruism to get schools to buy into laptops and apps.\u201cIt centers learning on technology, not students,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, the learning app analyst. \u201cIt is a very narrow lens on equity that leaves out things like student-teacher ratios.\u201d(Mr. Casap said he would not advise school districts with deficiencies in areas like teaching or student support services to invest first in classroom technology.)Mr. Markey, the East Leyden High School principal, had another equity concern. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. How would they do their homework on a Chromebook, which required a connection?Google was already working on offline capabilities, Mr. Casap said, and ultimately modified its education apps so that students could take their work home on Chromebooks, then upload homework the next day using school Wi-Fi.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever remember when a specific device and platform has taken off so quickly across different kinds of schools,\u201d said David Andrade, a K-12 education strategist at CDW-G, a leading Chromebook dealer.In 2014, Google\u2019s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. The culture clash illuminated profound differences between Google, a build-it-first-and-tweak-it-later Silicon Valley company, and a large, bureaucratic school district with student-protection rules to uphold.At the time, she was the school system\u2019s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district\u2019s technology administrators \u2014 effectively making a district policy decision from the outside. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies.\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand out product and hope it will work in the classroom,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. \u201cYou have to work with the districts to make sure that you are keeping the kids and the teachers safe.\u201dJim Siegl, technology architect for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the nation\u2019s 10th-largest school district, reported a similar experience.He said that Google had directly contacted certain Fairfax teachers who had volunteered to beta-test Classroom, giving them early access to the app. In so doing, he said, the company ignored the Google settings he had selected that were supposed to give his district control over which new Google services to switch on in its schools.Mr. Siegl added that Google did not tell him which, or even how many, Fairfax teachers the company had enlisted to try out the Classroom app. And by the time he was able to shut off the app, Mr. Siegl said, teachers had already set up virtual classrooms on the service and started using it with their students.He said he complained to Google.\u201cBecause of who they are and how sprawling the ecosystem is,\u201d Mr. Siegl said, \u201cthey are held up and need to meet a higher standard than any other vendor schools deal with.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Mr. Bout said of the company\u2019s core education services, \u201cIn all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school\u2019s domain.\u201dClassroom was the brainchild of Mr. Rochelle, who started Google\u2019s education apps group, and Zach Yeskel, a Google product manager and former high school math teacher. They said they envisioned the app as a kind of \u201cmission control\u201d dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks like assigning and correcting homework, freeing teachers to spend more time with students. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers.\u201cThey developed a real momentum with teachers,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. \u201cGoogle Classroom was key to that.\u201dThat was too fast for Chicago Public Schools.Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers\u2019 needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Ms. Hahn said, she collected teachers\u2019 feedback and sent it to Google.\u201cWe wanted to help them do it right,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive.\u201cIt took us a long time to get them to do it,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. She added, \u201cUnfortunately, there were things that a district of our size needed that Google did not understand.\u201dGoogle eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. \u201cWe have said to Google many times, \u2018If it works in Chicago, it will work anywhere,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hahn said.Mr. Bout of Google agreed, saying that Chicago Public Schools often made more stringent demands on Google than other school districts did.\u201cIf you can get it in Chicago, it\u2019s sort of like you have passed a lot of tests,\u201d Mr. Bout said, \u201cand then you can probably get it into any school in the country.\u201dThe relationship has benefited Chicago Public Schools, too.Today, about 15 million primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Classroom, Google said.Google\u2019s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labor. \u201cIt\u2019s a private company very creatively using public resources \u2014 in this instance, teachers\u2019 time and expertise \u2014 to build new markets at low cost,\u201d said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California.Mr. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback \u2014 otherwise it might develop products that worked for only a few of them.\u201cOur goal is to build products that help educators and students,\u201d Mr. Rochelle said. \u201cTeachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.\u201dMs. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees. She said that schools were getting something substantive in return from Google, something they had rarely received from other tech companies: quick product improvements that responded to teachers\u2019 feedback.After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google\u2019s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company\u2019s innovations. \u201cThey no longer just turn stuff on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to us first.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Puerto Rico Declares a Form of Bankruptcy", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe scale of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt is also unusual: it has about $123 billion in debt and pension obligations. For comparison, Detroit had $18 billion of debt in 2013.Any relief could eventually help the island return to solvency.Before then, however, government workers will have to forgo pension payments, while public health and infrastructure projects will go unfunded. The \u201cbrain drain\u201d could intensify as well.The next step is for the Supreme Court to designate a bankruptcy judge to handle the case.The coming court proceedings mean that the island\u2019s creditors, whose lawsuits prompted the request for relief, are likely to receive far less of their money back.Those creditors had already been shocked by a fiscal plan this year that allowed only about $800 million a year to pay principal and interest on Puerto Rico\u2019s bond debt, instead of the roughly $3.5 billion it would cost to make the payments on time.Some are now furious about the latest move.\u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s proposal is not a credible starting point for negotiations,\u201d Andrew Rosenberg of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, an adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders of Puerto Rico, said in a statement.Puerto Rico has become a cautionary tale for states and municipalities facing similar strains, like Illinois and Philadelphia, and many will be watching to see whether others will take a similar path.It takes audacity to go head to head with 21st Century Fox, but the timing looks right for Sinclair Broadcast Group.There is a Republican president; regulators have eased rules on owning television stations; and Fox, the dominant name in conservative media, is reeling from scandals.Sinclair beams local television stations into a quarter of American homes and has been using its 173 stations to advance a mostly right-leaning agenda.Sinclair has been racking up acquisitions since the 1990s.\u201cWe\u2019re forever expanding \u2014 like the universe,\u201d David Smith, the chairman and son of the founder, Julian Sinclair Smith, said in 1995.Sinclair\u2019s attempt to buy Tribune would also allow it to push for higher fees from cable operators retransmitting its channels and help it to fight similar fee demands from content providers, including Fox. And it would give Sinclair more leverage over Fox\u2019s owners, the Murdochs, because of its position as the biggest owner of Fox affiliates by far.Still, Fox remains a behemoth.\u201cYou can talk a big game about Fox News on the ropes, but it\u2019s still Muhammad Ali,\u201d said Tim Graham, the director of media analysis at the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group. \u201cIt\u2019s still the champion, and everyone else is much smaller.\u201dAnd that cover?

Portland was also moving ahead with subpoenaing Uber on Greyball, an official there said on Friday, affirming that the federal action was a criminal investigation.Now the inquiry has widened to include Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Parking Authority, a state-governed transportation agency, said on Friday that it was contacted by the Justice Department and asked to hand over information regarding Uber and its use of special software to enter and operate in certain markets.Uber declined to comment on the transit agency\u2019s actions or the federal inquiry.Greyball, which Uber began using as early as 2014, was sometimes deployed when the company started service in a city without permission. Uber has argued the tool had legitimate uses, such as disguising the locations of drivers from competitors or would-be attackers.Uber now operates in both Portland and Philadelphia legally.Dan Saltzman, commissioner of the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said on Friday that the city would continue looking into Greyball.\u201cWe support the criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice into Uber\u2019s use of the Greyball tool to evade regulators, and will continue to move forward with our own efforts to subpoena the requested records from Uber,\u201d Mr. Saltzman said in a statement.

{"Headline": "TV Station Owners Rush to Seize on Relaxed F.C.C. Rules", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byThe media industry has been rife with consolidation in recent years: Cable companies, film studios and telecommunications firms have all been bought and sold at a rapid clip.Now, local television stations are at the center of the deal-making frenzy.Last week, a day after the Federal Communications Commission eased regulations over how many stations an owner may have, Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest local broadcast group in the country, said it would buy 14 New York-based stations for $240 million.The timing of Sinclair\u2019s deal may not have hinged directly on the change, but it demonstrated a demand for broadcast station mergers. Sinclair did not reply to requests for comment.And now, a bidding war has begun over Tribune Media, the owner of WGN America and, in New York, PIX 11.The Blackstone Group appears to be working with 21st Century Fox on a bid for Tribune. And Sinclair is also circling that company.\u201cThe F.C.C. has basically said: \u2018Game on. We\u2019re going to let you consolidate further than anyone had imagined,\u2019\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.Consolidation of local broadcast stations could lead to more expensive fees for consumers as providers pass on ever-higher fees from broadcasters and content creators to subscribers. But to media companies, the mantra of late has been that bigger is better.For broadcast station companies in particular \u2014 including Sinclair, Fox and the Nexstar Media Group \u2014 owning more stations increases their power over cable companies, which pay to retransmit the stations.Fox\u2019s motive for pursuing Tribune, which has more Fox affiliates than any other station owner, largely appears to be blocking a deal with Sinclair. It plans to form a joint venture with the Blackstone Group, an investment giant, in which Blackstone would provide the cash for a deal while Fox would provide its own television stations, according to people briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.If successful, Fox would then reduce its direct exposure to local television stations, Mr. Greenfield said, while still holding on to a piece \u2014 and while stymieing a rival.Details of the potential joint venture were unclear, as were the precise reasons that Fox was turning to Blackstone. Tribune is a relatively small company, with a market value of about $3.4 billion.But for companies like Fox and Sinclair, consolidation is also a defensive move, shoring them up at a time when online rivals like Netflix and Hulu are commanding more viewers. Content providers like CBS and the Walt Disney Company are also pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.Getting bigger through station acquisitions, then, is meant to help these companies drive harder bargains. And smaller operators have emerged as potential takeover targets: The stock prices of two other broadcast companies, E. W. Scripps and Gray Television, are both up sharply this year.Underpinning broadcasters\u2019 dreams of expansion is the hope that Ajit Pai, the F.C.C.\u2019s new chairman and a Republican, will let through the kinds of deal making that had been held up during the Obama administration.\u201cCompanies are talking about deals now because they have reason to believe the F.C.C. will relax all the ownership rules,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company.The first tangible step came with a 2-to-1 vote by the F.C.C. last week to reintroduce the so-called UHF discount.Longstanding rules prohibit companies from covering more than 39 percent of American households, but the UHF discount allows station owners to exclude certain stations that operate in ultrahigh frequencies. With the reinstated discount, according to calculations by Fitch Ratings, Sinclair\u2019s household coverage percentage has fallen to about 25 percent, from 38 percent, while Nexstar\u2019s has dropped to 27 percent, from 39 percent, opening the door to new mergers and acquisitions.\u201cThis represents a rational first step in media ownership reform policy allowing free and local broadcasters to remain competitive with multinational pay TV giants and broadband providers,\u201d Gordon Smith, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said in a statement.The F.C.C.\u2019s rule change followed pressure from industry groups. One week before the vote, Mitch Rose, NBC Universal\u2019s senior vice president for government relations, visited the office of the other Republican commissioner on the F.C.C., Michael O\u2019Reilly, urging him to reinstate the UHF discount.And in February, Tribune Media\u2019s general counsel, Edward Lazarus, met with Mr. Pai\u2019s chief of staff, Matthew Berry, and lobbied for the change in rules.Mr. Pai has long been critical of strict broadcast ownership rules. He has said that online media companies such as Google, Facebook and Netflix are competing for audiences that were once served only by television. He has also been skeptical of rules against broadcast ownership limits, given that the agency has approved mergers in competing industries, including Charter\u2019s purchase of Time Warner Cable and AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirecTV.At the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas last week, Mr. Pai announced his intention to re-examine other media ownership rules. Broadcasters hope that one limit that may be removed is a prohibition on owning more than two stations in a local market.Consumer groups and Democrats in Congress and at the F.C.C. warn that the changes will lead to great industry consolidation, giving a few companies great influence over news and public opinion.The action \u201cwill actually harm the public interest, by reducing diversity, competition and localism,\u201d Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat at the F.C.C., said after the UHF discount vote.\u201cThese were mergers that could never have been contemplated a year ago,\u201d Mr. Greenfield, of BTIG, said of the deals that might blossom under the new F.C.C. \u201cYou\u2019re enabling the impossible in many ways, so people are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take a shot at this.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Identity Crisis at Italienne", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byRestaurant Review11 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Past the bar you enter the polished, expensive Dining Room, where the food is much more French, is arranged with an eye on negative space, and is available \u00e0 la carte or as a six-course, $140 tasting menu, wine pairing optional. On Monday nights, this half of the enterprise switches over to a four-course set menu devoted to the cooking of a single region, which could be French, or Italian.These party-in-the-front, business-in-the-back setups are complex propositions. They\u2019re not hot-dog stands. Mr. Sippel has made a tough job tougher by taking on two countries and more than one style of cooking, and layering the formal-casual split on top. At times, Italienne is like somebody who starts to tell you a joke about a priest, a rabbi and an imam in a rowboat and ends up talking about Maimonidean law.Along the way, he brought together a talented crew. Erica O\u2019Neal, who had been a sommelier at Frasca, stockpiled mostly French and Italian wines for a discovery-packed list that is full of twists and turns even at its cheap end. The desserts and pastries are under Rebecca Isbell, whose work made the end of a meal at Betony something to look forward to. His business partner and general manager is James King, a well-rounded pro who put in time at both Frasca and Brooklyn Fare.Everybody is out to make a good impression. One busy night in the Taverna, when my guests and I had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes past our reservation time, we were handed glasses of prosecco before we had finished our cocktails. When we got to the table, two of the Italian snacks the menu calls stuzzichini were waiting for us: warm arancini with melted fior di latte at their core, and panzerotti, little turnovers filled with bits of warm salumi and scamorza.It was more of an apology than the situation called for. On the other hand, every apology should taste so good.On a quick read, the Taverna\u2019s menu is like the ones at many other casual Italian spots. A deeper look, though, reveals more originality than usual. Scattered among the Italian favorites are a few French ideas, like the subtly curried cauliflower gratin under a tan layer of Comt\u00e9. One of the snacks was a kind of sandwich filled with something like hash browns; crisp fried triangles of cheese take the place of bread. Eating it is like getting a tax refund you weren\u2019t expecting.Under pasta was another big surprise: delicate little cabbage-and-bread dumplings the size of Swedish meatballs. They\u2019re from far northern Italy, where they\u2019re known as canederli. Italienne gave them an Eastern European lilt by serving them with beets, horseradish and applesauce. Mr. Sippel seemed to reach beyond the borders again with the caraway seeds and excellent braised red cabbage he brought to a plate of pork \u2014 tender ribs and a juicy chop that got a little too much finishing salt but were still close to perfect.Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts in the Taverna made some unexpected moves, too. Her lemon tart was wonderful and showed a sense of humor; with a cloak of white lemon icing outside and a soft filling of lemon-poppy seed cream inside, it looked just like a wedge of Camembert. But I don\u2019t know what to make of her baba au rhum, which tasted like a two-day-old coconut doughnut that had been accidentally splashed with liquor at the bar.My first meal in the Dining Room was on a Monday, when the four-course menu was supposedly inspired by the northern Rhone. I had trouble seeing the connection, but I enjoyed it all. There was an exceptional velout\u00e9 of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin. Dessert was a tart of dense, rich chocolate layered over salted caramel. It was an ideal end for a dinner of refined bistro food.When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google\u2019s translator and then back again.The frogs\u2019 legs hidden inside a frizz of kataifi were almost flavorless, and a white garlic sauce had a sharp, raw bite. Snails and strips of prosciutto strewn over buttered pappardelle never came together, and bull\u2019s-eyes of pasta called corzetti stampati were dotted with beet greens and a walnut pesto that was sweet when it should have been savory.Other dishes were better, but the only complete successes were the warm herb fougasse, served on a hook like a Bavarian pretzel, and Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts \u2014 a rhubarb granita with salty candied pistachios, and a weird, inspired oat bavarois veined with chocolate ganache.Some of the food at Italienne made me want to dance on the table. Some of it made me want to hide under the table and wait for the lights to go out so I could leave without making eye contact. My three meals might have come from three different restaurants. I would settle for one where the ideas had been worked out. At the moment, that is the Taverna.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.So the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201dBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201dThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201dMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201dIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.I\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friday Mailbag: Is The Times Praising the President \u2014 or Poking Fun?", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byThe Public EditorTwo Sundays ago, The Times introduced a feature in the Sunday Review that has raised a number of eyebrows: a regular column that says something nice about President Trump.The column reads as if The Times is attempting to curry favor with the administration by printing puff pieces glamorizing him or his opponents. This isn\u2019t journalism. While I understand that the column runs in the Opinion section, I would argue that a regular feature with a specific, stated intent of saying something positive about our political leader has no place in a mainstream newspaper. When the man does something good, cover it as news. When he does something bad, cover it as news. Please reconsider this column. It cheapens the paper and leads readers like me to question your news reporting.Jesse Vincent, Oakland, Calif.A Times spokeswoman, Danielle Rhoades-Ha, explained that currying favor with Trump is far from the column\u2019s aim.This feature is media criticism and satire by the veteran journalist and commentator Michael Kinsley. He is assessing the president and the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of the administration for the Times Opinion pages. The first installment of the column outlines the media criticism aspect of the column more fully. It is entirely separate from our newsroom coverage.Several readers noted the missing coverage.Sarah Sears, New York CityWe asked Wendell Jamieson, the Metro editor, why The Times didn\u2019t cover the story.We looked into this and didn\u2019t think it was something we needed to cover with our limited resources. It felt like a very modest story.The founder and chief executive of the network was unhappy both with the claim and with the description of Marcus.This is untrue. In fact, in 11 years of operation serving 14,000 students, Success has only expelled a child on a single occasion. The claim that we \u201cexpel\u201d students plainly suggests that we do so regularly or at least on more than one occasion. An accurate statement would be \u201cSuccess once expelled a student.\u201d You also fail to disclose that the letter writer is a former Success employee. Given that former employees often have an ax to grind, this omission is a clear violation of ethical journalistic practices.Eva Moskowitz, New York CityWe asked Sue Mermelstein, a staff editor in the letters department, for a response.Elephant camps are known for torturing animals. They are taken from their mothers at a very early age and starved, beaten and abused for weeks. Once trained, they live sad lives carting around tourists and often still getting beaten should they not behave. It\u2019s a horribly cruel process. It deeply saddens me that The Times would promote an elephant camp of this nature. There are so many amazing elephant sanctuaries that could be promoted instead. These places take animals from horrible situations and give them a home where they don\u2019t have to serve or obey commands. They are often deeply underfunded. Tourists can still go and spend time with the elephants, bathe them, walk with them and feed them without riding them. It\u2019s the same wonderful experience being close to the animals without exploiting them.Megan Denniston, BrooklynWe raised Denniston\u2019s concern with Monica Drake, the travel editor.I share your concern. In the column, we try to highlight hospitality companies that meet the bar of providing basic human rights for their workers and provide humane treatment of animals. The resort in question has a reputation of being an advocate for elephants in Thailand. Its director of elephants and conservation, John Roberts, is associated with Earthwatch and another foundation that advocates for fair treatment and sustainability.The writer of the piece, Donald Frazier, also replied, noting that the elephant camp\u2019s reputation is \u201csterling.\u201dI know quite a bit about this topic, and wholly agree about a large number of the elephant camps in the region. I\u2019ve been to this one a few times, indeed a sanctuary. More of a village, it provides a complete ecosystem for the elephants and their mahouts [people who tend to elephants], with sustainable livelihood for their mahouts\u2019 families with cottage industries such as silk spinning. I have seen it, and have had the run of the camp.If you happen to be in Thailand this weekend and are planning on visiting an elephant camp, we hope you heed Denniston\u2019s concern.Advertisement"}

Last month, Fairfax management said that the company would need to trim 30 million Australian dollars, or about $22.5 million, representing nearly one-quarter of its editorial budget.In his email to staff members on Wednesday, Sean Aylmer, the editorial director at Fairfax Media, said that all editorial sections could be affected but that some jobs would be hit especially hard.\u201cWhile we will be looking across all parts of the newsroom, at the end of the redundancy program we expect there will be significantly fewer editorial management, video, presentation and section writer roles,\u201d he wrote.A Fairfax spokesman said the company was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the journalists\u2019 decision but would continue to publish its titles in print and online as usual during the strike. He declined to say how many workers had walked off the job.The newspapers that make up Fairfax Media have more than 150 years of history in Australia, shaping public opinion on politics, exposing dubious business practices and targeting criminal operations.Staff members interviewed said the latest round of cuts signified the decline of one of Australia\u2019s most powerful media empires.\u201cThe fact that our newsroom is being cut by a quarter at least, some figures suggest more like a third, and they want us out the door in two weeks, is an enormous blow to journalism,\u201d said Michael Bachelard, investigations editor at The Age. \u201cIt really shows the deep and sudden nature of these cuts.\u201dEven by the newspaper industry\u2019s standards, readers of Australia\u2019s print newspapers have been declining at an unusually rapid rate.Revenue from the Fairfax division that includes the papers fell 8 percent during the six months that ended in December, the company said in February.The Brisbane Times also went on strike on Wednesday.The strike would last until Wednesday, a day after the country\u2019s federal budget is released. The budget typically receives heavy attention in the news media.Under Australian labor law, the country\u2019s Fair Work Commission can order striking employees back to work. The Fairfax spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would pursue that option.\u201cThe history of these strikes \u2014 and we\u2019ve done a number over the years as the cuts have progressively gotten worse \u2014 is that management is still able to put out a newspaper,\u201d Mr. Bachelard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a shadow of its former self.\u201dFairfax staff members posted photographs of empty newsrooms on social media after news of the strike. In Melbourne, staff members gathered and waved newspapers.He added, \u201cWe find it really frustrating that after years and years of cuts, still the organization hasn\u2019t been able to come up with a solution which doesn\u2019t require cutting the very thing that we do, which is producing good-quality journalism.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly listed one Fairfax newspaper among those whose workers went on strike.

{"Headline": "Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program.But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Uber\u2019s development efforts.The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies, automakers and start-ups.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Over the last few months, Uber and Waymo have traded barbs and legal maneuvers to gain the upper hand. Waymo accused Mr. Levandowski of downloading thousands of its documents and using the findings at Uber. Mr. Levandowski decided to plead the Fifth Amendment in the case, exercising the right against being compelled to incriminate himself.In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, \u201cWaymo L.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there.\u201dHe added, \u201cSignificantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo\u2019s confidential files.\u201dJudge Alsup also ruled that Waymo significantly \u201coverreached\u201d when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets.\u201cGeneral approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not \u2018secret,\u2019 since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees,\u201d Judge Alsup wrote.He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowski\u2019s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files to Waymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowski\u2019s employment at Uber.Federal court order in Waymo\u2019s case against Uber.\u201cCompetition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions,\u201d Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cWe welcome the order to prohibit Uber\u2019s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr. Levandowski from working on the technology.\u201dDespite the judge\u2019s ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around lidar,\u201d Niki Christoff, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement.Judge Alsup\u2019s ruling followed his decision on Thursday to deny Uber\u2019s request to send the case against Waymo to arbitration. The judge set a series of deadlines in the next two months for Uber to produce additional evidence before the case moves to a public trial.Legal specialists who are following the case questioned whether a day in court is the best course of action for Uber.\u201cI think Uber has to seriously consider whether they even want to have that trial, or whether they\u2019ll be able to settle it,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. \u201cIf you read between the lines, it\u2019s pretty clear the judge hints at some wrongdoing by Uber, and he wants to see more evidence which could come in at the trial.\u201dUber and Waymo are unlikely to appeal the ruling given that the case is continuing, legal specialists said. Neither company may want to risk a worse outcome.Yet current and former Uber employees said Mr. Levandowski remains a dominant force. In last month\u2019s memo, Mr. Levandowski said Eric Meyhofer, a principal at the research facility, would assume leadership of the autonomous vehicle efforts, reporting to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Meyhofer are close, and Mr. Levandowski continues to oversee all projects outside of lidar development, said three current and former employees, who insisted that their names not be published, citing fear of retaliation.Uber declined to comment on Mr. Levandowski\u2019s current duties or on internal matters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of European Transit: Driverless and Utilitarian", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byOn the outskirts of Berlin, Michael Barill\u00e8re-Scholz is testing a driverless vehicle that is neither sleek nor futuristic. The machine is boxy and painted white. Its top speed barely reaches 20 miles per hour.The self-driving vehicle is a shuttle with room for 12 passengers. Mr. Barill\u00e8re-Scholz, who leads the driverless research team at Deutsche Bahn, Germany\u2019s largest train and bus operator, and his team have been testing the vehicle around a local office park. Later this year, the partly state-owned public transit company will also begin separate trials of a similar autonomous bus on public roads in southern Germany, connecting a local train station with stops along a predetermined route.\u201cWe want to show that autonomous cars don\u2019t have to be limited to luxury consumer vehicles, they also have a role in public transport,\u201d Mr. Barill\u00e8re-Scholz said. \u201cThe market in Germany for this type of vehicle is huge.\u201dThe coming age of driverless cars has typically centered on Silicon Valley highfliers like Tesla, Uber and Google, which have showcased their autonomous driving technology in luxury sedans and sport utility vehicles costing $100,000 or more. But across Europe, fledgling driverless projects like those by Deutsche Bahn are instead focused on utilitarian self-driving vehicles for mass transit that barely exceed walking pace.Forgoing the latest automotive trends of aerodynamics and style, European transportation groups and city planners are instead aiming to connect these unglamorous driverless vehicles to existing public transportation networks of subways and buses. The goal is to eventually offer on-demand driverless services to those who cannot afford the latest expensive offerings from Tesla and others.While cities in the United States \u2014 including Ann Arbor, Mich., and Las Vegas \u2014 have tested some of these mass transit driverless vehicles, Europe is a particular hotbed of this activity. That is because of the region\u2019s densely packed urban areas and decades-old and widely used public transit systems, which often include subways, trains and buses.In total, more than 20 pilot or existing public transport programs have taken place in Europe involving autonomous vehicles, according to a review by The New York Times. Most of these projects have received government funding, tapping into local research institutions and tech start-ups that are not household names.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.For those who dream of owning a sleek driverless vehicle of the future, this generation of autonomous public shuttles \u2014 often half the length of a traditional bus with capacity for less than a dozen people \u2014 will not set hearts racing. Though they include much of the high-tech sensors and gadgetry required for autonomous driving, the vehicles are designed for functionality rather than speed and style.Unlike the driverless trials from Uber and Alphabet\u2019s Waymo, which aim to bring autonomous vehicles to personal transport, a focus on self-driving public transit is a significantly easier challenge. That is because these autonomous vehicles are often limited to operating in the \u201clast mile,\u201d to existing public transit, or smaller distances on often well-traveled routes. That reduces the complexity required to make the machines navigate across an entire city.In London, city planners conducted a three-week trial in April involving a self-driving electric shuttle moving slowly around a well-defined three-mile route on mostly private roads. Nick Reed, the project\u2019s coordinator, said that by offering people autonomous connections to the British capital\u2019s existing transportation network, his team was helping the city to meet public demand without having to invest millions, if not billions, in traditional subways or buses.Not all of the autonomous vehicles being tested for public transport in Europe are glamour-free.In December, Carlo Ratti, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stood on the banks of a picturesque canal in Amsterdam to test his team\u2019s latest contraption: a driverless boat.Mr. Ratti\u2019s goal is to bring a fleet of these driverless boats to the Dutch city by the end of the decade, where they will be used to ferry people and goods around Amsterdam\u2019s miles of canals. If everything goes to plan, the researcher also hopes the autonomous boats will be able to automatically dock with each other, creating on-demand bridges and walkways whenever necessary.\u201cThere are rivers and waterfronts in most cities, so the applications are quite wide,\u201d said Mr. Ratti, whose team is split between Amsterdam and Boston, where they use a university swimming pool to try out their latest version of the Roboat. \u201cNot many people have looked at self-driving boats.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Trump Dividend for Canada? Maybe in Its A.I. Industry", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byAmir Moravej, an Iranian computer engineer in Montreal, quietly worked last year on building software to help people navigate the Canadian immigration system. He saw it as a way for others to avoid the same immigration travails he suffered a few years earlier.Then came the American presidential election. \u201cTrump accelerated everything,\u201d said Mr. Moravej, 33, the chief executive of a software start-up named Botler AI.Mr. Bengio is adding his intellectual firepower to ease the way for what could become a migration of high-tech talent. Canada stands to benefit from the American political climate and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts \u2014 stalled in court so far \u2014 to sharply restrict travel into the United States from six predominantly Muslim nations. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, applications to Canada for student and temporary visas surged.Immigration is a linchpin in Canada\u2019s economic policy. One-fifth of the country\u2019s population of 36 million is foreign-born. Canada has dozens of provincial and federal programs, but a priority is placed on highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs, often with points assigned for specialized expertise, education and language proficiency.Not only are Canadian A.I. start-ups like Botler AI now building on interest in immigration and on homegrown talent, but major American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, have also been adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada.Canada has well-funded programs intended not only to lure A.I. experts to the country, but also to persuade A.I. researchers, educated at Canadian universities, to remain in Canada rather than depart for Silicon Valley, as so many have done before.The nation\u2019s policy makers also want to persuade expatriate engineers and entrepreneurs to return to Canada \u2014 and the political climate in the United States has influenced some to do so.But last month, Ross, whose software can read through thousands of legal documents and rank relevant cases for lawyers, opened an office in Toronto. Five members of its team, including senior engineers and two co-founders, are moving from San Francisco to Canada. The group includes two Canadians, a Brazilian, a Belgian and an American.The Toronto outpost, said Jimoh Ovbiagele, a co-founder and chief technology officer of Ross, \u201callows us to really recruit from the global talent pool.\u201dMr. Ovbiagele, one of the Canadians who is relocating to Toronto, said Ross had received dozens of inquiries from international students concerned about the immigration risk of working in America. Ross, he said, recently hired engineers who were international students and graduates of Princeton, Cooper Union and the University of Toronto.Another technologist making the move to Canada from Silicon Valley is Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, 31, who returned to Montreal a few weeks ago after working for Apple for 13 months. There were other considerations, she said, but \u201cthe election of Trump did play a role\u201d in convincing her that she would prefer to live in Canada.So when an opportunity to work at Mr. Bengio\u2019s A.I. institute in Montreal became available recently, Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert did not hesitate. Her new salary is about a third of her income at Apple.Then again, Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert observed, her rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Montreal is less than a third of the monthly rent she paid for a one-bedroom apartment in Sunnyvale, Calif. And Montreal, she added, is a cosmopolitan city.\u201cLiving in Montreal is pretty good,\u201d Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert said.Back at Botler AI, a lot of work remains \u2014 including landing funding and figuring out a business plan. But the addition of Mr. Bengio is a sign that the start-up needs to be taken seriously.Mr. Bengio, in an interview, said he was joining the start-up partly because Botler AI\u2019s technology fits neatly with research underway at his A.I. institute. What\u2019s more, he added, the company\u2019s work around immigration could \u201chelp a lot of people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Yoshua Bengio\u2019s title at Botler AI.

{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of Yik Yak, the Anonymous Messaging App", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byThis month, two feminist groups and several former students filed a federal complaint accusing the University of Mary Washington in Virginia and its former president, Richard Hurley, of failing to protect the female plaintiffs from cyber harassment and threats of physical and sexual violence during their time at the university.The platform where all of this took place? Yik Yak, the now-defunct, localized, anonymous messaging app that Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, two students at Furman University in South Carolina, founded in 2013 and that soon became associated with bullying, discriminatory speech and threats of bomb and gun violence.\u201cThe lack of responsiveness and inability to control this devastating hate speech I think is what ultimately did this app in,\u201d said Debra Katz, one of the lawyers who brought the complaint against Mary Washington, located in Fredericksburg, and Mr. Hurley, in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia.In response to the suit, the university said it contained \u201cno new allegations\u201d and that it had, and would continue, to \u201cwork diligently to create a safe and secure campus environment and to address the issue of sexual violence.\u201dThere was no comment from Mr. Hurley\u2019s lawyer.The lawsuit was just the latest twist in the rocky road the messaging app has traveled in its short life.Yik Yak\u2019s image problems seemed to stem from its reliance on anonymous posts and the few solutions that were available to curtail racist, sexist, aggressive or threatening language. The app was community-monitored, meaning that users could vote down a post they found vulgar or offensive, and if the post received enough negative feedback, it was removed.But the app\u2019s privacy policy did not allow institutions to identify users who posed a risk without a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or an emergency request from a law-enforcement official with a compelling claim of imminent harm.Messages that cropped on Yik Yak disparaged and threatened the feminist group\u2019s most visible members. Some of the worst are listed in the complaint: \u201cGonna tie these feminists to the radiator and [g]rape them in the mouth,\u201d \u201cCan we euthanize whoever caused this?\u201dKelli Musick, one of the plaintiffs, who graduated in 2015, said: \u201cThere were days when I felt like I couldn\u2019t look away from my phone because a friend or someone I knew would send me a screenshot of a threatening or harassing Yak. We don\u2019t blame the app in and of itself. It was a tool. Tools can be used in any way that a person decides to use them.\u201d\u201cWe had parents reaching out to say their 9-year-old has been threatened and harassed on the app,\u201d said Ross Ellis, the founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying. \u201cKids get hysterical when people make mean comments. Their brains are not mature enough to handle it.\u201dThe school administration, citing logistical and first amendment concerns, refused. So the group asked that Yik Yak be banned on the school\u2019s Wi-Fi network, a gesture that was primarily symbolic given that students could continue to access it on their personal data plans. The university said no again.\u201cThis was something over which we had no control,\u201d said Anna Billingsley, the associate vice president for university relations. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t remove the posts from Yik Yak.\u201d She said that the school offered the protection of campus police and suggested that the students contact Yik Yak and the Title IX office at the university.\u201cThey told us to report the Yaks to Yik Yak, and if they were found to be credible, Yik Yak would then respond, which is not the case for any other threats of violence on campus,\u201d Ms. Musick said. \u201cWhen it has been a threat of a bomb or a gun, other schools did not say, \u2018Report it to Yik Yak and they\u2019ll follow up.\u2019\u201dIn trying to react to complaints about its product, Yik Yak created geo-fences and added filters that recognized certain keywords, such as \u201cbomb,\u201d and would ask users if they wanted to proceed with the message by suggesting: \u201cPump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it\u2019s probably nothing and you\u2019re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?\u201dAnd at the University of Mary Washington, Ms. Musick and her classmates turned to Ms. Katz to file a complaint with the Education Department. Its Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation, but before it could issue a decision, the White House changed hands and many of the office\u2019s employees left. So the women went to district court.Despite these efforts, by this past March, about two and a half years after it had closed a round of funding that raised millions in venture capital, its active users over age 18 had fallen to 264,000, an enormous decline from nearly 1.9 million in November 2014, according to comScore.Morgan Hines, who will start her fourth year at Northeastern University in Boston this fall, never encountered nastiness on Yik Yak. \u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d she said. \u201cIt formed a lot of camaraderie between students. There would be random shout-outs to things happening on campus, like people who are attractive or being annoying in the library, or a fire alarm going off at 4 a.m.\u201dBut Ms. Hines criticized Yik Yak\u2019s hyper-localization. \u201cYik Yak was for pockets of people on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the fire alarm went off at 4 a.m., it only went off at your building, so no one else will give it a thumbs-up.\u201dThat hyper-localization is also what made the cases of harassment particularly galling. Ms. Musick, one of the plaintiffs, said, \u201cWith Yik Yak, in the back of your mind, you know they\u2019re not from around the world or other parts of the state, they\u2019re right there in your classroom, in your dining hall. On a campus with 4,500 students, that\u2019s a pretty small group of people. This isn\u2019t some creepy guy in his mom\u2019s basement in Indiana.\u201dIn the end, it may have been this aspect of the app that really did it in. Danielle Levitas, the senior vice president for research at App Annie, pointed out that bad press would not necessarily override an app\u2019s popularity if it fulfilled a useful function (consider Uber, for example). But, she said, if it does not have something sustainable to offer, it will burn out.In this case, it seems that being local was to Yik Yak\u2019s detriment. When Ms. Hines went home to Kentucky after her freshman year, she forgot about the app. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on campus anymore and I wasn\u2019t with my friends anymore,\u201d she said. And back at Northeastern, \u201cno one was on campus to comment on anything.\u201d She added, \u201cIt kind of just became irrelevant in my life.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described one of the groups that is a plaintiff in the suit against the University of Mary Washington and Richard Hurley. The Feminist Majority Foundation is an organization based in Arlington, Va., not a campus group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Whole Foods, Pressured by Restless Investors, Shakes Up Board", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byJohn Mackey, a founder of Whole Foods Market, took the helm as sole chief executive last year in a bid to single-handedly revive the upscale grocer\u2019s fortunes.On Wednesday, facing growing pressure from restless shareholders, he brought in reinforcements.A month after an activist hedge fund took a stake in Whole Foods and began to agitate for change, the company unveiled a sweeping overhaul of its board, replacing five directors, naming a new chairwoman and bringing in a new chief financial officer. It also laid out plans to improve operations and cut costs.The defensive maneuvering comes as Whole Foods, an organic foods pioneer that helped change the way Americans shop and eat, faces the greatest crisis of confidence in its 37-year history. It also underscores the growing influence of activist shareholders, who continue to press corporate executives.\u201cWe pay attention to what our shareholders tell us,\u201d Mr. Mackey said in an interview.\u201cWe\u2019ve been told for some time that we needed to address governance issues,\u201d he said, adding that a main concern from shareholders was that the board was not independent enough.Among those joining the Whole Foods board is Ronald Shaich, the founder, chairman and co-chief executive of Panera Bread Company. The others are Ken Hicks, a former chief executive of Foot Locker; Joe Mansueto, the founder and chairman of Morningstar; Sharon McCollam, a former chief financial officer of Best Buy; and Scott Powers, a former vice president of State Street Corporation.Keith Manbeck, a former vice president of Kohl\u2019s, will become the company\u2019s new chief financial officer.Jana went public with its fight against Whole Foods last month. Its targets included customer service and brand development at the company, which has faced added competition from traditional grocers in recent years.The hedge fund, arguing that the board was stale and in need of fresh blood, proposed a slate of directors that included Glenn Murphy, a former chief executive of Gap Inc., and Mark Bittman, a former food columnist for The New York Times. The potential directors bought their own stakes in the company.Whole Foods tried to broker a peace with Jana, offering to accept two of the hedge fund\u2019s nominees if Jana would refrain from publicly agitating for change for two years. Jana refused, a spokesman for the hedge fund said.On Wednesday, Whole Food unveiled its own new picks for the board, foreshadowing what could be a showdown with some shareholders.\u201cIf Jana wants to have their own directors on the board, then they ought to be willing to sign a cooperation agreement,\u201d Mr. Mackey said.Jana, for its part, said it wanted to remain nimble rather than strike a compromise with the company.\u201cWe decided we\u2019d rather keep all options on the table,\u201d the Jana spokesman said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ll be waiting to see if the newly reconstituted board can show a real commitment to fixing the operations at Whole Foods and pursuing all avenues to shareholder value creation.\u201dWhole Foods detailed the changes as it announced quarterly earnings and subjected its financial health to the market\u2019s microscope. Sales for the quarter met expectations, but the company pared back its forecast for earnings this year.The Whole Foods brand was once synonymous with organic and natural foods, and the company staked its reputation on a culture of healthy eating and living. It stood out for offering fresh, local produce, but its products came with a hefty price tag, earning the grocer the nickname \u201cwhole paycheck\u201d among some shoppers.Whole Foods faces fierce competition and has been forced to slash prices as national retailers like Costco, Safeway and Walmart have begun offering their own organic produce and kitchen staples.Wall Street started to lose faith in Whole Foods amid the shifting landscape, and the company\u2019s shares slumped, although they have regained some of the lost ground since Jana announced its investment.Whole Foods pledged on Wednesday to accelerate a planned customer loyalty program, after shareholders, including Jana and Neuberger Berman, had criticized it for being slow to adopt one. It also said it would cut $300 million in additional costs over the next four years.And the grocer told investors that it would buy back $1.25 billion in shares.But some shareholder demands remain. Neuberger Berman sent a letter to the board last week noting its concern that employees would be \u201cdistracted from their primary responsibilities\u201d amid the flurry of public pressure. Neuberger Berman, which manages $267 billion for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and individuals, urged Whole Foods to consider \u201cpossible strategic mergers, partnerships, joint ventures, alliances\u201d in addition to making internal investments.It was the second time that Neuberger Berman had sent a letter to the Whole Foods board. A month after its first letter, in September, the company announced a series of management changes.Those changes included the elimination of the company\u2019s co-chief executive structure and the appointment of Mr. Mackey as the sole chief executive. Walter Robb, the previous co-chief executive, continued to serve on the board. Whole Foods also brought Mary Ellen Coe, the vice president for sales and product operations at Google, onto the board. And it announced that Glenda Flanagan, the chief financial officer, would retire at the end of 2017.In a statement on Wednesday, Neuberger Berman said, \u201cWe look forward to understanding the new board\u2019s sense of urgency and timeline in assessing all strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford, Trudging Into the Future, Ousts Mark Fields as C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 Ford Motor was the American automaker savvy enough to avoid bankruptcy when industry sales collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. Then it rode economic recovery and cheap gasoline to record sales and profits. But what looks like success can turn upside down quickly in Detroit these days.The latest evidence came Monday when Ford ousted its chief executive, Mark Fields, after only three years in the job. Mr. Fields had failed to persuade investors and his own board that the company was moving fast enough to develop the vehicles of the future, like battery-powered cars that drive themselves.Industry stalwarts such as Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen are no longer the only automotive trendsetters. Now they share that distinction with interlopers from the tech world like Google, Apple, Uber and not least Tesla, the electric-car maker now valued more highly than any of the Detroit giants.The upheaval at Ford, the nation\u2019s No. 2 automaker by sales, after G.M., reflects the challenges that lie ahead for companies that cannot adapt to that new landscape fast enough.\u201cOur world has changed dramatically,\u201d said William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s chairman and great-grandson of its founder. \u201cLook at the pace of change and the competitors coming into our space, and we need to match or beat that.\u201dMr. Fields, a 28-year veteran of Ford, was a victim of rapidly evolving expectations for carmakers that for decades had been judged on how many vehicles they could manufacture and sell at a profit.Mr. Hackett, 62, made his reputation as the head of Steelcase, an office-furniture maker based in Michigan. There, he built credibility in Silicon Valley for adapting workplaces to fit the needs of legions of computer programmers and other tech workers.Since last year, he has been in the middle of the automotive revolution as the head of Ford\u2019s nascent division devoted to autonomous vehicles and new forms of personal mobility like ride-hailing services.When he was introduced as chief executive on Monday, Mr. Hackett defended the company\u2019s commitment to self-driving technology. \u201cI would challenge that idea that we are not moving fast on mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve mapped out a path that gives us a lot of opportunity.\u201dOne of Mr. Hackett\u2019s first tasks will be to demonstrate that progress, and change perceptions that Ford is behind not only Tesla and Google but also traditional rivals like G.M. that are testing prototypes of autonomous cars.Mr. Fields, for his part, had been under pressure for months from Ford\u2019s board to sharpen the company\u2019s strategy on future technologies and reverse what had been a 40 percent drop in its stock price since 2014.He also became embroiled in controversy over a $1.6 billion plant the company was planning to build in Mexico to assemble small cars.When President Trump was campaigning for the Republican nomination and criticizing American companies for moving factories to Mexico, Mr. Fields defended the company\u2019s expansion plans there. But once Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Fields was forced to backtrack, and he ultimately canceled the project.Mr. Ford also felt the need to step in and smooth the testy relationship by speaking directly to Mr. Trump. While it hardly affected Ford\u2019s overall performance, the Mexico episode may have distracted Mr. Fields from corporate issues.And with the American auto market starting to decline after peaking last year, Ford\u2019s profits were also dropping \u2014 more than 30 percent in the first quarter alone.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.By Friday, the company\u2019s directors had had enough, authorizing Mr. Ford to ask Mr. Fields to retire and paving the way for Mr. Hackett\u2019s ascension to the top of the company.Industry analysts viewed the decision as a wake-up call for the company, as well as any other automaker lagging in the high-tech race toward driverless cars.\u201cGiven how rapidly the transportation sector is expected to transform in the next decade, Ford can\u2019t afford to be behind the eight ball when it comes to emerging technology,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto-research website Edmunds.com.But it will not be easy. Mr. Ford and Mr. Hackett concede that Ford has been underperforming in some of the core parts of its business, in particular its sales of passenger cars.Investors reacted favorably to the Ford shake-up, with its shares gaining more than 2 percent on the day and closing at $11.10. But Wall Street analysts said the transformation to a leaner, more tech-focused company could come at a price.\u201cThe earnings situation may need to get materially worse before it gets better,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research note on Monday.And even a stronger emphasis on new technology will not immediately close the gap between Ford and its competitors that are developing self-driving equipment.Traditional automakers have focused mostly on lower levels of automated driving where the car handles specific tasks, such as braking and cruise control.Some tech companies, on the other hand, are pushing relentlessly toward higher levels of driverless capability.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Google is miles ahead of other tech companies in the space right now,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, a transportation specialist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cBut automakers have been working a long time on lower-level, connected automated vehicles.\u201dThe best solution for some carmakers may be to align themselves with tech firms to share costs and accelerate development.Auto companies, however, are not yet pursuing full-scale partnerships with Silicon Valley. Instead, they are competing to hire software engineers to develop their own expertise as well as buying start-up firms to augment their research.While car companies are reluctant to give up control in the development of any of their vehicles, they may be forced to seek broader, long-term alliances with Silicon Valley on driverless models.\u201cWhat we may end up seeing is partnerships that could really benefit all players,\u201d Ms. Shaheen said.In Ford\u2019s case, the company has to maintain a fine balance between building quality cars and trucks for consumers in every region of the world and beefing up its commitment to self-driving technology.Mr. Hackett says he knows the automaker cannot ask for unlimited patience from investors eager to see more progress. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re dealing with the future,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s ambiguous \u2014 until you prove it.\u201dMike Isaac contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waiting for the Credits to End? Movies Are Naming More Names", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byIt is now a standard feature of the typical Hollywood blockbuster. You watch scenes that have become more complex and dazzling than ever in their visual effects and technical mastery, then sit through end credits that feel almost novelistic in length: hundreds, or frequently thousands, of names in a blur of acknowledgment of the village it took to stage a superhero battle or bring robots to photorealistic life.The names can occupy five to 10 minutes or more of a movie\u2019s running time. And we\u2019re often staying put so as not to miss a possible extra scene or a tease to other films in a franchise. In the meantime, we learn about film jobs we had no idea existed. (Hello, render wrangler!) And yet many names are still missing, and some in the industry don\u2019t think the credits are long enough.How did we get here?It used to be much simpler. The earliest films, shown at nickelodeons at the start of the 1900s, had no credits at all, just the title.Credits grew in the following two decades, but not by much. They would all appear at the beginning of films, usually, in three or four title cards acknowledging the cast and principal technical players.As productions grew more lavish and more complicated, more and more crew members were needed. But in the age of celluloid, studios had to be mindful of how long their credits would be. Film was more expensive to work with and process, so each added reel had an impact on the budget.\u201cI have several films that I\u2019m uncredited on even though I was working for the primary vendor of the visual effects,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd anytime I subcontracted, we were almost never credited. I had a small studio for a while, and the studio itself was rarely even credited.\u201dThe opening credits and how they appear are dictated by unions and contracts. The actor credits are negotiated in individual contracts. \u201cThe key words you use in a contract are usually size, style and duration,\u201d said Ann B. Clark, a lawyer for independent producers and production companies.Mr. Estrada, for example, worked on lighting, rendering and compositing effects for features, and on the animated adventure \u201cOver the Hedge,\u201d he did two distinct jobs. But he was told that he could have only one credit, his choice.A visual-effects supervisor may negotiate a credit with a studio through an agent, but Mr. Estrada said that in most of his rank-and-file contracts, \u201cthe credit is clearly called out as being optional on the studio\u2019s part.\u201dSo if a credit is not contractually obligated, how do you get one? \u201cI think some of it depends on who\u2019s vouching for you,\u201d Ms. Clark said, \u201cand some of it depends on how many degrees of separation you are from the individuals who are actually preparing the credits.\u201d\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\u201d has fun with its scroll, occasionally inserting the words \u201cI Am Groot,\u201d then switching to the name of a crew member. There are also five credit scenes (or \u201cbuttons,\u201d as the industry calls them), laying the groundwork for other \u201cGuardians\u201d tales. The sequence keeps the upbeat spirit of the movie and gives the audience less of a feeling of being held hostage.These artists are all alumni of the animation program at CalArts, a school that produces a number of animators and designers whose names will ultimately appear in film credits.Students certainly find meaning in the scroll, said Maija Burnett, the director of the character animation program there: \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed, when we\u2019ve screened films together for our students, the cheers when they see their teachers\u2019 and fellow alumni\u2019s names.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G.

Was she in any way culpable for this bad choice? After all, she was being used as work for hire: a body and a face to sell a magazine.Or was she?Whether it is obviously an ad, whether a Federal Trade Commission-required hashtag admission goes with it or not (and the F.T.C. is increasingly cracking down on influencer posts, recently writing to 45 celebrities to warn them about necessary disclosures), there is, as Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of the Innovation Group at J. Walter Thompson, said, \u201can implied individual choice.\u201dAnd that means that those involved are perceived as having a personal \u2014 not merely professional \u2014 relationship with the thing they are selling. Which in turn means they bear some responsibility for it. There is a downside to the upside of being an influencer.Either way, it\u2019s real. As with all slippery slopes, it\u2019s easy to hop on but also easy to end up in a heap at the bottom. Which raises the possibility that we are on the verge of a new (hopefully more considered) age in the evolution of Influencer culture.\u201cThe influencer bubble will totally collapse in the next 12 months if people aren\u2019t very careful about the money being thrown around as brands try to buy influencer placement,\u201d said Caroline Issa, the fashion director and chief executive of Tank magazine and a street-style star-turned-occasional Influencer.But while it\u2019s easy to be distracted by the siren call of Influencer culture \u2014 Money for just being you! Free trips to sit front row at fashion shows! Global branding laying out the red carpet for your delicately pointed feet! \u2014 what the cases of Kendall et al. make clear is that there are also risks to individuals.\u201cYouth culture can see through anything they think is inauthentic,\u201d Ms. Greene said. And because followers have what at least seems to be direct access to their \u201cfriend\u201d on Twitter or Instagram, they can respond directly. Also publicly.As we go further down the rabbit hole of personal branding, new agencies are springing up with the mission of connecting brands to influencers and monetizing social media presence (names like MuseFind, UP Influence and Instabrand), and traditional talent agencies like CAA and WME/IMG are signing up YouTube stars or helping their clients transform themselves into social media mavens. Magazines and ad agencies are measuring a model\u2019s attraction not just by his or her physical dimensions, but also by the number of followers. It is increasingly clear that a disconnect exists between the imperative to make as much money as possible out of your influence as fast as possible, and the need to be highly selective about how you wield your influence in order to preserve its equity.The generation that grew up on social media, the digital natives at whom Digifest is aimed, understands this viscerally. The older generation, the ones who Ms. Rojas said \u201cwere born not on social platforms but as traditional celebrities, and have migrated to social afterward,\u201d seems to be learning the hard way.

Mr. Hassabis has said that top amateur Go players, with the help of AlphaGo, can generally manage to beat the software program in a match.

The services offer smaller bundles of channels and allow viewers to watch live television outside the home on mobile devices. Because the video is delivered over the internet, consumers do not need to buy bulky hardware.But choosing a service can be overwhelming. Each lacks channels or features that some viewers consider essential.Here are questions to ask when considering the services:If you live alone, this may not be a concern. But for families with more than one child, or for apartment dwellers with roommates, being able to watch on only two screens at once may not cut it.Several of the services offer packages with different channel lineups and prices. If a specific channel is a must, make sure the package you are considering includes it.All of the services offer the basics for sports fans, including ESPN, ESPN2, FS1 and FS2. But the availability of regional sports networks, or the channels that frequently show Major League Baseball, N.B.A. and N.H.L. games, varies by market. Check the service\u2019s website to see what is included. You will also need to check on the availability of channels that occasionally feature live sports, like TNT, NFL Network, NBA TV, Big Ten Network and SEC Network.Subscribers would gain access to its streaming library, which otherwise costs $7.99 a month.Users of AT&T for wireless phone service have an incentive to choose DirecTV Now: Any video streaming on the app does not count toward monthly data limits. Since streaming quickly chews through data, the perk could help save on mobile bills or enable more on-the-go viewing.This is as close as you will get to \u00e0 la carte programming. You can start for as little as $20 and add chunks of channels in categories like sports, news, comedy and kids for $5 each.It is not just for Sony\u2019s video game console. The service is supported on the same devices used to stream its competitors.A major caveat to this item: The service is initially available only in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Not that here\u2019s a whole lot \u2014 we\u2019re in the spring doldrums. Everybody has one foot in vacation, so basically very little is happening in the industry we cover.If he is running for office (maybe, probably, not) then we still have no idea what his platform would be. I saw some people tweeting (cough, Mike) that it seemed as though he wanted to say more. I think this seemed pretty standard for Zuckerberg, in that he limits his public comments to what will offend the least number of people. It would be fascinating to see him take a strong political stance.At this point, Facebook arguably has the wealth and political sway of a medium-size country (in which Zuckerberg never has to worry about getting re-elected). It\u2019s standing at the center of a lot, and yet its users rarely get insight into what its managers are thinking about the world.But I wonder if the car companies are getting a little too paranoid about self-driving tech. I think the tech will come, but it is, at best, in the research stage now, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how many years it will take to go mainstream. I suspect we\u2019re at the top of the hype cycle right now, and soon we\u2019ll all begin to see the limits of self-driving \u2014 and the story will change to one of pessimism rather than optimism. What do you think?All that being said, I think the technology is inevitable, at least here in the U.S. It\u2019s going to be a long time until the developing world sees the widespread use of self-driving cars.Last year, when I was in Indonesia, I spoke to Google engineers about how hard it is to get accurate maps in much of the rest of the world, where streets don\u2019t really have standard names, and directions are given through landmarks, rather than blocks and feet. Until they sort that out, I can\u2019t see self-driving cars realistically getting rolled out.I like to go through life assuming that everything \u2014 from my Facebook messages to my emails and photos \u2014 will one day get hacked into. If I don\u2019t want it public, I don\u2019t write it down, photograph it, or otherwise save it to any system that is hooked up to the big bad world through the internet. I\u2019m willing to accept that I\u2019m paranoid, but the way that the rate and scale of hackings are exponentially increasing, I think it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.To me, the big issue is that the rules of the game are changing.

{"Headline": "Facebook Scrambles to Police Content Amid Rapid Growth", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As a business, Facebook is more successful than ever. On Wednesday afternoon, it reported another quarter of huge growth, with nearly 2 billion people actively using the service and revenue up 49 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago.But with the company\u2019s vast reach has come another kind of problem: Facebook is becoming too big for its computer algorithms and relatively small team of employees and contractors to manage the trillions of posts on its social network.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner \u2014 whether that\u2019s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.\u201d He offered no details on what would change.Despite Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s pledge to do a better job in screening content, many Facebook users did not seem to believe that much would change. Hundreds of commenters on Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s post related personal experiences of reporting inappropriate content to Facebook that the company declined to remove.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at University of North Carolina who studies online speech issues, said that Facebook designed Live to notify your friends automatically about a live feed \u2014 something guaranteed to appeal to publicity seekers of all sorts.\u201cIt was pretty clear to me that this would lead to on-camera suicides, murder, abuse, torture,\u201d she said. \u201cThe F.B.I. did a pretty extensive study of school shooters: The infamy part is a pretty heavy motivator.\u201dFacebook has no intention of dialing back its promotion of video, including Live, telling investors on a conference call Wednesday that it would continue to rank it high in users\u2019 news feeds and add more advertising within live videos and clips.Advertising is Facebook\u2019s lifeblood, accounting for most of the company\u2019s revenue and profit. In the first quarter, the company earned $3.1 billion, up 76 percent from the previous year.Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, said that all the negative publicity about Facebook\u2019s problems with horrific content and fake news appears to have hurt user satisfaction levels. Adding more content monitors is aimed at reassuring Facebook\u2019s 1.94 billion users, she said.\u201cIf people feel safe on Facebook, they will be more engaged and will use it more often,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cAnd if they use it more often, there will be more inventory for advertising.\u201dThe company is trying to strike a balance between censorship and free speech. Facebook video has been used to share millions of personal stories and to document events of immense public interest, such as a series of police shootings of unarmed black men that sparked a national conversation about race and law enforcement.\u201cAll policies need to recognize that distressing speech is sometimes the most important to a public conversation,\u201d said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who works on free speech issues.She said that the decision to hire more moderators can only help the company make better judgments, especially about live events where fast decisions can be critical. \u201cHumans tend to have more nuance and context than an algorithm,\u201d Ms. Rowland said.But Ms. Rowland said Facebook must also be more clear to the public about its rules on making those calls.Mr. Zuckerberg called the recent episodes of violence \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said the company wanted to make it simpler and faster for reviewers to spot problems and call in law enforcement when needed.In the conference call with investors, he said that artificial intelligence tools would eventually allow reviewers to do a better job of reviewing content. \u201cNo matter how many people we have on the team, we\u2019ll never be able to look at everything,\u201d he said.Facebook is not the only internet company to wrestle with these problems. Google has struggled with similar issues involving its YouTube video service and an automated advertising system that sometimes places marketers\u2019 ads next to questionable content.Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said in an interview this week that like Facebook, his company believed the internet was so vast that machine learning had to work hand-in-hand with human reviewers to improve vetting.\u201dWe don\u2019t think the problem over time should involve humans, because of the scale of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are definitely using humans. We have invested pretty heavily in humans because they are training the machine learning.\u201dJim Kerstetter contributed reporting from New York.Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter @vindugoel.Advertisement"}

Such an investigation could lead to criminal charges for Mr. Levandowski.Keith A. Noreika, the newly appointed head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, comes from the prominent law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, where he represented several banks.Many of his former clients are regulated by the agency he now heads, including at least one lender that may need regulatory approval for a merger, a matter on which Mr. Noreika worked.A spokesman for the Treasury Department, which houses the agency, said Mr. Noreika would face \u201cthe same strong ethics laws that apply to all officials serving in the O.C.C.,\u201d including recusing himself from \u201cany specific matters involving his clients from over the past year.\u201dBut the White House used an administrative quirk to appoint Mr. Noreika to the job on an acting basis as a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d who is expected to work at the agency for no more than 130 days, rather than through a Senate confirmation.As a result, Mr. Noreika does not need to sign the pledge, allowing him to face fewer restrictions on lobbying and lawyering when he returns to the private sector.\u201cThese stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No App Required.", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Today, most people know Amazon\u2019s Echo speaker as an easy way to play music using voice commands, but the device and others like it are catching on as ways to control light switches, thermostats and other smart home appliances.Now Amazon has a deal with one of the best known purveyors of home furnishings \u2014 Ikea \u2014 to make Alexa, the voice assistant inside Echo, more integrated into homes.The arrangement is not exclusive to Amazon, so Ikea can strike similar agreements with makers of other smart speakers like Google Home.The backing of Ikea, known for its affordable, mass-market furnishings, could help attract more public curiosity about smart home appliances, which most consumers have not yet seen a compelling reason to purchase. In an interview, Daniel Rausch, vice president for smart home at Amazon, said the relationship with Ikea would allow people to outfit a room with smart lighting for just \u201ctens of dollars.\u201dAmazon has said there have been \u201ctens of millions of Alexa devices\u201d sold, including various devices in Amazon\u2019s Echo family of products and others from independent device makers. While a lot of people use Echo to play music from Spotify or from radio stations, Mr. Rausch said smart home usage of the devices was growing rapidly.He said Alexa users gave home-related commands \u2014 like \u201craise the temperature in the living room\u201d and \u201cturn on the dining room lights\u201d \u2014 millions of times a day. The number of such commands by Alexa users grew 500 percent in the period from March to May compared with the same period the year before he said.One obstacle to the growth of the smart home market has been that most individual products \u2014 thermostats, sprinkler systems, smart plugs and light bulbs \u2014 require separate apps to control them. For a person fumbling in the dark with a bag of groceries, simply flicking the lights on is much less of a hassle than opening an app on a smartphone to perform the same task.But being able to command all or most of a home\u2019s smart appliances using voice, as people can do through Alexa, could make them more appealing, analysts said. \u201cI think this idea of voice control is really going to accelerate this whole market, and I think Amazon is very much ahead,\u201d said Victoria Petrock, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say the race is won.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In January, his estimated revenue was about $3,900.In February and March, he was alarmed to see that drop below $3,000. Last month, he saw around $1,600 and has been using crowdfunding to cover his shooting costs.\u201cWe\u2019ve never had problems with being told we\u2019re not advertiser-friendly,\u201d said Mr. Wood, who said he did not use profanity or offensive material in his videos. He suspects that algorithms scanning for words like \u201csatanic\u201d or \u201cmurder\u201d may be limiting ads from running with his content, but can\u2019t be sure as discussions with YouTube product managers have yielded little information.While companies like Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola have resumed spending on the platform, major brands including AT&T and the pharmaceutical company GSK have not yet returned. Enterprise, the car rental company, will resume spending in the next week, said Laura Bryant, an Enterprise spokeswoman.In the meantime, several YouTube creators say they are getting fewer ads on their videos, but are not certain whether the changes are a result of less money in the system, new buying methods from advertisers or new algorithms from YouTube that have flagged their content.\u201cRates are a lot lower and hurting a lot of folks,\u201d said Krishna Subramanian, a founder of Captiv8, a firm that connects brands to social media influencers.His firm recently conducted a survey of 100 YouTube creators and said that channels focused on comedy and gaming experienced the sharpest drops in revenue last month compared with February. At the same time, creators in food, beauty and fashion, and family and parenting had increases. YouTube shares ad revenue with creators, who keep more than half.Some creators are \u201clooking at a video saying, \u2018It got a million views, but I only got $700 \u2014 I used to get $2,500,\u2019\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it the new reality,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said last week when asked about struggling creators. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we actually find the right balance between the advertisers here and the creators. That\u2019s really what we have to fine-tune the systems to.\u201dHe said it was difficult to assess how many people were affected, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s a big, complicated space with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people making substantial amounts of money.\u201d But he said the disruption was extra tough on niche creators.\u201cWe look at our bottom line, and if we lose 30 percent of our YouTube revenue, we might say yes to some brand deals we would have otherwise said no to in order to not lay anybody off,\u201d he said of his channels. \u201cBut if somebody\u2019s making an extra $1,000 a month and that\u2019s helping them pay the grocery bills, those people might not have access to that.\u201dShe wanted an explanation for why ad revenue had dried up on her series \u201cI Don\u2019t Bi It\u201d and a video of her describing her lesbian crushes on YouTube, while it had remained steady on videos titled \u201cTop 15 Canadian Stereotypes\u201d and \u201cBleaching My Hair Blonde.\u201d While YouTube\u2019s guidelines say that \u201csexually suggestive content\u201d and \u201csexual humor\u201d are not advertiser-friendly, Ms. Fender said the videos in question were still running ads, but for far less money.\u201cIf they\u2019re going to pull ads from videos without telling us and giving us no notification and no way to appeal it, they need to at least tell us what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat rules are these videos breaking? What is it that we need to avoid? How can we remain advertiser-friendly? That\u2019s the main problem \u2014 the secrecy and how quiet they\u2019re keeping.\u201dYouTube said in a statement that it had had \u201clots of positive conversations with advertisers, and many are noticing the improvements we\u2019ve made.\u201d\u201cWhile many creators are seeing revenue improvements, some continue to be impacted,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work closely with both advertisers and creators to get things right.\u201dHe said he was frustrated by a call last week with a YouTube representative.\u201cShe basically told me, \u2018Your channel is doing so great, especially for the last month,\u2019 and that everything is up \u2014 our numbers are way up, our watch time almost doubled from March,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our ad revenue is pretty much a quarter of what it was in March.\u201dMr. Green, who helped launch a nonprofit called the Internet Creators Guild to protect and guide people in the industry last year, said it would be helpful for YouTube to disclose which channels and categories had been most affected by the recent changes, and whether the shifts were being driven by the platform or advertisers.\u201cThe great thing about YouTube, the thing that has made it such a powerful, creative ecosystem, is that you can be getting a relatively small number of views and still be making a good amount of money, which can help you keep it going to do weird and new and creative things,\u201d he said.While Mr. Green expects the situation to rebound as advertisers return to YouTube\u2019s lucrative audience, he expressed concern about the possibility they may limit themselves to large, established channels.\u201cThe great promise of YouTube is the potential for this to be an important job, for there to be more professional, independent creators than coal miners in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cIf we\u2019re just going to remake TV and put all of the power to make money and distribute content back into the hands of a few people, then burn it all down.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Fargo\u2019 Season 3, Episode 6: Ray the Loser", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byFargoRay Stussy was a loser. Before he ever opened his mouth, before we ever learned anything about him, this was a fact that we understood immediately, like catching a sharp whiff of cheap cologne. There was never going to be anything he could do to eradicate this part of himself and certainly nothing his brother Emmit could do, either, to validate or appease him. His death in this week\u2019s episode is treated like a sad inevitability, as the inept schemes and crippling pettiness of a not-so-clever man lead to another needless fatality and open the door to still more. He cannot accept the stamp from his brother as a gift because he feels entitled to it. There\u2019s strength in seizing it from him by robbing his house or raiding his safe deposit box or scoring $100,000 by blackmailing him with a phony sex tape. But he\u2019s too proud to have it given to him.\u201cFargo\u201d is sympathetic to Ray, though, more so than the Coen brothers were to their loser, Jerry Lundegaard, who also wanted to feel bigger than an \u201cexecutive sales manager\u201d getting dressed down over sealant. The opening shot bathes Ray in the morning light as it\u2019s refracted by the blinds, emphasizing the near-heroic look of determination and purpose that animates his face. Two men have come after the woman he loves and he will defend her, without even formulating a plan or thinking about the consequences. When Ray comes across Varga\u2019s henchman at one of his brother\u2019s lots, Nikki has to stop him from plunging headlong into a conflict in which he has no advantage. He\u2019s willing to kill for her, and he\u2019s willing to die for her \u2014 both with equal recklessness.Ray\u2019s impulsiveness is childish and stupid. That was clear when he committed the original mistake of going after the red Corvette, which looked cool but would deteriorate in value and cachet over time, instead of the boring old stamp, which would only appreciate if carefully preserved. But with childishness also comes a kind of innocence, a base sincerity that makes his sins more understandable and human, if not necessarily forgivable. He wants to be respected like his brother. He wants to please and defend his wife-to-be, whom he loves with such obliviousness that he proposes to her at the worst possible time. This episode puts too fine a point on it by having Ray die the way he does \u2014 I\u2019m reminded of Lisa Simpson dreaming of her brother getting impaled on her Nobel Peace Prize \u2014 but it does strike a persuasively tragic note.With the creator Noah Hawley taking over scripting duties, \u201cFargo\u201d enters the second half of its 10-episode season by eliminating one of its catalysts, but tightening the screws elsewhere. Ray leaves Nikki behind as both target and vengeful chaos agent, but the big development is Gloria finally meeting Varga, who will be her biggest foe as the season concludes. It doesn\u2019t have to happen, either. Varga\u2019s need to control Emmit and his play at Stussy Lots overwhelms the more sensible strategy of remaining the unseen puppet master. He doesn\u2019t trust Emmit to speak to the police without him present, but he winds up drawing more suspicion through arrogance and contempt.Varga may be a fearsome customer, but we know that Gloria is used to dealing with men like him because one of those men is her boss, who\u2019s currently trying to pry her away from the investigation. \u201cI\u2019m an associate of Mr. Stussy\u2019s is all you need to know,\u201d Varga sneers, before offering the thin historical coincidence of there being 24 Hitlers in the phone books. (\u201cWere they all responsible for the Final Solution?\u201d) The director, Dearbhla Walsh, stages the scene brilliantly, starting from Varga\u2019s predatory vantage point as he closes in on the conversation in Emmit\u2019s office from the outside before making an entrance and controlling the discussion. Yet it\u2019s not Varga but Gloria who has the real power in this scene: As Varga saunters around the room, offering countertheories and obfuscation, Gloria asks questions insistently and leaves with another piece of the puzzle.There\u2019s more evidence of Varga\u2019s aggression and cunning at the top of the episode, when he proposes a series of loan-funded acquisitions that will double the size of the company, but Hawley nonetheless paints him as a know-it-all who doesn\u2019t know as much as he thinks he does. His Google search on Gloria Burgle yields nothing and a second search for the Eden Valley Police Department yields a public library, which leads him to conclude that Gloria is a threat that\u2019s easily squashed. He\u2019s dangerous, but he also thinks the moon landing was faked. Reality tends to catch up to men like that.3 Cent Stamps\u2022 Varga may be making a similar mistake in underestimating Larue Dollard, the IRS agent looking at Stussy Lots\u2019 books. The decision to kick him out of the office, rather than allow the cooked numbers to speak for themselves, is likely to stoke his suspicions rather than extinguish them.\u2022 Staging an elaborate flashback where Archduke Franz Ferdinand\u2019s assassin is eating a fateful sandwich is one of those unexpected flourishes that make the show fun.\u2022 The answer to a mystery from a few episodes ago: The sole contents of Emmit\u2019s safe deposit box were a Dalmation\u2019s ashes.\u2022 The fewer shots of Varga jabbing away at his rotten gums, the better. This show is setting back Britain\u2019s already dim dental legacy.Advertisement"}

It was not a major concern of the company, Mr. Fernandez said.\u201cThe political and macroeconomic situation did not affect our discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not affect the fundamentals of our business, because at the end of the day, there are 200 million people who still need transportation.\u201dMr. Fernandez joined 99, based in S\u00e3o Paulo, in January 2016, initially brought on board as chief product officer by one of the company\u2019s founders, Paulo Veras. He was made chief executive last October, and his main task was to find global strategic partners. He was previously head of mobile and social for Google Latin America. Before that, he served as head of Latin America for AdMob, which was acquired by Google in 2009.Mr. Fernandez said that 99 planned to use the new capital to expand its peer-to-peer ride offering, called 99POP, which it started in the fourth quarter of last year.The company, founded in 2012, initially focused on working with taxi drivers and was first called 99Taxis, providing an alternative to Uber. It continues to grow in that area, but it is now putting more effort into the POP service.\u201cThe goal is to dominate Brazil and dominate peer-to-peer,\u201d the chief executive said. He noted that in S\u00e3o Paulo, 50 percent of the company\u2019s rides are peer-to-peer.The company says it has more than 200,000 drivers and more than 14 million registered users.Mr. Fernandez, though, understands that the sector is capital intensive.\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to raise a lot more capital. This is just one step in a very long path ahead of us,\u201d he said.

Investors include the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Mubadala Investment Company of the United Arab Emirates, Apple and Qualcomm. It said it expected final closing to occur within six months.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re coming in is a really big deal for the country,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said of the SoftBank fund.For start-ups maturing and trying to grow, \u201caccess to capital in Latin America is really difficult, and much more so than in the U.S., Asia or Europe,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Push and Pull on Cuba", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn recent weeks, as the White House has been consumed by loud debates over health care, taxes and trade, there has been another, quieter debate occurring beneath the surface. Government agencies and lawmakers have been pulling the administration in two directions on whether to continue the Obama administration\u2019s path on relations with Cuba.Meanwhile, a large pro-engagement coalition that includes lawmakers from both parties, businesses and young Cuban-Americans, is calling on the White House to build on the foundation of engagement it inherited. By charting out narrow areas of cooperation with Havana \u2014 while agreeing to disagree on human rights issues \u2014 the Obama administration enabled the freer flow of people, goods and information between the countries.Among the fruits of this approach have been bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills and coordination on counternarcotics efforts. Havana also recently agreed to start accepting some Cubans who have been ordered deported. Regulatory changes have made it easier for most Americans to visit Cuba \u2014 though going there purely for tourism is still technically illegal \u2014 and enabled broader exchanges among scholars, journalists and artists. Google, meanwhile, is negotiating a series of agreements with Cuba that could significantly expand access to the internet on the island, one of the most unplugged nations on earth.Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks on Cuba policy have been brief and thoughtless. Shortly after being elected, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.\u201dThat put Cubans and Americans on notice that Mr. Trump was contemplating reversing Mr. Obama\u2019s easement of American sanctions. The White House began an assessment early this year and agencies, including the Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, have given their input. It is unclear when, or whether, an announcement of a decision will come. Mr. Trump could undo many regulatory changes with the stroke of a pen. For instance, he could tighten rules on sending remittances to Cubans, suspend the newly re-established commercial flights between the nations and stop American cruises from docking in Havana.If he were to take those sorts of steps, Mr. Trump would make the small pro-embargo coalition in Capitol Hill very happy. But doing so would mean reversing course on a policy change that is widely popular among Americans and nearly universally supported by Cubans.He also would be putting American farmers and businesses at a disadvantage by curtailing their access to a market that is gradually opening to global trade. In 2016, the European Union formally abandoned a policy predicated on pursuit of a democratic transition and struck a broader agreement with Havana that includes cooperation on trade and development and a dialogue on human rights.Most damagingly, putting the relationship with Cuba back on a confrontational track would all but certainly subject Cubans to greater repression and privation. In the past, Havana has ratcheted up its repressive tactics during moments of heightened tension with the United States.Instead of waiting for the Cuban government to \u201cmake a better deal with the Cuban people\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 Mr. Trump can continue to make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with Cubans. Strengthening ties does not guarantee that Cuba will reform its one-party system or overhaul its centrally planned economy. But it would empower Cubans as they contemplate the future they want for their country.Advertisement"}

She feared losing her job and being kicked out of graduate school, and she spent years on damage control.\u201cI can\u2019t really say that it ever ended. I\u2019m pretty sure that my images are still being posted, but I just stopped searching my name,\u201d she said.Ms. Jacobs is far from alone.For victims, fighting against such attacks can take years and prove costly. In Ms. Jacobs\u2019s case, the ordeal came to an end of sorts when she reached a legal settlement last summer, more than six years after it began.Here\u2019s a brief look at the advice she and others offer to women and men who find, or are threatened with, their most intimate images and videos being shared without their permission.The toll of nonconsensual porn can be severe, causing depression and post-traumatic stress. That\u2019s why advocates say victims should seek out support from a trusted friend, partner, family member, teacher, counselor or therapist.Ms. Jacobs had access to free counseling through her school, but many victims are not so fortunate. For them, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative maintains a 24-hour crisis hotline, (844) 878-2274, that can serve as a starting point.\u201cWe have counselors that are on the other end of that line to offer immediate counseling for the victim and then we take them through their options,\u201d Ms. Jacobs said.Many victims want nothing more than for their intimate photos and videos to be destroyed. But advocates encourage them to preserve the information in case they plan future legal action.(The group, a pro bono project of K&L Gates, the global firm where Ms. D\u2019Amico works, is not related to Ms. Jacobs\u2019s organization.)Some companies may, by request, retain information for future legal proceedings, while some law enforcement agencies may be able to collect forensic evidence, too. Ms. Jacobs recommends consulting a lawyer to better understand what evidence might be useful.And while the decision to prosecute lies with the government, victims can help by providing documentation. \u201cIn order to have a successful prosecution, you\u2019ve got to have evidence,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Amico said.But even when legal representation is free, there are emotional costs to pursuing civil action, said David Bateman, a K&L Gates lawyer who co-founded the pro bono group with Ms. D\u2019Amico. Going to trial can mean months or years of legal entanglement and public exposure, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a good tool if you need it, but 95 percent of the people we see just really want to get this stuff down and move on with their life,\u201d he said.After victims have considered their legal options, and, ideally, consulted a lawyer, they can focus on having the photos and videos taken down.Many major websites and online services, including Google, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter and Yahoo, ban nonconsensual porn and have processes for reporting it.For those daunted by the process, takedown services can do the work for a fee, or free.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Computer Coding Classes Swell, So Does Cheating", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byFor a simple assignment, writing code that would allow one computer to visit web pages located on another, two students in H. E. Dunsmore\u2019s class at Purdue University turned in nearly 100 identical lines of code. Was it a fluke? Or had they cheated?As he looked over their work, Mr. Dunsmore, a veteran computer science professor, saw what he called the smoking gun:boolean done = true; while (!done) {\u201cThis is pretty strong evidence that one had copied the other,\u201d Mr. Dunsmore said. \u201cThey later both confessed to collusion.\u201dCollege students have flooded into computer science courses across the country, recognizing them as an entree to coveted jobs at companies like Facebook and Google, not to mention the big prize: a start-up worth millions.The exploding interest in these courses, though, has coincided with an undesirable side effect: a spate of high-tech collegiate plagiarism. Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internet.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,\u201d said Randy H. Katz, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying code.Computer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course, and, like colleagues in other subjects, deploy software to flag plagiarism. They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheating.At Brown University, more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer science.At Stanford, the alma mater of the founders of Google, Snapchat and countless other internet wonders, as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheating.In interviews, professors and students said the causes were not hard to pin down.\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option to copy from the internet,\u201d said Jackson Wagner, who took the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why people cheat.\u201dComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers, which encourages code-sharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class. Professors also frequently allow students to discuss problems among themselves, but not to share actual code, a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheating.The executive committee at Yale, where five students were accused of copying code last fall, though a couple had charges withdrawn, acknowledged as much.\u201cIt is often such a complex task to read these guidelines,\u201d wrote the committee chairman, Paul North, a professor of German, \u201cthat the code to be written seems simple in comparison.\u201dPenalties can be as small as a zero on an assignment, which is what the Purdue students received; they were also docked a letter in the course\u2019s final grade. (Dr. Dunsmore credits awareness of such penalties with a reduction in cheating in his courses over the last decade.) More serious or repeated infractions can lead to failing the course, or even suspension.\u201cIt\u2019s mostly that a lot of computer science professors actually check,\u201d said Alex Aiken, who heads the computer science department at Stanford.Though coding is a foreign language to most people, the principles of plagiarism are the same as with papers written in English.Sometimes it is acceptable for lines of code to be identical, if the code is performing a routine task or one that cannot be done a different way. But other times it is a red flag.struct visit_list node; node.row = row; node.col = col; node.next = NULL;Someone copying the code, he said, might render it this way:struct rooms_visited room; room.r = r; room.c = c; room.link = 0;At Harvard, David J. Malan, the CS50 professor, introduced a \u201cregret clause,\u201d letting students who cheat and admit it within 72 hours receive an unsatisfactory or failing grade on the assignment, and avoid further discipline \u2014 unless they do it again.Professor Malan said one reason for the large number of cases was that instructors were scrutinizing students\u2019 work more carefully than before. He also said that since students could use the regret clause, instructors felt more comfortable going to the honor council when students had passed up that chance.He referred questions about the outcomes of the cheating complaints to a university spokeswoman, who said she could not discuss the cases because of student privacy.Two Harvard students who said they were familiar with some of the violations, and who wanted to be anonymous for fear of repercussions from the university, described one of the more blatant examples: A student submitted code using a computer language, PHP, that had been taught in a previous year, but not last fall.Some students suggested that in other cases there was a fine line between reasonable sharing and improper copying, particularly because the professor encourages students to discuss problems with one another.\u201cThere is a gray area as to how much help one can get,\u201d said Javier Cuan-Martinez, the president of the Harvard Computer Society, who took the course two years ago.Professor Malan, in an email, said the guidelines in the course syllabus were clear. One rule says that when asking for help, you may have your code viewed by others, but you may not view theirs. \u201cWhenever a line is actually crossed,\u201d Professor Malan wrote, \u201cit\u2019s often that one.\u201dStephanie Saul contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Viewers Drift Online, Advertisers Hold Fast to Broadcast TV", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byTV ratings are collapsing. Media stocks are falling. Cord cutting is accelerating.There has been no shortage of bad headlines for television networks over the last few months, as investors grow concerned over dropping viewership and as people increasingly find new ways to entertain themselves.Yet while audience attention has drifted toward platforms like Netflix, Facebook and YouTube, there is one group of stubborn holdouts who are not ready to give up on broadcast television: advertisers.This week, as ad buyers cram into New York institutions like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall to watch the broadcast networks talk up a new TV season, they will again prepare to spend as much as $9 billion to be a part of it. Though the market may be cooling this year, a significant drop is not expected.A reasonable person might ask how, in 2017, is that remotely possible?\u201cIt will continue to move forward this way as long as it works,\u201d said Lyle Schwartz, the president of investment for North America at GroupM, the ad buying arm of the advertising conglomerate WPP.But isn\u2019t buying a 30-second spot on television a little, well, out of date?As a media analyst at Pivotal Research, Brian Wieser, put it, advertising on TV is \u201cas archaic as water flowing through pipes.\u201d\u201cYou could set up a drone to take water from a reservoir and use fascinating technology and cutting-edge approaches to deliver it, but there\u2019s a good reason we use these systems,\u201d he said.In interviews, ad buyers and television executives pointed to a variety of reasons that advertisers remain attracted to ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS. Ratings aside, television still reaches more people and provides a reliable way for an ad to be seen on a full screen with sound. There is a limited amount of inventory, in contrast to the endless reach of the web, and marketers know rates will spike if they wait to buy airtime.It also does not hurt that Facebook and YouTube have had trouble in recent months with ads showing up next to objectionable content.\u201cSales directors at the networks are going to say, \u2018We have premium content that is professionally produced, and it\u2019s been vetted and won\u2019t be an issue for your brand to be associated with it,\u2019\u201d said Brad Adgate, a veteran media analyst. \u201cWith Google and Facebook, you\u2019ve seen stuff where they\u2019ve had to say that they have to do a better job.\u201dStill, there are serious questions about how sustainable all of this is. Trend lines certainly suggest things could go in the other direction. Networks are having trouble showing how many people are watching their content across a wide variety of platforms, audiences are growing accustomed to platforms where they can watch shows without commercials, and marketers are eager to find better ways to target potential customers.And at present, broadcast television is holding an edge thanks to an older audience. The median age for scripted TV\u2019s No. 1 show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and one of its top reality shows, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d is 55. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, ratings in broadcast television fell by 11 percent this season.\u201cIf you just look at where the business is going, we\u2019re in a transitional phase now where to a large degree, boomers are keeping television as we define it today afloat,\u201d said Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment.Advertisers are aware that this may not last forever.GroupM predicted that digital platforms would be taking a growing share of new advertising dollars. Still, even though digital players are surging, television remains the established elder statesman for advertisers. GroupM noted that television accounted for 42 percent of advertising investments last year, compared with 31 percent for digital.The sophistication of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s ability to target ads is no small matter, though, and TV networks have been scrambling to find ways to compete in that arena.Digital companies are capable of targeting audiences so narrow that they can pinpoint, say, Idaho residents in long-distance relationships who are contemplating buying a minivan. (Facebook\u2019s ads manager says that description matches 3,100 people.)As attractive as that slicing and dicing can be, television appears to have an advantage in terms of the actual commercial time it can offer marketers.\u201cIt\u2019s great if I can target someone I know is a truck driver who searched for the word \u2018truck\u2019 who visited my site a lot, but where do I get them to watch my ad?\u201d asked Joe Marchese, the newly named head of ad sales for Fox Networks Group. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make him or her watch it?\u201dAnd television still offers an enormous audience.\u201cThe number of minutes we show commercials is way more than YouTube or Facebook on a video basis \u2014 many multiples more,\u201d Mr. Marchese said.Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s largest advertising companies, said the millions who saw commercials on a hit show like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d could also be more valuable.\u201cIf you basically put that same advertising, say a million dollars, within Facebook and Google, the reality of it is that people are going to see those things in a very splintered fashion,\u201d he said.The so-called upfront season offers advertisers a chance to buy the bulk of their ads before marquee shows return in September. This creates a level of competition that advertisers cannot help but participate in.It also fosters a power dynamic that probably sounds foreign to a generation of consumers who tend to see automatically placed ads on YouTube content that could have been made a day earlier by anyone.\u201cWhat the networks do say is: \u2018Great, I\u2019m going to invite all my potential clients and clients to a room at the same time on the same day where I\u2019m going to show my shows that I may or may not actually put up this fall and may not keep for two episodes,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201c\u2018And I\u2019m going to make you sit next to your competitors and basically say here\u2019s the price of it, and if you don\u2019t pay this price now, it\u2019s going to cost you 30 percent more in six months.\u2019\u201dMass marketers aiming to drive people to, say, their stores or car dealerships rely on long-held TV plans to align with their product launches, and pulling out could be both expensive and risky.\u201cThe reason it\u2019s priced high and reason you have to buy in advance is because your competitors might buy it out,\u201d Mr. Morgan continued. It\u2019s like the Cold War but for brands, he said, adding, \u201cIf they have a bunch of missiles, you need a bunch more missiles.\u201dAnd so, for a week in mid-May, the networks still have the upper hand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Power Player and Her Sons Disappear Off the Bahamas", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byRescue workers on Wednesday continued to collect debris from an MU-2B aircraft that went down about 15 miles east of Eleuthera, the Bahamas, said Eric Woodall, a spokesman for the Coast Guard.The three passengers aboard the private plane were the New York event space entrepreneur Jennifer Blumin, 40, and her two sons, Theodore, 3, and Phineas, 4. The pilot was Ms. Blumin\u2019s boyfriend, Nathan Ulrich, 52, a founder of a scooter company, Xootr.\u201cThere have been no body parts or survivors found,\u201d Mr. Woodall said.The father of the children, who was in New York at the time of the crash, was the architect James Ramsey.When the landlords were ready to sell, or developers began to build, Ms. Blumin would pack her bags and find a new space in yet another soon-to-gentrify neighborhood.In 2001, Ms. Blumin helped the developer Jonathan Leitersdorf convert his apartment in the NoHo section of Manhattan into a space for photo shoots and corporate events. Soon, the model Gisele B\u00fcndchen was standing by the pool on Mr. Leitersdorf\u2019s roof while a photographer snapped away.To finance her nascent operation, Ms. Blumin took out a series of loans on Manhattan properties and flipped them. Equal parts developer, event planner and urban archaeologist, she took over 18,000 square feet of abandoned industrial space at Hudson and Spring Streets early on, transforming it in 2004 into a clean white box that was used by clients including Tommy Hilfiger and Nike.After that, Ms. Blumin obtained leases for the James A. Farley Post Office across from Pennsylvania Station and a space in the West Village, both of which have served as main sites for New York Fashion Week events.Dan Barasch, an entrepreneur and a friend of Ms. Blumin\u2019s since their days at Cornell University, said she was guided by a desire to have an \u201cadventure that was risky, that others wouldn\u2019t try.\u201dThat sense of risk took her to Puerto Rico, where Ms. Blumin was in the process of buying a house, according to another friend, Vanessa Grigoriadis, a writer for several publications, including The New York Times Magazine.Shortly after celebrating the birthday of her son Theo in April, Ms. Blumin traveled to Puerto Rico with her children. They were joined there by Mr. Ulrich, an experienced pilot.\u201cShe was really proud of herself for what she built,\u201d Ms. Grigoriadis said. \u201cIt was an only-in-New York kind of story. But she did feel that her success afforded some freedom.\u201cI never heard her say, \u2018I\u2019m giving the business up,\u2019\u201d Ms. Grigoriadis continued, \u201cbut she did say: \u2018I\u2019m going to be with my kids. I\u2019m going to be in the North Fork. I\u2019m going to be in Puerto Rico.\u2019 And the tragedy is that she never got the chance to live that life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Hot Ones\u2019 and Other Shows Parade the Rich, Famous and Oh So Vulnerable", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byDJ Snake, like many stars of the dance-music mega-festival circuit, has the public profile of someone in witness protection. His job doesn\u2019t necessarily require bold charm, but even by those measures, he\u2019s a cipher.So his recent appearance on \u201cHot Ones,\u201d the online interview show in which celebrities are confronted with questions and 10 chicken wings slathered in increasingly spicy sauce, didn\u2019t initially hold much promise.\u201cI\u2019m crying,\u201d he said. \u201cBehind these glasses, there is a human being.\u201dEventually, he returned to the table and completed the challenge, but his transformation was complete \u2014 by showing weakness, by allowing himself to be bested, he somehow gave his fame a boost.Incessant social media and the internet, with its immediacy and density, have gone a long way toward undoing the top-down version of celebrity. But in truth those new spaces are often almost as controlled as the older, more hierarchical ones, despite their seeming transparency. Hunger for something unvarnished persists.Almost all celebrities aim for an impregnable public image, one that can hold up to any assault. But in this era of 24-7-365 mythmaking, the most visionary ones understand the value and uses of weakness, too.Each of these shows is premised upon the dismantling and destabilization of fame. In exchange, the subjects \u2014 ranging from the moderately well known to the extremely famous \u2014 surrender a little piece of their everyday mask.\u201cHot Ones,\u201d which is in the middle of its second season, thrives on the visible trial of physical discomfort. The most entertaining episodes are, naturally, the ones with the most pain. Kevin Hart winces and weeps and keeps looking at his associates offstage, as if begging for reprieve. DJ Khaled, usually gregarious and motivational, decides early in the wing flight that he\u2019d prefer to be a spectator: \u201cIt\u2019s very important we teach the youth, because this right here is dangerous.\u201dCorporeal suffering may be the last preserve of unassailable truth \u2014 even the most socially trained stars may have weak stomachs. (The \u201cStar in a Reasonably Priced Car\u201d segment, from the original \u201cTop Gear,\u201d in which celebrities raced a clunker around a track, was an excellent early example of this.) Some people maintain their veneer \u2014 the Los Angeles rapper YG never appeared to break a sweat \u2014 but most struggle at least a little bit, and the struggle is the thing.As an interlocutor, Mr. Evans is a sterling foil. He retains admirable composure as he makes his way through the increasingly violent sauces. (He always completes the task.) And he\u2019s a well-prepared interviewer, ready to spring awkward questions at difficult moments. Just after Padma Lakshmi finished the final wing, he earnestly asked, \u201cOf all the animal testicles that you\u2019ve eaten in your life, which pair do you think has the best shot of becoming a mainstream menu item?\u201dThere is something sportslike to \u201cHot Ones,\u201d which has only attracted more famous masochists as it\u2019s become more established. Facing off against Mr. Evans is a point of pride, but almost without fail, posture reveals all: Mr. Evans remains erect and focused, while his guests, even the successful ones, tend to crumble.The power dynamic on \u201cThe Therapist,\u201d which uses the framework of an actual session to simulate structured intimacy, is more equitable, and sometimes weighted in favor of the celebrity. Each episode of the show, which had its premiere on May 8, is devoted to a single session with Siri Sat Nam Singh, a Ph.D. and licensed marriage and family therapist who tries to get his guests to unpack their trauma in concise sit-down sessions.The results are often fascinating \u2014 Young M.A. reveals that she randomly smells embalming fluid that reminds her of her murdered brother, and Corey Taylor of Slipknot details childhood sexual abuse and drug addiction. Mr. Taylor appears most moved by the experience, breaking down in tears and allowing Mr. Singh, a beatific if shtick-reliant presence, to lead him in chant: \u201cI am healing, I am healed, I am whole.\u201dThese shows reflect an evolution in celebrity journalism, using the conventions of reality television \u2014 unpredictability, intimacy, alleged authenticity \u2014 as a means of reframing how one should be famous in public. In the past, that might have meant a confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey or Diane Sawyer, or willing (but invisible) collaboration with the tabloids \u2014 tools to leverage one\u2019s personal life for fame. But those have become part and parcel of mainstream celebrity. Now, what\u2019s required are less expected, and more grounded, peeks behind the curtain. It is no longer the obligation of the celebrity to be unattainable; it\u2019s more important to be relatable.And sometimes suggestible, which is perhaps the greatest disruption of all. That\u2019s the foundation of \u201cHollywood Medium,\u201d a consistently troubling show that resumes its second season later this month. Mr. Henry is, depending on your belief in the afterlife, a seer or a charlatan. In each episode, he offers readings to celebrities, telling them things about their long-gone loved ones that are largely discoverable by Google. Seemingly without fail, his marks are blown away.Mr. Henry, who describes himself as a \u201cmedium,\u201d a \u201cmedical intuitive\u201d and a \u201cclairvoyant,\u201d often says that he is unaware of who he\u2019s reading, though a show on E! is an unlikely home for someone who purports to be blind to popular culture. Sometimes Mr. Henry\u2019s narrative is, to put it generously, unlikely, as when he says he did not recognize Bobby Brown at the beginning of their reading but then immediately names his daughter when shown a picture, and acknowledges he knows Mr. Brown\u2019s ex-wife, Whitney Houston.On \u201cHot Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Therapist,\u201d the celebrities come into the host\u2019s arena, whereas Mr. Henry takes his charade on the road, which, when he goes to a subject\u2019s house, feels like an invasion. That\u2019s especially the case when Mr. Henry visits the home of Alan Thicke and his wife, Tanya. The initial meeting was last August, a few months before Mr. Thicke died. This season, Mr. Henry returns to Ms. Thicke for a follow-up two months after her husband\u2019s death.\u201cI always say readings are not a cure for grief but they\u2019re a reminder that our loved ones are with us,\u201d Mr. Henry says chipperly, before revisiting the initial reading (with its ominous and very general warnings about the health of Mr. Thicke\u2019s heart) and assuring Ms. Thicke her husband is reconnecting with his family members on the other side.Imagine the moral vacuum required to lie straight-facedly to a grieving widow. Mr. Henry plays the role of na\u00eff but is a con man of the highest order, which is to say, he does an impressive job walking the high wire over his marks\u2019 possible disbelief.More interesting are the reasons that celebrities choose to submit themselves to his acting-class sorcery. Imagine a life cut off from the routine of normal interactions, and one in which disruptions to public image are considered signs of failure. Wouldn\u2019t even the tiniest bit of forgiven humanity be tempting?For those whose lives are surrounded by predictability and coated in plastic, the promise of an experience outside of the bubble \u2014 while still very much protected by that bubble \u2014 is likely too good an opportunity to pass up. (See: The socially acceptable and artistically productive inebriation on \u201cDrunk History,\u201d or the severely polished but ostensibly natural \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segments on \u201cThe Late Late Show With James Corden.\u201d) At a time when celebrities seem more accessible than ever, these new shows allow for the almost complete removal of artifice, in regulated fashion.And so the stars eat ludicrously hot wings, sit with a therapist they\u2019ve never met, engage some aw-shucks huckster to connect them to the other side. Mostly, there\u2019s no harm done. Even if Mr. Evans is leading his guests on a gastronomic roller coaster, he shares the ride, and offers outs along the way. Mr. Singh may ask questions that knocks his guests out of their comfort zones, but they are free to resist his suggestions. Mr. Henry, though, is parasitic, feeding on the vulnerabilities offered to him so gamely. Celebrities are people, too, and they deserve better.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fight Brews Over Push to Shield Americans in Warrantless Surveillance", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Obscured by the furor over surveillance set off by the investigations into possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia during the election, a major debate over electronic spying that defies the usual partisan factions is quietly taking shape in Congress.The debate centers on the National Security Agency\u2019s incidental eavesdropping on Americans via its warrantless surveillance program, which spies on foreigners abroad whose communications pass through American phone and internet services. Its legal basis, the FISA Amendments Act, is set to expire at the end of 2017.A bipartisan coalition of privacy-minded lawmakers has started to circulate draft legislation that would impose new limits on the government\u2019s ability to use incidentally gathered information about Americans who are in contact with foreign targets.The privacy advocates in Congress are using that same lesson this time around, hoping to leverage their colleagues\u2019 concerns that the program will lapse if they fail to extend the law.But the intelligence and law enforcement communities and their allies in Congress appear determined to extend the warrantless surveillance program law, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, without changes. They are framing the debate as being about a program that is too important to be held hostage to any push for changes, lest gridlock kill it.\u201cThis is a tool that is essential to the safety of this country,\u201d the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told Congress at a hearing on Wednesday. \u201cI did not say the same thing about the collection of telephone dialing information by the N.S.A.

And I mean that.\u201dMr. Comey also warned that one of the proposed changes \u2014 a new requirement that a warrant be obtained to search for Americans\u2019 information in the surveillance repository \u2014 risked a failure to \u201cconnect dots\u201d about potential threats.But Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, sought to warn other lawmakers that Congress needed to impose a warrant requirement.\u201cPrivacy is being betrayed in the name of national security,\u201d Mr. Poe told congressional aides at an event to discuss Fourth Amendment issues and legislation late last month.More broadly, two key members of the coalition that won privacy gains two years ago \u2014 Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin \u2014 are discussing a draft bill, which is circulating among panel members.A congressional staff member who described the draft on the condition of anonymity because it is not yet finalized or public said it incorporated a warrant requirement for American searches \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 and would:\u25a0 Restrict law enforcement from using information obtained or derived from warrantless surveillance except when investigating the most serious crimes, like murder.\u25a0 Reduce to three years from five years the time the government may retain raw, or unprocessed, messages collected without a warrant.\u25a0 Require disclosures from the government that are more complete, including forcing the F.B.I. to say how often its agents query for Americans\u2019 information in national security cases, which it has declined to track.\u201cI know there are some people who want a clean reauthorization of Section 702,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that is possible.\u201dThe program can be traced back to the Bush administration\u2019s post-Sept. 11 warrantless wiretapping of international phone calls and emails, which bypassed a 1978 law requiring warrants.Congress legalized a version of that activity in 2008 with the FISA Amendments Act. It permits the N.S.A., on domestic soil without a warrant, to collect messages of foreigners abroad from American phone and internet companies \u2014 including when they communicate with Americans. It also expanded the program from a counterterrorism tool to one that can be used for any foreign intelligence purpose.But the statute did not say how information about Americans that was incidentally gathered should be handled. A newly declassified document, obtained by The New York Times via a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, has shed further light on how the government expanded its power to use such data.Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and an outspoken critic of surveillance, said that affair \u201cis helpful for the reformers\u2019 cause because it is generating awareness about the topic generally.\u201dAt a hearing in February, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, told Mr. Comey that leaks about surveillance of Trump associates\u2019 contacts with Russians, though conducted under a different law, were \u201ca threat to the reauthorization\u201d of the FISA Amendments Act.\u201cTrust me, you and I both want to see it reauthorized,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said. \u201cIt is in jeopardy if we don\u2019t get this resolved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber Faces Federal Inquiry Over Use of Greyball Tool to Evade Authorities", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber is the subject of a United States Department of Justice inquiry over a program that it used to deceive regulators who were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service.The inquiry concerns Uber\u2019s use of a software tool called Greyball, which the company developed in part to aid entrance into new markets where its service was not permitted. The tool allowed Uber to deploy what was essentially a fake version of its app to evade law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service.The federal inquiry was disclosed in a transportation audit conducted by the City of Portland, Ore., published last week. In the audit, Portland officials said they had been notified by the United States attorney\u2019s office for the Northern District of California about the existence of the inquiry. The City of Portland said it was cooperating with the inquiry.Press officers for Uber and the United States attorney\u2019s office, as well as the City of Portland, declined to comment on Thursday.The company is in the midst of an internal investigation into its workplace culture, with a report on the findings expected at the end of this month. Mr. Kalanick has said he needs help with his leadership of the company and is searching for a chief operating officer to join Uber.Greyball was part of a larger program at Uber known as VTOS \u2014 short for Violation of Terms of Service \u2014 which was used in the United States and in countries including Brazil, South Korea and France. The program began as early as 2014, and Uber has argued it had legitimate uses, such as concealing the locations of drivers from competitors or would-be attackers.But officials are concerned with the program\u2019s use in evading law enforcement personnel. After using a series of techniques to identify and tag officials, Uber would turn to the Greyball tool to show a false version of its app to officers who tried to hail an Uber car using their smartphones.Greyball was approved by Uber\u2019s legal team, though some inside the company had qualms about it.Uber made a particular effort to deploy the tool in cities where it faced opposition from local regulators or rival taxi and transportation companies. One of those cities was Portland. The Times reported that Uber used the Greyball tool there in late 2014, when the company began service without permission from city regulators.After the use of Greyball was revealed, the mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, said in a statement at the time, \u201cI am very concerned that Uber may have purposefully worked to thwart the city\u2019s job to protect the public.\u201dIn a letter dated April 21 to the City of Portland, which was included in the audit, Uber said it had not used the Greyball tool in the city after April 2015, when Portland officials put in place a set of regulations and a pilot program for ride-hailing companies.An earlier version of this article misstated when the City of Portland published a transportation audit. It was published last week, not this week.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York and Rebecca R. Ruiz from Washington.Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaac.Advertisement"}

In the last few months, journalists, academics, technology experts, civic-minded foundations and well-intentioned politicos have devoted decades of collective brain hours to an all-hands effort to stanch the conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods roiling our democracy.But as the Seth Rich story shows, we\u2019re going to need a bigger algorithm.You can see the partisan appeal. If you don\u2019t want to believe American intelligence assessments that the Russians were behind the breach \u2014 supposedly to help the electoral prospects of President Trump \u2014 and if you don\u2019t like all the news about the investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, well, there\u2019s an alternative fact set to grab onto: Mr. Rich did it and paid for it with his life.The problem, of course, is that there\u2019s no real evidence for the notion.The Rich story has been kicking around since July, but flared anew last week, when FoxNews.com and the Fox affiliate in Washington, WTTG, quoted an investigator working with the Rich family as saying that Mr. Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks before his death.Still, the story lived on as a meme flowing through conservative media, which seemed to relish the chance to change the subject from the torrent of news spilling forth last week on the president\u2019s Russia troubles.But if you thought that would chasten people pushing the story and lead them to drop it, think again.Like water, conspiracy theories find their own level. So, where Fox News issued its retraction, The International Business Times put up a Facebook post that carried the headline, \u201cBREAKING: Kim Dotcom claims he has evidence that proves murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was involved in the WikiLeaks hack.\u201dSo what is new is the speed of the internet and the especially fertile soil of our angry political divide.Take heart, there are optimists. Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family (who is open about his work as a liberal political consultant), said in an interview that the developments of this week, capped by Fox News\u2019s retraction, \u201cshould not just serve as a cautionary tale but it should also serve as a message that in the end, truth does prevail. But we need to be vigilant.\u201d\u201cAll the viral rumors, conspiracy theories and hoaxes were a wake-up call for at least some people, and certainly some institutions that are now moving to address this, including news organizations, social media organizations and educational institutions,\u201d he told me.But no matter what the media ecosystem does to stop uncorroborated conspiracies and false information, they will continue to live on as long as there are people eager to spread it and viewers and readers eager to believe it.

Uber, for its part, sees its future as dependent on self-driving cars.Mr. Levandowski asserted his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination when he was ordered by a federal judge to hand over evidence and testimony.Uber had pressured him to cooperate, but after he missed an internal deadline to hand over information, the company fired him.It had little choice, legal analysts said: Uber risked being tarnished if it continued to stand by him.But Mr. Levandowski could now become a witness against Uber if he were to claim, for example, that executives looked the other way while he used proprietary information from a rival to advance Uber\u2019s self-driving efforts.If Lael Brainard is ready to raise rates, there is probably little opposition within the Federal Reserve.Her comments indicated that the Fed was willing to shrug off a little bad data, including data indicating that inflation is still below the level desired by the Fed.The sluggishness of inflation has been a mystery and a \u201csource of concern,\u201d she said, but added that the economy was strong enough to warrant a rate increase.The caveat: Ms. Brainard would reconsider the wisdom of additional rate increases if there were no evidence of stronger inflation.Advertisement"}

The deal calls for the companies to work together to bring autonomous vehicle technology into the mainstream through pilot projects and product development efforts, these people said.The deal was confirmed by Lyft and Waymo.\u201cWaymo holds today\u2019s best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world\u2019s best transportation,\u201d a Lyft spokeswoman said in a statement.A Waymo spokesman said, \u201cLyft\u2019s vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology reach more people, in more places.\u201dThe partnership highlights the fluid nature of relationships in the self-driving-car sector. From technology companies to automakers to firms that manufacture components, dozens of players are angling for a slice of an autonomous vehicle market that many believe will ultimately be a multibillion-dollar industry. To gain an edge and outmuscle rivals, many of these players are forming alliances \u2014 and sometimes shifting them.Lyft is a distant No. 2 to Uber among ride-hailing services in the United States, and the two companies are bitter rivals. Waymo is also competing fiercely with Uber in the creation of technology for autonomous cars and is embroiled in a lawsuit over what it says is Uber\u2019s use of stolen Waymo trade secrets to develop such technology.Details about the deal between Waymo and Lyft were scant. The companies declined to comment on what types of products would be brought to market as a result of it or when the public might see the fruits of the collaboration.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.The seeds of the partnership between Waymo and Lyft were planted in discussions last summer, the two people familiar with the deal said. The talks involved Logan Green and John Zimmer, the founders and leaders of Lyft, and John Krafcik, the chief executive of Waymo. The idea of a deal evolved as the executives visited each other\u2019s campuses in the ensuing months.Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The case could affect the speed at which Uber\u2019s self-driving efforts come to market.

They arrived on November 8, Election Day, and were driven to their new homes around 10 p.m., unaware that Donald J. Trump had won the election and that they had just landed in a very different country.The brothers, Jamil and Ammar, their wives, Oulah and Raghida, and children began the hard work of finding jobs, schools and support in their new country. Months later, their efforts were suddenly brought to a halt. An anonymous caller left a message for Ammar threatening to \u201cchop off\u201d his head and kill his family unless they left the country. For good measure, the caller confirmed the address: He knew where they lived.Every few weeks, the writer, Jake Halpern spends hours with the families in their homes in New England (we have deliberately kept their locations secret and given the families pseudonyms for privacy reasons), reporting out their experiences. Jake then confirms the details with translators, sponsors, police and other people in contact with the families.

So he resorts to tactics as blatant and public as Gus\u2019s are subtle and invisible. He and his henchmen walk straight into Los Pollos Hermanos and hold the store\u2019s employees in a kind of captivity until the boss shows up.The scene is filled with delightful menace, enlivened by Margolis\u2019s scene-shredding approach to Hector\u2019s toxic personal habits, which include picking dog poo off his shoes and onto Gus\u2019s desk.Think for a moment about the self-control on display in the moment that Gus finds Hector puffing nonchalantly in his office. It\u2019s not only that Hector might have just blown Gus\u2019s carefully devised cover as a civic-minded entrepreneur \u2014 who is glad-handing the fire department right as his flagship store is being invaded. Hector is also the man who, years earlier, shot Max Arciniega, Gus\u2019s original Pollos Hermanos partner and, by all accounts, the only man that Gus ever loved. (At minimum, we\u2019ve never seen him with anyone else.)We understand what Gus means when he tells Mike that a bullet to Hector\u2019s head would not result in a sufficiently painful death. One of many blanks yet to be filled in this yarn is how, exactly, Hector winds up mute and in a wheelchair, speaking only by means of a bell he rings with one finger. It seems obvious now that Gus will have a decisive hand in whatever lands Hector in that terrible condition.At the same time, Round 27 of the Jimmy vs. Chuck battle royale finds Jimmy back to his underhanded ways. He has called in a favor, asking Mike to show up at Chuck\u2019s house as a handyman to fix the door Jimmy busted. And thus the list of Mike\u2019s skills grows longer, although the main point of his visit has nothing to do with the power tools he uses to keep Chuck at bay. He\u2019s there to take a bunch of photographs, which he later shows to Jimmy.What is the point of this illicit photographing exercise? Let\u2019s tally up what we know. First, the pictures will be somehow be involved with a hearing to determine whether Jimmy should be disbarred. Second, the shot that tickles Jimmy the most is the one of a gas lantern sitting on top of a stack of newspapers. (\u201cThat tells the whole story,\u201d he tells Mike, while they eat together at a diner.) Third, in addition to photos, Mike also hands over a piece of paper. We learn nothing about it, other than that it came from Chuck\u2019s address book, or from very near it.And that\u2019s it, for now.I was glad to see Kim offering some invaluable aid during this caper. I was worried that she was going to spend this season as a moral compass, which is just no fun for anyone, especially viewers. I hope she is just getting warmed up. Bring on wicked Kim!Less impressive to me was the moment in the opening scene when Don Eladio tells Hector that he appears jealous of all the money produced by Gus. As the maxim has it, great writers show, they don\u2019t tell. It was blatantly obvious that Hector\u2019s feelings were hurt. Don Eladio\u2019s line jumped out as exactly the sort of thing that characters in \u201cSaul\u201d don\u2019t say because \u201cSaul\u201d writers know they don\u2019t need to say it.We know who the ultimate winners will be in the coming contests. (Take a bow, Jimmy and Gus.) We just don\u2019t know how they will win, nor do we know what those victories will cost them. I\u2019m eager to find out.Along the way, we\u2019ll learn the point of Mike\u2019s turn as the Ansel Adams of indoor photography, to paraphrase Jimmy. I\u2019m stumped, which is exactly what I am supposed to be, it seems. When Kim says \u201cBingo\u201d near the end of this episode, we know that Chuck has walked into a trap of some kind. We also know that Jimmy is ultimately not disbarred, since he lives to practice law, albeit under a different name.Other than that, we are guessing. And guessing is fun, so if you\u2019re so inclined, provide a theory in the comments section.Nice to fix something, for a change.Advertisement"}

(About 125 people stay on to keep the station running through the long, dark Antarctic winter.)McMurdo was an eight-hour flight south from New Zealand on a military cargo plane. We left the lush greenery of South Island and touched down on the Ross Ice Shelf, a flat plain of floating ice extending to the horizon.Four of us made the trip: Graham Roberts oversees virtual-reality projects at The Times; Evan Grothjan has filmed Times VR projects on five continents; Justin Gillis is a climate reporter; and I am the graphics editor for the Science desk.We were confined to the station for the first few days, until we completed our orientation and field safety training. A mountaineer in a \u201cGut moose?\u201d T-shirt showed new arrivals how to secure a tent on snow, drill an ice anchor, prime a camp stove and recognize hypothermia.(One survival takeaway: If you\u2019re ever stuck in a tent in remote Antarctica, don\u2019t bother using your signal mirror for signaling. There\u2019s probably nobody on the horizon to see your flashes, anyway. The best the mirror can do is keep you distracted by providing something interesting to look at: yourself.)After training, we were allowed to leave the relative safety of the station and film ice in all its forms: the seasonal sea ice covering McMurdo Sound, the pressure ridges dotted with Weddell seals and their weaning pups, the Texas-size floating pancake of the Ross Ice Shelf, a cascading edge of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and more glaciers than we could count or name.Four virtual-reality films take you on, above and below the Antarctic ice.Several McMurdo veterans told us that we saw more of Antarctica in two weeks than most scientists see in five years. We took that in part as a caution. All the logistics, fuel, resources and time devoted to us could have been spent elsewhere, on science. But we also took it as a challenge to recreate some part of our Antarctic experience and share it with our viewers, in virtual reality.Our VR camera equipment is the best available, but not well suited for freezing temperatures, glacial winds, volcanic dust and military aircraft. We packed at least two of everything, including prototype cameras we used to take the first virtual-reality stereo footage ever shot in Antarctica.Our main camera was a ring of 16 GoPros. Those cameras share a power source \u2014 a 25-pound block of lithium batteries that makes airplane security cringe and is awkward to lug across ice \u2014 but they don\u2019t share memory, so Evan had to keep track of multiple sets of 16 tiny memory cards, swapping them out barehanded in the freezing temperatures whenever problems arose.Each of the 16 cameras captured a small part of the scene, but stitching the shots into a 360-degree stereo image required the huge computing power of Google\u2019s cloud. McMurdo\u2019s internet connection was painfully slow and shared by 900 people, so uploading footage was impossible. We had to shoot every scene without knowing how it would look when we got back to New York.We packed hand warmers around our cameras to squeeze a few extra minutes from the batteries, which drain more rapidly in the cold. We learned never to change lenses in the field, because McMurdo\u2019s volcanic dust gets everywhere.And one morning we were so focused on rigging a gyroscope-stabilized pole to film inside a helicopter that we forgot to bring our normal tripod. Evan became a human camera stand, striking a yoga pose and trying not to shiver in a stiff wind blowing at 25 degrees below zero.McMurdo Station is the largest outpost in Antarctica and is run by the National Science Foundation. We visited on a media grant, which encourages reporting on science in Antarctica. And we worked closely with the Rosetta project, a collaboration of Columbia University and other institutions to map the structure of the Ross Ice Shelf.Weather is the great unknown, and the great breaker of schedules. Our first week was spectacular \u2014 sunny and hovering at a balmy 20 degrees at McMurdo, which allowed us to film more locations than we thought would be possible. But our planned flight to the South Pole was scrubbed several times when the weather turned against us. In our final try, we circled the pole five times in heavy clouds before the flight crew abandoned the effort to land and returned to McMurdo. Though we never set foot on or filmed at the pole, we circumnavigated the world five times in the attempt.After two weeks in Antarctica, it was time to leave. We\u2019d been warned that returning to New Zealand would be strange: When you step off the plane you can smell the humidity. Your phone comes to life after weeks of silence and brings with it the distractions and interruptions of the outside world.Advertisement"}

For Lyft, the deal is a way to enter the autonomous driving industry.The agreement has competitive implications for Uber, especially as the ride-hailing firm is mired in a lawsuit about accusations of intellectual property theft from Waymo.For example, Citibank won a contract last month to handle a $3 billion bond offering from Bank of China, which aims to use the money to open branches across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa.A big hurdle to winning bids though, is China\u2019s preference for its own companies.One way for American companies to increase their chances would be to increase manufacturing in China, not in the United States, to satisfy Beijing\u2019s requirements that some of the work be done locally.James Zimmerman, a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, is skeptical that non-Chinese companies can benefit from the spending.\u201cTell us what we are going to get out of this,\u201d he said, referring to the West. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonstarter if it\u2019s all about bringing Chinese goods to Europe, or if it\u2019s all one way.\u201dThe International Court of Arbitration, operated by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, has the power to adjudicate disagreements under the terms of the companies\u2019 partnership.Western Digital contends that Toshiba cannot sell the semiconductor business without the American company\u2019s consent, but Toshiba has already solicited other bids.Western Digital is believed to have made an offer for the Toshiba unit \u2014 whose value has been estimated at around $20 billion \u2014 though it has declined to say whether that is the case.\u201cHow the infections spread across Asia, then Europe overnight, will be telling for businesses here in the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Our A.I. President", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byThe StoneIt is hard to imagine a more scathing indictment of our ability to read another\u2019s thoughts and intentions than our inability to predict Donald Trump\u2019s next move. From the gross pre-election misjudgments to postelection bafflement, the best pundits are at a loss to accurately anticipate his response to matters like North Korean military aggressiveness or his moment-by-moment political gyrations and opinion reversals. Labeling Trump a narcissist, psychopath, megalomaniac or attention-impaired, or all of the above, might feel explanatory, but even when armed with the best psychoanalytic insights, we have no idea what he will do when presented with a new or unforeseen circumstance.If conventional psychology isn\u2019t up to the task, perhaps we should step back and consider a tantalizing sci-fi alternative \u2014 that Trump doesn\u2019t operate within conventional human cognitive constraints, but rather is a new life form, a rudimentary artificial intelligence-based learning machine. When we strip away all moral, ethical and ideological considerations from his decisions and see them strictly in the light of machine learning, his behavior makes perfect sense.Consider how deep learning occurs in neural networks such as Google\u2019s Deep Mind or IBM\u2019s Deep Blue and Watson. In the beginning, each network analyzes a number of previously recorded games, and then, through trial and error, the network tests out various strategies. Connections for winning moves are enhanced; losing connections are pruned away. The network has no idea what it is doing or why one play is better than another. It isn\u2019t saddled with any confounding principles such as what constitutes socially acceptable or unacceptable behavior or which decisions might result in negative downstream consequences.Now up the stakes; instead of Go, Jeopardy, backgammon, poker and chess domination, ask a neural network to figure out the optimal strategy for the biggest game in town \u2014 the United States presidency. In this hypothetical, let\u2019s input and analyze all available written and spoken word \u2014 from mainstream media commentary to the most obscure one-off crank pamphlets. After running simulations of various hypotheses, the network will serve up its suggestions. It might show Trump which areas of the country are most likely to respond to personal appearances, which rallies and town hall meetings will generate the greatest photo op and TV coverage, and which publicly manifest personality traits will garner the most votes. If it determines that outrage is the only road to the presidency, it will tell Trump when and where his opinions must be scandalous and offensively polarizing.Further imagine that the Trump A.I. machine determines that the opinions most likely to get him elected have slim chances of being carried out once he is president. To the extent that traditional politicians are embarrassed by flip-flops or bound by ethical and moral values or both, they are likely to display a degree of restraint and hedging of controversial positions. Winning at any cost is at least partially balanced by underlying principles. Not so for a neural network. There is no cringe factor, no sense of anticipated embarrassment or humiliation with seemingly random changes of mind. There is no concern with subsequent disclosures of misrepresentations, falsifications and outright lies. As the U.C.L.A. Bruins football coach Henry Sanders, known as Red, once said, \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything; it\u2019s the only thing.\u201dFollowing the successful election, it chews on new data. When it recognizes that Obamacare won\u2019t be easily repealed or replaced, that token intervention in Syria can\u2019t be avoided, that NATO is a necessity and that pulling out of the Paris climate accord may create worldwide resentment, it has no qualms about changing policies and priorities. From an A.I. vantage point, the absence of a coherent agenda is entirely understandable. For example, a consistent long-term foreign policy requires a steadfastness contrary to a learning machine\u2019s constant upgrading in response to new data.A caveat to media gurus, historians and policy wonks: As there are no lines of reasoning driving the network\u2019s actions, it is not possible to reverse engineer the network to reveal the \u201cwhy\u201d of any decision. Asking why a network chose a particular action is like asking why Amazon might recommend James Ellroy and Elmore Leonard novels to someone who has just purchased \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d There is no underlying understanding of the nature of the books; the association is strictly a matter of analyzing Amazon\u2019s click and purchase data. Without explanatory reasoning driving decision making, counterarguments become irrelevant. The most cogent reasons that solar power is preferable to burning coal will fall on deaf circuits as long as the Trump network continues to determine that Trump is doing a great job.To know how this network assesses his performance, we need to know what basic positive and negative values Trump has inputted, and how they might compete with one another to determine whether or not he\u2019s succeeding. It is easy to come up with a list of likely motivating goals such as power, money, brand-name recognition, public praise, vindication, retribution and idolization. As recent history has shown us, these goals seem to vary from moment to moment. Unfortunately, a constantly shifting definition of what constitutes \u201cwinning\u201d further increases our inability to predict his behavior.As armchair psychologists, we have the gut feeling that with enough information and psychological savvy, we can figure out what makes Trump tick. Unfortunately there is no supporting evidence for this wishful thinking. Once we accept that Donald Trump represents a black-box, first-generation artificial-intelligence president driven solely by self-selected data and widely fluctuating criteria of success, we can get down to the really hard question confronting our collective future: Is there a way to affect changes in a machine devoid of the common features that bind humanity?An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a popular crime novelist. He is James Ellroy, not Elroy.Advertisement"}

Amorosa, said in an email that his client would \u201cplead not guilty and defend himself against the charges.\u201d Both charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.She was called a \u201ctotal degenerate\u201d and \u201cstupid, stupid lady\u201d in emails, according to the complaint. She later received a call from a man who identified himself as a police officer and said that OpticsFast had filed a \u201ccivil harassment suit\u201d against her.Another customer, identified in the complaint as Victim-8, clicked on an OpticsFast link that generated a shipping label to mail in glasses for repair. When he decided against using the label and refused to pay for it, OpticsFast sent him hundreds of emails, including 456 in a single day. Hundreds of them had \u201cI WIN!!!\u201d in the subject line.Mr. Borker appears to have toned down his previous approach, according to the complaint. None of the victims identified by the government, nor any of the dozens of OpticsFast customers who posted complaints on Yelp, mentioned physical threats.A call to OpticsFast in March, as complaints on Yelp piled up, was answered by a woman who said she had never heard of Vitaly Borker. Asked where the company was based, she snapped \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cClearly, I don\u2019t want to pay for this upgrade,\u201d he wrote, in what by his standards qualified as a charm offensive. \u201cPlease give me money.\u201dThe government\u2019s complaint also states that Mr. Borker recently posted a photo collage on his Facebook page showing him atop an enormous pile of eyeglasses. Next to the photos was what sounded like a job posting.\u201cI am looking for a responsible fast paced person who can assist me at my Brighton Beach office doing various projects for my eye wear e-Commerce business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cProject one will be to help me sort this mess.\u201dMr. Borker, a 41-year-old immigrant from Ukraine, stands about 6 feet 5 inches tall. In 2010, when he was terrifying customers of DecorMyEye, which was based in Brooklyn, there was a method to his noxious technique: He believed that Google\u2019s search algorithm could not distinguish between positive and negative feedback. The more people griped about his company, his theory went, the more prominently his site appeared in Google search results.In essence, Mr. Borker believed that the internet allowed him to turn upside down long-cherished verities of commerce, most notably that treating customers well enhances one\u2019s bottom line. Using aliases such as Stanley Bolds and Tony Russo, he threatened to chop off the legs of one customer. He threatened to rape another. He wrote a letter to the office of yet another in which he said the customer was gay and sold drugs.At his sentencing, in 2012, Mr. Borker told Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan, \u201cAs I stand before you today, I am genuinely and deeply sorry for the threats that I made. To say that I am ashamed of myself is an understatement.\u201dBut the sense of remorse may have been short lived. There were complaints about OpticsFast while Mr. Borker was still imprisoned. The volume of online groans only seemed to increase when he was freed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Taking Tougher Stance in Fraternity Hazing Deaths", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byAfter downing a dangerous amount of alcohol and suffering severe internal injuries during a fraternity hazing, a 19-year-old college sophomore died. Not long ago, the story might have ended there, except for some hand-wringing and litigation.\u201cGo back a generation or two, and hazing was accepted conduct, part of the fraternity experience, part of the football experience,\u201d said David LaBahn, president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, a national group that offers training for prosecutors. \u201cNow it\u2019s no longer \u2018boys will be boys, and why is the prosecutor getting involved in this?\u2019 I think there is much more acceptance out there that this is unlawful behavior.\u201dWhat is less clear is how much of a difference their actions make.\u201cThis is a huge challenge because we don\u2019t own the houses, we don\u2019t own the property, we aren\u2019t the national\u201d organization governing fraternities, Penn State\u2019s president, Eric Barron, said Monday in an interview.Dr. Barron said university presidents around the country had been expanding educational programs to discourage drinking, creating stronger rules and, when all else failed, revoking fraternity charters. But fraternities have found creative ways to avoid new restrictions, he said; some whose charters have been revoked have simply \u201ccreated underground organizations and just changed their names.\u201dDouglas E. Fierberg, a lawyer who specializes in suing fraternities and universities, said that while a few colleges had changed, most were unwilling to alienate alumni donors who belonged to fraternities.\u201cThe central problem is that in a fraternity house, kids, most of whom cannot legally drink, are in charge of getting and serving alcohol,\u201d he said.He noted that Mr. Piazza was left unconscious for hours before anyone sought help. \u201cThat would not have happened in an on-campus dorm,\u201d Mr. Fierberg said.Experts say the increase in prosecutions stems not only from a shift in attitudes but also from the ubiquity of electronic evidence. Security cameras in the fraternity house provided crucial information about Mr. Piazza\u2019s last hours, and in other instances, text messages and Google searches have contributed to criminal cases.The Penn State prosecution is one of the largest ever brought in a fraternity misconduct case, and it is unusual in that eight defendants face felony counts.Despite the adverse publicity, Penn State remains a coveted destination, with applications up about 30 percent from before the Sandusky case broke.The parents of two former Penn State students, Adam and Denise Lipson, say that they warned administrators in 2014 and 2015 of fraternity hazing that included coercing first-year students to drink to excess, but that their concerns were ignored. Dismayed by that atmosphere, their sons transferred to other universities, where they found less emphasis on alcohol and less pressure to drink.\u201cOur sons are not prudes, they\u2019re not anti-frat, they\u2019re not anti-alcohol, but they couldn\u2019t believe how far it went,\u201d Ms. Lipson said. \u201cThere was this underlying acceptance of it.\u201dDr. Barron said concerns about drinking had been taken seriously for some time.While some fraternity houses are known trouble spots, Dr. Barron said, Beta Theta Pi was considered a model.Mr. Fierberg was skeptical. \u201cThe Greeks will be around long after everyone has turned their attention elsewhere,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Protect Your Privacy as More Apps Harvest Your Data", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byIn the real world, your personal life is a private space. But in tech, your personal data is a ripe resource for businesses to harvest in their own interests.In addition, Uber was involved in some deception of its own: It participated in fingerprinting, a process in which iPhones were tagged with permanent identities that were detectable even after the Uber app was erased from the devices. The practice violated Apple\u2019s terms of service, which could have resulted in Uber\u2019s being banned from the App Store. Uber eventually revised the app to remove the fingerprinting code.For consumers, giving up some data has become part of the trade-off of receiving compelling, personalized services. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be caught by surprise. Here are some tips from privacy experts on protecting yourself from tricky data collection.When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. To avoid a privacy pitfall like the one involving Unroll.me, start perusing the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, opt against using the service.\u201cPeople quickly run into the challenge that there\u2019s so much legalese that it\u2019s up to you to envision how your data may be used,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. Still, it\u2019s better than reading nothing.For many companies, the path to monetization is anonymized, aggregated user data. That means while your name will not be attached to the information, your age, gender, shopping activities and location will all be rolled up with other users\u2019 data. Altogether, that becomes incredibly valuable information to many retailers looking for market research.So before subscribing to a free app or online tool, take a moment to do a web search for the company\u2019s business model.It\u2019s worthwhile to periodically check your primary online accounts, like Facebook, Twitter or Google, to see which apps are hooked into them. Chances are you have used those accounts to quickly sign up for a web tool or app. The ones you never use may still be leeching off your personal data, so you should disable them.On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to the account. On your Google account page, you can find a similar apps list labeled \u201cConnected apps & sites.\u201d And on Twitter, go to the Apps page under \u201cSettings and privacy.\u201d Ms. Sandvik recommended pruning apps that you don\u2019t recognize or have not used in the last six months. Once you have narrowed down the list, take a deeper dive on the ones that remain and read up on how they use your personal data. If their data-sharing practices sound offensive, remove the apps.Do this audit at least once a year: The number of connected apps on your online accounts can pile up over time. On my neglected Facebook account, for example, I had 82 connected apps. After removing many unused or defunct apps, like LivingSocial, Words With Friends and Draw Something, I had 32 left.Deleting your app from your phone or computer often isn\u2019t enough. You\u2019ll remove data from the device itself, but not from the company\u2019s servers.Even after doing that, you will have to reconcile with the idea that the company will probably hold on to the information you have already shared.

{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes at Orchard Platform, a Struggle to Innovate", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byOn a warm morning early last year, a start-up founder named Matt Burton addressed a group of 175 investors and executives at the sleek glass IAC building in Chelsea.Mr. Burton described how his company, Orchard Platform, already a provider of loan data to financial institutions, would soon unveil its own trading platform for loans.It had all the earmarks of a successful plan. Mr. Burton and the other Orchard founders had worked at an online ad exchange called Admeld, sold to Google for $400 million. Venture capital firms and Wall Street heavyweights including John Mack and Vikram Pandit had invested in Orchard. And Lending Club, the leading start-up offering online loans, had not yet been engulfed in scandal.\u201cWe\u2019re launching a full marketplace from scratch,\u201d Mr. Burton said a few months later, at Orchard\u2019s Flatiron district office, and we \u201chope everyone shows up.\u201dBut they didn\u2019t.More than a year after Mr. Burton revealed his big plans, Orchard has completed just a scattering of transactions. Over that time, it burned through more than $5 million in legal fees and other expenses. A regulatory snarl over whether the loans would be treated as securities caused delays. Major lending platforms were reluctant to participate. And the market for loans was thrust into upheaval by a wave of defaults and a scandal that broke last May at Lending Club.Next month, hoping to add momentum, Orchard plans to unveil a scaled-back version of the platform, eight months later than first planned.But regardless of the company\u2019s fate, its struggles thus far reveal just how hard it can be for a new entrant \u2014 even one with successful founders, a promising service and big-name investors \u2014 to break into a highly regulated industry.In a series of interviews over the last 15 months, Mr. Burton and other Orchard employees offered an unusual inside look at a project that has not gone as envisioned, but that they believe still holds promise \u2014 especially in a Trump era of potentially lighter financial regulation.\u201cIn general, it has been a humbling process going through it,\u201d Mr. Burton acknowledged last week. \u201cWe have definitely learned a ton. When you\u2019re operating in a new space in fintech, it\u2019s hard.\u201dWhen Orchard was founded in 2013, marketplace lending was just taking off. Unlike banks \u2014 which take deposits, make loans and hold capital to absorb loan losses \u2014 marketplace lenders match investors and borrowers directly, with the investors taking the risk of losses in exchange for higher interest rates.Orchard began by offering institutional investors an automated service to analyze the loans and buy them from different online lenders. But its long-term plan always included creation of what Mr. Burton calls a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d trading platform.\u201cWhat got us excited was seeing what happened in online advertising,\u201d said Dan Ciporin, whose Canaan Partners invested in Lending Club and Orchard. In that realm, he said, access to data drove a shift away from ads being sold via \u201cgolf-course relationships.\u201d Mr. Burton\u2019s pitch: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do the same thing in financial services?\u201dBut building an auction-style exchange for loans proved to be significantly more complex than building a marketplace for online ads.As Matt Harris, a start-up investor at Bain Capital Ventures, put it, \u201cBuilding a trading venue and attracting liquidity is somewhere between difficult and impossible.\u201d He still believes Orchard can get there eventually.Mr. Burton, 32, is 6 feet 4 inches, thin and resolutely cheerful. He sometimes takes his miniature Australian shepherd dog, Chico, to the office. At his desk is the 1972 book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance.\u201dSeeking financial expertise, Orchard recruited a few Wall Street veterans from Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns. In late spring of last year, Mr. Burton had more than a dozen roadshow meetings with executives from the largest loan platforms, including Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace and Social Finance.He hoped to charge them monthly fees of $2,500 to $5,000 to participate. Orchard also offered them the ability to be its \u201cdata partners,\u201d so Orchard could standardize their data for trading purposes \u2014 which Mr. Burton called \u201cthe big heavy lift.\u201dStandardizing data was daunting because each loan platform had its own legal and data formats, such as different definitions of debt-to-income, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, which tracks alternative lending.Orchard also enlisted the help of Meredith Cross, a lawyer at WilmerHale and the former head of corporate finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, as it met with Wall Street regulators.But in July, S.E.C. officials told Orchard that they would consider loans being traded as securities, potentially imposing a tougher level of oversight. That made some lenders nervous about participating. Some lenders were also concerned about exposing investors they had cultivated to loans from competitors.\u201cWe do not have a current need for a trading platform,\u201d said Ryan Rosett, a chief executive of Credibly, which offers small-business loans. \u201cOur capital markets team has the ability to sell our loans directly to a pool of institutional investors.\u201dBy late July, 10 of the 30 top lenders signaled they could not participate quickly enough to meet a planned Oct. 15 platform debut. Among them was Lending Club, even though its board had three Orchard investors, including Mr. Mack and Mr. Ciporin.Orchard was also fighting a separate headwind. The broader market for online loans was being buffeted by higher consumer loan defaults and investor fears. Some online lenders cut staff members, and others shut down as loan growth dried up.In late September, Orchard postponed the unveiling of the trading platform, newly named \u201cOrchard X,\u201d to November from October. A few weeks later, its new goal became \u201cjust to do some trades of any size\u201d by year-end, one Orchard staff member said. But Orchard X\u2019s regulatory approvals were delayed until January.In December, Mr. Burton expressed frustration at the difficulties. As Orchard X struggled to get going, he said, legal documents for trades had \u201cballooned to 150 pages from a 20-page contract,\u201d leaving him exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m a tech guy!\u201d he said.As it moves forward, Orchard has played down the regulatory issue, proceeding without an explicit formal S.E.C. ruling on whether the loans are securities. It is a potentially risky move, but one the company believes will work in part because it has dropped its goal of legal standardization, cutting the need for lending platforms to agree on regulation issues. The S.E.C. declined to comment.In January, Orchard X arranged its first sale of about $30 million in loans from an ailing platform, a small-business lender called CAN Capital. The auction took a lengthy four weeks to complete. But Orchard X did receive a fee of 0.5 percent of the sale price.It has since provided data for a smaller loan sale for another lender, Credibility Capital, and signed up with a dozen other lenders to broker loan auctions as well as private placements and two other types of transactions \u2014 \u201cforward flow\u201d agreements and credit facilities \u2014 in which investors provide funds to lenders for future loans.Although Orchard X would receive commissions for all such sales, it would not clear and settle the auctions like an exchange.Looking back, Mr. Burton said on April 4, Orchard should not have tried to persuade lenders to join the trading platform all at once. Having raised $30 million in 2015, Orchard plans to announce next month that it has raised an additional $20 million or more and to formally roll out its revised Orchard X transaction platform.Mr. Ciporin, the venture investor, is convinced that Orchard X will someday \u201cdo transactions instantaneously around any loan.\u201d And while acknowledging that Orchard \u201cdidn\u2019t initially provide enough time for an evolutionary process,\u201d he remained optimistic.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody sees this as a major blow,\u201d he added. \u201cI would put it in the category of a minor hiccup.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "ESPN Is Betting on Big Personalities to Restore Its Fortunes", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byAnd in a world where viewers can catch a must-see play on Facebook or stream an entire football game on Twitter, who needs a traditional highlight show like \u201cSportsCenter\u201d that focuses on highlights and updates like player injuries and roster moves?\u201cWe at ESPN are optimists,\u201d John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, said on Tuesday at the network\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers. \u201cOf course, the current environment forces us to be realists as well as optimists.\u201dSo ESPN is shaking things up.The theme was a bet on the power of the network\u2019s personalities. ESPN formally announced several new shows \u2014 including a three-hour morning block with the longtime ESPN host Mike Greenberg, and one that will feature the commentators Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre. In an apparent effort to draw viewers to \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d its crown jewel since 1979, ESPN has retooled the show, tying time slots to specific anchors, including Kenny Mayne, one of the network\u2019s best-known personalities. The show will not air at all from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. on ESPN\u2019s main channel.The network has also signed new deals with other ESPN veterans, including Sage Steele and Hannah Storm, who will have a new role that includes hosting prime-time specials. Ms. Steele will host a three-hour morning version of \u201cSportsCenter\u201d on ESPN2.In an effort to meet viewers on their various devices, the network announced SportsCenter Right Now, short news updates online and twice hourly on ESPN during the day. During the presentation, Mr. Skipper highlighted ESPN\u2019s inclusion in television packages offered by the likes of Sling TV and Hulu.ESPN\u2019s efforts to adapt to the digital age are indicative of broader challenges facing cable television. Cord-cutting has accelerated sharply in the last quarter, with traditional cable and satellite providers losing 732,000 subscribers compared with a loss of 102,000 in the same period a year ago, according to research by Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. Lower-priced \u201cskinny\u201d online packages of channels have not made up the slack.National television advertising fell 1 percent in the last quarter, the most in nearly two years.The shifting media landscape has been particularly hard on ESPN. The network has dropped subscribers in the last several years even as sports programming rights have become more expensive. ESPN, for instance, recently paid $12 billion for a nine-year deal with the N.B.A.Disney, ESPN\u2019s parent company, has staked some hope on an ESPN-branded subscription streaming service that it plans to introduce by the end of the year. But at least initially, the service will mostly stream sporting events for which ESPN owns the programming rights but does not televise, like certain tennis matches, cricket matches and various college sports.Wall Street, however, has looked mostly askance at Disney\u2019s plans for ESPN. During the conference call, analysts bombarded Mr. Iger with questions about the network. The company\u2019s share price is down 7 percent since the last week in April, mirroring an industrywide decline that was driven by fears of cord-cutting and weak ad sales.At the presentation on Tuesday, ESPN acknowledged its troubles, but did not let them detract from the over-the-top ritual of television\u2019s yearly pitch to advertisers. As they nibbled on breakfast sandwiches and avocado toast, the network paraded stars across the stage at a Broadway theater in Midtown Manhattan. Serena Williams sat for a short interview with Mr. Greenberg to promote his morning studio show that will start next year. Paul Pierce, the former N.B.A. star, appeared (\u201cI\u2019m still pulling for the Celtics,\u201d he said), as did many of the network\u2019s biggest names, including Scott Van Pelt, Suzy Kolber, Jon Gruden and Mr. Mayne.Absent, of course, was the talent the network laid off last month, including the former N.F.L. players Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, the former baseball general manager Jim Bowden, and the longtime N.F.L. reporter Ed Werder. Mr. Skipper was not available to talk to reporters after the presentation.But while the network threw out the occasional statistic \u2014 Mr. Skipper said ESPN\u2019s prime-time audience was up 15 percent in the first quarter and digital products reached more than 100 million people \u2014 the program lacked the torrent of sliced-and-diced numbers that often invade such presentations.ESPN was, for the most part, in sell mode, at times poking fun at the notion that television advertising was outdated.\u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor for the strength of cable,\u201d he said, as he freed himself. \u201cLook at it that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spotify Said to Lean Toward Direct Listing on N.Y.S.E.", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Spotify helped popularize streaming music when downloading, or pirating, songs was mainstream. Now, the service may be veering away from the mainstream in going public.The company is leaning toward a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange possibly late this year, people briefed on the matter said on Friday. Such a listing would bypass the traditional initial public offering process that virtually every other company uses to begin trading on the markets.Direct listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market. Instead of a prospectus many weeks before the market debut, the company files a registration statement soon before a direct listing.It is an exceedingly rare move. But Spotify is betting that its strong name recognition would help make a drawn-out and costly initial offering process unnecessary.Should Spotify list directly, it probably would do so at a valuation of about $13 billion, one of the people who had been briefed said.Spotify has already hired the investment banks Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Allen & Company to help weigh its options, which could still include pursuing an initial offering, the people said.By eschewing an I.P.O., Spotify would signal that it is not going public to raise additional money. It has already raised more than $1.5 billion since its founding in 2006, and was valued at $8.5 billion two years ago.That valuation has risen. Spotify, which has bought back stock from its employees over the years, conducted its most recent round of buybacks from mid-February to mid-March, at a valuation of about $9 billion, one of the people briefed on the matter said. Since the Universal music deal, its value has risen to about $13.3 billion.As of 2015, Spotify recorded $2.2 billion in revenue, but lost $194 million.A direct listing on the Big Board would be a much faster process than an initial offering. And it would free Spotify from restrictions that fall upon those pursuing the traditional route, which include limitations on what executives are permitted to say about future business performance.In a direct listing, underwriters \u2014 who pitch prospective investors on shares in the market debutante and compile the order books for the stock \u2014 are not strictly necessary. And banks would lose out on underwriting fees.But Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Allen could help introduce major mutual funds and other investors to the company and help smooth the process.A direct listing has downsides. Underwriters who manage the sale of shares can help reduce sharp price swings, which is not possible when companies simply open their stock for trading.An earlier version of this article misstated the source of Spotify\u2019s valuation of about $13 billion. It is tied to the company\u2019s trading on secondary stock markets, not an employee stock buyback program.Advertisement"}

Many fines don\u2019t get paid.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to get blood out of a turnip,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg, a Democrat, said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201dAn amnesty program that allowed violators to pay only a fraction of fees owed expired in March. It sought to chip away at California\u2019s $10 billion in unpaid traffic fines.According to a report published this month by the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, an advocacy group, California\u2019s traffic fines are among the highest in the nation.Running a stop sign has a base fine of $35, but once court fees are added it can cost $238, the group calculated.Elisa Della-Piana, the legal director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, also makes a case purely on income grounds.\u201cMany folks see that we have an unfair system,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have two people, each of whom rolled through a stop sign. One mails in a check. The other doesn\u2019t have enough money and experiences license suspension, arrest, job loss. Those are disproportionate consequences.\u201dThe California bill puts the burden on the courts to determine if a violator is \u201cindigent\u201d and if so, assess a lower fine based on income. Passage of the bill will depend on budget negotiations in the coming weeks.Mr. Hertzberg said there was concern that court revenue would decline too much, but he said the ultimate goal was to lower fines for everyone.\u201cThat\u2019s the next step,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these tickets are way, way, way too high.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Over the weekend, anti-Trump protesters in California spoke up by lying down.The style of human-formation, one-word, aerial-photographed protest has been popular since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.The latest stunt, next to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s properties, appeared to be more brazen.It was conducted in a small public park adjacent to the golf course\u2019s clubhouse.

Mr. Levandowski has been close to Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, who wooed the engineer to join the ride-hailing company and purchased Otto, the start-up Mr. Levandowski formed after leaving Google, for nearly $700 million last year.The letter from Uber orders Mr. Levandowski, who oversees most of Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle research efforts, to comply with the court\u2019s investigation into the more than 9.7 gigabytes of data Waymo has accused him of stealing, or else face consequences like losing his job.

{"Headline": "In Computer Attacks, Clues Point to Frequent Culprit: North Korea", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Intelligence officials and private security experts say that new digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world.The indicators are far from conclusive, the researchers warned, and it could be weeks, if not months, before investigators are confident enough in their findings to officially point the finger at Pyongyang\u2019s increasingly bold corps of digital hackers. The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month.Security experts at Symantec, which in the past has accurately identified attacks mounted by the United States, Israel and North Korea, found early versions of the ransomware, called WannaCry, that used tools that were also deployed against Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Bangladesh central bank last year and Polish banks in February. American officials said Monday that they had seen the same similarities.All of those attacks were ultimately linked to North Korea; President Barack Obama formally charged the North in late 2014 with destroying computers at Sony in retaliation for a comedy, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d that envisioned a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader.The computer code used in the ransomware bore some striking similarities to the code used in those three attacks. That code has not been widely used, and has been seen only in attacks by North Korean-linked hackers. Researchers at Google and Kaspersky, a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, confirmed the coding similarities.Those clues alone are not definitive, however. Hackers often borrow and retrofit one another\u2019s attack methods, and government agencies are known to plant \u201cfalse flags\u201d in their code to throw off forensic investigators.\u201cAt this time, all we have is a temporal link,\u201d said Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec who was among the first to identify the Stuxnet worm, the American- and Israeli-led attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and North Korea\u2019s effort to steal millions from the Bangladeshi bank. \u201cWe want to see more coding similarities,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cto give us more confidence.\u2019\u2019The new leads about the source of the attacks came as technology executives raised an alarm about another feature of the attacks: They were based on vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems that were found by the N.S.A. and apparently stolen from it.Over the past few months, it has become clear that the intelligence community\u2019s version of Tomahawks \u2014 the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d the N.S.A. and C.I.A. have spent billions of dollars to develop to break into foreign computers and foil Iranian nuclear programs or North Korean missiles \u2014 are being turned against everyday computer users around the world.\u201cWe have seen vulnerabilities stored by the C.I.A. show up on WikiLeaks,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote, \u201cand now this vulnerability stolen from the N.S.A. has affected customers around the world.\u201dThe N.S.A.\u2019s tools were published last month by a hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which enabled hackers to bake them into their ransomware, which then spread rapidly through unpatched Microsoft computers, locking up everything in its wake.There is no evidence that the North Koreans were involved in the actual theft of the N.S.A. hacking tools. There are many theories, but the favorite hypothesis among intelligence officials is that an insider, probably a contractor, stole the information, much as Edward J. Snowden lifted a different trove of information from the N.S.A. four years ago.But hackers quickly seized on the published vulnerabilities to wreak havoc on computer systems that were not \u201cpatched\u201d in recent months, after the N.S.A. quietly told Microsoft about the flaw in their systems. The damage wreaked in recent days could well escalate into the billions of dollars, security experts say, particularly now that any criminal, terrorist or nation state has the ability to tease the tools apart and retrofit them into their own hacking tools.Not surprisingly, government officials say it is not entirely their fault. They will not confirm or deny what Mr. Smith says outright: That these \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d come out of America\u2019s growing cyberarsenal. At a news conference at the White House on Monday, Thomas Bossert, President Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, told reporters, \u201cThis was not an exploit developed by the N.S.A. to hold organizations ransom,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a vulnerability exploit that was part of a much larger tool put together by the culpable parties.\u201d\u201cThe provenance of the underlying vulnerability is not of as much concern to me,\u201d Mr. Bossert said, stepping around the delicate question of the N.S.A.\u2019s role.The weapons used in the attacks that started Friday, government officials insist, were cobbled together from many sources. And the fault, they argue, lies with whoever turned them into weapons \u2014 or maybe with Microsoft itself, for not having a system in place to make sure that when they issue a patch that neutralizes such attacks, everyone around the world takes the time to fix their systems. Or with the victims, who failed to run their security updates made available two months ago, or who continue to use so-called \u201clegacy\u201d software that Microsoft no longer supports.When asked about the source of the attack, Mr. Bossert said on Monday, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d He told reporters at the White House. \u201cAttribution can be difficult. I don\u2019t want to say we have no clues. But I stand assured that the best and brightest are working on this hack.\u201dAs Mr. Bossert was speaking to reporters, yet another N.S.A. hacking tool, very similar to the one used in the weekend\u2019s ransomware attacks, was being retrofitted by cybercriminals and put up for sale on the underground dark web. In private hacking forums, cybercriminals were discussing how to develop more than a dozen other N.S.A. hacking tools for criminal use.Another round of attacks using the N.S.A. tools could well affect another big issue that the Obama administration debated and never resolved when it left office: whether the government can demand that all companies assure that investigators can \u201cunlock\u201d encrypted communications. Before he was fired last week, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, often complained that the government was \u201cgoing dark,\u201d and that intelligence agencies and local police departments needed a way to crack the encrypted mobile conversations of terrorists or kidnappers.But the N.S.A.\u2019s loss of its own hacking tools has undercut that argument, executives say. If the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. cannot keep their hacking tools locked up, companies like Apple are asking, why should Americans trust them with the keys to unlock every private communication and bank transfer? Won\u2019t those leak, too, meaning that hackers, blackmailers and thieves will all have access to everyone\u2019s private email, health records and financial transactions?Nine years ago, the White House created a process for deciding what unpatched holes to disclose to manufacturers like Microsoft and its competitors, and which to keep in its arsenal.That process was refined by Mr. Obama and in 2015, Adm. Michael Rogers, the director of the NSA, said the agency had shared 91 percent of the zero-days it had discovered that year. A zero-day is a previously undisclosed flaw that leaves computer users with zero days to fix the vulnerability.But Michael Daniel, the White House cybercoordinator in the Obama administration, noted, \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a good rating system for vulnerabilities in terms of their severity. Not all zero-days are created equal,\u201d he said.The N.S.A.\u2019s wormlike tool was leaked online by the Shadow Brokers last month.\u201cWhat happened with the Shadow Brokers in this case is equivalent to a nuclear bomb in cyberspace,\u201d said Zohar Pinhasi, a former cybersecurity intelligence officer for the Israeli military, now the chief executive of MonsterCloud, which helps mitigate ransomware attacks. \u201cThis is what happens when you give a tiny little criminal a weapon of mass destruction.

{"Headline": "To Be Great Again, America Needs Immigrants", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byWhat makes America great?The standard answers point to qualities that the United States is said to have in greater abundance than its peers in Europe and Japan. There are the innovations that pour out of Silicon Valley companies and elite universities, the flexibility of a work force relatively unconstrained by union rules, the dynamism of entrepreneurs less hamstrung by an oversize welfare state and of a more mobile population willing to move to where the cutting-edge jobs are mushrooming.In short, the standard innovation theory of American exceptionalism is all about qualities that make each worker more productive. Today, nearly all the economic discussion about how to make America great again focuses on ways \u2014 like cutting red tape and taxes \u2014 to revive flagging productivity growth.Though this discussion remains critically important, it plays down a big shift in the story. The underlying growth potential of any economy is shaped not only by productivity, or output per worker, but also by the number of workers entering the labor force. The growth of the labor force is in turn determined mainly by the number of native-born and immigrant working-age people. Over the last two decades, the United States\u2019 advantage in productivity growth has narrowed sharply, while its population advantages, compared with both Europe and Japan, have essentially held steady.What makes America great is, therefore, less about productivity than about population, less about Google and Stanford than about babies and immigrants.The growing importance of the population race will be very hard for any political leader to fully digest. Every nation prefers to think of itself as productive in the sense of hard-working and smart, not just fertile. But population is where the real action is.Comparing six of the leading developed countries \u2014 the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 I found that not only has productivity growth been slowing across the board in recent decades, but also that the gaps in productivity growth among these rich nations are narrowing sharply. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, productivity was growing much faster in the United States than in Germany or Japan, but that advantage has largely disappeared in this decade.The reasons for this convergence are complex, possibly having to do with the way production technology now spreads quickly across borders. But this trend spans the developed world, and it basically holds regardless of which two countries you compare, which should raise doubts about how any one country, including the United States, can regain a distinct economic advantage by focusing only on reviving productivity.Which brings us back to babies and immigrants. Like productivity, population growth has been slowing worldwide in recent decades, the big difference being that the gaps among the rich nations are increasingly significant. In the 1960s the United States population growth rate averaged 1.2 percent, or 50 percent higher than Europe\u2019s and about the same as Japan\u2019s. By the late 1960s, population growth peaked worldwide because of the spread of birth control and other cultural shifts, but it has slowed much more gradually in the United States than in its rivals.In the past decade, American population growth has averaged 0.8 percent a year, eight times faster than Europe\u2019s, and Japan\u2019s population has not grown at all. Increasingly, then, the underlying difference between the fast- and slow-growing economies is explained more by the differences in population growth than by productivity. And the United States now relies more than ever on demographics to defend its economic power. In the past decade, population growth, including immigration, has accounted for roughly half of the potential economic growth rate in the United States, compared with just one-sixth in Europe, and none in Japan.Since 2005, per capita gross domestic product has grown on average by 0.6 percent a year in the United States, exactly the same rate as in Japan and virtually the same rate as in the 19 nations of the eurozone. In other words, if it weren\u2019t for the boost from babies and immigrants, the United States economy would look much like those supposed laggards, Europe and Japan.Indeed, if the United States population had been growing as slowly as Japan\u2019s over the last two decades, its share of the global economy would be just 15 percent, not the 25 percent it holds today.Moreover, immigrants make a surprisingly big contribution to population growth. In the United States, immigrants have accounted for a third to nearly a half of population growth for decades. In other countries with Anglo-Saxon roots \u2014 Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 immigrants have accounted for more than half of population growth over the past decade. Those economies have also been growing faster than their counterparts in the rest of Europe or Japan. But much of that advantage would have disappeared without their population advantage.Politically, the irony of this moment is stark. Population growth is increasingly important as an economic force and is increasingly driven by immigration. Yet now along comes a new breed of nationalists, rising on the strength of their promises to limit immigration. And they have been especially successful in countries where anti-immigrant sentiment has run strong, including the United States and Britain.Immigration has been expanding the United States population at a rate of about one million people a year over the last decade. It\u2019s not clear exactly how much President Trump\u2019s policies will reduce the net flow of immigrants, given that he has yet to articulate a broad-based immigration program. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has been more explicit, promising to cut the net inflow to the \u201csustainable level\u201d of under 100,000 immigrants a year, down from an average of 250,000 in the last decade. For these leaders, delivering on these anti-immigrant messages may now be politically imperative, but it will seriously handicap their economies in the global growth sweepstakes.History is littered with examples of emerging nations that have failed to generate enough jobs for a booming young population. But virtually no nation has ever sustained rapid economic growth without strong population growth. And at a time when every major country including the United States faces continued decline in population growth, workers are an increasingly precious source of national economic strength.In the long run, governments have limited avenues to increase the growth rate of the labor force, which is unaffected by short-term fluctuations in unemployment. Even enticing the \u201cforgotten men\u201d \u2014 those no longer looking for work \u2014 back into the labor force can have only limited impact. The main reason fewer Americans participate in the labor force is not because they are discouraged, but because they are getting older.In recent decades nations from Australia to France to Singapore have foreseen the looming economic impact of slower population growth, offering families \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d to have more kids \u2014 but typically with little impact on the birthrate or the economy. The impulse to procreate may be one of the few areas of human endeavor that remains beyond the reach of government mandarins. In contrast, regulating immigration remains a relatively simple task, and if immigrants are properly assimilated, they can have an immediate impact on the size of the work force.It would be unrealistic to imagine that hard economic logic will turn the anti-global, anti-foreign tide any time soon. So the likely result is that the United States and Britain will go ahead and limit immigration. To the extent they do \u2014 and their rivals do not \u2014 they will undermine their key economic edge, and cede much of the growth advantage they have enjoyed over Europe and Japan.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

The Times guidelines don\u2019t offer a simple yes or no to the question of whether \u201cthey\u201d or some other nonstandard pronoun is acceptable in its pages.Phil Corbett, associate masthead editor for standards, said that as a first choice such pronouns are to be avoided, noting that many readers are still unfamiliar with them and their usage can cause confusion.But he also adds an important second point: \u201cIf it seems appropriate and there\u2019s no good way around it, we wouldn\u2019t propose a pronoun that the person (in the story) rejects or is offended by.\u201dIn those instances where a writer or editor considers alternative pronouns necessary, they are to seek Corbett\u2019s approval.At the moment, however, these guidelines are not in written form, and there seems to be some confusion in the newsroom about how to approach a subject of immense importance to the individuals being written about.Opinion editors, who generally follow the style and usage guidelines of the newsroom, were under the impression that \u201cthey\u201d could not be used as a singular pronoun. That\u2019s how they ended up calling Dillon \u201cshe.\u201d Another moment of confusion arose recently in another section when someone requested that they be referred to as \u201cthey.\u201d In that case, the matter was resolved by avoiding any pronoun but not before upsetting the subject of the piece.Understandably, this isn\u2019t a simple issue for news organizations: Either confuse many of your readers with sentences like \u201cThey is going to the theater\u201d or risk falling behind shifting cultural norms.Corbett approaches the dilemma this way: \u201cThe Times is not looking to lead the way, set the rules or break new ground. Our hope is to reflect accepted, standard usage among educated readers.\u201dAt least while the ground is shifting, the Times policy seems about right \u2014 allow nongender pronouns but first try reworking sentences to avoid them.That said, I would advocate two important changes. First, codify the policy on gender pronouns in a written entry to the formal stylebook. If that sounds bureaucratic, it\u2019s not. Editors and writers regularly refer to the stylebook for clarity on word usage. It\u2019s a critical reference tool that short circuits the bad information that word-of-mouth answers can spread. Right now, it seems there is still some confusion. Are nonbinary pronouns ever allowed? And if so, under what circumstances? Among the rank and file, you\u2019re apt to get different answers, as I did, depending on who you ask.Second, I wonder about the unintended consequence of requiring the signoff of a masthead editor for every singular usage of \u201cthey.\u201d That alone is enough to quell the possibility that the subject of a story might actually be identified by the pronoun they prefer.At a time when American culture is outpacing the language to describe it, easily referenced rules can prevent the kinds of embarrassing mistakes that could leave The Times seeming out of touch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Little-Known Accounting Change Could Have a Big Impact", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneA tsunami of change is coming to the regulations that govern corporate America, if President Trump and Republicans in Congress get their way.But there is also a little-noticed change coming down the pike that will have a major impact on business. And this one has corporate executives up in arms \u2014 and scrambling to comply.It\u2019s a new accounting rule promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, known as FASB. The rule, with the blandly mellifluous title \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2013Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d or Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, will change the way companies, both big and small, account for their equity investments in other companies, specifically for those stakes smaller than 20 percent.Like much of what the accounting standards board tries to do, the new rule is intended to provide investors and creditors with better information and more clarity around a company\u2019s financial statements, with the lofty goal of helping them make more informed decisions when providing capital to a company or business.But Update 2016-01 could significantly affect \u2014 and distort \u2014 the way companies like Alphabet, Intel, IBM and Salesforce.com, which make a lot of small investments in other companies, report their earnings. It could also curtail such investments from being made in the first place, because some businesses say the costs of complying with the rule are too high.Here\u2019s how things would change with the new rule: Now, when a company buys a stake of less than 20 percent in another company, it usually accounts for the investment on its balance sheet at cost \u2014 the price it paid for it. Over time, under the old rules, if the value of the investment goes down, the rules required a corresponding write-down of the value, both through the company\u2019s income statement and on its balance sheet. But if the value increases over time, the investment can still be kept at cost.While investors were fully informed when an investment lost value, there was less transparency for them when an investment increased in value. What investors lost in transparency on the upside, it has been argued, was gained in not requiring corporate executives to place a number on these often difficult-to-value investments every quarter.That\u2019s what is going to change after Dec. 15. From then on, each minority investment a public company makes will have to be valued quarterly, whether that value has increased or decreased. That potential volatility will soon be required to flow through a company\u2019s income statement, with the possibility of causing fluctuations to earnings per share from something that is not even a core business.Corporate executives will have two choices on how to go about valuing these investments.They can either spend the time valuing these investments themselves (or hire an accounting firm or a valuation firm like Duff & Phelps), or they can choose to wait until there is a market-driven valuation event and then mark up the value of the investment accordingly. How a company chooses to value these investments \u2014 whether every quarter or when there is a market event \u2014 has to be selected soon, and then cannot be changed. This, too, has added to the corporate executives\u2019 concerns.Take, for example, investments that have been made over the years in Uber, which now has a valuation of around $70 billion. In 2013, Google Ventures, now part of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, invested $258 million in Uber at a post-money valuation of $3.76 billion. Four years later, that investment is now worth around $4.8 billion.That\u2019s a nice return on investment, although it has nothing to do with Google\u2019s core business. At the moment, the word \u201cUber\u201d does not appear in Alphabet\u2019s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Alphabet\u2019s latest quarterly filing, it explains that all of its minority investments in private companies have a so-called carrying value of $1.7 billion, which presumably includes its investment in Uber at the cost of $258 million.Under the new rules, Alphabet will basically have to value its Uber investment at market, or closer to the $4.8 billion (either because of its own valuation or based on the recent new investments in the company). That increase in the value of Google\u2019s investment in Uber, around $4.5 billion, would have to flow through Alphabet\u2019s income statement. Considering that in the first quarter of 2017 Alphabet had net income of $5.4 billion, adding in the Uber gain of around $4.5 billion could have quite the distorting effect. It could have a similar effect on the downside if in subsequent quarters Uber\u2019s valuation takes a hit.The whole matter could be further complicated if Alphabet chooses to take one approach to how it values Uber and, say, Microsoft, another small Uber investor, takes a different one. It will soon be possible for Alphabet to value its stake in Uber using a different methodology than Microsoft does for the exact same investment.Or take Google\u2019s 2014 investment in Cloudera, a chip manufacturer, at a $1.8 billion valuation. Then, Intel invested at a $4.1 billion valuation \u2014 big gain. But Cloudera went public at a $2 billion valuation \u2014 big loss.But the new rule also has the potential to confuse investors about the value of these equity stakes, too. It would force corporate executives to remind listeners on every quarterly conference call that the fluctuations in the value of these investments have nothing to do with their core business and should be ignored, and that something like \u201cadjusted net income\u201d without these fluctuations is the way to look at their earnings. Even Ernst & Young, the big accounting firm, acknowledges that putting the new rule into effect could be a tough slog for many companies.Sounds to me like the new rule will have the unintended consequence of muddling the presentation of financial statements, not clarifying them. And since this really was not broken in the first place, why go to the trouble of fixing it?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump May Have Shifted U.S. Intelligence Policy on Russia. Or Maybe Not.", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byMr. Putin\u2019s repeated calls for unity in fighting terrorism \u2014 delivered from the podium of the United Nations, at countless global summit meetings and after every grisly attack around the world \u2014 have often been met with skepticism, interpreted as smoke screens to cloak the violence fomented by the Kremlin in places like Chechnya, Ukraine and Syria.That could signal a major policy shift, political analysts said.\u201cThe Kremlin has been so skillful in getting the president of the United States to cooperate in an unusual way,\u201d said Maxim Trudolyubov, a Russian political analyst and columnist. \u201cIt is a big and completely unexpected coup for the Kremlin.\u201dMr. Putin has long sought such cooperation. In part, he owes his 17 years leading Russia as either president or prime minister to the fact that he defeated a domestic insurgency in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus by branding it as part of the global war on terrorism and flattening the place. Although Al Qaeda was almost certainly active in Chechnya, no one outside Russia paid much attention to Mr. Putin\u2019s warnings about extremism there \u2014 until after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.His antiterrorism campaign is central to his grand overall strategy of restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed in Soviet times.Yet given the whims of Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudolyubov and others said, it is unclear that such cooperation will endure. The unexpected manner in which the information was shared makes it difficult to assess whether it reflects a permanent shift in course.\u201cIt is not something that Russia can rely on, because Trump changes like the weather,\u201d Mr. Trudolyubov said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of victory that you do not really want if you want orderly policy cooperation.\u201dThroughout his campaign, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would work more closely with Russia, and this latest episode could indicate that he is following through.Although Moscow asserted that chasing Islamist militants from the ancient ruins of Palmyra \u2014 twice \u2014 proved that it was defending civilized Western values, Russian firepower has largely been focused against the uprising confronting Mr. Assad.Outside of the Islamic State, a shared definition of who constitutes a terrorist in Syria does not exist, and the Pentagon has been leery about cooperation.\u201cThe problem is that both Russia and the U.S. mean different things when they talk about the fight against terrorism in Syria,\u201d said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg. \u201cThe question is whether they will try to bridge the gap in their understanding.\u201dIn addition, it is taken as a given in Russia that whatever Mr. Trump wants, the real establishment in Washington will put a stop to it if it clashes with its interests. \u201cIt is not a question of whether Trump wants to or not, it is a question of whether Trump can or not,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.Still, disparaging asides about Mr. Trump that had been creeping into official newscasts will most likely vanish.\u201cI would expect the Russians will now stop criticizing Mr. Trump as they have done during the last month or so,\u201d Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, the director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email.Even if the Kremlin has reason to be pleased with the latest episode, Mr. Putin and the Russian government prefer that policy changes happen in an orderly, choreographed manner.If the United States and Russia are to forge genuine new cooperation on terrorism, analysts said, Russia would prefer that it emerge from a meeting between the two presidents, scheduled for July, not via Twitter and confusing, contradictory denials in Washington.In any case, the Oval Office episode was not big news in Russia, where the main headline of the day was Ukraine\u2019s shutting down key Russian social media and information sites, including Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and Yandex, Russia\u2019s version of Google.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, dismissed the reports from the White House. \u201cFor us, this is not a subject,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is the latest nonsense.\u201dFew here accept the idea, at least publicly, that Russia helped Mr. Trump by stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, even if Russia has clearly stated that conducting hybrid information warfare is important to achieving its strategic goals.One of those goals is undermining the Western institutions that oppose it. Whether anyone accepts that idea or not, there is glee in some quarters in Moscow at the confusion in the American capital.\u201cOf course, from Moscow, we look at this chaos with a bit of a smile,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cSo many Americans used to look at the chaos in Russia that way. It is a kind of psychological revenge.\u201dAmerican officials preoccupied with domestic problems will also have less time to meddle in Russian affairs, he added.Most Russians expect that the United States will endure given the strength of its institutions, its economy and its overall resources. Some wonder, however, if the dysfunction at the White House will descend to the level that paralyzed the Kremlin in the worst, last days of the Soviet Union, or even to that of pre-Putin Russia.There were sarcastic remarks regarding the White House in a commentary on Channel One, a state-run television station, during a news program on Sunday.\u201cThe new action-packed series, tentatively titled \u2018Secrets of Trump\u2019s Oval Office,\u2019 becomes more fascinating every day,\u201d said a commentator named Evgeny Baranov. \u201cRussia\u2019s footprint, that is in one way or another present in each new episode, only enhances the intrigues of this bold plotline.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Highlights Alternate Legislative Universe as Trump\u2019s Woes Pile Up", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byCongressional memoWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers still gather in committee rooms to discuss matters like improving chronic disease management and amphibious warfare.Statues of Ben Franklin and other luminaries of history remain swathed in eerie plastic to protect them from protracted tests of the Capitol\u2019s smoke detection systems.Senate pages bumble around the chamber in ill-fitting jackets, racing to get their bosses glasses of water.But through it all, everyone watches their Google alerts with a mild sense of panic, waiting for the next daily \u2014 sometimes hourly \u2014 missive of dysfunction.As the bricks of bad news about Mr. Trump pile up, Republicans have struggled to portray themselves as busy toiling away at the nation\u2019s business even though their legislative agenda moves deeper into the abyss.\u201cThis is another busy week as we continue to make progress on our agenda for the American people,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan said, cheerfully, during a Thursday morning news conference, ticking off technology reform legislation winding its way to the floor, tax talks and bipartisan legislation to improve career and technical education in the offing.Yet as they left their offices to attend a hearing or a vote each day this week, lawmakers were swarmed by reporters, who trailed along with them down long hallways in a giant human hive, replete with extended arms bearing iPhones and tape recorders, demanding to know the latest on Mr. Trump\u2019s travails. Mundane confirmation votes dragged out. Attention was diverted. Legislation was ignored.\u201cThis has really captured the attention of all senators, and all Americans really,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, charged with investigating the role of Russia in Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cI am getting calls from supporters asking questions about things like martial law,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cAnd remember I am a moderate!\u201d He added, \u201cThe absence of other substantive legislative activity makes this all the more in focus.\u201dRepublican leaders tried their best to highlight the alternative universe on Capitol Hill, where they insist lots of lawmaking is going on. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, tried to turn the talk to health care most of the week, suggesting on Thursday that people who pick up their children from school were likely to be in a tizzy over the hobbled health care exchanges in his home state.But in their offices, gyms and cloakrooms, lawmakers and their staff members pondered with colleagues the speed and depth of Mr. Trump\u2019s careening presidency. Republicans privately fretted that their bosses would have little to brag about when they spent August back in their home states. \u201cDrama is not helpful in getting things done,\u201d Mr. Ryan conceded.The meltdown of a nascent presidency would distract even the most active and engaged Congress. But in many ways this Congress seemed particularly primed for huge distraction. Republican lawmakers \u2014 who control both chambers of Congress \u2014 have been doing most of their significant policy work on health care and to a lesser degree tax reform without Democrats.Republicans are loath to bring bills to the floor that Democrats will try to festoon with politically infused anti-Trump amendments. They fear any bill that would deal with, say, law enforcement would be used by Democrats as another vehicle to criticize Mr. Trump.The Trump administration has been slow to send over its nominees for consideration, and Democrats have done their best to use procedural tricks to slow the process to a crawl and avoid assisting Republicans in any form.There is very little legislation of significance emerging from committee rooms and hitting the Senate floor, and a major bill to repeal the health care law this month took most of the time of the House this spring.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do health care reform and tax reform, and that takes a lot of time to get that right,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. \u201cA lot of people are working very hard on both those issues.\u201dBut even simple things like a bipartisan child sexual abuse bill has been difficult to move forward, not because Mr. McConnell is stopping it, but because of the many distractions.The parallel worlds are quite different from 1973, when a Democratic Congress moved ahead on a variety of issues as President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s problems escalated. That year, Mr. Nixon signed the Federal Highway Act and the federal H.M.O. Act. \u201cNixon was something of a centrist and wanted to get some of the credit for liberal initiatives,\u201d said Donald A. Ritchie, the former Senate historian.The parties were both more moderate and more split into distinct, large camps at that time \u2014 moderate and conservative Republicans and Southern and liberal Northern Democrats \u2014 compared with the highly polarized parties of 2017 filled largely with very conservative Republicans and very liberal Democrats.Many of the House Republicans have never worked with a Republican president, and find themselves locked in the opposition mode of the previous eight years, while Democrats are increasingly bent on denying the other party, and especially Mr. Trump, any victories.\u201cCongress in 2017 seems to want to blame their dysfunction on Trump,\u201d said Ray Smock, the director of the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education. But, he added, \u201cThe low legislative output of the last two or three Congresses was not Trump\u2019s fault. The fault is with Congress with a Republican majority that was obtained as obstructionists to Obama, and they can\u2019t shift gears to become positive legislators for the whole nation.\u201dDemocrats are hoping that Republicans will fail to pass legislation along partisan lines, and come back to them to work on bills that require their input, such as a major infrastructure measure. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has pushed ahead with bipartisan efforts on health care and convened a meeting last Monday along those lines.\u201cWe have to deal with these Russia questions,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut at the same time we\u2019ve got to make sure we do other things.\u201d The work on Russia, he said, will make that more difficult.Republicans say that even with the distractions, the worries, and the briefings and the mini-meltdowns, Congress will eventually find its footing under their party\u2019s leadership. \u201cIn one sense I think of my life as being compartmentalized,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana. The current environment \u201cmay deplete the president\u2019s political capital,\u201d Mr. Cassidy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s affecting the legislative process.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet Chen Man, the \u2018Chinese Annie Leibovitz\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byStyles Q. and A.The next breakout star from China is not an actress or a pop idol, but rather a photographer. Signed in 2016 by Creative Artists Agency, home of Meryl Streep, Will Smith and Jennifer Lopez, Chen Man has already drawn comparisons to Mario Testino and Annie Leibovitz. Ms. Chen, known for her high-wattage clients and a dramatic, vivid style that melds contemporary Chinese imagery with historical symbols and spaces, was honored last Sunday in New York at the China Fashion Gala, an annual event co-hosted by the China Institute and the China Beauty Charity Fund. The gala benefits a design competition and a scholarship at the Fashion Institute of Technology, with an advisory board this year that included Valentino Garavani, Vivienne Tam, Christian Louboutin and Zang Toi.Ms. Chen, 36, began her career in 2003 while working on her bachelor\u2019s degree at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing with a series of rich, striking covers for Vision, a Chinese fashion magazine. She has photographed Rihanna, Victoria Beckham and Nicole Kidman for the Chinese versions of Vogue, Elle, Harper\u2019s Bazaar and Grazia, and works regularly with such Chinese stars as Fan Bingbing, Li Bingbing and Zhang Ziyi. For a glimpse into her background as a painter, how she compares to Ms. Leibovitz, and the place of Chinese art on a global stage, read on.Q. How did you end up working as a photographer?The reason I majored in photography is that I trained too much as a painter, so when I went to college, I wanted to start something new. And I like to be in contact with real people, not just be indoors and not go out.Speaking of Annie Leibovitz, how would you compare her work to yours?I have more of a fusion style. Annie Leibovitz shoots more reality, documentary. I like more drama. I went to a school for theater and worked as a graphic designer to earn extra money before going to Central Academy of Fine Arts. I\u2019m a painter and a graphic designer as well as a photographer. I use a lot of postproduction.I want to show what contemporary China is and what contemporary Chinese beauty is. I did several shoots for i-D magazine. I was a special editor on one issue, so I used models of different Chinese races for the covers. People think Chinese look the same, but we are kind of like the Americans. We have 56 different races.A few years ago, I shot models with the type of face that was not popular in China at the time. We call it the Asian face. Not the girl with big eyes, white skin, not so sweet, but the real Asian woman. And I shot them in contemporary Chinese scenes, like the Great Wall, Shanghai Bund and Tiananmen Square.Who are the celebrities you work with the most? I shoot them all, all the time. I kind of came up with Fan Bingbing, Li Bingbing, Zhang Ziyi. And right now I\u2019m shooting what we call the \u2018fresh meat\u2019 actors. I have shot Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham, Benedict Cumberbatch. The age range is wide. Sometimes I\u2019m shooting four covers a day.How do you manage to maintain quality and efficiency with so many shoots and subjects? Before I\u2019m shooting, I already have an image in my mind. We are so lucky to have WeChat, so everybody is prepared for what it will be. I send directions into the group chat. During the shoot, I try to show the best the subject can be, to show the best angles, the best emotions. They become addicted.Do you think that Chinese art is well represented globally? International icons come to China to shoot for the exposure. Conversely, for Chinese designers and artists, there is a giant microscope. The world is interested in China and what we\u2019re doing.The more exposure there is, the more opportunities there are for people to have conversations. But sometimes things get lost in translation, so what I hope to do is use a visual language, which doesn\u2019t need translation, to convey a more well-rounded, three-dimensional story.I\u2019m actually developing a short-video-based app right now that\u2019s a little bit like Instagram, and that\u2019s my slogan: The visual language is a language that does not need translation. I\u2019m hoping that when people use an app that solely uses short videos and clips, people are using what they see to communicate rather than a language that puts up walls and boundaries between different countries. The app aims to create a visual dialogue. I want people inside and outside of China to recognize that we\u2019re moving at the same pace as everyone else.Who is a photographer that you look up to? Liu Xiangcheng is an artist I follow a lot. He is a news photojournalist. He was the first Chinese person to win a Pulitzer for photojournalism. But the reason why I like him is not because he won a Pulitzer but because he grew up in a time when it was very difficult in China, during the Cultural Revolution, yet he was able to maintain his humor. Our parents\u2019 generation grew up in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution, and that was a hard life they experienced. He caught the sense of humor in that time. That inspires me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: How Uber and Waymo Ended Up Clashing", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byGiven the nasty legal battle between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google\u2019s parent, it\u2019s easy to forget that once upon a time, Google and Uber saw each other as allies.It was then, it seems, that Mr. Kalanick realized his company was falling behind, and he spent much of 2015 poaching Google\u2019s engineers.Mr. Kalanick eventually became friends with Anthony Levandowski, an autonomous-vehicle engineer at Google. The two spoke for hours about the future of driving as they walked from the Ferry Building in San Francisco to the Golden Gate Bridge five miles away, according to two people who were familiar with the executives and who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.The friendship developed into a partnership. Mr. Levandowski left Google last year to form Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up that Uber acquired months later for nearly $700 million. Mr. Kalanick subsequently appointed Mr. Levandowski to run Uber\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research.And that has set off the bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, which has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing trade secrets from Google.As an industry that values certainty, Wall Street appears to be troubled by the Trump administration.Cited in the article, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could stymie the president\u2019s legislative agenda, which includes Wall Street favorites like lower taxes and fewer regulations.One unidentified chief executive told Mr. Cohan, \u201cUnlike the rest of this stuff that is going on, which you can actually say, \u2018Uh, there he goes again,\u2019 like the ship in Korea going north instead of south, this is different. It feels different.\u201dStill, bankers express optimism that the Trump administration will be friendlier to Wall Street than previous governments.Mr. Maris said his fund, Section 32, had about $150 million under management and would invest in a variety of industries, including sectors like health care and agriculture technology.He said he had initially considered setting up a bigger fund but had changed his mind.\u201cThere was something about it that didn\u2019t feel entirely right,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople sometimes make the mistake of judging funds by size.\u201dMr. Maris is the sole general partner for now and will be operating the fund out of his home in San Diego.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at unprecedented opportunities that can have impact and can be at a scale that were not totally imaginable in the past,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The company, founded by two former executives of the computer security provider McAfee, has argued that relying on systems that run on cloud computing rather than those installed on customers\u2019 devices means smarter defenses and faster responses.\u201cWe\u2019re in the cloud, looking at a lot of end points,\u201d George Kurtz, the chief executive and co-founder of CrowdStrike, said in an interview, referring to customers\u2019 computers and systems. \u201cIt helps us prevent an incident from becoming a breach.\u201dSince its start, CrowdStrike has taken what Mr. Kurtz likens to a Salesforce-like modular approach to systems: plenty of options for customers.The new round of money comes as the six-year-old company undergoes rapid growth. CrowdStrike said subscriptions had grown 476 percent in the last year. It says more than 10 percent of the Fortune 1,000 are customers.The company also now has more than 650 employees around the world.Much of that growth, Mr. Kurtz said, came from word of mouth as customers praised the company\u2019s offerings. But the company\u2019s role in helping the D.N.C. \u201ccertainly raised our profile and awareness,\u201d he said.An existing investor, the venture capital firm Accel, led the new round. Other participants include other existing investors like CapitalG, an arm of Google\u2019s parent company, and Warburg Pincus, the private equity firm, as well as newcomers like March Capital Partners and Telstra, a telecommunications provider in Australia.Accel chose to spearhead the round because of CrowdStrike\u2019s promise as a leader in enterprise security, Sameer Gandhi, a partner at Accel, said in a news release.The new infusion of cash will go toward geographical expansion and the development of additional products as well as potentially for small acquisitions.

In March, the company, which has 16 global locations, expanded the offer, pledging a $250 monthly rent stipend for a year to any employee who lives in, or moves to, Newark. More than two dozen employees have taken advantage of that offer.Audible is among a handful of companies around the country offering housing assistance to its workers, although such benefits tend to happen in areas where the cost of living is extraordinarily high, which is not the case for Newark.But how do you draw workers to a place without much of a draw?Only about 70 Audible employees working in the headquarters live in Newark, and that number includes those who took the company up on its housing offer. About a quarter of the company\u2019s New Jersey-based employees live in New York City and Jersey City and the rest commute from elsewhere in the tristate area, coming from as far away as Connecticut.Many Audible workers suffer through long commutes not because they can\u2019t afford to live near where they work, but because they don\u2019t want to. So for Audible, the incentive isn\u2019t really about money; it\u2019s about Newark. \u201cClearly what they\u2019re trying to do is to get people to give Newark a try,\u201d Mr. Lubell said.Audible\u2019s founder and chief executive, Donald R. Katz, has been something of a cheerleader for the struggling city, ever since he moved the headquarters to Newark from Wayne, N.J., a decade ago.As exciting as it may be to discover a new area, leaving New York for a city that has only recently begun to climb out of decades of neglect is a big change, even if the boss is footing most of the bill for the first year.\u201cIt was definitely a period of adjustment,\u201d said Deanna Paquette, 29, a senior designer at Audible and a recipient of the $2,000-a-month rent reduction. Ms. Paquette moved in April to a $2,450-a-month one-bedroom apartment that was twice the size of the studio she had been renting in South Williamsburg for around $3,000 a month. \u201cI knew I needed to leave Brooklyn for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was such a big jump.\u201dFor Ms. Paquette, the biggest hit has been to her social life. \u201cIf you step out at 9 p.m. on a Saturday, there\u2019s not a ton going on the way there was in Brooklyn,\u201d she said. No longer can she text her friends and immediately meet one somewhere in the neighborhood.The move has had another significant impact on her life \u2014 nearly eliminating her commute. Now, rather than spending two and a half hours a day on subways and PATH trains, she spends about 20 minutes walking to and from the office. Already, Ms. Paquette cooks more at home and has taken on more volunteer opportunities with the company.Audible didn\u2019t decide to help pay the rent because it was concerned workers spent too much time in transit. Yet this unintended consequence may be the one that delivers the biggest impact. Moving a few dozen workers to Newark isn\u2019t going to save the city. But reducing commute time could drastically improve a worker\u2019s quality of life. The hours we spend each day sitting on trains, buses and in our cars contributes to our collective misery. Anyone who has ever had an hourslong commute knows that time spent in transit means less time to do things like go to the gym, hang out with friends or even just pet the cat. Shorten your commute and odds are you\u2019ll be happier and healthier.When Amy Garas, 36, the executive assistant to Audible\u2019s chief financial officer, entered the housing lottery, she was thinking about the two hours she spent in her car each day driving back and forth from her apartment in Somerset County, N.J. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t work at Audible, I don\u2019t know if I would have been so eager to move\u201d to Newark, she said. \u201cBut having a really great commute was a huge selling point.\u201dAn article and a picture caption last Sunday about Audible.com\u2019s offer to subsidize rent for employees living in Newark, where the company has its headquarters, misstated the given name of a senior designer at Audible who received a $2,000-a-month rent reduction for one year. She is Deanna Paquette, not Deanne.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With New Echo Speakers, Amazon Lets You Ask Alexa to Phone Mom", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byNow Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers \u2014 and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them.On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a seven-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices.The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Apple\u2019s FaceTime and Google\u2019s Hangouts, underline the company\u2019s ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone.The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people\u2019s homes \u2014 a system that can help you shop online, control your home\u2019s temperature and, now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker.\u201cAmazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,\u201d said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.Amazon said it planned to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360.According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be compelled to go and interact with the screen \u2014 you should be able to do it with your voice,\u201d Mr. Limp said in a product briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from traditional computing as we\u2019ve known it for the last three decades.\u201dYet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address.The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them.\u201cI think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies.The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Mr. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability.Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Ms. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling.\u201cWe\u2019re so used to using our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we\u2019re engaged with.\u201dBrian X.

{"Headline": "California Today: A Housing Fix That\u2019s Close to Home", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.One fix to California\u2019s housing crisis could be in our own backyards.A growing movement of urban planners is pushing policies that would spur homeowners in hot housing markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles to create \u201cgranny flats\u201d on their properties.Known officially as accessory dwelling units, they typically take the form of garage studios or backyard cottages that can be used by an elderly relative or a college-age renter.But in January, legislation went into effect that was intended to change that, by eliminating certain utility connection fees and removing a requirement to add off-street parking for each new unit.The idea was simple: Make it easier to build the units, then watch the housing stock soar and the rents fall.Those opposed to easing regulations on the units have cited concerns about increased traffic and changes to neighborhood character.But as the housing crisis has intensified, more city officials have been embracing the small units, said Paul McDougall, a policy manager at California\u2019s housing agency who has been tracking the rollout of the new legislation.Research suggests homeowners have an appetite for them as well.Yet until now, only a trickle of homeowners have taken the plunge, said Matt Regan, senior vice president of policy at the Bay Area Council, the public policy group that produced the survey.\u201cOnce people get comfortable with the concept, we really feel that we\u2019ll start seeing these balloon across the state,\u201d Mr. Regan said.She cited her own example. She spent about $100,000 to add a cottage in her backyard in Berkeley in 2011, and has been renting it out for between $1,500 and $2,000 a month.

{"Headline": "No, Google\u2019s Not a Bird: Bringing the Internet to Rural India", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byTARADAND, India \u2014 Babulal Singh Neti was sitting with his uncle on a recent afternoon, trying to persuade him of the merits of the internet.It was 105 degrees outside, and the sun was beating down on the frazzled croplands. His uncle said he had no use for the internet, since he had never learned to read; furthermore, he wanted to nap. This he made clear by periodically screwing up his face into a huge yawn.Mr. Neti, 38, pressed on earnestly, suggesting that he could demonstrate the internet\u2019s potential by Googling the history of the Gond tribe, to which they both belonged. Since acquiring a smartphone, Mr. Neti couldn\u2019t stop Googling things: the gods, Hindu and tribal; the relative merits of the Yadav caste and the Gonds; the real story of how the earth was made.His uncle responded with half-closed eyes, delivering a brief but comprehensive oral history of the Gond kings, with the clear implication that his nephew was a bit of a good-for-nothing. \u201cWhat does it mean, Google?\u201d his uncle said. \u201cIs it a bird?\u201dAnd then, theatrically, he yawned.While India produces some of the world\u2019s best coders and computer engineers, vast multitudes of its people are like Mr. Neti\u2019s neighbors, entering the virtual world with little sense of what lies within it, or how it could be of use to them.The arrival of the internet in their lives is one of India\u2019s most hopeful narratives.In the 70 years since independence, India\u2019s government has done very little to connect Taradand, in Madhya Pradesh State, in central India, to the outside world: The first paved road appeared in 2006. There has never been a single telephone landline. Electricity is available to only half the houses. When Mr. Neti was growing up, if someone in the village needed emergency medical care, farmers tied the patient to a wooden cot and carried him five miles through the forest to the nearest hospital, a journey of four hours.With the cost of both smartphones and data plummeting, it is fair to assume that Taradand\u2019s next technological leap will be onto the internet.Those who work in development tend to speak of this moment as a civilizational breakthrough, of particular significance in a country aching to educate its children. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made expanding internet use a central goal, shifting government services onto digital platforms. When Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, toured India in 2014, he told audiences that for every 10 people who get online, \u201cone person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created.\u201dSo it is instructive to follow Mr. Neti as he tries to drum up a little interest in Taradand. Young men use the internet here, but only young men, and almost exclusively to circulate Bollywood films. Older people view it as a conduit for pornography and other wastes of time.Women are not allowed access even to simple mobile phones, for fear they will engage in illicit relationships; the internet is out of the question. Illiterate people \u2014 almost everyone over 40 \u2014 dismiss the internet as not intended for them.Still, Mr. Neti persists with the zeal of the newly converted.\u201cYou can call me the black sheep. That\u2019s what I am,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s the internet age. One day they\u2019ll all come around.\u201dMr. Neti is, in some ways, an unlikely harbinger of technological change. His parents pulled him out of school in fifth grade to marry \u2014 his wife was 10 \u2014 and though he can read and write in Hindi, his school transcript brands him illiterate, foreclosing any opportunity to get a government job.When he bought his first mobile phone, in 2001, he was so nervous he did not make a call for nearly a week. When he finally did, he blurted out: \u201cFriend, I have bought this mobile. Is this your number and your name? I am Babulal!\u201d The next day his phone stopped working and he returned to the shop, telling the salesman that something was wrong with the phone.\u201cI had no idea what to do,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Your balance is over.\u2019\u201dBut this experience in no way prepared Mr. Neti for his first encounter with the smartphone, which he spotted about a decade ago in the hand of a computer operator in Taradand\u2019s local administration building.The official was an agreeable sort, and Mr. Neti began borrowing his phone for two- and three-hour stretches. He went on Google, searching for the word \u201cGondwana,\u201d the name for the Gond tribe\u2019s traditional land.\u201cIt was as if I had opened up history, the history of Gondwana,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed fascinating. You didn\u2019t have to buy a book. The earth map came up as round, and part of it was Gondwana. Ireland, Gondwanaland, Switzerland. I was fascinated. No sooner would I see a mobile than I would run over.\u201dOnly after some time, he recalled, did Mr. Neti realize it was possible to search for terms other than Gondwana.\u201cIt seemed,\u201d he said, \u201cas if I was diving into a sea with no bottom to it.\u201dThis marked the beginning for Mr. Neti of a wide-ranging inquiry about the world surrounding him. He was interested, for example, in knowing whether the residents of other countries worshiped Ram, the Hindu deity and, upon discovering that they did not, hastened to inform his neighbors of this startling news. He decided to fact-check the assertion of a childhood friend, who is from the Yadav caste, that the Yadavs had been present at the creation of the earth and learned this was not a universally accepted view.\u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t personally saying anything about the Yadavs, it was Google saying something negative,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe was very offended.\u201dAt some point, Mr. Neti discovered that he had become skeptical of nearly everything he had been taught. \u201cI tried to find out if the gods created the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out it was not true. But still I cannot answer the question of who created the earth. But I believe Google contains the answer.\u201dMr. Neti finds it maddening that, in a region whose farmers are desperate to educate their children, his neighbors still regard the internet principally as a way to watch movies.\u201cThe villagers do not yet understand,\u201d he said \u201cThey don\u2019t know that the whole world rests inside the mobile. The day people realize that, they will stop going out to study.\u201dIf Mr. Neti\u2019s audience was tougher than usual, there was a reason: A 15-year-old girl from Taradand had just eloped with a 17-year-old boy from a different caste, and everyone was blaming technology. There was no evidence the young couple planned their getaway on the phone, but everyone assumed it.\u201cNinety-nine percent of mobile users misuse them,\u201d said Devender Kumar Patel, 17, whose hair had been coaxed into a four-inch ducktail. \u201cRapes are an outcome of these things. One of my cousins received a call on a mobile phone, was asked to go someplace and was murdered.\u201dThe internet, Mr. Patel felt, is worse: a labyrinth of shallow diversion where many young people in the village would lose their way. \u201cThose who use it badly will go farther down from where they are,\u201d he said.His father, Sriram Karan Patel, 44, nodded darkly.\u201cThey are seeing what they should not be seeing,\u201d he said.This was also the opinion of Mr. Neti\u2019s father, Kuware Singh, who returned from the fields to the family compound naked to his waist. Totally illiterate, he remains wary even of the basic cellphone; he will speak on it only if someone holds it up to his ear. He said he was unsure how he felt about all the time his son spent on the internet.\u201cIt depends,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWill it help him get a job?\u201dMr. Neti does spend a lot of time online. Walking around the village, he stops periodically to take selfies and post them on Facebook, and he scrolls through his feeds compulsively. He likes to describe his smartphone as his \u201cbest friend,\u201d or his \u201cguru.\u201dNone of this makes much sense to his neighbors. A friend from childhood, Markandeya Yadav, said it was difficult for him to keep up with Mr. Neti\u2019s internet discoveries.\u201cI am a simple man,\u201d Mr. Yadav said. \u201cHe has changed, but I have not.\u201dThe worst damage has been to Mr. Neti\u2019s relationship with his wife, Sitabai, who comes from a far more remote village and is completely illiterate. She had taken to scrolling through images on her husband\u2019s phone and, coming across a woman\u2019s photograph, began calling numbers at random. She reached a senior district bureaucrat whose contacts he had programmed into the phone, and Mr. Neti had to beg the official\u2019s forgiveness. After hanging up, he slapped her \u201cfour or five times,\u201d he said.\u201cMy wife\u2019s mentality is such that she lives in yesteryear,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will not tread my path. And if I tread her path, I will be left miles behind.\u201dMr. Neti said he had made little effort to explain the internet to Sitabai.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the mental capability,\u201d he said. \u201cHow would you explain a mobile to a dog?\u201dAt moments of discouragement, Mr. Neti recalls that Taradand has already accepted a new technology. Fifteen years ago, when people began using mobile phones, his neighbors were elated. They were more efficient in everything they did.It was no longer necessary to make long overland journeys to inform relatives of family news. Before going to market, farmers could call around to compare wholesale prices for vegetables. Migrant laborers could find out where the contractors were paying 400 rupees a day, or around $7.50, instead of the usual 150.Even Mr. Neti\u2019s uncle, Siya Ram Singh Gond, shook his head gravely at the thought of how long they had lived without these tools. \u201cSo much time was wasted,\u201d he said.Once in a while, Mr. Neti feels he is close to a similar breakthrough with the internet. An example came recently when his father mentioned visiting a district records office to check the boundary of his land. Mr. Neti used Google for a few minutes and then held up his smartphone in front of his father. His father peered at the property lines that Mr. Neti was showing him, accessible on the district administration website, and approved.\u201cThe boundaries were there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all correct.\u201dWithin hours, he had performed the same service for a dozen other men from neighboring farms.\u201cIt was a very happy moment for me,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cMy father also realized this was no ordinary instrument.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In Orange County, the figure is about 1,300.\u2014 The average life sciences salary in California is considerable: more than $108,000.\u2014 Job growth may begin to taper in coming years as companies increasingly rely on automation.Joe Panetta, Biocom\u2019s chief executive, drew a comparison with California\u2019s winemaking industry, which generates roughly $60 billion in annual economic activity.For life sciences? Roughly $317 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s growing. It\u2019s strong. It\u2019s a huge part of the economy,\u201d Mr. Panetta said.That\u2019s despite California\u2019s reputation as a high-regulation, high-tax state. Those factors are blamed for the industry\u2019s tendency to locate their manufacturing and distribution facilities in places like the Midwest.\u201cI think the ecosystem keeps bringing people in, honestly. That\u2019s my hunch,\u201d said Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor who specializes in corporate law at the University of California, Berkeley.And then there\u2019s the Pacific.Many of San Diego\u2019s roughly 750 life sciences labs and businesses have clustered in the seaside community of La Jolla.Robin Toft, who runs a recruiting company dedicated to life sciences, said once someone takes a job in San Diego, they never leave.\u201cIt\u2019s such a lovely place to live,\u201d she said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The rugged isle is part of the chain of eight that makes up the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California.Among them, only Catalina has a significant human population, primarily in Avalon, a resort city of roughly 4,000 people near the island\u2019s eastern tip.The city is out of view in Mr. Oh\u2019s image, which shows Catalina\u2019s western end.\u201cI highly recommend it,\u201d Alex Krowiak, a marine science instructor on Catalina, said of the hike.\u201cYou basically have the entire island to yourself.

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner\u2019s Role Is Tested as Russia Case Grows", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The most successful deal of Jared Kushner\u2019s short and consequential career in real estate and politics involves one highly leveraged acquisition: a pair of adjoining offices a few penny-loafer paces from his father-in-law\u2019s desk in the White House.Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew, spent the Sabbath in fretful seclusion with his wife, Ivanka Trump, at his father-in-law\u2019s resort in Bedminster, N.J., unplugged, per religious custom, from electronics. But he emerged defiant and eager to defend his reputation in congressional hearings, according to two of his associates.What is less clear is how Mr. Kushner\u2019s woes will affect his hard-won influence on a mercurial father-in-law who is eager to put distance between himself and a scandal that is swamping his agenda and, he believes, threatening his family.Some Democrats are calling on the president to revoke Mr. Kushner\u2019s security clearances. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and a chairman of the House committee investigating Russian efforts to sway the 2016 election, suggested in an interview on Sunday that the recent news reports about Mr. Kushner have brought the investigation from the periphery of the Trump campaign and transition teams into the Oval Office.In a statement Sunday night, Mr. Trump praised his son-in-law and the work he has done in the White House.\u201cJared is doing a great job for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person.\u201dBut in recent weeks, the Trump-Kushner relationship, the most stable partnership in an often unstable West Wing, is showing unmistakable signs of strain.It has been duly noted in the White House that Mr. Trump, who feels that he has been ill served by his staff, has increasingly included Mr. Kushner when he dresses down aides and officials, a rarity earlier in his administration and during the campaign.For Mr. Trump, Ms. Meyer\u2019s performance violated two major rules: Politically, it undercut his immigration crackdown, and in a personal sense, it smacked of profiteering off Mr. Trump \u2014 one of the sins that warrants expulsion from his orbit.In the following days during routine West Wing meetings, the president made several snarky, disparaging comments about Mr. Kushner\u2019s family and the visas that were clearly intended to express his annoyance, two aides said. Mr. Kushner did not respond, at least not in earshot.His preppy aesthetic, sotto voce style and preference for backstage maneuvering seemingly set him apart from his father-in-law \u2014 but the similarities outweigh the differences. Both men were reared in the freewheeling, ruthless world of real estate, and both possess an unshakable self-assurance that is both their greatest attribute and their direst vulnerability.Mr. Kushner\u2019s reported feeler to the Russians even as President Barack Obama remained in charge of American foreign policy was a trademark move by someone with a deep confidence in his abilities that critics say borders on conceit, people close to him said. And it echoes his history of sailing forth into unknown territory, including buying a newspaper at age 25 and developing a data-analytics program that he has said helped deliver the presidency to his father-in-law.He is intensely proud of his accomplishments in the private sector and has repeatedly suggested his tenure in Washington will hurt, not help, his brand and bottom line.That unfailing self-regard has not endeared him to the rest of the staff. Resentful Trump staff members have long talked about \u201cJared Island\u201d to describe the special status occupied by Mr. Kushner, who, in their view, is given license to exercise power and take on a vague portfolio \u2014 \u201cMiddle East peace\u201d and \u201cinnovation\u201d are its central components \u2014 without suffering the consequences of failure visited by the president on mere hirelings.Mr. Bannon, a onetime Kushner ally turned adversary known for working himself into ill health, has taken to comparing the former real estate executive to \u201cthe air,\u201d because he blows in and out of meetings leaving little trace, according to one senior Trump aide. Just as Mr. Trump does, Mr. Kushner quickly forms fixed opinions about people, sometimes based on scant evidence. But Mr. Kushner is quicker to admit when he has misjudged a situation, and to change course.Despite the perception that he is the one untouchable adviser in the president\u2019s inner circle, Mr. Kushner was not especially close to his father-in-law before the 2016 campaign. The two bonded when Mr. Kushner helped to take over the campaign\u2019s faltering digital operation and to sell a reluctant Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of Fox News\u2019s parent company, on the viability of his father-in-law\u2019s candidacy by showing him videos of Mr. Trump\u2019s rally during a lunch at Fox headquarters in mid-2015.When asked by friends and associates to describe the source of his influence over the president, Mr. Kushner has offered explanations rooted in loyalty, family and, above all, his acceptance that Mr. Trump is a 70-year-old man of fixed habits who cannot be easily diverted from a course of action.Mr. Kushner is fond of telling friends that he does not have \u201cany vested interests\u201d beyond seeing his father-in-law succeed. Many of the people working for Mr. Trump are not \u201clooking out for the boss, but I am,\u201d Mr. Kushner told a visitor recently.Often, that entails soothing Mr. Trump. Other times, he serves as a goad, as he did in urging Mr. Comey\u2019s ouster and assuring Mr. Trump that it would be a political \u201cwin\u201d that would neutralize protesting Democrats because they had called for Mr. Comey\u2019s ouster over his handling of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, according to six West Wing aides.Mr. Kushner remains infuriated by what he believes to be leaks about his team by Mr. Bannon, who has privately cautioned Mr. Trump against being \u201ccaptured\u201d by liberal, New York \u201cglobalists\u201d associated with his son-in-law, according to three people close to the president.Mr. Trump, however, has had enough. He recently chided Mr. Kushner for continuing to call for Mr. Bannon\u2019s ouster, saying he would not fire his conservative populist adviser \u2014 who has deep connections with Mr. Trump\u2019s white, working-class base \u2014 simply because Mr. Kushner wanted him out, according an administration official.Mr. Trump admires Mr. Kushner\u2019s tough streak, and shares his taste for payback, especially in defense of his family. Over the years, former employees said, Mr. Kushner has quietly sought revenge on enemies whom he sees as hostile to another scandal-buffeted man in his life \u2014 his father, Charles Kushner, a New Jersey-based real estate tycoon who was imprisoned for, among other crimes, efforts to retaliate against his sister for cooperating with a federal inquiry targeting him.Ken Kurson, a friend of Mr. Kushner\u2019s who until this month was the editor in chief of The Observer, said accusations about personal score-settling were \u201ccomplete nonsense,\u201d adding that story ideas \u201ccan and should come from anywhere.\u201dMr. Kushner sees his role as a freelance troubleshooter, but he has focused on foreign policy, friends say, because he saw a gap in the White House structure in that area.Top administration officials know the importance of cultivating him: Last month, he traveled to Iraq at the invitation of Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he serves as a sounding board for officials like Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, according to Elliott Abrams, a Republican foreign policy veteran whom Mr. Trump vetoed for a job in the State Department.\u201cI hear more worries about the president than about Jared,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I never hear complaints about Jared.\u201dJason D. Greenblatt, the White House adviser on international negotiations, said that on the Middle East, at least, Mr. Kushner is not just a sounding board, but an adviser who helps shape policy options for the president. Together with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others, he said, Mr. Kushner helps shape policy decisions to put before the president. He said Mr. Kushner deserves a substantial part of the credit for Mr. Trump\u2019s recent trip to the Middle East. \u201cJared put together all the moving parts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went great.\u201dWith a staff of about a half-dozen, Mr. Kushner has also created an office for innovation that is tackling a disparate array of projects, from promoting apprenticeship programs as an alternative to four-year college degrees to modernizing how the government buys software.Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, said in an email, \u201cHis passion on this is very real.\u201dSo far, on some issues, the innovation office\u2019s role seems mostly advisory. David Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, said he meets with Mr. Kushner about twice a month to discuss his plans to modernize the agency.Asked for a concrete example of how Mr. Kushner\u2019s office has helped him, Mr. Shulkin said aides were pulling together corporate leaders who hired a lot of veterans, \u201cand that\u2019s important.\u201dBut the Russia investigation has shaken Mr. Kushner, friends and associates say. When news broke last week, Mr. Kushner and his wife at first discussed getting a statement denying the report issued through the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II \u2014 who told them that it was not a good precedent to set and that it was a job for a personal attorney.While Mr. Kushner has said he and his wife might move back to Manhattan if it were best for their family, he appears, for now, willing to stay and fight.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that White House officials had reached out to reassure him that Mr. Kushner was willing to cooperate in the inquiry into possible collusion between the Russians and Trump aides. \u201cHe seems to be a very open person,\u201d Mr. Corker said of Mr. Kushner. \u201cI\u2019d let him speak for himself when the time is right.\u201dGlenn Thrush and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "The Great Vietnam War Novel Was Not Written by an American", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byIn 1967, Le Ly Hayslip, then known as Phung Thi Le Ly, was a teenager living and working in Da Nang. A peasant girl who had survived war and rape in her rural village, she had migrated to Da Nang to escape persecution from both Vietnamese Communists and anti-Communists. In 1972 she married an American and moved to the United States, and in 1989 she would publish her powerful autobiographical account of being caught between two sides, \u201cWhen Heaven and Earth Changed Places.\u201d In 2017, it remains perhaps the only first-person book in English about the experiences of Vietnamese villagers caught in the crossfire of the Vietnam War. In her life and work, Ms. Hayslip embodies my broad definition of what it means to be Vietnamese, an identity that includes those in Vietnam or in the diaspora, as well as those who write in Vietnamese or in other languages, in this case English.I came across her book as a college student at Berkeley in the early 1990s. It moved me deeply, not only because it was a compelling memoir, but also because it was one of the few books in English by a Vietnamese writer. (Co-written, in her case, with Jay Wurts.) Searching for my own history as a Vietnamese refugee brought to the United States by an American war in my country of origin, I had not found much available to me in English, either in the original or in translation. The overwhelming amount of American writing about the war was by Americans, and it was, not surprisingly, about Americans.There were a few exceptions. Tran Van Dinh was a former diplomat from the South, the Republic of Vietnam, who stayed in America and wrote two novels dealing with the Vietnam War, \u201cNo Passenger on the River\u201d (1965) and \u201cBlue Dragon, White Tiger\u201d (1983). As a precocious child who read everything I could about the war, I came across the latter in the public library of San Jose, Calif., my hometown, and was puzzled by its anomalousness. Even then I knew that it was rare to find Vietnamese writers in the United States speaking about this war, or to hear any Vietnamese voices at all in mainstream America.Immersed in the stories, feelings and memories of the Vietnamese refugee community in which I grew up, I was determined to tell some of those stories, for I knew that Americans as a whole knew very little about them. Only a small cadre of Americans believed that it was necessary and urgent to learn more about Vietnamese voices and experiences, without which a more complete American understanding of the Vietnam War would never happen. American ignorance of Vietnamese history, culture and politics helped draw the United States into a war and a country that it did not comprehend. This pattern of ignorance arguably continues today, both in terms of what Americans continue to ignore about Vietnam and what Americans refuse to know about the Middle East. Literature plays an important role as a corrective to this ignorance.As the writer Le Thi Diem Thuy and so many others have said, time and again, Vietnam is a country, not a war. One need only read the short story collection \u201cThe General Retires,\u201d by the masterful Nguyen Huy Thiep, to understand this. His stories reveal the complexities of postwar life in a disillusioned Vietnam, struggling to rebuild itself and to reconcile the hypocrisies and failures of Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese state with the noble wartime rhetoric of the Communist Party. At the same time, war defined a generation, and its consequences have shaped the generation after, as Ms. Thuy reveals in \u201cThe Gangster We Are All Looking For.\u201dThis lyrical novel tells the story of a young refugee girl in San Diego whose family is haunted by the soldier father\u2019s trauma and the death of her brother, lost in the refugee flight. Like much of Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American literature dealing with the war, her novel shows that war affects more than soldiers or men. The Vietnam War was not remarkable in killing more civilians than soldiers, and in turning millions of civilians into refugees whose experiences were much more traumatic than those of the many American soldiers who never actually saw combat. Vietnamese-American literature forces its readers to acknowledge that a narrow definition of war that features only soldiers is inaccurate.The list goes on. The literature by Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans is out there for anyone who knows how to use Google. But so many here and abroad would rather not know, or when a new Vietnamese author is published, would prefer to say, \u201cAt last! A voice for the Vietnamese!\u201d In fact, there are so many voices, for the Vietnamese people are very loud. They just often aren\u2019t heard by those who don\u2019t understand Vietnamese, or those who would prefer to think of Americans when they hear the word \u201cVietnam,\u201d or those who have room in their course syllabuses for only one Vietnamese book, as is still the case in too many college classes on the Vietnam War, even if that one book is as worthy as Bao Ninh\u2019s novel \u201cThe Sorrow of War.\u201d This book is not just a North Vietnamese war classic \u2014 it is a classic war novel of any time and any place.As for the Communist Party of Vietnam, it, too, would rather not hear certain voices. Even Bao Ninh is silenced now, as is his great compatriot, Duong Thu Huong, the disillusioned northern veteran who was exiled for her disturbing postwar anti-Communist novels, books like \u201cNovel Without a Name\u201d and \u201cParadise of the Blind.\u201d As for Vietnamese-American voices, while we are occasionally heard here \u2014 and then often forgotten \u2014 we are rarely heard in Vietnam. We are the losers, the traitors, the dissidents or simply the outsiders who see the nothingness behind a party that praises Communism while running the country as a capitalist dictatorship.Like Le Ly Hayslip, we are caught between sides, Vietnam and America, Vietnamese and English, Communism and capitalism. As difficult as such a situation is, it is good for writers. The discomfort makes us write our stories, again and again, in the hope that we can change what people think of when they hear \u201cVietnam.\u201dAn earlier version of this essay omitted a word from the title of a novel by Le Thi Diem Thuy. It is \u201cThe Gangster We Are All Looking For,\u201d not \u201cThe Gangster We Are Looking For.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Still Need Your Brain", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byGray MatterMost adults recall memorizing the names of rivers or the Pythagorean theorem in school and wondering, \u201cWhen am I ever gonna use this stuff?\u201d Kids today have a high-profile spokesman. Jonathan Rochelle, the director of Google\u2019s education apps group, said last year at an industry conference that he \u201ccannot answer\u201d why his children should learn the quadratic equation. He wonders why they cannot \u201cask Google.\u201d If Mr. Rochelle cannot answer his children, I can.Google is good at finding information, but the brain beats it in two essential ways. Champions of Google underestimate how much the meaning of words and sentences changes with context. Consider vocabulary. Every teacher knows that a sixth grader, armed with a thesaurus, will often submit a paper studded with words used in not-quite-correct ways, like the student who looked up \u201cmeticulous,\u201d saw it meant \u201cvery careful,\u201d and wrote \u201cI was meticulous when I fell off the cliff.\u201dWith the right knowledge in memory, your brain deftly puts words in context. Consider \u201cTrisha spilled her coffee.\u201d When followed by the sentence \u201cDan jumped up to get a rag,\u201d the brain instantly highlights one aspect of the meaning of \u201cspill\u201d \u2014 spills make a mess. Had the second sentence been \u201cDan jumped up to get her more,\u201d you would have thought instead of the fact that \u201cspill\u201d means Trisha had less of something. Still another aspect of meaning would come to mind had you read, \u201cDan jumped up, howling in pain.\u201dThe meaning of \u201cspill\u201d depends on context, but dictionaries, including internet dictionaries, necessarily offer context-free meanings. That\u2019s why kids fall off cliffs meticulously.Perhaps internet searches will become more sensitive to context, but until our brains communicate directly with silicon chips, there\u2019s another problem \u2014 speed.Quick access is supposed to be a great advantage of using the internet. Students have always been able to look up the quadratic equation rather than memorize it, but opening a new browser tab takes moments, not the minutes required to locate the right page in the right book. Yet \u201cmoments\u201d is still much slower than the brain operates.Speed matters when the quadratic equation is part of a larger problem. Imagine solving 397,394 x 9 if you hadn\u2019t memorized the multiplication table. Sure, you could look up 4 x 9, but you could easily lose the thread of the problem as you did so. That\u2019s why the National Mathematics Advisory Panel listed \u201cquick and effortless recall of facts\u201d as one essential of math education.Deeper knowledge of words also helps. Your knowledge of what a word means, how it\u2019s spelled and how it sounds are actually separate in the brain. That\u2019s why you may recall one but not the others, as when you know what you want to say (\u201csomeone who owes money\u201d) but can\u2019t find the word (\u201cdebtor\u201d). Good readers have reliable, speedy connections among the brain representations of spelling, sound and meaning. Speed matters because it allows other important work \u2014 for example, puzzling out the meaning of phrases \u2014 to proceed.Using knowledge in the head is also self-sustaining, whereas using knowledge from the internet is not. Every time you retrieve information from memory, it becomes a bit easier to find it the next time. That\u2019s why students studying for a test actually remember more if they quiz themselves than if they study as they typically do, by rereading their textbook or notes. That parades the right ideas before the mind, but doesn\u2019t make them stick. In the same way, you won\u2019t learn your way around a city if you always use your GPS, but you will if you work to remember the route you took last time.The brain beats the internet when it comes to context and speed, but the internet clobbers the brain when it comes to volume. You can find any fact on the internet, even alternative ones. Your brain, in contrast, is limited, so how should we choose what to learn?Students should learn the information for which the internet is a poor substitute. Getting information from the internet takes time, so they should memorize facts that are needed fast and frequently. Elementary math facts and the sounds of letters are obvious choices, but any information that is needed with high frequency is a candidate \u2014 in algebra, that\u2019s the quadratic equation.The internet is poor at putting information in context. Kids who look up the quadratic equation may end up like the child who looked up \u201cmeticulous\u201d; they have a definition, but they don\u2019t have the background knowledge to use it correctly. Students should learn not only the formula but also why it works and how it connects to other math content. That\u2019s how contextual knowledge develops in the brain, and that\u2019s why vocabulary instruction seldom consists of simple memorization of definitions \u2014 students are asked to use the words in a variety of sentences. The same should be true of more advanced concepts and for the same reason.It\u2019s a grave mistake to think Google can replace your memory. It can, however, complement it, if we keep in mind what each does best.An opinion article last week about why you still need your brain and cannot outsource knowledge to the web inaccurately described where Jonathan Rochelle, a Google executive, made comments about the quadratic equation. He made them at an industry conference last year, not in a recent interview with The Times.Daniel T. Willingham is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Reading Mind: A Cognitive Approach to Understanding How the Mind Reads.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Enduring Appeal of Seeing Trump as Chess Master in Chief", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byNotebookAs a theory of Trump\u2019s actions, the chess-master meme is notable for its total lack of predictive power. Instead, it acts as an explanatory bridge across the wide abyss between two observable tendencies: that Trump keeps doing unexpected or abnormal things; and that his political opponents, and the media, can\u2019t seem to stop him.Yet Comey\u2019s firing, and the subsequent week of dizzying disclosures and scoops and escalations \u2014 few favoring Trump \u2014 have led to a revival of 4-D-chess talk on the right. On the Reddit forum dedicated to the president, the heights of the mid-May news frenzy were met with counterintuitive assurances that any investigation into Trump or Russian influence would surely lead back to the Clintons. Bill Mitchell, the singularly dedicated pro-Trump pundit and chess theorist, agreed, albeit in poker terms. \u201cA year from today, Democrats will curse the day they ever demanded a special counsel,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey bluffed, and Trump just called it.\u201dChess theory, in other words, is primarily a defensive tool. Trump\u2019s earliest online supporters used it to pre-empt claims about their bizarre and unlikely favorite, then to vex opponents who believed, as many Trump supporters did, that election night would end in defeat. After Trump\u2019s win, it was liberals who had the most to answer for and who took possession of the theory. Since the election, it is most visibly articulated by whichever party feels, at any given moment, that it\u2019s under attack or not making progress: by liberals after executive orders or shattering appointments, by Trump supporters when the news cycle becomes suffocating. Liberal chess theory is on a break for now, but it will return in the next moment of relative calm in which Donald Trump stubbornly remains president.John Herrman is a David Carr fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 S\u00f6ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.Instead, he went to China.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Schwertfeger said.Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China\u2019s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.China\u2019s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu \u2014 often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition \u2014 this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.\u201cIt\u2019s a race in the new generation of computing,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe difference is that China seems to think it\u2019s a race and America doesn\u2019t.\u201dFor Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.\u201dQuantifying China\u2019s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn\u2019t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation\u2019s spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cIt\u2019s the habit that yes is more risky than no.\u201dAuthorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China\u2019s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.\u201cThe lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut it has started to change.\u201dAt the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America\u2019s research institutions.Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.It\u2019s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.Baidu is a leader in China\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary \u2014 take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is \u2014 into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.In an apparent effort to harness Baidu\u2019s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a \u201cmilitary-use intelligent ground robot,\u201d was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China\u2019s seven schools of national defense.A company spokeswoman said: \u201cBaidu develops products and services that improve people\u2019s lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.\u201dStill, there are advantages in China\u2019s developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.\u201cAfter AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,\u201d said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, \u201cthe content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.\u201d Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Mr. Shirky said, \u201cunlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that\u2019s never been Beijing\u2019s favorite characteristic.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and John Markoff from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "How Tales of \u2018Flippers\u2019 Led to a Housing Bubble", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewThere is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives \u2014 like tales of getting rich through \u201cflipping\u201d houses and shares of initial public offerings \u2014 that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn\u2019t tell us why.Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn\u2019t flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \u201ca thing\u201d in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and \u201980s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump\u2019s well-timed 2004 book, \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,\u201d written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but made fortunes anyway.The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators\u2019 power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Internet Is Broken\u2019: @ev Is Trying to Salvage It", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Evan Williams is the guy who opened up Pandora\u2019s box. Until he came along, people had few places to go with their overflowing emotions and wild opinions, other than writing a letter to the newspaper or haranguing the neighbors.Mr. Williams \u2014 a Twitter founder, a co-creator of Blogger \u2014 set everyone free, providing tools to address the world. In the history of communications technology, it was a development with echoes of Gutenberg.And so here we are in 2017. How\u2019s it going, Mr. Williams?\u201cI think the internet is broken,\u201d he says. He has believed this for a few years, actually. But things are getting worse. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a lot more obvious to a lot of people that it\u2019s broken.\u201d\u201cI thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,\u201d Mr. Williams says. \u201cI was wrong about that.\u201dThe Silicon Valley entrepreneur first drew notice during the dot-com boom, for developing software that allowed users to easily set up a website for broadcasting their thoughts: blogging. By the time Google bought the company in 2003, more than a million people were using it.Then came Twitter, which wasn\u2019t his idea but was his company. He remains the largest individual shareholder and a board member.After fame and fortune come regrets. Mr. Williams is trying to fix some things. So, in different ways, are Google and Facebook, and even Twitter. This is a moment for patches and promises.The trouble with the internet, Mr. Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you\u2019re driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behavior like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them.His goal is to break this pattern. \u201cIf I learn that every time I drive down this road I\u2019m going to see more and more car crashes,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a different road.\u201dBut a new road may have other problems. It may, for instance, be a dead end.Mr. Williams isn\u2019t the only one trying to fix this mess, of course. If he and others can\u2019t find a path forward, if they can\u2019t solve what he calls \u201cthe architecture of content creation, distribution and monetization on the internet,\u201d there are unsettling implications for the future of news and ideas. Maybe it will be all car crashes, all the time. Twitter already feels like that.\u201cA beautiful space for reading and writing \u2014 and little else,\u201d Mr. Williams called Medium at its public debut in 2012. \u201cThe words are central.\u201dEarly chatter was enthusiastic, based on Mr. Williams\u2019s track record and the site\u2019s ease of use. But Medium, which began out of step with nearly all other media, now seems to inhabit a different universe.Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Mr. Williams\u2019s 85-employee hobby. \u201cThe notion that you\u2019re going to succeed as a writing site simply by putting quality first is not compatible with venture capital revenue expectations,\u201d said Bill Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant. \u201cNo one would have funded this if it weren\u2019t by Ev Williams.\u201dMr. Williams\u2019s supporters say that is a feature, not a bug, and that publishing needs all the experiments it can get. But they concede the road will be difficult.Biz Stone was at Twitter with Mr. Williams from the beginning. He joined his old friend at Medium as both a board member and an investor.\u201cEv chose the hardest thing to do,\u201d Mr. Stone says. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to make publishing profitable.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah, so does everyone else.\u2019 How far along are we? Somewhere between zero and half a percent.\u201dMr. Williams is 45, bearded and stick-thin. He looks more like a Beatnik poet, staying up until dawn to debate existentialism, than the son of a Nebraska farmer, which he is. Growing up in a place where he felt new people and new ideas were in short supply, he was starved for someone to talk to. Living in a football-loving culture, and hating what he called \u201cthe stereotypical jock mentality, small brains thinking they\u2019re superior because they\u2019re surrounded by big muscles,\u201d did not help, Mr. Williams said.A few years ago, Twitter was viewed as a tool of liberation. It enabled, some believed, the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. Twitter, like the internet itself, was putting tyranny on a short leash.Then the narrative turned darker, with the rise of trolling on the platform.\u201cIt\u2019s a very bad thing, Twitter\u2019s role in that,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that he wouldn\u2019t be president if it weren\u2019t for Twitter, then yeah, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Williams\u2019s remarks.In a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska this month, Mr. Williams noted that Silicon Valley has a tendency to see itself as a Prometheus, stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals. \u201cWhat we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity,\u201d Mr. Williams told the crowd. \u201cSome would say that\u2019s what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump.\u201dMr. Williams\u2019s mistake was expecting the internet to resemble the person he saw in the mirror: serious, high-minded.\u201cI\u2019ve come to realize Ev is extremely intellectual and introspective,\u201d Mr. Stone says. \u201cIf he could wave a magic wand, he\u2019d have everyone write the kind of things he likes, like, \u2018Here are suggestions on climate change.\u2019\u201dIt was just another Utopian dream, Mr. Williams says. \u201cThe problem is that not everyone is going to be cool, because humans are humans,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lock on our office door and our homes at night. The internet was started without the expectation that we\u2019d have to do that online.\u201dWriters want readers and, usually, money. Readers want to be entertained, instructed or outraged. Publishers need revenues and profits. Yet no one has come up with a satisfactory and sustainable way of harnessing the internet to satisfy all these parties without descending into sleaze and clickbait.Money, of course.In the beginning, Medium had an editorial staff that sought out writers and rewarded them modestly for their contributions, just like a traditional magazine. Abby Norman, then in her early 20s and working for the medical records department of a Maine hospital, was pulled in.\u201cAd-driven systems can only reward attention,\u201d Mr. Williams says. \u201cThey can\u2019t reward the right answer. Consumer-paid systems can. They can reward value. The inevitable solution: People will have to pay for quality content.\u201dMr. Williams was late to arrive at this solution. The rest of the media got there long ago.Medium declined to say how many subscribers it has, saying that its effort is still informal. In any case, it\u2019s not going to be an online magazine. Mr. Williams resists the notion that Medium should be seen as a traditional publisher, commissioning, editing and making stuff available.He suggested instead the bookstore model. Bookstores don\u2019t commission material, but they curate it and sell it. \u201cWrite whatever you want, and we\u2019ll pay you based on certain terms,\u201d Mr. Williams says now. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m the publisher, or you?\u201dAs Medium struggles to define itself, the older new communications platforms \u2014 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2014 are trying to deal with their unexpected toxicity.\u201cI think we will fix these things,\u201d Mr. Williams says. Just don\u2019t hold your breath. The work has barely begun, he says. \u201cTwenty years isn\u2019t very long to change how society works.\u201dJames Hong, best known for the popular rating-and-dating site Hot or Not? in the early 2000s, was an angel investor in Medium. He once told Mr. Williams that he had some new ideas about dating sites but feared that if he tackled them, \u201cI\u2019d be working on the same thing my whole entire life.\u201dMr. Williams had pondered for a moment and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on the same thing my whole life.\u201dMr. Hong said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a vanity project, it\u2019s his calling. Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan.\u201dThat kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph.\u201cMedium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated,\u201d Mr. Watson says. \u201cBut as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally. And that post-Obama world holds no room for minimalist, distinguished, self-important, elevated thoughtfulness.\u201dSo what\u2019s a mere writer to do? Mr. Watson says he is now working on a screenplay.Medium maintains it is doing well by the metrics it cares about. The company says that the number of posts on the site quadrupled in 2016, and that it has 60 million unique monthly readers. After raising $130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $600 million last year.Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever.Mr. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult, but flat-out impossible. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, and they\u2019re not,\u201d he says.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying not to die, frankly,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve really moved on to other things out of necessity.\u201dAnd yet. Medium hasn\u2019t solved the problem of publishing on the internet, but neither has anyone else.\u201cI\u2019ll pitch them, because I\u2019ve been invested all this time and I\u2019ve hung on and hung on,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d like to see how it all pans out. I\u2019d like to see it through.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Self-Driving Cars See", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byWheelsGiant tech companies are fighting over the technology in court. Start-ups around the world are racing to develop new versions of it. And engineers say it is essential to making autonomous cars safe.The obscure object of desire: lidar.\u201cWe believe it will be the basis for autonomous driving,\u201d said Guillaume Devauchelle, who oversees innovation at Valeo, a major parts supplier to automakers.The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to trees to cyclists in a variety of environments and under a variety of lighting conditions. While autonomous car designs use numerous sensors, including ultrasonic, radar and video camera components, lidar has unique abilities. Unlike cameras, for example, lidar cannot be fooled by shadows or blinded by bright sunlight.The biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption is an economic one, and that is where the battle is being waged.When Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, the lidar sensors it used cost roughly $75,000. Those sensors were made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader. Velodyne declined to say what the current pricing is for such systems, but Waymo\u2019s chief executive, John Krafcik, said in a recent presentation that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 percent.But even at $7,500, such systems are seen as too expensive to meet automakers\u2019 demands.The race to fill that void is largely focused on producing solid-state lidar systems, which would shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts involved in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that could bring costs down, said Hongbo Zhang, a research associate at Virginia Tech who is working on a lidar design. Established automotive suppliers, such as Velodyne and Valeo; technology companies like Waymo and Uber; and relative newcomers like Innoviz, LeddarTech and Quanergy all have their sights set on making less expensive sensors.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.But most of the researchers working on these designs still believe they can produce them for much lower prices, and Hyundai has demonstrated in its Ioniq autonomous test cars how such sensors could be made less conspicuous and concealed in the bumpers and roof pillars of vehicles.Velodyne, which says it is the only current third-party lidar supplier for fully autonomous vehicles now being tested, is well aware that start-ups are gunning for its business. Velodyne is working on its own solid-state Velarray lidar sensor, said Mike Jellen, Velodyne president, and it plans to start mass-producing them next year in a 200,000-square-foot factory in San Jose, Calif.While there has been considerable speculation about how Velodyne will face the potential price competition, Mr. Jellen declined to estimate how much the new sensors might cost, saying only that a complete lidar sensor package for future vehicles might be priced in the \u201clow thousands\u201d per vehicle.Other companies building complete autonomous driving packages expect prices to fall faster.\u201cThe problem is that we\u2019re still in A.I. learning mode and only buying in quantities of a couple thousand,\u201d said Velodyne\u2019s Jellen, referring to artificial intelligence. \u201cThe problem is, the market isn\u2019t there yet.\u201dThere are also some technical kinks that need to be ironed out with new systems. Different versions of lidar paint images of the world around them in different ways, said Mr. Zhang at Virginia Tech. That means different lidar sensors from different companies cannot simply be exchanged for one another on an autonomous BMW or Ford vehicle. How a car is trained and learns will partly depend on the specific type of lidar used.In spite of these challenges, Mr. Keilaf of Innoviz and many others say there will not be fully autonomous cars without lidar \u2014 and it will have to be cheap.It will also have to meet exceptionally high standards.\u201cAn autonomous vehicle that\u2019s 99 percent safe won\u2019t be good enough,\u201d said Mr. Russell of Luminar. \u201cThis is mission critical. You can\u2019t afford to miss a single object because that object could be a person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Aren\u2019t Built to Live in the Moment", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byOpinionWhat best distinguishes our species is an ability that scientists are just beginning to appreciate: We contemplate the future. Our singular foresight created civilization and sustains society. It usually lifts our spirits, but it\u2019s also the source of most depression and anxiety, whether we\u2019re evaluating our own lives or worrying about the nation. Other animals have springtime rituals for educating the young, but only we subject them to \u201ccommencement\u201d speeches grandly informing them that today is the first day of the rest of their lives.Behaviorists thought of animal learning as the ingraining of habit by repetition. Psychoanalysts believed that treating patients was a matter of unearthing and confronting the past. Even when cognitive psychology emerged, it focused on the past and present \u2014 on memory and perception.But it is increasingly clear that the mind is mainly drawn to the future, not driven by the past. Behavior, memory and perception can\u2019t be understood without appreciating the central role of prospection. We learn not by storing static records but by continually retouching memories and imagining future possibilities. Our brain sees the world not by processing every pixel in a scene but by focusing on the unexpected.Our emotions are less reactions to the present than guides to future behavior. Therapists are exploring new ways to treat depression now that they see it as primarily not because of past traumas and present stresses but because of skewed visions of what lies ahead.Prospection enables us to become wise not just from our own experiences but also by learning from others. We are social animals like no others, living and working in very large groups of strangers, because we have jointly constructed the future. Human culture \u2014 our language, our division of labor, our knowledge, our laws and technology \u2014 is possible only because we can anticipate what fellow humans will do in the distant future. We make sacrifices today to earn rewards tomorrow, whether in this life or in the afterlife promised by so many religions.If you\u2019re a chimp, you spend much of the day searching for your next meal. If you\u2019re a human, you can usually rely on the foresight of your supermarket\u2019s manager, or you can make a restaurant reservation for Saturday evening thanks to a remarkably complicated feat of collaborative prospection. You and the restaurateur both imagine a future time \u2014 \u201cSaturday\u201d exists only as a collective fantasy \u2014 and anticipate each other\u2019s actions. You trust the restaurateur to acquire food and cook it for you. She trusts you to show up and give her money, which she will accept only because she expects her landlord to accept it in exchange for occupying his building.When making plans, they reported higher levels of happiness and lower levels of stress than at other times, presumably because planning turns a chaotic mass of concerns into an organized sequence. Although they sometimes feared what might go wrong, on average there were twice as many thoughts of what they hoped would happen.While most people tend to be optimistic, those suffering from depression and anxiety have a bleak view of the future \u2014 and that in fact seems to be the chief cause of their problems, not their past traumas nor their view of the present. While traumas do have a lasting impact, most people actually emerge stronger afterward. Others continue struggling because they over-predict failure and rejection. Studies have shown depressed people are distinguished from the norm by their tendency to imagine fewer positive scenarios while overestimating future risks.They withdraw socially and become paralyzed by exaggerated self-doubt. A bright and accomplished student imagines: If I flunk the next test, then I\u2019ll let everyone down and show what a failure I really am. Researchers have begun successfully testing therapies designed to break this pattern by training sufferers to envision positive outcomes (imagine passing the test) and to see future risks more realistically (think of the possibilities remaining even if you flunk the test).Most prospection occurs at the unconscious level as the brain sifts information to generate predictions. Our systems of vision and hearing, like those of animals, would be overwhelmed if we had to process every pixel in a scene or every sound around us. Perception is manageable because the brain generates its own scene, so that the world remains stable even though your eyes move three times a second. This frees the perceptual system to heed features it didn\u2019t predict, which is why you\u2019re not aware of a ticking clock unless it stops. It\u2019s also why you don\u2019t laugh when you tickle yourself: You already know what\u2019s coming next.The brain\u2019s long-term memory has often been compared to an archive, but that\u2019s not its primary purpose. Instead of faithfully recording the past, it keeps rewriting history. Recalling an event in a new context can lead to new information being inserted in the memory. Coaching of eyewitnesses can cause people to reconstruct their memory so that no trace of the original is left.The fluidity of memory may seem like a defect, especially to a jury, but it serves a larger purpose. It\u2019s a feature, not a bug, because the point of memory is to improve our ability to face the present and the future. To exploit the past, we metabolize it by extracting and recombining relevant information to fit novel situations.This discovery explains what happens when your mind wanders during a task: It\u2019s simulating future possibilities. That\u2019s how you can respond so quickly to unexpected developments. What may feel like a primitive intuition, a gut feeling, is made possible by those previous simulations.Suppose you get an email invitation to a party from a colleague at work. You\u2019re momentarily stumped. You vaguely recall turning down a previous invitation, which makes you feel obliged to accept this one, but then you imagine having a bad time because you don\u2019t like him when he\u2019s drinking. But then you consider you\u2019ve never invited him to your place, and you uneasily imagine that turning this down would make him resentful, leading to problems at work.Methodically weighing these factors would take a lot of time and energy, but you\u2019re able to make a quick decision by using the same trick as the Google search engine when it replies to your query in less than a second. Google can instantly provide a million answers because it doesn\u2019t start from scratch. It\u2019s continually predicting what you might ask.If Homo prospectus takes the really long view, does he become morbid? That was a longstanding assumption in psychologists\u2019 \u201cterror management theory,\u201d which held that humans avoid thinking about the future because they fear death. The theory was explored in hundreds of experiments assigning people to think about their own deaths. One common response was to become more assertive about one\u2019s cultural values, like becoming more patriotic.But there\u2019s precious little evidence that people actually spend much time outside the lab thinking about their deaths or managing their terror of mortality. It\u2019s certainly not what psychologists found in the study tracking Chicagoans\u2019 daily thoughts. Less than 1 percent of their thoughts involved death, and even those were typically about other people\u2019s deaths.Homo prospectus is too pragmatic to obsess on death for the same reason that he doesn\u2019t dwell on the past: There\u2019s nothing he can do about it. He became Homo sapiens by learning to see and shape his future, and he is wise enough to keep looking straight ahead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Judge Denies Uber\u2019s Motion for Private Arbitration", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byA federal judge denied a motion to move a legal showdown between Uber and Waymo into private arbitration, according to a court document filed Thursday evening, a decision that sets the stage for a public, bare-knuckle trial between the two companies.At the heart of the suit is Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer and a veteran of self-driving technology who Waymo has claimed stole technology from Google before leaving to form Otto, his own autonomous-vehicle start-up. Waymo has argued that Uber conspired with Mr. Levandowski to use those stolen files in Uber\u2019s self-driving-car designs after Uber purchased Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up for $680 million. Uber has denied the accusation.But the already-trying civil process for Mr. Levandowski \u2014 who is not being sued \u2014 has now raised the specter of a criminal case. In a separate order, the judge overseeing the dispute suggested that a federal prosecutor review the matter.In making its case for arbitration, Uber pointed to a previous arbitration clause from Mr. Levandowski\u2019s employment contract with Google.In a statement, Waymo said that justification was \u201ca desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d\u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,\u201d the statement said.It was yet another turn in a high-profile case between two technology giants who have made huge bets that self-driving automobiles will dominate the transportation landscape of the future.The case began in February and has proceeded in fits and starts, partly because Mr. Levandowski has resisted providing information on the files he has been accused of stealing. Mr. Levandowski has exercised his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, which has prevented Uber and Waymo from obtaining certain information and documents in the continuing case.Judge William Alsup of United States District Court for the Northern District of California, who is presiding in the case, ruled that moving it to private arbitration could make it even more difficult to establish a clear timeline of events in the case.\u201cAs a practical matter,\u201d Judge Alsup wrote, \u201cit is hard to imagine how consolidating proceedings as to Levandowski and defendants, whether here or in arbitration, could alleviate these difficulties.\u201dJudge Alsup also referred the case to the United States attorney for an investigation into a possible theft of trade secrets, according to a court filing. Such an investigation could lead to criminal charges for Mr. Levandowski.\u201cWe remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum,\u201d Niki Christoff, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Looks to Regain Lost Ground in the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Last week, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, slipped on a glove made of cardboard and clenched his hand into a fist, causing a robotic hand with fingers made of drinking straws to mimic his movements.The glove was one of several engineering projects built in a makeshift laboratory on Microsoft\u2019s campus. The company spent the last year talking to thousands of teachers and designing high-tech experiments that require mostly low-cost parts. It will give the designs to schools for free so teachers can use them in their lesson plans.The projects are part of a major push the company announced Tuesday at an event in New York to make its products more attractive to school administrators, students and teachers. The push includes a new version of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system for classrooms, tweaks to its Office applications and a new Surface laptop for students in a collection of bold colors.While the dollars available in the education market are compelling enough for big technology companies like Microsoft, classrooms also offer an opportunity to make a first impression on young people who could eventually buy their products.\u201cThe second-order effects of education, of being relevant in education, are going to be very, very key for us,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in an interview last week. He added, \u201cThe devices the kids take to their school, or to their college, is going to be influenced by what they were familiar with.\u201dGoogle has gained ground in public schools by offering a tightly connected system of free classroom apps, lower-cost laptops called Chromebooks and a web-based console that allows schools to remotely manage thousands of student devices.Industry analysts said Microsoft\u2019s initiative was the company\u2019s first credible response to Google\u2019s recent encroachment into education.\u201cI am not going to predict that they are going to take back the entire market or anything like that, but this is the best move that I could have seen them making against Chromebooks,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, where Microsoft is one of his clients.Some of Microsoft\u2019s moves are intended to make its products more appealing to educators by simplifying them and, in some ways, restricting them. The new version of its operating system, Windows 10 S, will run only applications that have been vetted by Microsoft and placed in its online app store, to prevent students from downloading software that could slow the performance of their computers.Microsoft has also devised a way for schools to get new computers running on a network quickly, without manually configuring each one, by plugging in a USB memory stick. A Microsoft management system called Intune for Education allows schools to set further limits on classroom computers, like locking them down so students cannot cheat by surfing the web during tests.The tools are designed to be easy enough for teachers to use, since many schools do not have dedicated technology administrators. \u201cSometimes school districts aren\u2019t managing the devices,\u201d said Terry Myerson, a Microsoft executive vice president. \u201cTeachers are on the front lines of managing the devices.\u201dThe company is also making full versions of its Office applications, rather than more limited web versions, available to schools for free. It has modified a version of its Microsoft Teams group-chat tool so teachers can collaborate with students. It is also waiving the cost of an educational version of Minecraft, a popular video game it owns, for the first year schools use it.While much of Microsoft\u2019s focus is on software that makes using inexpensive devices \u2014 often in the $200 to $300 range \u2014 more palatable, the company will also release a $999 device called the Surface Laptop, a twist on its Surface tablets. The device will run Windows 10 S.Tech companies are fiercely competing for business in primary and secondary schools in the United States, a technology market expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Ibis Capital, a technology investment firm, and EdtechXGlobal, a conference company.It is a matter of some urgency for Microsoft.Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, compared with less than 1 percent in 2012, according to Futuresource Consulting, a research company. By contrast, Windows laptops and tablets made up 21.6 percent of the mobile-device shipments to schools in the United States last year, down from about 43 percent in 2012.Outside the United States, Microsoft Windows devices accounted for about 64 percent of mobile-device shipments to schools last year, Futuresource said.Like Microsoft, Apple is not taking the Chromebook phenomenon lying down. Apple recently introduced an iPad management app called Classroom, which enables teachers to assign shared iPads to students and create virtual classrooms to guide students through lessons. Apple also introduced lower pricing for educational institutions on its newest iPad model. The iPad starts at $329 for consumers and at $299 for schools.By contrast, Mr. Gownder of Forrester Research said that Microsoft software is so feature-rich that technology experts in many school districts have had to devote their summers to preparing Windows laptops for students one device at a time.And some of Microsoft\u2019s initial attempts to contend with Google\u2019s rise in schools stumbled. In 2014, Microsoft announced it would be going head-to-head with Chromebooks by working with device manufacturers to introduce cheaper Windows laptops. But some schools found the lower-priced Windows devices too cheaply made to withstand student use and too low-powered to efficiently run Microsoft software.\u201cThe cheapest of them would not work,\u201d said Hal Friedlander, a former chief information officer of the New York City Department of Education.Google began to win the classroom software wars as well. In 2014, the company introduced Google Classroom, an app that teachers could use to digitize daily tasks, like assigning homework or taking attendance. It quickly became a hub where teachers could hold class discussions, communicate with individual students and keep parents updated on classroom news.While Microsoft had successfully developed a loyal following among teachers for certain tools \u2014 like Skype and its OneNote notebook organizer program \u2014 the company had no answer for the classroom management system, which Google had developed specifically for teachers.Officials at Omaha Public Schools, which spends about $570,000 annually on Microsoft software and is investing $8 million to buy students Windows devices, welcomed the company\u2019s more comprehensive approach to the classroom.About 200 teachers in the district have completed professional development activities called the Microsoft Innovative Educator program. Some of those teachers are already using the Microsoft Teams chat service with their students.\u201cNow it\u2019s not four or five different experiences based on which app you are using,\u201d said Rob Dickson, the executive director of information management services for Omaha Public Schools. \u201cIt\u2019s a single app with all those experiences within it.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Redmond, Wash., and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coal Country\u2019s Power Plants Are Turning Away From Coal", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byCoal is on the defensive in the nation\u2019s power industry. Even in coal country.The pressure to shift more of the country\u2019s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry\u2019s biggest customers, like General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it \u2014 and keep them from taking their business elsewhere \u2014 utilities are changing their ways.West Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception.Appalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012.Chris Beam, the company\u2019s president, made the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)It\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.And in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201dAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.Coal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201dFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.Last year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201dOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.Appalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201dMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Most nights, he went for long runs through the town\u2019s hills, streets and marinas.On the album\u2019s epic, introspective title track, he sings that he would \u201crather be a functioning cog in some great machinery serving something beyond me\u201d and admits, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that will be/I\u2019ll get back to you someday soon,\u201d with an answer.\u201cSoon,\u201d it turned out, was relative. When Fleet Foxes\u2019 new album, \u201cCrack-Up,\u201d is released on Friday, June 16, it will be more than six years since \u201cHelplessness Blues.\u201d But the band is returning with a weighty, ambitious album of shape-shifting songs that builds on the exacting finger-plucked guitar melodies and cooing multipart harmonies central to its earlier music. At a time when indie-rock seems be growing more culturally marginal by the day, \u201cCrack-Up\u201d is a defiant artistic statement, an album that dares to feel important. It leaked more than a month before its scheduled release date, a frustrating turn of events but one the band ultimately found encouraging.\u201cIt leaked because people want it,\u201d Skye Skjelset, the band\u2019s guitarist, said during an interview alongside Mr. Pecknold in a 113-year-old Japanese restaurant here on the day of the leak. The two friends had started Fleet Foxes together as teenagers. Today, Mr. Skjelset, 31, rail-thin with an angular face and shoulder-length brown hair, was dressed head to toe in black; Mr. Pecknold, also 31, tall and lean, with sleepy eyes, wore a tattered green Army jacket, dark pants and a knit cap. Mr. Pecknold admitted he spent part of the day reading internet comments about the new album. \u201cMost of them were positive. Then there was one that just said, \u2018Boring,\u2019\u201d he said with a short laugh.For a time, it wasn\u2019t clear there would even be an album to leak. Songwriting sessions in 2013 quickly petered out. \u201cIt felt O.K. to not have to think about doing it for a long time,\u201d Mr. Skjelset said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to be as long as it was. I definitely came to terms with the fact that this band was never happening again.\u201d\u201cYou did?\u201d Mr. Pecknold said, turning to his friend, surprised.\u201cFor sure,\u201d Mr. Skjelset answered.The seeds of the long hiatus were planted during the tortured process of making \u201cHelplessness Blues.\u201d As Mr. Pecknold grew increasingly obsessed with realizing his vision, his band mates often became little more than sidemen. The rest of his life crumbled. He split with his longtime girlfriend and was experiencing what he called \u201can early-onset identity crisis.\u201d As touring began, relationships within the band frayed. Mr. Pecknold was also in physical pain, having delayed surgery for an ailment he prefers to keep private.In the fall of 2012, Mr. Pecknold left Portland, Ore., where he\u2019d only recently moved: \u201cI got rid of all my stuff and was just floating around for six months.\u201d He cut his hair short and shaved his beard, then backpacked alone in Hawaii and Nepal and attended the woodworking school. For about eight months, he rarely touched a guitar. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be cool to be unmoored for a little while.\u201dIn 2013, he enrolled in an undergraduate program at Columbia designed for older students and moved to New York. His routines became almost monastic. \u201cI was studying constantly, and when I wasn\u2019t, I was exercising,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI went down this weird, masochistic path. I never again in my life want to have an experience that isolating.\u201dAt Columbia, he wasn\u2019t often recognized \u2014 the haircut and shave helped \u2014 and found it simultaneously liberating and dispiriting to be an anonymous college freshman. \u201cIt was weird to be like: \u2018I have zero out of 126 credits. I have nothing to give to anyone, because my past is erased and I\u2019m now in this class.\u2019\u201dDaniel Rossen, a vocalist and songwriter for the band Grizzly Bear, has known Mr. Pecknold since before Fleet Foxes\u2019 2008 self-titled debut album, and related to his struggles. \u201cHe wants to challenge himself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely gone through that, where you lose sight of the value of what you\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s easy to see much more valuable ways to spend your life.\u201dEventually, Mr. Pecknold emerged from his cocoon. He performed Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cCorduroy\u201d on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d with Mr. Rossen and went on a short tribute tour playing the 1974 album \u201cNo Other,\u201d by one of the original Byrds, Gene Clark, alongside members of other indie rock bands. The loose vibe helped answer some questions for Mr. Pecknold. \u201cI was just like, it\u2019s worth doing if it moves you or you feel you\u2019re pointed in the right direction while you\u2019re working on it,\u201d Mr. Pecknold said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t need to be a why.\u201dThat focus on enjoying the present made the \u201cCrack-Up\u201d sessions a refreshing change from the grind that birthed \u201cHelplessness Blues.\u201d Mr. Skjelset said that when Mr. Pecknold texted him about reassembling Fleet Foxes \u2014 which also includes the guitarist-bassist Christian Wargo, the keyboardist Casey Wescott and the multi-instrumentalist Morgan Henderson \u2014 Mr. Skjelset made it clear the band\u2019s working dynamics needed to change: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, it has to be something that\u2019s not going to make us want to kill ourselves.\u201dIn practical terms, that meant making \u201cCrack-Up\u201d more of a team effort. In the early stages, Mr. Pecknold sent out Google Docs with thoughts about the album and the things that were influencing him, then encouraged his band mates to add their own ideas. \u201cI wanted to leave room in all the songs for people to make their mark in a way I wasn\u2019t comfortable letting them do on the last one,\u201d he said. As the recording commenced, stress levels remained refreshingly low. \u201cIt was just fun,\u201d Mr. Wargo said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s head was very clear, and it was drama-free.\u201dThe resulting album, produced by Mr. Pecknold and Mr. Skjelset, is breathtaking in its scope. The opening track, \u201cI Am All That I Need/Arroyo Seco/Thumbprint Scar,\u201d careens from dreary, self-doubting dirge to bright, breathless acoustic rocker and back multiple times before strings sweep in like a soothing balm. Many songs undergo similar shifts. The album\u2019s centerpiece, the nearly nine-minute \u201cThird of May/Odaigahara,\u201d begins as a vibrant, soaring celebration but falls periodically into quiet, contemplative passages as Mr. Pecknold wraps his supple voice around phrases that reflect, albeit obliquely, the journey he\u2019s been on the past six years: \u201cCan I be light and free?\u201d; \u201cTo be held within oneself is deathlike\u201d; \u201cI was a fool.\u201d\u201cThe way the songs move between sections is almost like moving between emotional states,\u201d Mr. Rossen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very cinematic. There\u2019s a lot of disappointment and loss, but it\u2019s like a triumph. Robin made it through to the other side in a way that doesn\u2019t feel cynical.\u201dThe title nods to F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cThe Crack-Up,\u201d which chronicled the author\u2019s own existential crisis. Fitzgerald writes, \u201cI began to realize that for two years my life had been drawing on resources that I did not possess, that I had been mortgaging myself physically and spiritually.\u201d Mr. Pecknold glimpsed the shadow of his own \u201ccrack-up\u201d in Fitzgerald\u2019s.\u201cI was trying to find new things to care about,\u201d he said. Fitzgerald\u2019s essay was \u201cexactly about that \u2014 needing to build your own reasons for living.\u201dOn a rainy evening in May, the band gathered in a cramped rehearsal space in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill neighborhood to run through the set for a tour beginning two days later. Mr. Pecknold, standing near a rack of guitars amid crumpled-up pieces of paper, boxes of Vicks VapoPads and vitamin C supplements, was clearly in charge, but also at ease. As he put it later, \u201cI wasn\u2019t always secure enough as an individual to be in a room like that and not feel exhausted.\u201dAfter working through other songs from their three albums, they finished with a rejiggered \u201cHelplessness Blues,\u201d the song that in some ways started Mr. Pecknold on the road to where he and the band find themselves now. Gone were the ecstatic acoustic guitars and the sense of revelation embedded in the original song. This new version felt more considered. A lyric was altered, too, from \u201cIf I had an orchard, I\u2019d work till I\u2019m sore\u201d to \u201cNo time for an orchard with all that\u2019s in store.\u201d\u201cThat song got a little misinterpreted, that line in particular,\u201d Mr. Pecknold said after rehearsal. Fans often took it literally to mean Mr. Pecknold wanted to chuck it all and go raise fruit trees. \u201cTo me, the line was more, \u2018I just want something to do.\u2019\u201d The lyric is more optimistic now, less yearning, a reflection of a songwriter and a band that\u2019s more comfortable with who they are and where they\u2019re headed.\u201cMaking this album, I was like: I get to do this? This is what I wake up and do? This seems like a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel lucky.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ad Buyers Have a Say in Whether Real News Survives", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byMediatorPHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hey, America\u2019s Advertisers: You got some good news last week, didn\u2019t you?The question now is whether all of this will give advertisers the assurance they need to keep sending the overwhelming majority of their new online ad dollars to Google and Facebook.There is more at stake in the answer than the fortunes of our two online overlords. It will also help determine the fate of the rest of the digital media. And that, in turn, will affect whether cities like this one will be able to maintain a vibrant free press that keeps government honest and voters informed.So, yeah, America\u2019s Advertisers, I\u2019m talking about democracy, and your role in it. News flash: You have one. Let me explain.We are still very much in the midst of a fascinating, often exciting but sometimes scary digital transformation in which advertising dollars are moving to Google and Facebook in a hurry.But as those dollars are moving toward Google and Facebook, they are often moving away from quality news and information providers, starving them of the direct digital revenue they need to pay for fact-based news gathering. Real news costs real money; fake news comes cheap.It\u2019s just the latest bit of upheaval in their joint operation, which is now combined into a single newsroom after The Daily News vacated its own. The former Daily News newsroom is just across a hallway from the Inquirer space here on Market Street, and it still sits tauntingly empty save for an old neon \u201cDaily News: The People Paper\u201d sign, which now sits unlit.The shifting dynamic is especially hard for old-line newspapers, whose lucrative classified ads were rendered obsolete by the likes of Craigslist, and high-margin print advertising fled to the Web. They had hoped to make up the difference through online advertisements. Then Google and Facebook fired up their cash vacuums.Their draw for marketers is all too powerful, and understandable. Advertisers were once happy to pay to reach big, broad audiences with the hope of getting their messages in front of the right customers \u2014 buying the whole cow just to get the milk, it was called \u2014 and they would turn to local newspapers for what once passed for geographical precision. Now they can use Facebook and Google to reach a smaller, more targeted audience, right down to the correct ZIP code.The new environment is forcing newspapers to scramble to come up with a solution that can keep the lights on, and keep the staff large enough to continue to do real, probing journalism, before it\u2019s too late and it\u2019s all over.The country\u2019s still-standing metropolitan dailies are increasingly requiring extra help from benevolent rich people. The Philadelphia Media Network \u2014 the owner of The Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com \u2014 has been lucky enough to have a benefactor in H. F. Lenfest. Last year, he donated the group to a foundation he created, the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which he endowed with $20 million.Last week, the institute followed up by announcing that it had secured $26.5 million more from donors, and Mr. Lenfest committed an additional $40 million in future matching funds, all with a goal of finding \u201csustainable business models for high-quality journalism.\u201dIn an interview, I asked Mr. Lenfest a leading question: Does the diminishing of local newspapers mean open season for corrupt city officials?\u201cI don\u2019t think our city government is corrupt \u2014 but sometimes they need correcting, and that is the responsibility of the newspaper,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere will be a tremendous vacuum if these local newspapers don\u2019t continue to print.\u201dIt\u2019s not hyperbole. I grew up in Philadelphia, reading The Inquirer\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning expos\u00e9s of the Philadelphia court system \u2014 by a team including Buzz Bissinger \u2014 and of the Philadelphia Police Department K-9 unit by William K. Marimow, now the paper\u2019s editor at large.But as David Boardman, who sits on the Lenfest Institute board of managers, told me, the group \u201cstill needs to make a buck\u201d under the terms of its philanthropic support.\u201cUltimately, you can\u2019t continue to contribute to something that is inevitably in decline,\u201d said Mr. Boardman, who is the dean of the Klein College of Media and Communication at Temple University.So the Philadelphia Media Network is preparing for buyouts. And, like all newspaper groups, it is trying to reorganize its newsroom to provide its journalism in new forms that fit with new media consumption habits.But that will not solve the threat that Facebook and Google pose to news providers. They have the user base \u2014 billions \u2014 and engineering prowess that no media company can match, which Stan Wischnowski, the Philadelphia Media Network executive editor, told me, is \u201cputting democracy as a whole at risk because it has put at risk the kind of watchdog journalism we\u2019ve been doing for 187 years.\u201dIt might, for instance, help efforts to increase subscriptions to newspapers with digital paywalls, while making them more adept online and on social platforms.The company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Thompson, told investors that The Times seemed to be benefiting from advertisers\u2019 desire to avoid being adjacent to \u201cdishonest or tawdry content.\u201dWe can hope that\u2019s the start of something more lasting, and not a temporary move to a safe harbor until the squall passes.Facebook is working to do its part to help newspapers. Newspapers are trying to modernize. Now it is time for advertisers to do their part to support the people who make the quality content they want to be associated with, and to reconsider their headlong rush away from them.That isn\u2019t a plea for charity. It\u2019s a plea for common sense. If current trends continue, there will be far less quality content to fill the big platforms advertisers are so in love with. They should think about what will be left.The Mediator column on Monday, about the role that advertisers can play in supporting quality news sources, misstated the title of Stan Wischnowski in some copies. He is the executive editor of the Philadelphia Media Network, not its editor in chief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Network Ad Wrangler Undaunted by Facebook and Google", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAfter completing her first year as the head of advertising sales for NBCUniversal, Linda Yaccarino went out to dinner with her husband to celebrate.She soon found herself crying into a bowl of shrimp scampi.The tears were a rare reaction to what she called the hardest year of her career, when Ms. Yaccarino started dragging an ad sales operation for television programming as varied as \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Bravo reality shows into the digital future.Things haven\u2019t gotten any easier in the television ad world, but five years later, Ms. Yaccarino, 54, is still at it. And far from weeping, she has become an outspoken leader in an industry that is contending with far-reaching changes in how people watch television while competing against a host of technology companies that have begun to vie for those same audiences by investing in original video content.Ms. Yaccarino, who oversees $10 billion in annual ad revenue, has drawn particular attention for her vocal criticism of Nielsen ratings, which have long been the standard for how TV ads are bought and sold, and for her use of digital properties that NBCU has either invested in or forged partnerships with, like Snapchat, BuzzFeed and Apple News.\u201cLinda has the ability to stay a step ahead, and I think she\u2019s done that wherever she\u2019s been,\u201d said Julie Rieger, the executive vice president for media at 20th Century Fox, who has known Ms. Yaccarino for more than a decade. \u201cShe is in some ways the Wayne Gretzky of media. It\u2019s not about where the puck is \u2014 it\u2019s about where the puck is going.\u201dAs broadcast television audiences shrink and people spend more time on digital platforms, Ms. Yaccarino has reoriented herself to think of the competitive landscape as stretching beyond NBC\u2019s rival networks to include online behemoths like Facebook and Google. During this week\u2019s annual ritual known as upfronts, when networks trot out their biggest stars and announce new shows in an attempt to lure advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino will surely be promoting the fact that the NBCU universe includes more than 17 cable channels, 50 online destinations and partnerships that reach to all sorts of platforms and devices.During a recent interview in her sun-filled office, Ms. Yaccarino explained the ways that marketers might use NBCU\u2019s properties and partnerships to reach, say, a young, busy mother.First, she wakes up and checks Apple News on her phone, Ms. Yaccarino said. Then she might turn on the \u201cToday\u201d show while making breakfast, catch up on E! on Snapchat at the school drop-off and check stock prices on CNBC or sports scores during the day. In the evening, she\u2019ll tune in to a show like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d then end the evening watching Jimmy Fallon. Each presents a distinct marketing opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s about the media mix,\u201d she said.Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s desk faces two flat-screen televisions mounted side by side, and her office is peppered with photographs of stars like the Kardashians, whom she adores in part because of E!\u2019s success in marketing their reality show. She\u2019s married with two children, but jokes that Jack Pearson, the character from \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d will be her second husband once she figures out what to do with the first. And she professes excitement for the \u201cpinch me\u201d moments in her job, like holding business meetings with Mr. Fallon and talking with Megyn Kelly about her move from Fox to NBC.She has forged new relationships, inviting the sales chief of a rival network to speak at an NBCU innovation event this year and teaming up with AOL for automated advertising a couple of years ago \u2014 when the notion was viewed as \u201cheresy in the TV world,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said.She first oversaw sales for NBCU\u2019s cable channels and was quickly promoted to overseeing all of the network\u2019s ad sales, a move that combined its broadcast, cable and digital properties for the first time.Previously, sales teams for divisions like NBC Sports, Bravo and USA functioned independently of one another. With the new structure, the idea was that if buyers wanted to be on \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d they could also be sold on \u201cModern Family\u201d reruns, Bravo shows and more, providing the network with more scale and efficiency.Wrangling a 1,000-plus person organization and 15 teams into doing that was the grueling part for Ms. Yaccarino. But it also forced her to grow comfortable with acting quickly in an industry where her competitors were changing by the day.\u201cHer job is understanding the marketplace and how to combine the assets she has under NBCU, connecting the dots between all the channels and ensuring the parent company gets as much revenue as possible,\u201d said Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM, the media investing arm of the ad giant WPP. While that may occasionally make it harder for buyers, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what she does, and she does it well.\u201dIf that was Act 1 of Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s time at NBCU, she\u2019s now ready for Act 2.\u201cThe next frontier is: How do we really bring it all together in terms of linear and digital?\u201d she said.\u201cImagine if the advertising-supported ecosystem went away,\u201d she said. \u201cThere would be no Hulu, no Netflix, no Amazon, because that\u2019s what fuels all their content. They\u2019d have to go to 100 percent original, and the cost for the consumer would be absolutely unaffordable. So I think everyone agrees that advertising-supported content needs to remain the main driver or the epicenter of the business. We just need to figure out a way to do it respectfully to consumer behavior today.\u201dThe frustrations have cast old rivalries in a new light. Joe Marchese, who was named the head of ad sales at Fox Networks Group last week, was invited by Ms. Yaccarino to speak at an internal NBCU event this year.\u201cIt was kind of like a Macy\u2019s-Gimbels type of thing for her to invite a senior person from Fox to come up and talk about where the industry is headed,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. But it reflects the challenges networks are facing as some viewers opt out of ads entirely through platforms like Netflix, while at the same time TV ratings numbers are being compared with online ad views on Google and Facebook.TV executives have seethed in the past two years over a frequently repeated remark from Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, who said the social network has a Super Bowl on mobile every day in terms of the people it can reach. While the size of audiences on Facebook and YouTube are undeniable, there is fierce debate over the value of video views on such platforms, particularly when the ads take up only, say, half of the screen, or appear for a couple of seconds without sound.\u201cFrom a consumer experience, we all know what it\u2019s like to experience a Super Bowl as you have people over your home, family, friends, or you go somewhere and you\u2019re watching this communal experience and you\u2019re talking about the show and you\u2019re yelling and screaming and holding your breath and talking about the commercials,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Super Bowl.\u201dShe held up her phone and exaggeratedly swiped the screen without breaking eye contact. \u201cDoes this look like a Super Bowl?\u201d She kept swiping. \u201cThis is not a Super Bowl.\u201dNBC, it should be noted, will air the game next year.While much has been said about technology companies coming for TV advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino said the companies were \u201creally coming for TV content.\u201d She pointed to Twitter\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s deals with the N.F.L. and YouTube\u2019s new ad-supported shows with stars like Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres.\u201cReally, you just can\u2019t snap your fingers and invent that,\u201d she said of premium content.And that is why she believes her focus on aligning with tech companies and reaching a large number of people on a variety of platforms will pay dividends.\u201cIt\u2019s about real audiences, real people who buy stuff, because they experienced your content all throughout the day,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we can do that, then we can really compete with the Google, Facebooks, Twitter, etc., etc., or whoever\u2019s next of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For $499, a Drone for Beginners: DJI\u2019s Spark", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported bytech fixIf you thought those drones buzzing around on the beach were annoying, just wait and see what happens when they become cheaper than iPhones. I tested Spark over several days this week and found it surprisingly capable for a low-cost drone. Unlike most expensive drones, which operate with a physical remote control, this machine was designed to work primarily with a smartphone app; you can also make hand gestures to move Spark or make it take your selfie. It shoots superb high-definition video, weighs about a quarter of a pound and is so compact you could stuff it in a tote bag.I was able to confidently fly Spark, the first drone I have ever used, after several sessions, a testament to its overall ease of use. Unsurprisingly, Spark isn\u2019t perfect. Its app can be tough to grasp without reading an instruction manual. The battery lasts only about 15 minutes, and there are some bugs in the software that could send your drone flying off erratically. Yet I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend Spark for people who are curious about trying drones for taking aerial photography or for experiencing the sheer joy of flying an object. Considering how small and lightweight this drone is, Spark will also make a great stocking stuffer this holiday season. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what you\u2019re getting from a budget drone.\u00a0Inside DJI\u2019s app for controlling Spark, there are virtual joysticks for making the drone rotate or move up, down, forward or backward. Initially, the app will be confusing to use. It took me three sessions, or 90 minutes of flight time using two batteries, to get the hang of it. The app buttons do not intuitively state what they do or how to use them. In the end, I had to flip through a 50-page instruction manual to learn how to better operate Spark. There is an option to skip using the app altogether by enabling PalmControl, a mode that lets the drone respond to your hand gestures. To enable this, hold your palm flat toward the camera, and the drone will lock in on your hand and follow it around as you move. You can hold out your thumbs and index fingers to form a frame around yourself to make the drone automatically take a selfie of you. Wave your hand at the drone and it will ascend and fly backward. Spark was ultimately inconsistent with reacting to hand gestures. Sometimes it responded quickly, but often the drone failed to recognize the gestures and continued to hover.The Spark has several features that make it well suited for those who are new to drones. The killer feature is a menu of shortcuts called QuickShot: These are automated motion sequences for shooting some neat drone videos. You select a subject (like a human or a dog) to record, choose a QuickShot mode and tap a button to commence the sequence. One QuickShot mode called Circle makes the drone automatically circle a subject while recording video of it. My favorite QuickShot mode was Rocket, which caused the drone to lift dozens of meters into the air while continuing to shoot video of me and a friend from overhead. The recording was a delight to watch and share on Instagram.Typically, you would need a lot of skill flying drones to shoot these types of videos adequately. By including these automated video-recording sequences in its app, DJI has made Spark very accessible as an aerial photography tool.There are downsides, of course. One of the QuickShot modes, called Helix, did not work properly in my tests. Helix is supposed to cause the drone to fly upward and spiral around the subject. But in three different test locations, activating Helix caused the drone to fly upward and so far away that it lost its Wi-Fi connection with the smartphone. (This may have been related to interference caused by nearby Wi-Fi routers.) The drone is programmed to return home, or land where it took off, whenever it loses connection with a smartphone \u2014 but nobody would blame you if you chased after it out of anxiety.That brings up another issue with Spark: The $499 price tag is misleading when you add the extra accessories you are likely to need. After buying the propeller guards ($19), you probably also need at least one extra battery ($49) and the battery charging station ($69). In the end, you\u2019ll probably spend roughly $640 just to make flight sessions last half an hour, given the device\u2019s 15-minute battery life.Even so, $640 is still cheaper than an iPhone or a high-end Android device like the Google Pixel (also priced at about $650), which makes it a compelling potential gift for tech and photography enthusiasts. Spark is a solid product for a relatively low cost, and it seems inevitable that drones will become more commonplace at parks, beaches and tourist attractions.Perhaps the most intriguing question is whether new etiquettes will form around these flying cameras, which may be noisy and intrusive of people\u2019s privacy. There was one thing I learned the hard way: Don\u2019t fly a drone at a dog park. While some dogs enjoyed chasing Spark, the drone frightened two pups so much that they darted into the street.

{"Headline": "California Today: To Fight Climate Change, Heal the Ground", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The climate change fight has focused largely on cutting emissions.But California is now considering another solution: dirt.Whereas an overabundance of carbon in the air has been disrupting our climate, plants are hungry for the stuff.The Central Valley\u2019s farmlands essentially operate as a vast lung, breathing in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and converting it into plant tissues. That results in less of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere.But the healthier the soil, the more carbon is stored in plants.\u201cI think there\u2019s a growing recognition that the soil beneath our feet has huge potential to sequester carbon,\u201d said Karen Ross, secretary of the state\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture.More than a quarter of California\u2019s landmass is used for agriculture. Over generations, farming practices like monocropping and tillage have reduced the amount of organic matter in the soil, affecting plant growth. Some of that organic matter, which contains carbon, needs to be put back.\u201cIf you don\u2019t put carbon back in, you\u2019re kind of mining the soil,\u201d said Kate Scow, a professor of soil science at the University of California, Davis.California\u2019s initiative will give grants to farmers who take steps to reverse that nutrient loss. Those could include adding compost on rangelands or seeding fields between harvests with so-called cover crops such as grasses and mustards, which add organic matter to the soil.State officials say such measures could eliminate from the air the equivalent of millions of tons of carbon dioxide a year.For now, the soils initiative is funded with just $7.5 million, a drop in the bucket for a state with more than 76,000 farms. But officials hope it can be expanded after demonstrating enough interest from farmers.To that end, they\u2019ve pushed the program as a win-win by citing evidence showing healthy soils produce higher yields.But many unknowns still need to be sorted out, said Cynthia Cory, director of environmental affairs for the California Farm Bureau Federation.California agricultural is dizzyingly varied. More than 230 crops spring from the Central Valley alone.Even if the new measures are good for yields, whether they justify a farm\u2019s time, labor and expense depends on its unique circumstances.\u201cWe want to try it,\u201d Ms. Cory said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if bad or good is the question. It\u2019s just, \u2018Is it worth it?\u2019\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cIn some ways we are all now Californians.\u201dThat\u2019s how London\u2019s Design Museum introduces an exhibit it opened this month exploring how things designed in California now permeate so many lives around the world.More than 200 objects were curated to tell the story, including skateboards, LSD blotting paper, a vintage Apple 1 computer, the rainbow flag, concept artwork for \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and Snapchat glasses.Perhaps helplessly, users of iPhones, Instagram and Google maps around the world have remained in thrall to the visions of California\u2019s tech innovators.Dr. Sadler cited the case of the serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose projects have included a hypothetical high-speed train, space rockets and, most recently, plans for a brain-computer interface.\u201cIt\u2019s so Californian. It\u2019s so delirious,\u201d said Dr. Sadler, who is British-born. \u201cYou put all this together and you start to see why California looks so remarkable if you\u2019re outside of that state.\u201dThe London exhibit closes Oct. 15.The California Today columnist, Mike McPhate, is a third-generation Californian \u2014 born outside Sacramento and raised in San Juan Capistrano.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Let Facebook Make You Miserable", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byIT is now official. Scholars have analyzed the data and confirmed what we already knew in our hearts. Social media is making us miserable.We are all dimly aware that everybody else can\u2019t possibly be as successful, rich, attractive, relaxed, intellectual and joyous as they appear to be on Facebook. Yet we can\u2019t help comparing our inner lives with the curated lives of our friends.Just how different is the real world from the world on social media? In the real world, The National Enquirer, a weekly, sells nearly three times as many copies as The Atlantic, a monthly, every year. On Facebook, The Atlantic is 45 times more popular.The Las Vegas budget hotel Circus Circus and the luxurious hotel Bellagio each holds about the same number of people. But the Bellagio gets about three times as many check-ins on Facebook.The search for online status takes some peculiar twists. Facebook works with an outside company to gather data on the cars people actually own. Facebook also has data on the cars people associate with by posting about them or by liking them.Owners of luxury cars like BMWs and Mercedeses are about two and a half times as likely to announce their affiliation on Facebook as are owners of ordinary makes and models.In the United States, the desire to show off and exaggerate wealth is universal. Caucasians, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are all two to three times as likely to associate on Facebook with a luxury car they own than with a non-luxury car they own.On Facebook, though, men seem to underplay their interest in artists considered more feminine. For example, on Spotify, Katy Perry was the 10th most listened to artist among men, beating Bob Marley, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Wiz Khalifa. But those other artists all have more male likes on Facebook.The pressure to look a certain way on social media can do much more than distort our image of the musicians other people actually listen to.Sufferers of various illnesses are increasingly using social media to connect with others and to raise awareness about their diseases. But if a condition is considered embarrassing, people are less likely to publicly associate themselves with it.Irritable bowel syndrome and migraines are similarly prevalent, each affecting around 10 percent of the American population. But migraine sufferers have built Facebook awareness and support groups two and a half times larger than I.B.S. sufferers have.None of this behavior is all that new, although the form it takes is. Friends have always showed off to friends. People have always struggled to remind themselves that other people don\u2019t have it as easy as they claim.Think of the aphorism quoted by members of Alcoholics Anonymous: \u201cDon\u2019t compare your insides to other people\u2019s outsides.\u201d Of course, this advice is difficult to follow. We never see other people\u2019s insides.I have actually spent the past five years peeking into people\u2019s insides. I have been studying aggregate Google search data. Alone with a screen and anonymous, people tend to tell Google things they don\u2019t reveal to social media; they even tell Google things they don\u2019t tell to anybody else. Google offers digital truth serum. The words we type there are more honest than the pictures we present on Facebook or Instagram.Sometimes the contrasts in different data sources are amusing. Consider how wives speak about their husbands.On social media, the top descriptors to complete the phrase \u201cMy husband is \u2026\u201d are \u201cthe best,\u201d \u201cmy best friend,\u201d \u201camazing,\u201d \u201cthe greatest\u201d and \u201cso cute.\u201d On Google, one of the top five ways to complete that phrase is also \u201camazing.\u201d So that checks out. The other four: \u201ca jerk,\u201d \u201cannoying,\u201d \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cmean.\u201dWhile spending five years staring at a computer screen learning about some of human beings\u2019 strangest and darkest thoughts may not strike most people as a good time, I have found the honest data surprisingly comforting. I have consistently felt less alone in my insecurities, anxieties, struggles and desires.Once you\u2019ve looked at enough aggregate search data, it\u2019s hard to take the curated selves we see on social media too seriously. Or, as I like to sum up what Google data has taught me: We\u2019re all a mess.Now, you may not be a data scientist. You may not know how to code in R or calculate a confidence interval. But you can still take advantage of big data and digital truth serum to put an end to envy \u2014 or at least take some of the bite out of it.Any time you are feeling down about your life after lurking on Facebook, go to Google and start typing stuff into the search box. Google\u2019s autocomplete will tell you the searches other people are making. Type in \u201cI always \u2026\u201d and you may see the suggestion, based on other people\u2019s searches, \u201cI always feel tired\u201d or \u201cI always have diarrhea.\u201d This can offer a stark contrast to social media, where everybody \u201calways\u201d seems to be on a Caribbean vacation.As our lives increasingly move online, I propose a new self-help mantra for the 21st century, courtesy of big data: Don\u2019t compare your Google searches with other people\u2019s Facebook posts.Advertisement"}

Computer scientists, tech giants and start-ups are using sophisticated algorithms and reams of online data to quickly \u2014 and automatically \u2014 spot fake news faster than traditional fact-checking groups can.The goal, experts say, is to expand these digital tools across Europe, so the region can counter the fake news that caused so much confusion and anger during the United States presidential election in November, when outright false reports routinely spread like wildfire on Facebook and Twitter.Researchers have tried to learn from the United States\u2019 run-in with fake news, but the problem in Europe has mutated, experts say, making it impossible to merely replicate American responses to the issue.But with fake news already swirling around Europe\u2019s forthcoming elections, analysts also worry that technology on its own may not be enough to combat the threat.\u201cThere\u2019s an increased amount of misinformation out there,\u201d said Janis Sarts, director of the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, a think tank in Riga, Latvia, that will hold a hackathon with local coders in May to find potential tech solutions to this trend. \u201cState-based actors have been trying to amplify specific views to bring them into the mainstream.\u201dNot everyone, though, has embraced Facebook\u2019s response.Since last year, Google also has funded almost 20 European projects aimed at fact-checking potentially false reports. That includes its support for two British groups looking to use artificial intelligence to automatically fact-check online claims ahead of the country\u2019s June 8 parliamentary election.\u201cWe\u2019re trying something new,\u201d Mr. Dieudonn\u00e9 said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy answer for this complicated issue.\u201dNot all potential solutions, though, are being driven by Silicon Valley\u2019s big beasts.Using a database of verified articles and their artificial intelligence expertise, rival groups \u2014 a combination of college teams, independent programmers and groups from existing tech companies \u2014 already have been able to accurately predict the veracity of certain claims almost 90 percent of the time, Mr. Pomerleau said. He hopes that figure will rise to the mid-90s before his challenge ends in June.\u201cThis is just Round 1 of what we want to do,\u201d said Mr. Pomerleau, who expects the teams to share their work with fact-checking groups worldwide. \u201cNext, we want to move toward multimedia content like videos.\u201dIn the rush to find solutions to fake news, some within the industry are taking a decidedly more low-tech approach.Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, recently started a crowdfunding campaign to create a news organization that would combine professional journalists with digital volunteers, who would contribute to reports in a way similar to how articles are created on Wikipedia.\u201cThe real impetus for this was fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to get behind topics, and then we\u2019ll hire staff to cover them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated a role that Delip Rao previously had at Google.

{"Headline": "As C.E.O. Pay Packages Grow, Top Executives Have the President\u2019s Ear", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "The top 200 chief executives, who make more than last year, are holding meetings with President Trump, who is considering rolling back Dodd-Frank regulations.Supported byPerhaps the pay surge reflects the times: Stocks are coming off a strong run. Unemployment is low. The economy is percolating.And President Trump is not only promising to roll back what he calls excessive business regulations but also listening keenly to what corporate America has to say. Since taking office on Jan. 20, the businessman-turned-politician has met with hundreds of executives, including at least 41 of last year\u2019s 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, a New York Times analysis shows.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Mr. Rutledge, 63, stormed to the front of the pack after closing his company\u2019s mega-merger, a $65 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller competitor.For that, he got a big bump in pay. The year before, his compensation totaled $16.4 million.This combination \u2014 the gains in pay for chief executives, the president\u2019s pledge to deregulate and cut corporate tax rates \u2014 sets the stage for perhaps the most consequential moment for corporate governance since the financial crisis of 2008. Rising executive compensation only widens the gap between top executives and most American workers. Mr. Rutledge, for instance, made about 2,617 times the average American worker\u2019s salary of $37,632, according to figures maintained by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.Discrepancies like that helped fuel the populist frustration that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election and, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, led to the passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul act.Yet the president\u2019s team is considering rolling back a Dodd-Frank rule that, starting next year, would make it much easier for employees at a publicly traded company to compare their own pay to the chief executive\u2019s.In the meantime, pay for top executives is reaching staggering levels. Mr. Rutledge\u2019s compensation swelled to $98 million largely thanks to a stock options award valued at roughly $78 million. The Charter board awarded Mr. Rutledge that grant, which runs through 2020, about a month before completion of its big merger in May 2016.Over all, technology company chief executives are well represented on the list of 200 best-paid C.E.O.s, along with executives from financial services companies and media companies. The best-paid female chief executive is Oracle\u2019s Safra A. Catz, whose total package was valued at $40.9 million, making her the eighth-highest-paid C.E.O. in 2016.Mr. Trump, who sees himself as the nation\u2019s C.E.O., is hardly the first president to savor the company of corporate executives. But he\u2019s made the pageantry of meetings with C.E.O.s at the White House or at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which he has dubbed the southern White House, a priority during his first few months in office. The visits have become an opportunity for the president to trumpet the progress he says his administration is making in creating jobs and reducing regulations.But Mr. Trump may be getting a one-sided perspective on policy recommendations by spending so much time with a large swath of highly paid executives \u2014 at least 307 since Inauguration Day \u2014 whose views on taxes and economic inequality tend to differ from those of average Americans.Unleashing business by reducing regulations was the subtext of Mr. Rutledge\u2019s meeting on March 24 with Mr. Trump.Justin Venech, a Charter spokesman, said Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a lighter regulatory environment had enabled the company to commit to locating those new jobs in the United States over the next four years, and to spend billions on broadband infrastructure.What is clear from the Equilar study is that many C.E.O.s were doing quite well even before Mr. Trump took office. Average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives list \u2014 which changes from year to year \u2014 rose about 2 percent, to $19.7 million, from 2015. For the 200 specific individuals on this year\u2019s list, 2016 was especially kind. Those executives saw an average gain of 16 percent over what they received in 2015.On a percentage basis, Ronald D. Croatti at UniFirst, one of the nation\u2019s largest uniform manufacturers and distributors, had the biggest bump in pay last year. Mr. Croatti, 74, died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia, the company said. His pay package in 2016 rose 740 percent, to $17.69 million, according to Equilar.Steven Sintros, chief financial officer for UniFirst, said Mr. Croatti\u2019s large compensation package merely reflected the way companies are required to report the valuation of stock grants.In all, Equilar reports that the median salary for chief executives at all publicly traded companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion came in at $6.14 million, down slightly from $6.19 million in 2015.Elon Musk, the brash inventor and chief executive of Tesla Inc., clocked in with a $99.7 million pay package in the Bloomberg survey. But Mr. Musk did not appear in the Equilar survey because Equilar valued stock grants, even ones spread out over several years, at the time they were awarded, as the Securities and Exchange Commission requires.The total compensation for Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric slid 33 percent in 2016, to $17.7 million, according to Equilar. His payout under the company\u2019s long-term compensation plan fell by about $6 million, and his annual bonus shrank by $1 million to $4.3 million, according to the company\u2019s proxy. In 2016, G.E. shares rose just 4 percent compared with 12 percent for the S.& P. 500.Mr. Immelt remained on the list, however. Notable extremely wealthy chief executives who did not appear include Tim Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Both own enormous quantities of their companies\u2019 stock, but their compensation in 2016 was not high enough to qualify.The list also excludes executives who run big divisions but not entire public companies, even when they make more than the corporate boss.Digging deeper, Equilar found that Marc Lore, president and chief executive of Walmart\u2019s online operation, had the biggest payout of all executives at publicly traded companies, earning an eye-popping $243.9 million in total compensation.His total pay was more than 11 times greater than the $21.8 million pay package awarded to C. Douglas McMillon, Walmart\u2019s chief executive.Another big winner was Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google at Alphabet. Mr. Pichai got a compensation package worth just under $200 million. Like Mr. Lore, Mr. Pichai gets a small base salary and most of his compensation is in stock grants. Last year, Alphabet\u2019s board awarded Mr. Pichai stock valued at $198.7 million.By comparison, Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, draws an annual salary of $1 a year. He hardly needs the salary: Forbes estimates the net worth of the co-founder of Google at $45 billion.The Equilar study points up a trend in compensation: Companies are increasingly moving away from cash bonuses and toward stock grants to reward top executives.Many large investors favor them because they give corporate executives an additional incentive to produce results that increase a company\u2019s share prices. Some critics, however, contend that stock grants and stock options can encourage executives to cut costs and take other short-term steps that don\u2019t invest in a company\u2019s long-term prospects.Supporters of stock grants are winning. Over the past five years, the median cash bonus awarded to the 200 best-compensated C.E.O.s declined to just under $3 million, from $3.37 million, according to Equilar. Meanwhile, the median value of stock awarded to those chief executives last year was $9.2 million.\u201cThe issue with cash bonuses is that they have become a given for most executives,\u201d said Aeisha Mastagni, an investment officer with the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, or Calstrs. \u201cThere are still companies where they award the same bonus year after year, and the stock price doesn\u2019t reflect any value added.\u201dMs. Mastagni said a cash bonus \u201cis not money at risk,\u201d as is a grant of stock.The board at AMC Networks \u2014 which has produced hit television shows like \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d \u2014 has decided to phase out the long-term cash award for its chief executive and other top executives. AMC\u2019s compensation committee decided that a stock award \u201cbetter aligns the interests of its senior officers with those of stockholders.\u201dBut in 2016, Joshua W. Sapan, AMC\u2019s chief executive, hit the daily double of sorts. Mr. Sapan got a big cash award of $15.1 million, which will become much smaller in 2018 under the board\u2019s policy. But he also got a big stock award, valued at $13.2 million, consistent with the board\u2019s new directive on corporate pay. In all, Mr. Sapan\u2019s total $30.5 million pay package soared 72 percent over 2015, even as the company\u2019s stock dropped nearly 30 percent last year.No matter how you look at it, the pay gap between corporate executives and most everyone else in America keeps getting bigger.Some 50 years ago, the typical chief executive made just 20 times what an employee did, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. By comparison, it calculated that the average C.E.O. today made 347 times the average salary of an American laborer, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: $37,632.Reversing this ever-widening pay gap is a union rallying cry, especially at companies that have been shedding jobs in the United States.Take Mondelez, the global snack company. Outside the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on May 17 in Chicago, union members protested its decision to eliminate 600 jobs at a local factory that makes Oreo cookies, and shift some operations to Mexico.\u201cMondelez is emblematic of everything that is wrong with our economy, which works for C.E.O.s, but not for working Americans,\u201d said Brandon Rees, who works in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.\u2019s Office of Investment.Irene B. Rosenfeld, the company\u2019s chief executive, received a 2016 pay package valued at $15.8 million, according to Equilar, a decline of 13 percent. Michael Mitchell, a Mondelez spokesman, said the company\u2019s compensation program is \u201cwell aligned with shareholders\u2019 long-term interests.\u201dBut Mr. Rees said the company\u2019s failure to hit certain performance targets, and a 13 percent decline in Mondelez revenue last year, accounted for the decline in her compensation, adding that her pay package was still too high. He said she had focused too much on cutting costs and share buybacks, and not enough on investments that would keep jobs in the United States.Amid populist anger over income inequality, the S.E.C. in 2015 required publicly traded corporations to begin providing standard information in 2018 on the disparities between pay for chief executives and rank-and-file workers. That so-called pay-ratio rule would give investors and employees another metric for evaluating C.E.O. pay.The chairman of Business Roundtable is Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase and the 25th-best-compensated chief executive in the Equilar survey. His pay package rose 49 percent last year, to $27.2 million. Mr. Dimon, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s C.E.O. advisory group, visited the White House on Feb. 3 and has praised the president for awakening \u201canimal spirits\u201d in the economy.Alan Johnson, managing director of the pay consulting firm Johnson Associates, said he supports the opposition to the pay-ratio rule because it \u201cis a cooked-up thing to embarrass firms with a lot of part-time workers.\u201d He added that focusing on compensation leads to \u201cpay envy\u201d and does not do anything to address a fundamental problem, which is that average workers need better job training and job assistance programs.But Susan R. Holmberg, a fellow with the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal public policy group, said that if the pay-ratio rule encourages employees to join unions, it is a good thing for workers, since it could lead to future wage gains.Mr. Trump \u201cran on this populist message,\u201d she said, and it is odd that the administration would be taking another look at the pay-ratio rule, because \"C.E.O. pay is the No. 1 populist issue.\u201dStill, there is some progress on the pay inequality front.This year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Equity Index Fund and the New York State Common Retirement Fund reached an agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a biotech company, to include new language on executive and employee compensation in its proxy statement. It says the company is taking a \u201cnon-elitist\u201d approach by awarding stock options to all of its 5,500 employees, not just to executives. The change has helped lead the union and the New York pension system to withdraw a proposed shareholder amendment on the issue of pay.Alexandra Bowie, a Regeneron spokeswoman, said the revised language in the company\u2019s filings did not reflect a change in policy but a \u201cbroader effort to include more detailed and accessible language.\u201dAs for Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, his total compensation for 2016 was $28.2 million, almost 40 percent less than the year before, and nearly matching the 32 percent slide in the company\u2019s share price.Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, said company boards need to be sensitive to issues of income inequality. \u201cI have no problem with someone doing well, who creates value,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I do think a company and a board as they look at compensation need to make sure everyone down the chain is also benefiting from the performance of the company.\u201dBoards need to consider not only how much top executives are getting paid, she said, but also whether rank-and-file workers are being compensated fairly too. The crucial question is this, Ms. Sheehan said: \u201cAre they investing enough in the human capital in the company?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who died on Tuesday from complications associated with pneumonia. He was 74, not 73.An article last Sunday about executive compensation misidentified a company that Charter Communications \u2014 whose chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge made the most last year among chiefs of 200 public companies with annual revenue of at least $1 billion \u2014 took over.

{"Headline": "Google, Not the Government, Is Building the Future", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut don\u2019t be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn\u2019t just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Profit Dwindles, Ford Is Said to Replace Its C.E.O.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 In a shake-up reflecting the pressures on the American auto industry, Ford Motor is replacing its chief executive, Mark Fields, according to officials briefed on the move.During Mr. Fields\u2019s three-year tenure \u2014 a period when Ford\u2019s shares dropped 40 percent \u2014 he came under fire from investors and Ford\u2019s board for failing to expand the company\u2019s core auto business and for lagging in developing the high-tech cars of the future.Mr. Hackett, 62, a longtime chief of the office furniture giant Steelcase and a former Ford director, joined the company\u2019s operational ranks last year as head of its \u201csmart mobility\u201d operation, which includes driverless technology.Despite spending heavily on self-driving research, Ford was struggling to keep pace with larger automakers such as General Motors and tech giants like Google, both of which have been testing self-driving vehicles. Ford is promising to have a fully autonomous vehicle on the road by 2021.The upstart electric-vehicle maker Tesla \u2014 which recently surpassed G.M. and Ford in market capitalization \u2014 is bringing a mass-market model to market later this year.At the annual meeting on May 11, Mr. Fields said Ford was capable of staying competitive in the current market for new vehicles, while also \u201ckeeping one foot in the future\u201d of an industry heading toward autonomous, battery-powered cars.Yet Ford is showing troubling signs of decline. Profit in the first quarter dropped more than 30 percent from a year earlier, and the company\u2019s American market share declined slightly.So far this year, Ford has had a number of safety recalls that have raised red flags about its overall vehicle quality. The company has also experienced a deep decline in the sale of small and midsize cars, leading some Wall Street analysts to suggest that it drop unprofitable models from its portfolio.Ford\u2019s car sales are down 25 percent this year \u2014 far more than the overall industry decline in the car segment \u2014 and it is making little, if any, money on the cars it does sell.The personnel changes at the company extend beyond the departure of Mr. Fields and ascension of Mr. Hackett, according to the officials briefed on the move.Joseph R. Hinrichs, head of Ford\u2019s critical Americas division, will expand his role to become executive vice president for global operations. James D. Farley Jr., who runs Ford\u2019s European unit, has been appointed to oversee worldwide sales and marketing. And the company\u2019s chief technical officer, Marcy Klevorn, will take over Mr. Hackett\u2019s duties as chief of mobility initiatives.In a related move, Mark Truby, who previously led the company\u2019s communications teams in Asia and Europe, will immediately take over as its communications chief. He succeeds Raymond F. Day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Happens When Your Car Gets Hacked?", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPatching is how the computer industry maintains security in the face of rampant internet insecurity. Microsoft, Apple and Google have teams of engineers who quickly write, test and distribute these patches, updates to the codes that fix vulnerabilities in software. Most people have set up their computers and phones to automatically apply these patches, and the whole thing works seamlessly. It isn\u2019t a perfect system, but it\u2019s the best we have.Fast forward five to 10 years, and the world is going to be filled with literally tens of billions of devices that hackers can attack. We\u2019re going to see ransomware against our cars. Our digital video recorders and web cameras will be taken over by botnets. The data that these devices collect about us will be stolen and used to commit fraud. And we\u2019re not going to be able to secure these devices.Like every other instance of product safety, this problem will never be solved without considerable government involvement.For years, I have been calling for more regulation to improve security in the face of this market failure. In the short term, the government can mandate that these devices have more secure default configurations and the ability to be patched. It can issue best-practice regulations for critical software and make software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities. It\u2019ll be expensive, but it will go a long way toward improved security.But it won\u2019t be enough to focus only on the devices, because these things are going to be around and on the internet much longer than the two to three years we use our phones and computers before we upgrade them. I expect to keep my car for 15 years, and my refrigerator for at least 20 years. Cities will expect the networks they\u2019re putting in place to last at least that long. I don\u2019t want to replace my digital thermostat ever again. Nor, if I ever need one, do I want a surgeon to ever have to go back in to replace my computerized heart defibrillator in order to fix a software bug.No amount of regulation can force companies to maintain old products, and it certainly can\u2019t prevent companies from going out of business. The future will contain billions of orphaned devices connected to the web that simply have no engineers able to patch them.Imagine this: The company that made your internet-enabled door lock is long out of business. You have no way to secure yourself against the ransomware attack on that lock. Your only option, other than paying, and paying again when it\u2019s reinfected, is to throw it away and buy a new one.Ultimately, we will also need the network to block these attacks before they get to the devices, but there again the market will not fix the problem on its own. We need additional government intervention to mandate these sorts of solutions.None of this is welcome news to a government that prides itself on minimal intervention and maximal market forces, but national security is often an exception to this rule. Last week\u2019s cyberattacks have laid bare some fundamental vulnerabilities in our computer infrastructure and serve as a harbinger.

As politically untenable as it is, we need government to step in to create the market forces that will get us out of this mess.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber and Waymo Duel at Key Hearing Over Driverless Car Technology", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOne of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars. The company is involved in a legal dispute over whether it used technology stolen by a top executive who had worked at Google.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In the fight over the future of self-driving vehicles, a bare-knuckled brawl between Uber and Waymo is coming to a head.That was clear in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday as the two companies clashed at a crucial hearing in a case that could halt the progress of Uber\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research efforts. The hearing was expected to be the final court session before a federal judge decides whether to temporarily shut down Uber\u2019s work on self-driving cars.The thief, Waymo maintains, is Anthony Levandowski, a former top Google engineer whose start-up was acquired by Uber last year to work on self-driving technology. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of illegally downloading 14,000 documents from Google and then applying those stolen secrets at Uber.On Wednesday, lawyers for Waymo argued that Mr. Levandowski had reached an understanding with Uber before he left Google. To keep that agreement secret from Google, the Waymo lawyers said, Mr. Levandowski and Uber needed some cover, so they hatched a plan for Mr. Levandowski to create a self-driving-car start-up named Otto, which Uber would then acquire.\u201cIn fact, there was this clandestine plan all along that Uber and Mr. Levandowski had a deal,\u201d Charles Verhoeven, a lawyer for Waymo, said.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.\u201cWe\u2019ve interviewed more than 85 Uber employees, and more than 40 attorneys spent more than 6,000 hours reviewing documents, including over weekends,\u201d Arturo Gonzalez, a lawyer for Uber, said. \u201cAfter reviewing more than 300,000 documents, we\u2019ve only found one Google email in the files.\u201dThe case will be decided by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court, who is expected to issue a ruling within the week. Waymo has asked for a temporary injunction blocking Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts; such an order would affect hundreds of Uber\u2019s highly skilled engineers.The two companies have been regarded as leaders in driverless technology, a field that has become crowded in recent years as Apple, General Motors, Tesla and dozens of other companies have flooded in. More than 30 companies have applied to test driverless cars in California, which is at the forefront of addressing regulatory issues raised by such vehicles.There has been little love between Uber and Google in the past, with the companies tangling over issues like mapping technology and hiring. Waymo\u2019s lawsuit against Uber is one of the most tangible manifestations of the enmity between the two.Waymo, which was spun off by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, last year, sued Uber in February. Uber has repeatedly denied the accusations and has separately sought to take the matter to arbitration. Mr. Levandowski said last week that he would stop working on Uber\u2019s Lidar system \u2014 a shorthand term for light detection and ranging technology, a key hardware component in the operation of autonomous vehicles \u2014 for the duration of the case.Waymo\u2019s lawyers opened the proceedings on Wednesday by pointing to documents and emails uncovered during the case. The documents include correspondence between Uber executives discussing the acquisition of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s start-up in early 2016 while he was still working for Google, Waymo\u2019s lawyers said.The documents also show Uber agreeing to grant Mr. Levandowski more than 5.3 million company shares, with an estimated value of more than $250 million, in exchange for meeting various technical milestones and project goals should he join Uber.Uber\u2019s lawyers argued there was no proof that the company had used any Waymo trade secrets.Judge Alsup said Wednesday that Waymo\u2019s lawyers had presented strong evidence that Mr. Levandowski had downloaded troves of valuable information from Google before leaving the company and had tried to erase his tracks after doing so. He also said Uber had determined at some point that Mr. Levandowski was \u201cradioactive\u201d and had taken steps to insulate itself from any repercussions he might face.Yet Judge Alsup also indicated that Waymo\u2019s lawyers might not have proved that there was a direct link between Mr. Levandowski\u2019s actions and Uber\u2019s products.\u201cI\u2019ve already given you lots of time for discovery, and you don\u2019t seem to have a smoking gun,\u201d he said to Waymo\u2019s lawyers.Waymo\u2019s lawyers said they believed that there might be additional evidence that Mr. Levandowski had shared the company\u2019s technology with Uber and had used it in Uber designs, but that Uber was withholding that evidence.Waymo\u2019s lawyers also said that Mr. Levandowski could offer similar proof were he willing to cooperate in a deposition. Mr. Levandowski, apparently seeking to avoid criminal charges, has invoked his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Times Uses Forensic Mapping to Verify a Syrian Chemical Attack", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byImages of children and adults, foaming at the mouth, struggling to breathe, flooded international TV screens hours after the deadly chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun on April 4. A week later, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria went on television to deny Syrian involvement and to dispute the fact that any attack had even taken place.\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether those dead children were killed in Khan Sheikhoun. Were they dead at all?\u201d President Assad said of the images broadcast on TV screens around the world, adding, \u201cHow can you verify a video?\u201dThere is a simple answer to that question: Find a computer, get on Google Earth and match what you see in the video to the streets and buildings. For the six years since the Syrian conflict began, I\u2019ve used these basic tools \u2014 and widely accessible information \u2014 to verify images broadcast on television.My investigation into the veracity of the alleged April 4 chemical attack began with a YouTube video of bombs dropping over Khan Sheikhoun. Using social media, I found and interviewed people who had witnessed the bombings. I obtained exclusive video and photos of the buildings that were bombed from residents of the town. Using GPS coordinates and other mapping techniques, I determined their exact location.Our investigation into the question of whether a chemical attack took place in Syria on April 4 relied on a fairly novel combination of forensic mapping techniques with analysis of witness content to enhance our reporting. Our work confirmed, conclusively, that a chemical attack had taken place in Khan Sheikhoun, and provided a concrete example of what we mean when we talk of video and the way it can strengthen our storytelling.In combination with graphics and on-the-ground reporting, our video forensic work also showed conclusively that the attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun took place hours before Syria \u2014 and its Russian allies \u2014 say that it occurred and cast doubt on the official account of the attack that Russia provided.Here\u2019s what we found:GeolocationKhan Sheikhoun is a town of many minarets. We started our investigation by mapping these towers; they provide identifiable reference points that we linked to images in the first videos from the morning of the attack. We also mapped distant hills, the alignment of fields and houses, roads out of the town and a large mound in the center of the town.Take a look at the Google Earth/DigitalGlobe satellite image above. I placed an electronic pin on every towering minaret in this image and identified each by the shadows they cast. When I couldn\u2019t easily determine whether a particular structure was a mosque or a minaret, I referred to historical satellite imagery, available on Google Earth, to examine older images, taken from alternate camera angles or on clearer days when shadows were more distinct.By zooming in on terrain view, another feature of Google Earth, I simulated how the town looked from the ground. Terrain view doesn\u2019t provide an exact 3-D replica of the town, but it shows the contours of the ground as hills rise and fall. This allowed me to match the position of minarets against distant hills as the video shows, and put myself in the cameraman\u2019s shoes.Analyzing the camera position, it was clear that the video was filmed in Khan Sheikhoun, it was not video from another town. I established that the camera was positioned to the north of the town and was looking south.The location was important because it helped us to ascertain what time the video was filmed, which we could estimate based on the sunlight illuminating the minarets on the video.The uploaderWho filmed it? I examined the uploader\u2019s YouTube, Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook profiles. In his social media history, he regularly talks about events in Khan Sheikhoun. His cover photos are pictures of Khan Sheikhoun. This and other information in his profiles indicated that he was a journalist or activist who lived in the town.His YouTube account contained several videos of bombings and other events related to the conflict that were filmed from the same northerly vantage point. The voice-over on these videos was the same voice that we heard on the April 4 video.Why was this important? It gave me confidence the video was shot by someone who regularly films events in his hometown \u2014 not someone who copies and reposts videos from elsewhere.Time of the attackThe Syrian foreign minister, President Assad and a Russian military spokesman said the attack took place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that day. Video forensics, however, proves that it took place much earlier.My colleague Neil Collier made contact with the uploader, Mohamad Salom, and interviewed him at length. He corroborated the time of the bombing as early morning, soon after 6:35 a.m.Our network of sources in Syria put us in touch with other town residents. A second witness who had filmed the attack sent us more footage that I verified using the same mapping techniques. We interviewed this witness and found that the time frame he presented corroborated Mr. Salom\u2019s account.Doctors at hospitals in the area coordinate support services using WhatsApp, and a medic sent me screenshots of messages they sent in the hours after the attack. The Times\u2019s Beirut bureau chief, Ms. Barnard, and Ms. Saad, a Times reporter in Beirut, verified the messages with two independent medical sources. The timing of these communications was consistent with what additional open source material indicated was the time that multiple casualties connected with exposure to chemical agents was reported.All of this occurred hours before Russian and Syrian officials acknowledged that regular bombing missions had been carried out in Khan Sheikhoun. No other bombing runs were reported that morning until warplanes hit a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun after midday.Video-enhanced investigative work helped us set the record straight.What was hit?A Russian military spokesman suggested that Syrian aircraft bombed a \u201clarge depot\u201d on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town where, he alleged, \u201cterrorists,\u201d or opposition forces, manufactured chemical weapons.However, there were no visible depots near the strike points on the videos taken that morning. Small buildings were hit, and people described them as homes.Note that the videos show conventional bombing and do not depict chemical weapons. However, witnesses told us that the chemical weapons were dropped in the same bombing mission and took place near the conventional strike points.Using TerraServer and DigitalGlobe, I got new and old satellite images of the town, zoomed into the buildings\u2019 coordinates and saw that the damage matched exactly what we see in the photos. As does the rubble in the streets.The satellite verification also corroborated our interviews and established precisely what was hit \u2014 those small buildings that residents described as people\u2019s homes.Large depotRussia said that a \u201clarge depot\u201d was bombed on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town. The only large buildings near the strike points that match this description are a bakery and a grain silo. I found archive footage on YouTube showing they had been targeted in the past. But satellite imagery from April 6 showed that they had suffered no recent damage.We neither received nor found evidence of any other points being hit in the eastern parts of the town that morning. This casts further serious doubt on Russia\u2019s story.The craterTown residents pointed to a crater on the road by the grain silo and bakery where the chemical weapons attack reportedly took place. Fresh scarring in the video indicated the crater was new and, again, before-and-after satellite imagery confirmed this.Though we are not certain what caused the crater, circumstantial evidence and witness testimony establish the crater as the site of the attack. Several town residents say planes passed over the town twice and dropped bombs across it.Rebel-held parts of Syria have a network of spotters that monitor warplanes. They share information with residents and rescuers in an effort to warn of impending strikes. According to information our Beirut bureau received that day, spotters saw a fighter plane over Khan Sheikhoun twice within a few minutes that morning. This corroborates the accounts we received from witnesses.Another activist who works in the town sent me a map marking where the chemical attack happened. This matched our satellite location of the crater. The source said the \u201cpopulation within the vicinity of [this] place were poisoned.\u201dOur investigation does not prove who is responsible for the attack, nor does it attempt to. The O.P.C.W. said it intends to search the site as soon as it is safe to do so. What our investigation shows is how the visual evidence debunks Russia and Syria\u2019s claims about what happened that day. The evidence builds on the testimony gathered by others and puts Syria and Russia\u2019s account into serious doubt.This investigation offered a promising occasion to use new technologies to bolster and extend our reporting into new areas, and it nicely illustrates the importance and possibilities forensic mapping and visual storytelling present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Since Ouster, Sheriff Arpaio Has Lots of Time, but Not for Regrets", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byPushed into retirement by voters who tired of his colorful ways, Mr. Arpaio has gone from being a public official working 14-hour days to a civilian with a mostly empty calendar.His flip phone hardly rings. He has no driver to shuttle him around or assistants to cater to him. He never had time to develop a hobby, so he has to learn to find pleasure in \u201clittle things\u201d \u2014 steering his red Cadillac around town, or searching for his name on Google.\u201cI average six Googles a day,\u201d he said, referring to the number of new mentions of him when he runs his name through Google. That is a far cry from the attention heaped on him during his 24 years in office, when he was nicknamed \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff,\u201d and relished acting the part.Journalists from around the world used to fly in to interview Mr. Arpaio. By his own tally, which he has typewritten on loose sheets of paper, he has been profiled in more than 4,000 national and foreign newspapers, magazines and TV news programs. There was a time when it almost did not matter what other elected officials said or did about immigration. His was the only voice that counted.These days, the positions he embraces \u2014 more agents on the border, more power to local police agencies to enforce federal immigration law \u2014 are emanating from the Oval Office. Mr. Arpaio is on the sidelines, alone but for a tight circle of friends as he waits to go on trial next month on charges he defied a federal judge\u2019s order to stop singling out Latinos for traffic stops.\u201cI get a few phone calls \u2014 where is everybody?\u201d Mr. Arpaio said resentfully one recent Friday, dressed in a black suit, a silver pin of a Glock pistol on his tie.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you would think some politicians \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to talk which ones, I won\u2019t say who, maybe county officials \u2014 you would think they would say something that I did nice in 24 years. I think I did something nice in 24 years.\u201dMr. Arpaio\u2019s entry into civilian life after decades in law enforcement \u2014 he began his career in 1954, as a police officer in Washington \u2014 was the end of an era in Arizona, whose tough anti-immigrant law earned it a reputation as a caldron of intolerance.\u201cThat fueled my anger,\u201d said Mr. Navarrete, 31. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t be angry. I really needed to find a way to build power and to make change.\u201d\u201cThere was an expectation by the media that this office was really a story generator,\u201d said Mr. Penzone, a former Phoenix police sergeant. There were also, he said, \u201ca lot of men and women in this organization who came to work believing it was their job to identify methods to promote the former sheriff.\u201dMr. Penzone has been careful not to give too many interviews, judicious about the places he visits and conscious of the inevitability that everything he does will be used as a point of comparison with Mr. Arpaio.During Mr. Arpaio\u2019s time, a lot of the decisions about where to stage crime-reduction patrols relied on tips from his volunteer posse, anonymous callers or even members of motorcycle gangs. The patrols became a central point of the racial-profiling lawsuit against Mr. Arpaio and his deputies.Mr. Penzone said he still has a long way to go to make amends. Recently, during a visit to the Irene Lopez School in South Phoenix, a predominantly Latino area that was the target of many of Mr. Arpaio\u2019s operations, elementary-school children paraded before him dressed like the professionals they wished to be when they grew up.\u201cNot a single kid wanted to be in law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Penzone said.Mr. Arpaio swatted his hands at the notion that he had been a destructive force, or that his years in office had caused any type of rift.\u201cI know my people did nothing wrong. I did not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m more popular than ever.\u201dHe noted an interesting twist in the criminal case against him: It was started by Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department, but will be decided by Mr. Trump\u2019s. If convicted of criminal contempt of court, a misdemeanor, Mr. Arpaio could spend six months in jail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Return of Kyle MacLachlan (and Agent Cooper)", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "More than two decades after \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d set off a cultural explosion, the actor is reunited with David Lynch and a beloved character.Supported byWelcome to a celebrity profile in which you learn almost nothing about the project the subject is promoting. As your tour guide, I do apologize. So does Kyle MacLachlan, and it\u2019s hard to be mad at him.The guy exudes a Pacific Northwest joie de vivre, one he has used to great effect over the years playing men who are all chipper surfaces \u2014 high-I.Q. Mr. Cleans \u2014 with edginess or daffiness, or both, lurking beneath.In \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d he played an innocent-seeming college student who didn\u2019t mind stumbling into a sadomasochistic murder mystery. On \u201cSex and the City,\u201d he was a blue blood incapable of getting aroused without an issue of Juggs at hand. And on David Lynch\u2019s creepy, brilliant \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d he played Dale Cooper, the cherry-pie-inhaling, coffee-swilling F.B.I. special agent who waxes poetic about the majestic beauty of Douglas firs and turns out to have a dangerous past.Such is the state of appointment TV in the social media era that no one involved can discuss the show except to say that a few years ago, Mr. Lynch met Mr. MacLachlan for coffee and asked him if he was ready to take on the role of Agent Cooper again.Certainly, there isn\u2019t another character Mr. MacLachlan prefers playing or a director he likes working with more. As he put it one recent afternoon while walking up the High Line on Manhattan\u2019s West Side in a khaki Guess windbreaker, gray zip-up cashmere sweater and Levi\u2019s jeans, \u201cWithout David, who knows if I\u2019d even still be acting?\u201dTheir relationship started in 1982, when Mr. MacLachlan, having graduated from the University of Washington, was living in Seattle, acting in a regional production of \u201cTartuffe.\u201d He saw an ad in the paper about a nationwide casting for the movie adaptation of \u201cDune,\u201d which Mr. Lynch was directing, and decided to audition.When he met the director, who was born in Montana and had grown up partly in Washington State, they bonded over the Pacific Northwest, wine and science fiction novels.\u201cIt was a perfect fit from the very beginning,\u201d Mr. Lynch said in a phone interview. \u201cKyle is a great actor. He can play somebody quite pure and quite spiritual, and he can go to the opposite extreme.\u201d\u201cDune\u201d turned out to be one of the biggest flops of the 1980s, but it led to Mr. Lynch\u2019s placing Mr. MacLachlan in \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201d which the National Society of Film Critics named the best film of 1986 and has since gone on to appear on numerous lists of the greatest movies of all time.Then came their collaboration on \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d which focused on a small-town It Girl whose murder is being investigated by an F.B.I. agent. The show was unlike anything that had ever appeared on network TV and garnered critical praise and Emmy nominations for its cast members, including Mr. MacLachlan. Then, with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Frost leaving the running of the series to others, it went off the rails in the second season, and ABC canceled it.\u201cSome people have gone as far as to try to defend it as a brilliant movie,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure, but I appreciate the effort.\u201d Ultimately, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to promote it. \u201cI went into hiding,\u201d he said.Mr. Lynch didn\u2019t hold Mr. MacLachlan\u2019s frustration against him. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough life for an actor waiting for the phone to ring,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to work.\u201dAnd at a certain point he did.In 1999, Mr. MacLachlan went for an appointment with his chiropractor, and spotted a mystery brunette in the waiting room.Her name was Desiree Gruber. At 31, she was already a world-class connecter who served as a vice president at the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan, with clients including supermodels (Naomi Campbell, Heidi Klum) and big companies (Miramax Films, Victoria\u2019s Secret). Mr. MacLachlan talked with her briefly but \u201cdidn\u2019t have the nerve\u201d to ask for her number before going into traction therapy.The next evening, he spotted Ms. Gruber at a Talk magazine party at the Mondrian Hotel. They talked the entire night and decided on an even less low-profile date some 24 hours later: the Vanity Fair Oscar party.Almost immediately, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine not being with her forever.\u201d Ms. Gruber was pragmatic and gregarious in a way that brought him out of his shell and motivated him \u201cto do better.\u201d\u201cShe knows more about my industry than I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the creative part. As do all actors. The business side is something that I run from. And she has encouraged me to not run from that and to engage. And that\u2019s been incredibly helpful.\u201dIn 2000, Mr. MacLachlan made his debut on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d a role he accepted when Ms. Gruber told him to stop vacillating and say yes.Not long after they met, Ms. Gruber left Rogers & Cowan and started the marketing firm Full Picture. There, she helped Harvey Weinstein and Ms. Klum conceive \u201cProject Runway,\u201d a show she owns a piece of.In 2002, after a string of gossip items, they married in Coral Gables, Fla. The bride wore Amsale; the groom, a custom Tom Ford tux. Ms. Klum and Ms. Campbell were guests. There was also a Cuban band with a cigar roller.\u201cWe both grew up in Washington State, and that\u2019s something we bonded over,\u201d said Carrie Brownstein, who created and stars in the show with Fred Armisen. \u201cThere\u2019s a like-mindedness, a feeling of being at the edge of the country, the last stop in this potentially false notion of what the American dream is.\u201dIn fact, Mr. Armisen said, one of the reasons he was happy Mr. MacLachlan agreed to play the part is that \u201cwe definitely stole from \u2018Twin Peaks.\u2019\u201d The actor\u2019s unique gift, he added, was bringing humor to the character\u2019s \u201cdo-good\u201d impulse without ever seeming \u201csarcastic\u201d or \u201coverly ironic.\u201dMr. MacLachlan\u2019s marriage also made him something of an off-camera role model to his co-stars.\u201cThey have an enviable relationship,\u201d Ms. Brownstein said of Mr. MacLachlan and Ms. Gruber. \u201cThey\u2019re not threatened by the other\u2019s success. Kyle is the first to admit she is the powerhouse of the two of them, and at the same time, that\u2019s given him an artistic freedom.\u201dSo when a reporter suggested concluding the High Line stroll with a visit to Mr. MacLachlan\u2019s wife, the answer was yes.We arrived at her Flatiron district office around 2 p.m. Everyone from the doormen to the receptionists knew him. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there, Boo,\u201d Ms. Gruber called out from her office.We stepped inside her lair. Framed photos showed Ms. Gruber with Warren Buffett, Muhammad Ali and Barack Obama, among others. On a table was a copy of a just-released profile of her included in Variety\u2019s \u201cPower of Women: New York.\u201d Ms. Gruber wore a herringbone one-piece from Prada, Manolo Blahnik slingbacks and her trademark Tom Ford glasses.She poked fun at his old-fashioned, aw-shucks traditionalism. He poked fun at her inclination to try everything new.The recent iPhone in his hand, they said, was the result of her overcoming his endless kvetching about how a new device was going to be the death of him.\u201cTechnology to me is like a pattern, and I\u2019ve learned a pattern and I\u2019m comfortable with a pattern,\u201d Mr. MacLachlan said. \u201cThen I get a new piece of technology, and I have to learn a whole new pattern.\u201dHe was more enthusiastic about another of Ms. Gruber\u2019s discoveries, the Allbirds cashmere sneakers on his feet. \u201cI love them,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou have an eye.\u201dShe pulled from a small refrigerator a couple of aluminum juice packets that she explained were made by a Silicon Valley company called Juicero.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a juice?\u201d Ms. Gruber said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have one.\u201d\u201cOh my God,\u201d Mr. MacLachlan said, examining a bag. It had bar codes on it and looked like something from a fancy hospital. \u201cDo you have an IV to go with that?\u201dAn assistant took the packets to the nearby Juicero juicer and soon returned with glasses filled with a mixture of kale, lemon, spinach, pineapple and apple. Ms. Gruber coaxed Mr. MacLachlan into taking a sip.\u201cIt\u2019s really good,\u201d he said, sounding by-gosh, by-golly excited to discover that his wife was right yet again.Set design by Grace Hartnett.

{"Headline": "Google Wants to Be Everywhere With Everyone", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Sometimes you just need to have a party, even if there\u2019s nothing special to celebrate.That was Google\u2019s situation on Wednesday, when it held its annual conference for developers on a perfect spring day in the outdoor amphitheater adjacent to its Silicon Valley campus.There were no headline-making announcements, no big reveal of the sort that Steve Jobs would make (iPod and iPhone) in his glory years at Apple. The tech world moves too fast these days for companies to save products for an annual event; they appear when they\u2019re finished. But the conference must go on anyway.Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, began by talking about Google\u2019s impressive reach. Seven of its products \u2014 including Search, YouTube and Maps \u2014 have more than a billion users each. The Android operating system software is on more than two billion devices.Google\u2019s ambition, as Mr. Pichai and the speakers that followed him made clear, is to knit all those devices and services together. Google users \u2014 which means just about everyone, in Google\u2019s vision \u2014 will interact with the company all day long and do it so seamlessly that they barely notice it.\u201cIn an A.I.-first world, we are rethinking all our products,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Simply pointing a phone at a restaurant would bring up reviews of it. And a search for a small product \u2014 a screwdriver, say \u2014 in a vast hardware store would be enabled by what Google calls Visual Position Service.\u201cGPS gets you to the door, and then V.P.S. can get you the exact item you\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s virtual reality team leader. With an audio interface, V.P.S. would be a gift to the vision-impaired.Google Home, introduced at I/O last year, was rushed out to compete with Amazon\u2019s Echo. While Google does not release sales figures, analysts say Home lags far behind the Echo, which recently announced new features that Home does not have. Perhaps Google can catch up or perhaps Home will become another Google Buzz, a social network that failed a few years ago.The same caution goes for Google\u2019s efforts in virtual reality. It is developing its first stand-alone headsets, done in partnership with Qualcomm, Lenovo and HTC, which will be released this fall. But Facebook and Samsung already have their own well-publicized V.R. initiatives.At the end of the keynote, Mr. Pichai discussed a new initiative called Google for Jobs that will pull data from partner sites to making job-hunting easier.One major job listing site, Indeed, is not one of Google\u2019s partners. Within a few hours of the keynote, the company fired back. \u201cWe are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone\u2019s life,\u201d said Chris Hyams, the president of Indeed, in a statement.That makes another battle joined.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Weirdly Calm. Here\u2019s a Theory of Why.", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsWhen Donald J. Trump won the presidency in November, one bet seemed like a sure thing: We were in for a volatile few years. And in Washington, that forecast has come true. This unconventional presidency is creating an avalanche of uncertainty in areas including global trade, taxes and health care.But on Wall Street, these are the quietest of times. Prices for stocks and many other assets are less volatile than at any time since before the global financial crisis a decade ago, and volatility is, by some measures, near record lows.Consider this: In 2015, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index moved by more than 1 percent on 29 percent of trading days. Last year that fell to 19 percent. So far in 2017, there has been a 1 percent or greater swing in the market in only three trading sessions, or 3.5 percent.This sense of calm would be notable in any event, but the contrast with the sheer variance in the policy world makes it particularly unusual. In a single week, the Trump administration might flirt with exiting the North American Free Trade Agreement, roll out an outline for a multitrillion dollar tax cut and push legislation that would overhaul the health care sector, one-sixth of the United States economy.But while they do a good job of indicating why indexes like the Vix are so low, these technical explanations are less effective at explaining why the actual fluctuations in markets have been so subdued \u2014 realized volatility, to use the traders\u2019 term, as opposed to expected volatility.Something is causing the shares of the most widely owned companies to jump around less than they almost always have in the past. And they also don\u2019t do a great job of explaining why many other markets have also become less volatile than in the recent past, including international stocks, currencies and bonds.Dating to the 2008 financial crisis, markets have swung on every hint of news out of world capitals \u2014 Washington, especially, but also Berlin and Tokyo and Beijing \u2014 because the very future of the global economy seemed to hang in the balance. From the financial crisis to the eurozone crisis to the efforts by Japan to reflate its economy to the effort by China to deleverage its economy, the policies set by central banks and national governments were the prime mover of investor sentiment and the global outlook.Those days are over, at least for the moment. In normal times, markets are driven much less by what governments do and much more by, well, the economic fundamentals. How many people are working, with what level of productivity and savings levels, and what are the resulting economic growth rates, levels of corporate profitability, and interest rates?After all, the assets of those major companies \u2014 Exxon Mobil\u2019s oil rigs and Google\u2019s search algorithm and all the rest \u2014 don\u2019t really change from day to day. All that changes is investor perception about what kind of cash those assets will generate in the future. Isn\u2019t it actually fairly rare that a piece of news should change the fundamental outlook by that much?What makes this moment unusual is that there really are policy choices in play that could have hugely distortive effects on those fundamentals: what happens to trade policy, taxes and health care in the United States; what terms Britain achieves in its exit from the European Union; even whether the E.U. as we know it survives.But if the last few years have taught investors anything, it is that those with a hair-trigger reaction to political news stand to lose, while those who bet on a continued steady and unexceptional expansion will win.You see a bit of that in how subsequent conflicts over United States fiscal policy during the Obama years generated less market volatility. The debt ceiling standoff of 2011 generated huge market swings as traders bet on the risk of a default; the standoffs over the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d at the end of 2012 and a government shutdown in October 2013 caused mere murmurs.Investors learned a lesson that it\u2019s easy to overreact to political developments, and the same seems to have happened globally in the last several months.The risk, of course, is that this generates complacency.Low volatility could make banks, hedge funds and other institutions more comfortable taking on extra leverage, paradoxically making the financial system less stable and more subject to large swings over time.And perhaps most worrisome, sometimes big financial market moves are the mechanism by which policy makers receive the signal that they\u2019re doing the wrong thing. We saw that again and again in the global financial crisis and the eurozone crisis, when it was big market swings that got governments\u2019 attention.So the biggest risk of this period of ultralow volatility is that by looking past the latest headlines out of world capitals, investors won\u2019t send the signals that might prevent political leaders from making a mistake in the first place.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chinese Giant Is on a Global Buying Spree. Who\u2019s Behind It?", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe political spotlight was a global coup for Chen Feng, chairman of the carrier\u2019s parent, the HNA Group, who was on hand to greet Mr. Xi and David Cameron, then British prime minister.Mr. Chen has propelled the privately held HNA onto the world stage through a dizzying array of acquisitions, a spending spree supported by Chinese state banks and hidden behind a holding company with a complex ownership structure. According to corporate filings, state-backed banks have given HNA a $60 billion line of credit, a level of lending usually reserved for state-owned enterprises charged with carrying out the government\u2019s policies.In a statement, the company insisted that it was \u201csupported by strong operational cash flow and a wide range of domestic and international sources of financing.\u201d\u201cHNA Group is focused on continuing to build a leading global platform in tourism, logistics and financial services supported by strong operational cash flow and a wide range of domestic and international sources of financing,\u201d the company said in a statement.The White House declined to comment.HNA\u2019s deals are increasingly putting the company in the political cross hairs, at home and abroad.Mr. Scaramucci, in a telephone interview, disputed any suggestion that HNA was trying to curry favor with the Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019m very glad to have sold my business to them. They\u2019re world-class,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I were to serve in government, I\u2019d sign a full recusal, so I wouldn\u2019t be dealing with them.\u201dAs speculation swirled that HNA could be drawn into a political firestorm, shares of one of the company\u2019s Hong Kong affiliates tumbled late last month. Soon after, critical news articles on the group began disappearing from Chinese websites, prompting concerns that government censors had handed down orders to delete unfavorable news about HNA.HNA declined to comment on the allegations by Mr. Guo.The birth of HNA traces back to the creation of China\u2019s brand of capitalism.When the company was founded in 1993, China had just begun experimenting with private ownership, opening new economic zones and allowing companies to sell shares to the public. The Hainan provincial government asked Mr. Chen, a former pilot with the People\u2019s Liberation Army, to help develop a regional carrier, one that would be partly owned by the state and partly owned by private investors.As the company gained momentum, Mr. Chen brought in overseas investors, including the billionaire George Soros, who in 1995 invested $25 million, for a 25 percent stake. (Mr. Soros has since sold his stake.) With deeper pockets, it began diversifying into other, more stable businesses like hotels, finance, advertising and property development, creating a holding company called the the HNA Group.The strategy and structure allowed Mr. Chen and his top executives to parlay their small stake in a state-backed airline into a controlling stake in its parent company. In doing so, a group of six longtime HNA executives \u2014 led by Mr. Chen \u2014 effectively took the group private.Along the way, he nurtured government ties. Mr. Chen has been a delegate to the national congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which meets every five years to help determine party leadership. In 2008, HNA formed a venture with a firm connected to a son of He Guoqiang, the Communist Party\u2019s powerful discipline chief at the time.It all played to Mr. Chen\u2019s goals. A Buddhist and an expert calligrapher, Mr. Chen has tried to use his force of personality to create a corporate culture based in part on Confucian values of ethical living. But he is also an executive who talks not so much about creating a profitable enterprise as a really big one.In 1993, the company had just $17 million in revenue. Today, it has about $90 billion in annual revenue, most coming from companies acquired outside China.\u201cHis fundamental goal is to be in the top 10 of the Fortune 500 by 2025,\u201d says William Kirby, who teaches at Harvard and has known Mr. Chen for nearly a decade. \u201cThis is an incredibly ambitious company.\u201dHNA, of late, has embraced the government\u2019s push to \u201cgo global\u201d and invest overseas, focusing on shipping, hotels, logistics and retail, amassing a $145 billion portfolio. Over the past three years, it has spent more than $30 billion, according to Dealogic.In a span of three months in 2016, HNA bought a construction and property development company; a flight catering and airport servicing group in Switzerland with 40,000 employees; a St. Regis hotel in Bora Bora, in French Polynesia; a global network of 1,400 hotels, among them the Radisson and Park Plaza brands; and a 28-story office tower in San Francisco.Last year, the company spent $6 billion to buy Ingram Micro, a technology wholesaler, and $10.4 billion for the aircraft leasing business of CIT Group. It has snapped up American hotel chains, golf courses and signature buildings, including paying $2.2 billion for 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan.And two of the company\u2019s top executives \u2014 Mr. Chen and his brother, Chen Guoqing \u2014 seem determined to make a home in New York. Each has purchased an entire floor at One57, the ultra-luxurious, 75-story residential tower, with commanding views of Central Park.The company also outbid the Ukrainian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik for the Upper East Side limestone mansion owned by the art dealer Wildenstein & Company, buying it for $79.5 million. For its American headquarters, HNA paid $450 million for 850 Third Avenue, which includes tenants like the City of New York.\u201cIf there\u2019s any strategy, it\u2019s to go out and buy up as much as possible,\u201d says Edward Tse, a longtime consultant who has advised HNA and now runs Gao Feng Advisory.While other big Chinese deals have been delayed or canceled in recent months, after the country imposed tighter controls on money flowing out of the country, HNA so far has managed to keep borrowing and making more purchases. It has racked up a debt pile of a size that some analysts wonder is sustainable.Its biggest lenders are state-owned banks like the China Development Bank and the Export and Import Bank of China, institutions that generally support state enterprises and the country\u2019s industrial policies. In 2016, another state giant, China Construction Bank, announced it was giving HNA a $4.5 billion credit line, and said that it would partner with the company to set up a $2.9 billion \u201cindustry fund.\u201dIn tapping Wall Street and the global bond market for even more money, HNA has relied on a network of affiliates and subsidiaries to increase its borrowing power. Eighteen companies now listed on the Chinese stock market fall under the HNA Group, and several more trade on a smaller stock exchange in Beijing.Understanding how these companies work together, and who controls the HNA Group, is a challenge. Its shareholders are masked behind multiple layers of shell companies, subsidiaries and offshore affiliates.One of the group\u2019s biggest shareholders is the Hainan Traffic Administration Holding Company, which is in turn owned by four other entities. Those entities are owned by yet other entities.Corporate filings show that 45 percent of the HNA Groups\u2019s shares are owned by Mr. Chen and five longtime company executives. Another 22 percent is owned by the Cihang Foundation, run by Zeng Haorong, a former government official who once served as mayor of Haikou, where HNA is based.There are also a few mystery investors, like Guan Jun, who does not appear in filings as a top executive. Mr. Guan\u2019s residence, in the records, is a rundown apartment building in Beijing.Advertisement"}

Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates was a close second with $1.4 billion.Further down the list was Robert Mercer, the co-chief executive of Renaissance and one of the biggest backers of Donald J.

Waymo had sought a temporary injunction that could have shut down Uber\u2019s work on self-driving cars.The judge ordered Uber to produce a timeline of events that led to Mr. Levandowski\u2019s hiring and to do what it could to return the files to Waymo.\u201cThey\u2019ve set up a perfect scheme here.

In these straitened times for districts, it\u2019s really becoming a question of whether you go with Google and Chromebooks and accept what they entail or do without.BRIAN NADEL, PELHAM, N.Y.To the Editor:Sadly, American public education lurches from one fad to another. Remember \u201cschools without walls\u201d or the \u201cnew math\u201d? Chromebooks are simply the latest fad. There is little evidence that computers in classrooms produce student outcomes superior to traditional teaching methods, at least when the latter are implemented properly.Elite private schools have computers, but they are far less central to the educational process. Instead, smaller class sizes and better teachers are emphasized. However, these are a lot more expensive than Chromebooks.SCOTT OCHILTREE, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:The big question everyone should be asking here is: Are we educating our kids to become active citizens or passive, unquestioning consumers? Which society do you want your kids to live in?To the Editor:I am the parent of two elementary-school children. Our school district has Google accounts for all the schoolchildren, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My children have learned how to use word processing, create spreadsheets, make and give presentations, and use email \u2014 all at a young age in a safe environment. They can log into their accounts from anywhere, do their homework (it even saves their work automatically every few seconds), communicate with their teachers and classmates, and even submit their homework online. All their work is saved and accessible anywhere, anytime. They both have cellphones and can also access their accounts on their phones.To the Editor:Chromebooks might make a teacher\u2019s job easier, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they will produce better educated and more responsible citizens, more creative kids or a highly skilled work force. The distractions that Chromebooks present offset many of the advantages. If Google or Apple or Facebook were serious about providing a useful tool for students, the platform would have looked much different. It would have limited access to the web, disallowing all sites but those with strictly educational value. We would never use textbooks jammed with advertisements, inappropriate pictures or games.I know there is no getting this toothpaste back in the tube, but the last thing children need is more screen time. Google has been virtually giving out Chromebooks like lollipops. It knew full well that the temptation to stray from schoolwork into cybertainment would be inevitable, providing Google with infinite data mining and marketing research opportunities.The Chromebook movement at the high school level has also spawned some very creative ways to \u201cshare\u201d homework, classroom assignments and screenshots of tests.RICK BOBRICK, MEDUSA, N.Y.The writer is a junior high school science teacher.To the Editor:Google\u2019s education apps group director, Jonathan Rochelle, questions the value of teaching students the skills of mathematical thinking when students can just \u201cask Google for the answer.\u201d The purpose of education should not be to teach students how to mindlessly search the internet and locate the answer to a question. Whether the class is mathematics, history, literature, science, civics or the arts, a good teacher will encourage students to think critically for themselves, ask their own questions and discover answers.It is hard for this reader to accept that a laptop with a bunch of apps will ever teach students more meaningfully than a skilled and inspiring teacher standing up in front, armed only with chalk, and challenging students to think.DAVID E. COHEN, WYCKOFF, N.J.To the Editor:This article gave copious details about how the tech giant Google won over numerous school districts around the country, and beat out Microsoft, but I wish it had focused more on what the Google tools were, and how they helped students gain knowledge and acquire inspiration.I was appalled by a quote from the director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, who disparaged rote memorization of equations in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dDuring my years in junior high school I learned the formula for solving quadratic equations and how it worked, and as an aerospace physicist for more than 40 years, I found I needed it often. By being stored in my memory it was at my immediate disposal.Of course we should use computers as we do libraries to look up information. But certain fundamental rules, laws, processes and shortcuts should be memorized, so they are conveniently available. I also found that depending on computers for solving problems can often result in a \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d situation. If you can\u2019t solve the problem as a rough \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation, you\u2019ll never know if your computer got it right.To the Editor:Good for Google. It figured out how to level the playing field across different types of schools and districts to help close the digital divide. And it has helped spawn a new generation of digital citizens who are learning how to use technology in a social, positive manner geared toward learning. Schools can be left scrambling to find ways to give each student full access to a good education. At low cost and with easy-to-use tools, Google has skinned the cat.Yes, Google also has almost unfettered access to a new generation of consumers. That\u2019s a price worth paying given the high returns to students in the form of contemporary, relevant learning.MATT LEVINSON, SEATTLEThe writer is the author of \u201cFrom Fear to Facebook: One School\u2019s Journey.\u201dTo the Editor:The article raises many valid concerns about the infiltration of Google into the lives of our children. The question, however, as to \u201cwhether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers\u201d is no longer relevant. They must be one and the same. I hope the public schools can embrace and facilitate this reality.PAUL FIEDLER, NEW HAVENAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plot Twist! John Grisham\u2019s New Thriller Is Positively Lawyerless", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byProfileJohn Grisham\u2019s publisher, Doubleday, got a nice surprise last January. Grisham, whose yearly delivery of a legal thriller is as reliable as the sunrise, had written a little something extra on the sly: a lawyerless caper. It had a picturesque Florida setting, a fun-filled story about book lovers of many stripes (from those who write them to those who steal them) and a heroine who spent time in a bikini and sandals. Mr. Courtroom had written a beach book. His first.Grisham and his wife, Renee, dreamed up the idea for \u201cCamino Island\u201d on a drive from their home outside Charlottesville, Va., to their beach house in Florida. Its working title was the name of the place where they have a vacation home, but he eventually changed it for reasons of privacy. Its cover still looks just like the view from the Grishams\u2019 boardwalk to the beach.It was Renee who suggested working literary treasures into the plot, which involves the theft from Princeton University of the original manuscripts of the five novels written by F. Scott Fitzgerald \u2014 or \u201cFITZ-gerald,\u201d as the Arkansas-born, longtime Mississippian Grisham pronounces it. The book features two not-quite-adversaries: Bruce Cable, a rare-books dealer on Camino Island, and Mercer Mann, a stymied young writer hired to get close to him.Grisham briefly thought the novel might include parts written by his wife. He wanted her to write the chapters involving Mercer, the female lead. \u201cBy the time we got to Florida 10 hours later she had made up her mind: She\u2019s not writing a word of this,\u201d Grisham said. Nor has she written a word of any of her husband\u2019s other books either.Grisham collects rare books by Fitzgerald (\u201cI do not have \u2018The Great Gatsby\u2019 because it\u2019s very rare and very expensive. I can\u2019t bite the bullet\u201d), Hemingway, Steinbeck and Faulkner, all of whom were candidates to star in the story. But Faulkner wrote too many books to steal. The locations of Steinbeck\u2019s and Hemingway\u2019s manuscripts are too scattered. Only Fitzgerald had a conveniently portable five-book collection stored in a single place, Princeton\u2019s Firestone Library.As a point of principle, Grisham never set foot in there as he worked out the totally credible unfolding of the fictional theft. For anyone who wonders where he gets the precise details on which his books\u2019 suspense depends, the answer isn\u2019t shoe leather. It\u2019s often Google. \u201cI faked every bit of it,\u201d he boasted. He wants as little real information as possible in order to avoid inspiring copycat crime. And he enjoys the challenge. \u201cl love piecing together intricate thoughts that people find compulsively readable and they can\u2019t put down,\u201d he volunteered, and he will never need a better blurb than that. Literary status is not what he cares about. Selling books is.Grisham is garrulous and funny when talking about himself, much more so than the tone of rectitude in some of his books might suggest. But another unexpected side of him also stands out: the accountant. (He has written books called \u201cThe Abduction,\u201d \u201cThe Accused,\u201d \u201cThe Activist,\u201d \u201cThe Appeal\u201d and \u201cThe Associate.\u201d \u201cThe Accountant\u201d was a movie that had nothing to do with him.) Much is made of the fact that Grisham, whose father was a construction worker and cotton farmer, went to law school at Ole Miss and served from 1983-90 in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Not much is made of the fact that he also has a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. He still has that old fiscal pragmatism when it comes to the state of the Grishamverse after nearly 30 years.His breakout hit wasn\u2019t his first book, \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d (1989). It was \u201cThe Firm,\u201d which came out two years later. He has very happy memories of 1991, and mentions that year a lot. It was the first year friends sent him pictures of many people reading his books in the wild.But it was also the year he made what was arguably his biggest financial blunder. A small publisher, Wynwood Press, had printed 5,000 copies of \u201cA Time to Kill,\u201d many of which wound up stacked unsold in Grisham\u2019s office. He got rid of them. Bad idea, especially for a guy who now collects first editions. Doubleday bought the rights to republish the debut novel in 1991, after Grisham\u2019s reputation had been established and after the author had passed on the opportunity to secure the rights himself.\u201cMy agent at the time advised me against it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a $15,000 advance for \u2018A Time to Kill,\u2019 and he did not want to cough up his 15 percent of $15,000! I was too dumb to know it and too na\u00efve, and no one knew what was coming.\u201d And where does \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d stand now? \u201cIt\u2019s pushing 20,\u201d he said, as in 20 million copies sold. \u201c \u2018S a lot of books.\u201dSure is. But one of Grisham\u2019s conversational habits is to say, \u201cI don\u2019t spend much time worrying about it,\u201d after showing just how thoroughly he\u2019s thought something through. At the beginning of his career, Grisham thought about movie sales all the time. \u201cIf you look at the first four, five movies\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Firm,\u201d \u201cThe Pelican Brief,\u201d \u201cThe Client,\u201d \u201cA Time to Kill\u201d \u2014 \u201cthey made them quickly, they paid top dollar.\u201d Those were the days when he and Michael Crichton were one-upping each other with best-selling books and lucrative movie adaptations. Grisham and Crichton hadn\u2019t met but \u201cwe had the biggest racket in the world. He would sell a book for one dollar more than I got, and I would come back the next year, back and forth. And they\u2019re throwing money at us. They would take the manuscripts before they were even published.\u201dThe movies worked, too, on a global scale. \u201cThey\u2019re on cable TV somewhere tonight, being recycled, and they still sell books \u2014 that\u2019s the amazing part. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d That model\u2019s enemy, he believes, is the superhero blockbuster that might make $1 billion in China. It just so happens that \u201cCamino Island,\u201d with its female lead, inviting location and huge plot whammy, is his most Hollywood-friendly book in years.He doesn\u2019t worry much about book sales either, except he\u2019s very alert to the numbers. \u201cThe biggest change for me has been that I\u2019m selling about half the books I sold before the Great Recession,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe a little bit more than half. This is discretionary spending, and people are not spending.\u201dWhatever else Grisham does \u2014 and he has branched out into sports (\u201cCalico Joe\u201d), boyhood memories (\u201cA Painted House\u201d), a kid lawyer (the Theodore Boone series) and miscellaneous (\u201cSkipping Christmas\u201d) \u2014 he absolutely has to write his October legal book. The financial terms for those are bigger, and so are the sales. \u201cMy readers have some patience when I step outside the thriller,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they really want the thriller. They want it every year.\u201dThe next traditional thriller, as yet untitled, will be about student debt, a subject that has lit a fire under him. It will be topical, like \u201cThe Confession\u201d (2010), which was about the death penalty and mostly set in Texas \u2014 with a preening, ambitious governor who bore an amazing resemblance to Rick Perry. \u201cAh, well, no,\u201d Grisham jokily insisted. \u201cFictional character. Rick is a very devout Christian who doesn\u2019t drink, and the governor in \u2018The Confession\u2019 was drinking some very good bourbon every afternoon.\u201dI asked Grisham why alcohol issues come up in so many of his books. Does he have an agenda, points he wants to make about drinking or recovery? \u201cNah. I\u2019ve never been close to the edge of the cliff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very careful. We have a wine collection. My wife is a very light drinker. We\u2019ve all had friends who got in trouble. I have writer friends who battled it a long time, and it\u2019s not a pretty sight. But I really enjoy it so much that I don\u2019t want to quit.\u201dThis was an interesting moment for Renee Grisham to appear. She\u2019d been out shopping, and she was a little taken aback when she heard her husband explain what he\u2019d been discussing. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about drinkin\u2019 and what,\u201d he said, the Southern accent suddenly strong. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 worried.\u201d Well, yeah, she was, but she seemed used to his loose cannon side. They have been married for 36 years.As for why drinking and sobriety turn up in the books, including \u201cCamino Island,\u201d he picked up the thread: \u201cI write about a lot of writers and lawyers. Those two professions have produced a lot of world-class drunks. The legal profession\u2019s filled with guys and ladies who\u2019ve abused it because of a bunch of factors. I\u2019m not really tolerant with excuses. Somebody says \u2018Well, he or she was driven to drink because of this, this and this.\u2019 Their problems were too much, and that\u2019s their excuse. I don\u2019t really buy that. I think it\u2019s a matter of self-control and being able to take care of yourself.\u201dThis is the old-school side of him. It\u2019s tough, but it suits stories of characters skating around the law. The part of him that advocates personal responsibility also has no patience for self-pity. \u201cI tell my friends, \u2018Just stop whining. You\u2019re lucky to be where you are in life, you\u2019re lucky to be here, shut up. I don\u2019t want to hear it. Nobody wants to hear your gripes.\u2019 \u201dGrisham\u2019s friends, family, publisher and close associates are the only people who can reach him. He lives nearly off the grid outside Charlottesville and has an office in town, where he says he\u2019s seldom bothered. If there\u2019s an emergency he can be found, but he long ago decided he liked lying low. Watching Tom Cruise get screamed at by fans during the filming of \u201cThe Firm\u201d was one learning experience. So were stories he heard at Square Books in Oxford, Miss. \u2014 the readers\u2019 and writers\u2019 shrine that he relocates to Camino Island in exact detail \u2014 from the writers Larry Brown, Willie Morris and Barry Hannah, who told him a book tour was a horrible thing.But 25 years since he last toured, Grisham is going out into the world again. He will visit 12 cities to promote \u201cCamino Island,\u201d doing Q. and A.s with local writers and meeting up to 200 fans at each stop. He still signs 2,000 copies of anything he publishes for Square Books; that\u2019s how much he loves the place, as well as a few other independent stores that get similar treatment. But he\u2019s needed his arm massaged after some marathon signings, so this time he\u2019s setting limits.And looking forward to it enormously. What does he have to lose? He\u2019s someone who candidly says, \u201cIt\u2019s all about selling books,\u201d and the tour will certainly do that.Readers of \u201cCamino Island\u201d will learn a lot about how Grisham sees the rest of the writing world. He has described in it everything from what it feels like to sit down and type \u201cChapter 1\u201d (probably not bad, for him) to how a box of brand-new books smells.In the novel, we mingle with several writers who gather at the fictional island, and together they present a Grisham\u2019s-eye view of what fellow authors look like to a superstar. The popular ones want literary credibility. The literary ones want to be more widely read. There\u2019s one \u201cliterary snob who can\u2019t sell and hates everybody who can,\u201d and a \u201cVampire Girl\u201d who \u201chit pay dirt with a series about vampires and ghosts and some such junk.\u201d Most popular stereotypes are represented. E .L. James must vacation in another state.Janet Maslin, a longtime film and book critic for The Times, is a frequent contributor to the paper.Advertisement"}

In his address he complained that no politician has \u201cbeen treated worse or more unfairly\u201d than he has.The Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday invited Mr. Comey to testify in both open and closed-door hearings, offering him the opportunity to address reports Mr. Trump asked him to scuttle the investigation into Mr. Flynn.\u201cI don\u2019t think I know any member that I\u2019ve talked to, publicly or privately, Democrat or Republican, that doesn\u2019t think that Jim Comey deserves a chance to tell his side of the story,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s top Democrat.It was unclear when Mr. Comey would appear. Mr. Warner said he did not expect Mr. Comey to respond immediately to their invitation.The committee also requested that Andrew McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director, hand over any related documents prepared by Mr. Comey about his communications with senior officials from the White House and Justice Department regarding the Russia investigation \u2014 including the so-called Comey memo.The Senate Judiciary Committee issued its own request for information on communications between Mr. Comey and various administration officials, including Mr. Trump and former President Barack Obama.It also requested that the F.B.I. provide Mr. Comey\u2019s memos detailing his interactions with several current and former Justice Department officials related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u2014 Emmarie Huetteman on Capitol HillSpeaking with reporters for the first time since news broke of Mr. Comey\u2019s memos, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Trump \u201cwants to get to the bottom of this.\u201dAsked if Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to end the investigation into Mr. Flynn, Spicer said, \u201cthe president\u2019s been very clear that this is not an accurate representation of that meeting.\u201dRepresentative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican who has a history of openly criticizing President Trump and bucking his party, told reporters on Wednesday that if the allegations contained in the so-called Comey memo were true, they constituted grounds for impeachment.He was one of the first Republicans to join a growing chorus of Democrats suggesting Mr. Trump may be guilty of an impeachable offense, a determination that ultimately would be made by the House.On Tuesday evening, Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida, a moderate Republican, also said if the allegations were true, it would be grounds for impeachment.\u201cObstruction of justice, in the case of Nixon, in the case of Clinton in the late \u201990s, has been considered an impeachable offense,\u201d he said during an interview on CNN.\u2014 Emmarie Huetteman on Capitol HillMr. Trump used his first commencement address to a service academy as president to defend himself, telling graduates of the Coast Guard Academy that no leader in history has \u201cbeen treated worse or more unfairly\u201d by the news media and Washington elites.\u201cYou will find things are not always fair,\u201d the president said, blurring the lines between speech and self-encouragement.\u201cYou have to put your head down and fight,\u201d he said, switching to an explicit defense of himself. \u201cLook at the way I\u2019ve been treated lately, especially by the media. No politician in history \u2014 and I say this with great surety \u2014 has been treated worse or more unfairly.\u201d\u2014 Maggie Haberman in New London, Conn.Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said he planned to invite Mr. Comey to testify in an open session next week.But on Wednesday, as he hoped to reach Mr. Comey with his invitation, Mr. Chaffetz encountered a stumbling block.\u201cSince he\u2019s left government, the old telephone number that I had for him, I haven\u2019t been able to get through,\u201d Mr. Chaffetz said by phone from Utah, where he is recovering from foot surgery. \u201cI used to be able to text and call him on it.\u201dAs of early afternoon, the chairman\u2019s strategy was not entirely clear.\u201cI need to actually be able to contact him and other than looking him up on Google, I need to network out how to be able do that,\u201d he said.Mr. Chaffetz added that he hoped Mr. Comey would be able to appear \u201cpotentially for next Wednesday,\u201d if his schedule permits. The request comes as the Senate Intelligence Committee also asked the former director to appear in both open and closed sessions.\u2014 Matt Flegenheimer on Capitol HillHouse Democratic leaders on Wednesday seized on the mounting allegations against Mr. Trump to jump-start their push for an independent commission to investigate the ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia, as some Democrats took to the floor to press for a stronger statement: impeachment.Representative Joseph Crowley of New York said it is the \u201cgeneral consensus\u201d of himself and other Democratic leaders that an independent investigation is the appropriate path forward.\u201cMembers can come to their own conclusions,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere needs to be a full investigation first.\u201dRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, a former United States prosecutor and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said impeachment required first answering a few legal questions, including determining Mr. Trump\u2019s intent.\u201cIt cannot serve as a method to nullify the election by other means,\u201d he said.Mr. Schiff said the commission, similar to the 9/11 commission, would not replace his committee\u2019s investigation but rather serve as an additional inquiry \u201ccompletely removed from political considerations.\u201dAt a news conference at the Capitol, House Democrats accused Republicans of slow-walking any relevant oversight of the administration, despite an onslaught of troubling revelations.\u201cHouse Republicans have shown repeatedly that they refuse to conduct credible, robust oversight over this president,\u201d said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. \u201cThey do as little as humanly possible just to claim that they\u2019re doing something.\u201d\u2014 Matt Flegenheimer on Capitol HillIn conversations Tuesday and Wednesday about his predicament, Mr. Trump focused on the question of whether the memo was authentically written by Mr. Comey at the time, according to people briefed on the discussions.The president has sounded subdued and weary in these conversations with aides.\u2014 Maggie Haberman in New London, Conn.As the minority party in a chamber with no filibuster, House Democrats have little power to force an independent investigation.They turned Wednesday to one of the few parliamentary procedures at their disposal to bypass the Republican leadership\u2019s control of what legislation comes to the floor, a rarely used method known as a discharge petition. If they succeed in collecting signatures from a majority \u2014 a challenge in the Republican-controlled House \u2014 their legislation can then leapfrog the committee process and come to the floor for a vote.Two Republicans known for defying their party \u2014 Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina and Mr. Amash \u2014 are co-sponsors on the measure.But the process could still take months, a concern that Democrats dismissed.\u201cThese are extraordinary times, and people are counting on us to do something about this,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who co-wrote the legislation to establish an independent commission. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to act,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
