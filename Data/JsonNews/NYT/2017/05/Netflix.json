{"Headline": "Review: \u2018War Machine\u2019: Brad Pitt Has Met the Enemy. He Just Doesn\u2019t Know It Yet.", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byBluff and bowlegged, with a neat side part in his hair and a spine as straight as a schooner\u2019s mast, Brad Pitt strides into \u201cWar Machine\u201d in a gust of masculine self-assurance. The sardonic tones of the accompanying narration \u2014 voiced by someone whose identity will be revealed later on \u2014 are an early indication that Mr. Pitt may not be the hero of the story. Glen McMahon, the four-star general he is playing, has no doubts on that score. McMahon, a man of many macho nicknames (the Glenimal, for example) is a man\u2019s man, a soldier\u2019s soldier, a warrior with the soul of a poet \u2014 the walking embodiment of just about every clich\u00e9 in the book.In adapting Mr. Hastings\u2019s journalism, David Mich\u00f4d, the writer and director of \u201cWar Machine,\u201d also streaming on Netflix, has taken some risks of his own. The movie is fiction, but it hugs the shore of reality, occasionally running aground on the facts. It\u2019s a bit awkward \u2014 though not unusual \u2014 for semi-invented characters to brush up against real people. Anthony Michael Hall plays a volatile colleague of McMahon\u2019s who seems to be based on Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whose more recent adventures may provide fodder for a sequel. The actual President Obama appears on a television news clip, and is played later in a brief scene on an airport tarmac by an actor named Reggie Brown. Ben Kingsley wickedly impersonates Hamid Karzai, at the time the president of Afghanistan.That is a brilliant piece of casting. At its best, \u201cWar Machine\u201d crackles with irreverent wit, even if American political craziness circa 2009 looks tame compared with the 2017 version. It takes a while to get going, though. A raft of secondary characters is introduced via voice-over, but most of them fade into the desert-camo background. The few that stand out \u2014 Mr. Hall\u2019s fireplug, Topher Grace\u2019s glib fixer \u2014 make the labored introductions superfluous. And as you follow McMahon through the first stages of his new assignment, you may wish for a speedier, snappier rhythm.McMahon may be a blowhard and kind of an idiot, but he\u2019s not a bad guy. His judgment can be questioned, but not his sincerity. He is beloved by most of the men in his charge and unflinchingly committed to them. Their belief in him is exceeded only by his belief in himself as a legendary, larger-than-life figure. Everyone knows that he runs seven miles every morning, sleeps four hours a night and eats one meal a day. He his devoted to his wife (a wonderfully sly Meg Tilly) even though, as she points out over an anniversary dinner, they have spent 30 days in each other\u2019s company over the past eight years.McMahon is no tomcat, but no choirboy either. His attractive qualities of bluntness and loyalty are offset by a propensity for passive-aggressiveness in his dealings with civilian authority and a dogmatic attachment to some pretty dubious ideas. He is convinced that the war can be won and that he is the man who can win it. His hubris would be tragic if his overestimation of his own abilities were not so farcical.\u201cWar Machine\u201d effectively rebuts the evergreen notion that military leaders are held back from victory by politicians and bureaucrats. It\u2019s not that the political and diplomatic aspects of American policy are excused, but rather that failure, to reverse the old saying, has a thousand fathers. McMahon, clinging to his faith in the dubious doctrines of counterinsurgency, chases after an illusory victory that his allies, colleagues and bosses don\u2019t really believe in any more. Is he ridiculous or noble? A little of both, perhaps.But \u201cWar Machine,\u201d as its title hints, is not entirely about him. Mr. Pitt\u2019s performance is engaging and complicated \u2014 somehow recalling both the wily and ruthless Aldo Raine of \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d and the lethally stupid Chad Feldheimer of \u201cBurn After Reading\u201d \u2014 but the film\u2019s most memorable words are none of the jargon that comes out of McMahon\u2019s mouth. In one indelible scene, a German member of Parliament (Tilda Swinton) delivers a calm, respectful and unsparing demolition of the American position. It is too long and complicated to quote here, but in another scene an Afghan villager offers a three-word summary: \u201cPlease leave now.\u201dMovie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Winter Driving Hazard", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byWordplayTHURSDAY PUZZLE \u2014 I have this theory that once you start solving crossword puzzles regularly and you push past the early week puzzles, you will look at words much differently than you did before you started. It\u2019s hard to avoid, and the tendency to look at a phrase like \u201coffice temp\u201d and not chase someone down the hall at work and say, \u201cHey! You\u2019re an office temp? You know, \u2018office temp\u2019 contains the word \u2018ice,\u2019 and what\u2019s left makes up two complete words, \u2018off\u2019 and \u2018temp.\u2019 It\u2019s possible that people might get off the elevator a floor early, just to avoid those conversations.My point is, it\u2019s an addictive habit.You might not even be interested in making puzzles of your own, but it\u2019s hard to play with words day in and day out and not see how they can be manipulated and parsed differently. Today, Loren Muse Smith and Tracy Gray collaborate to show you just how artfully that can be done.I\u2019m not great at rebus themes, but I conquered this one without much slipping or sliding around. A word is hidden in four of the black squares, and Ms. Smith and Ms. Gray are warning you to watch your step.That\u2019s because four of the squares in today\u2019s puzzle are made of BLACK ICE (the revealer is in plain sight at 44A), that dastardly winter driving hazard. It\u2019s up to you to determine which ones they are. And to avoid wiping out on them.The theme is made more slippery, so to speak, by the fact that in most of the entries, the second word is its own entry with its own clue, so we\u2019re not sure whether it has any relationship to the word connected to it by the ICE.Got that? Steady yourself, proceed with caution and you will uncover the other three patches of BLACK ICE.\u25a0 5D: Wordplay alert! \u201cIt\u2019s out of this world\u201d refers to SPACE today.\u25a0 28D: Note that I have resisted the urge to make a United joke here. You should too. The answer to \u201cThey\u2019re pushed on planes\u201d is BAR CARTS.So Tracy and I came up with possible themers, and then she flat went to work. And work. And work. No telling how many grids she came up with. At one point I think \u201cwe\u201d just decided it would be too hard. Then a few months later, boom! She emailed with this grid and I was so impressed, I immediately got up from a nap to help with the tweaking and cluing.I like the idea for this theme because a word \u201cwritten\u201d in a black square is unexpected and hard to see, just like that patch of BLACK ICE we\u2019ve all wiped out on.It was a pleasure to work with Tracy, a talented, inventive, resolute constructor.The problems started with the revealer BLACK ICE being eight letters and not working in the center row of a 15x15 grid. It also didn\u2019t work on Row 13 in the lower SE corner, because of its symmetrical theme entry containing a black ice square on Row 3 in the upper NW corner. So, I decided to put BLACK smack dab in the middle of the puzzle with ICE directly below it, which led to the B and the K of BLACK as unchecked letters, but I thought Will might allow it. However, as much as I liked the looks of this quirky grid, I just couldn\u2019t get good fill with four pairs of crossings hiding ICE theme entries, so we decided to give it a rest for awhile.Fast forward to November 2016: A year after our initial conversation and eight grids later, I found that a simple change to a 16 x 15 grid appeared to solve all of our problems. I woke Loren up from her long nap with a surprise \u201cCOMPLETED BLACK ICE PUZZLE!\u201d email so that she could work her linguistics major magic on the tweaking of fill words and cluing.Thanks again, Loren \u2013 it was fun working with you!Your thoughts?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: \u2018Terrace House\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byLetter of RecommendationI came to reality television late, and I watched as if I were making up for lost time. I started with the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise, bingeing on old seasons when I couldn\u2019t wait for the next one to start. Soon I moved on to \u201cLove & Hip Hop,\u201d then \u201cDating Naked\u201d (gone but not forgotten). I took a perverse sort of pleasure in my new habit, but it wasn\u2019t until I found \u201cTerrace House,\u201d a staggeringly banal Japanese franchise, that I realized the format was capable of genuine literary excellence.The premise is familiar: Six young people live together and consent to being filmed around the clock. (The original house had a terrace, hence the name.) But that\u2019s where the similarities to shows like \u201cReal World\u201d and \u201cBig Brother\u201d end. On \u201cTerrace House,\u201d the roommates conduct themselves with what I can only describe as radical civility. They\u2019re polite \u2014 almost exceedingly so. It\u2019s the kind of decency you rarely see on American TV \u2014 scripted or not \u2014 nor on the notoriously cruel game shows Japan is known for. Participants do, in fact, come to \u201cTerrace House\u201d to make friends.The show\u2019s most recent seasons were set in Hawaii, and they are now available on Netflix. There are still no cash prizes. Nothing, beyond the demands of daily life, is at stake. In one episode, a college athlete struggles to stop eating junk food and stay committed to his dream of going pro. Another episode revolves around a trip to Costco. Simply put, \u201cTerrace House\u201d is boring. Extremely, hypnotically boring. But after a few episodes \u2014 and it does take a few \u2014 something strange happened to me. I capitulated. I gave in to the show\u2019s logic. I stopped expecting shocking twists, or revelations, or other rewards for my attention. I started living on \u201cTerrace House\u201d time. I watched 46 episodes in under a month.But even the most humdrum reality show must intersect, somehow, with the celebrity-industrial complex. So, at discrete intervals, \u201cTerrace House\u201d cuts to a panel of Japanese stars who watch the show from a remote location and provide commentary. Like Greek gods, they observe and remark on the mortals from the beige couch that is their Mount Olympus. This clever inversion of gaze suggests to the viewer that these young people\u2019s lives are worthy of examination, however pedestrian they might be.Take, for example, the situation that unfolded when Yusuke, an endearingly awkward ukulele prodigy, asked out Lauren, an aspiring artist and a model. Yusuke is cripplingly shy, humble to a fault, and completely inexperienced when it comes to the opposite sex. Lauren is beautiful, confident and mature for her 18 years. When he finally works up the courage to ask her out, she hesitantly accepts. There are no confessional interviews on \u201cTerrace House,\u201d but it\u2019s clear from their exchange that she isn\u2019t into Yusuke \u2014 only too kind to turn him down.You watch in real time as Yusuke gets a haircut, barely containing his excitement when he tells the barber that he\u2019s going on his very first date. He buys new boots and two different colored shirts, because in the store he \u201cgot confused and couldn\u2019t decide.\u201d All dressed up and wearing a bit too much product in his hair, Yusuke meets Lauren at the movies (\u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\u201d). On any other reality show their strained conversation in line to buy tickets would have been left on the cutting-room floor. But \u201cTerrace House\u201d lets it play out in its excruciating entirety:YUSUKE: This isn\u2019t a sequel or anything, right? It\u2019s a new work?LAUREN: Yeah.YUSUKE: But it\u2019s the same \u2014\u2014LAUREN: It\u2019s a new work by J.K. Rowling.YUSUKE: So it\u2019s by the same author as Harry Potter?LAUREN: It\u2019s not Harry Potter, but it\u2019s the same author. The feel will probably be similar.YUSUKE: Oh, the same author. I\u2019m looking forward to it.LAUREN: I\u2019m also looking forward to it.YUSUKE: It\u2019ll be good, I\u2019m sure.In any other context, this would be unwatchable. But I\u2019d completely succumbed to the trancelike effect of the show, which does so little to insert melodrama and tension where it doesn\u2019t exist that it works on your consciousness like a sensory-deprivation chamber. In this state, even a hint of rejection can be hugely affecting \u2014 just like in real life.After the movie, Yusuke invites Lauren to dinner. She demurs, citing a family commitment. And the date ends \u2014 almost. Yusuke, rather than return home defeated, stoically honors his reservation at an otherwise empty restaurant and eats a catfish dinner alone. Sitting on my own beige sofa, four hours already vanished into his world, I wept.Andrew Ridker is the editor of \u201cPrivacy Policy: The Anthology of Surveillance Poetics.\u201d His debut novel is forthcoming from Viking.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s also plenty of new talent.\u201cCinema is a way of thinking about the world, of knowing others and of knowing oneself,\u201d Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the head of the festival, said in an interview. \u201cIn 1946, by creating the Cannes Film Festival, it was thought that cinema and culture were important in the reconstruction of the postwar world. We still think that culture, and therefore cinema, still has a say.\u201dMr. Fr\u00e9maux\u2019s strong sense of cinema\u2019s purpose is reflected in the strength of the auteur lineup (as well as the subject matter of several films that touch on topics like immigration). Every edition of Cannes is contingent on which directors have finished films in time for the festival, and Cannes this year benefits from a number of major filmmakers who took their ideas in new directions.Mr. Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d one of the most anticipated titles, follows the journeys of two deaf children, each in a different time period, 1927 and 1977. It\u2019s adapted by Brian Selznick from his book, and in addition to its young leads, Oakes Fegley and Millicent Simmonds, it stars Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams.\u201cWhat\u2019s unique about this film, and one of the reasons I wanted to do it, is it\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve never done before, which was make a film I really wanted kids to be able to see,\u201d Mr. Haynes said. He added that in informal preview screenings, children responded well to the film\u2019s stylistic ambition in rendering the deaf experience.Mr. Haynes has plenty of company this year, including Ms. Coppola, who reinterprets \u201cThe Beguiled,\u201d a Civil War-era story originally starring Clint Eastwood in 1971, now with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell; Bong Joon-ho, imagining a new kind of monster in \u201cOkja\u201d; Yorgos Lanthimos, likely to ruffle feathers with \u201cThe Killing of a Sacred Deer,\u201d starring Mr. Farrell and Ms. Kidman; the cleareyed documentary veterans Claude Lanzmann and Raymond Depardon; two films by Hong Sang-soo; and Andrey Zvyagintsev, with the grim-sounding family drama \u201cLoveless.\u201dThe stature of the festival is also supported by the presence of Ms. Varda. Her \u201cVisages, Villages\u201d presents the fruits of her cross-country photographic project in France with the artist JR. And the film \u201cRedoubtable,\u201d directed by Michel Hazanavicius (\u201cThe Artist\u201d), portrays Ms. Varda\u2019s contemporary, the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, played by the French actor Louis Garrel, at a turning point in 1967.\u201cIt\u2019s a story of a man who wants to change but doesn\u2019t know how,\u201d Mr. Hazanavicius said. \u201cHe really revolutionizes himself.\u201dThe festival will also have its first full-fledged virtual reality entry in \u201cCarne y Arena,\u201d about the hardships of crossing the Mexican border with the United States, by the director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.Television, already represented by the major players Netflix and Amazon, is another new wrinkle in this tradition-based festival. David Lynch\u2019s much-anticipated \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d revival will be shown, as will Jane Campion\u2019s and Ariel Kleiman\u2019s \u201cTop of the Lake: China Girl,\u201d with Elisabeth Moss and the ubiquitous Ms. Kidman.The festival\u2019s lineup may give the impression that it is solely focused on famous names, but the 2017 edition embraces the opportunity to track filmmakers tackling new challenges: the New York filmmakers Josh a and Benny Safdie, with the Robert Pattinson robbery picture \u201cGood Time\u201d; Jacques Doillon, with his biographical picture \u201cRodin\u201d; and Robin Campillo, with \u201c120 BPM [Beats Per Minute],\u201d a look at Act Up in the early 1990s. That list also includes filmmakers who stumbled somewhat with recent films, like Fatih Akin and Lynne Ramsay.\u201cThe vocation of Cannes, or all major festivals, is twofold: to honor great auteurs and make beautiful discoveries,\u201d Mr. Fr\u00e9maux said of the mix of filmmakers.The Un Certain Regard section has typically been the platform where such discoveries are made, with selections from around the globe. Mr. Fr\u00e9maux singled out Algeria (Karim Moussaoui\u2019s \u201cUntil the Birds Return\u201d) and Slovakia (Gyorgy Kristof\u2019s \u201cOut\u201d) as two rarely seen countries in the lineup, both with debut films eligible for the Cam\u00e9ra d\u2019Or. Also featured will be the festival veterans Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Mathieu Amalric, Laurent Cantet, Sergio Castellitto, Michel Franco and Valeska Grisebach.The festival is complemented by the vital selections of the Directors\u2019 Fortnight, with additional movies in another parallel program, Critics\u2019 Week. The Fortnight features new films by Claire Denis, Philippe Garrel, Abel Ferrara, Bruno Dumont and Sean Baker. Critics\u2019 Week includes a film by Fellipe Barbosa and a dark comedy-drama by Atsuko Hirayanagi with two executive producers who are not usually mentioned at Cannes: Adam McKay and Will Ferrell.\u201cWhen I hear all the good things, I start doubting things \u2014 it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d Ms. Hirayanagi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s Japanese of me.\u201dThat trepidation is part of Cannes. It happens when the films have their debuts in front of the festival\u2019s audiences, but it precedes the festival, as filmmakers rush to finish their films in time.Ms. Denis\u2019s \u201cLet the Sunshine In\u201d opens Directors\u2019 Fortnight and stars Juliette Binoche, G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Alex Descas. The director remembered getting the welcome offer to open the Directors\u2019 Fortnight before the film was actually complete.\u201cThe Fortnight offer was sort of waving to us: Let\u2019s meet, let\u2019s be together, let\u2019s come,\u201d Ms. Denis said of the appeal of the deadline. \u201cIt was a possibility to experience happy fright.\u201dThat could also describe the nervous excitement with which Cannes audiences await each film: hoping for greatness, not quite knowing what\u2019s next.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maria Bamford\u2019s New Special Is a Kind of Inspired Gibberish", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byOn Comedy\u201cWe have a lot of sex,\u201d she says in a smoky voice before describing her love life. \u201cA lot of fudging and wedging and lotions and potions and unguents and poultices, jams and jellies. Custards, mustards, sauces, souses, foam soups, smoothing milks.\u201dThis litany spins in an even more bizarre direction, concluding with Ms. Bamford shouting \u201cHammer, anvil!\u201d three times and bending down in orgasmic exhaustion.This kind of inspired gibberish, which pokes fun at sex talk but is far too unhinged to be straight satire, really appeals to a certain kind of comedy nerd. Not everyone will be delighted by the unexpected use of the word \u201cunguents,\u201d but some people will be, and count me among them.But while this special will be catnip for those who love the delirious absurdity of Ms. Bamford\u2019s Netflix series, \u201cLady Dynamite,\u201d it also represents a narrowing of her aesthetic, a doubling down on her quirks, occasionally at the expense of being consistently funny. It\u2019s an intimate and inward-looking hour of stand-up that wrestles with the question of who is and who should be her audience.In this special, Ms. Bamford, who emerged in the alternative comedy movement at the turn of the last century, pokes fun at herself for not wanting to perform in a sports bar; imitates an audience member upset at her paucity of punch lines; and sends up the common comedian boast that you need to play for a multitude of different crowds to really develop your skills. \u201cI just did a pop-up open mike at a live birth,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, just to be there for baby\u2019s first laugh.\u201dEvery fan base, including Mr. Burr\u2019s, is its own bubble, and some comics push its limits more than others. \u201cOld Baby\u201d rests comfortably inside its womb, while pointedly drawing attention to it through its form, shifting settings every few minutes through deft edits (Jessica Yu directed the special with an assured and nimble touch), from Ms. Bamford telling jokes to her husband in their house, to a bunch of old friends on a suburban street, then to strangers in a bowling alley.What\u2019s striking is that her comedy doesn\u2019t change while the context and audience does. A seasoned, virtuoso comedian, Ms. Bamford makes the case for stand-up as a personal art form that stays true to itself rather than adjusting to the crowd.Like the greatest comedians, Ms. Bamford has a deep appreciation for funny words. Her jokes are filled with oddball phrases that are whimsical (\u201cpassing fancy\u201d) or slightly puzzling (\u201cI always wanted a clean boy\u201d). She\u2019s subtle and highly self-conscious, but no snob. She is happy to put on a pair of oversize shorts for a laugh. But even her blunt jokes are always slightly off kilter, focusing more on bizarre turns than on an explosive climax.Some of her best bits take the shape of an elaborate metaphor dragged out indulgently. \u201cI\u2019m going full Detroit\u201d is how she describes getting older, comparing her body to that struggling Midwestern city, with aging as seemingly inevitable as globalization. \u201cAbandoning all infrastructure. Letting my neural pathways go slack with disuse.\u201d After saying she\u2019s worried about sinking property values, she moves into the kicker: \u201cI\u2019m a good place to squat.\u201dMs. Bamford begins the special staring in the mirror, setting a mood of self-awareness and quiet intimacy that holds for an hour. After telling jokes to her husband, she gives him a high-five; and the special ends with him playing peekaboo, making her laugh. It\u2019s the second reference to peekaboo in the hour, and it\u2019s not the only time the fun of childhood is evoked.At one point, onstage at a theater, she tries to reproduce a game she played as a child called One Big Blob, with everyone in the audience forming a human chain. It has the feel of a late-night stunt, but the execution is strained and clumsy. The friendly spectacle and inclusion of her husband in this special is endearing, but it can also move from sweet to cloying and is part of the reason this show is more likely to appeal to fans than win converts.Advertisement"}

I always had been scared of the idea of going someplace by myself, and not knowing anyone.

{"Headline": "At Cannes, the Glam and the Grim Mix Uneasily", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 The Cannes Film Festival has always been a jarring clash of the glam and the grim, between often dark films and the stars who pose on the red carpet to promote them. This year, news and business developments were as much on the minds of festivalgoers as the movies and the paparazzi. Here are scenes from the first days of the festival:On Tuesday afternoon the festival honored victims of the terrorist attack in Manchester, England, with a moment of silence on the red carpet, where the festival director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, and his staff had gathered. Organizers also canceled a fireworks display planned for Tuesday evening, when it will hold a gala celebrating the festival\u2019s 70th edition.In a statement on Tuesday, festival organizers expressed \u201chorror, anger and immense sadness\u201d at the Manchester bombing, adding, \u201cThis is yet another attack on culture, youth and joyfulness, on our freedom, generosity and tolerance, all things that the festival and those who make it possible \u2014 the artists, professionals and spectators \u2014 hold dear.\u201dIn many respects, the festival is carrying on as always. At a party at a beach club for the Todd Haynes film \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d Michelle Williams greeted fans while her young co-star, Jaden Michael, danced like Michael Jackson. Another co-star, Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf, chatted in sign language with her interpreter. Meanwhile, a patrol boat filled with armed officers glided along the waters in the near distance beyond a dock with a billboard for \u201cThe Emoji Movie.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t the only time American politics invaded the Croisette. At the gala dinner after the ceremony, the jury, led by Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who wore sunglasses inside, chatted at a central table while news alerts lit up cellphones about developments surrounding Mr. Trump.People seemed hooked on the news, even at parties and between strolls on the red carpet. Ben Stiller, a co-star of Noah Baumbach\u2019s competition film \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d was constantly checking for updates. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed when I don\u2019t get a news alert,\u201d Mr. Stiller said, as fans came up to snap photos with him during a party hosted by Netflix at a rose-colored villa high above the hills of Cannes on Sunday night.\u201cNetflix is having a moment,\u201d said Eric d\u2019Arbeloff, the founder, with his husband, Howard Cohen, of Roadside Attractions, as they stood beside the pool at the Netflix party. \u201cThey\u2019re shaking up the Croisette.\u201dThe situation was all anyone could talk about in the garden, amid the lighted palm trees and flowing Champagne. Would Cannes add a section for works that would go straight to streaming services, Mr. Cohen speculated, the way the 1968 social uprisings in France led it to create the Directors\u2019 Fortnight to showcase more avant-garde works? It felt like a turning point.On Monday a group of European directors, including Michael Haneke (whose \u201cHappy End\u201d is in competition), Wim Wenders and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, issued an appeal for \u201can ambitious cultural policy\u201d covering European cinema and how streaming services are changing viewing and financing models.\u201cLoveless\u201d is about parents in the midst of a divorce, neither of whom wants custody of their son. \u201cI didn\u2019t only want to show the politics,\u201d Mr. Zvyagintsev said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a metaphysical level.\u201dEach year, thousands of journalists from around the world attend the festival constantly on the hunt for a local angle. The news conferences can be surreal, and questions range from the news of the day to how motherhood has changed actresses. At one such gathering for the fantasy film \u201cOkja,\u201d a journalist from Chile asked the director, Bong Joon-ho, how he felt about the film\u2019s genetically modified pig being advertised as coming from Chile. He said he had really wanted to go to Chile but hadn\u2019t had the chance. \u201cSo at least I went in a cinematographic way.\u201dAt the news conference for \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d a journalist from Argentina said he shared a last name with Dustin Hoffman. \u201cCan you turn sideways? I just want to see your nose,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.But Mr. Stiller also got the laugh: \u201cIt was that press tour 25 years ago,\u201d he said.In the luxury hotels lining the Croisette, industry professionals broker deals. Outside the entrances, paparazzi linger, waiting to snap pictures of stars arriving in limousines.As Charlotte Gainsbourg, in a short silver-lam\u00e9 dress, left the opening-night dinner, she was greeted by calls of \u201cCharlotte! Charlotte!\u201d from fans and photographers. She graciously posed for the cameras.\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the game,\u201d she said in an interview later. She is a co-star in Arnaud Desplechin\u2019s \u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d which opened the festival out of competition and was deemed very French by many American critics.\u201cI\u2019m not very good with all the promotion and that kind of life after a film,\u201d she added, then recalled something her father, the singer-songwriter, actor and director Serge Gainsbourg, told her. \u201cBecause I used to sulk a lot, he used to say, \u2018The day it all stops, then you\u2019ll see the pain.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kevin Spacey Is Holding Court. Really.", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byHe asked one young actor to play a scene from Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s \u201cThe Last Days of Judas Iscariot\u201d as if he were talking to someone he\u2019d met on the subway; another to slow down her lines from Beth Henley\u2019s \u201cCrimes of the Heart,\u201d and not get swallowed up in its Southern accent.When he is not teaching seminars like this one, Mr. Spacey, 57, the Academy and Tony Award-winning actor, can be a fearsome competitor in his own work, making unexpected choices and committing to them steadfastly.Having previously starred in this David W. Rintels play at the Old Vic Theater in London (where Mr. Spacey was its artistic director from 2004 to 2015), he is bringing it to the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, N.Y. \u2014 a space not known for presenting traditional dramas \u2014 on June 15 and 16.Better known for the steely confidence he exudes \u2014 in his performances, and at intimidatingly close range, in conversation later that morning at a Juilliard office \u2014 Mr. Spacey has embraced his status as an unlikely Tonys M.C.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want me in the first place,\u201d he said with a self-deprecating laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s all uphill for me, from the moment the show starts.\u201dBut from the stories he shared on this visit to Juilliard, where Mr. Spacey trained from 1979 to 1981 but did not graduate, he came across more consistently as an actor who, even as a young man, possessed singular skill and the conviction it would take him places, before his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 caught up.Having been reprimanded for focusing too much on his acting classes, and not enough on the history of theater, Mr. Spacey recalled: \u201cI said, \u2018For two years, you\u2019ve been teaching us how to carve out what\u2019s important \u2014 how to emphasize, how to underscore. And now you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t do that in my life?\u2019\u201dHe added: \u201cI went, \u2018I think we should call it a day.\u2019\u201dAt the time, Mr. Spacey had no job waiting for him; no agent, no prospects. But, he said: \u201cI never lost faith that I was going to make it at some point. That kind of blind \u2014 very often, unsupported \u2014 faith.\u201dA certain imperiousness seems to unite Mr. Spacey\u2019s best-known roles, up through the dastardly Underwood on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d whose depraved schemes have outpaced real-life politics by at least a few years.(As Mr. Spacey said he joked to the show\u2019s creator, Beau Willimon, \u201cSince things seem to be happening that we\u2019re doing, why don\u2019t we write a bunch of episodes where, like, $500 million gets put into the arts budget?\u201d)That sense of sureness can make it seem like Mr. Spacey does not want or need direction. Thea Sharrock, his director on \u201cClarence Darrow,\u201d says he does, but that he must be approached with self-assurance matching his own.\u201cGreat actors all want to be directed,\u201d Ms. Sharrock said. \u201cThe truth is, the really good ones could do it by themselves. They\u2019ve had to learn how to survive in trusting their own judgments.\u201dWith Mr. Spacey, she said: \u201cYou need to prove to him that it\u2019s worth sitting down, to say, \u2018Kev, don\u2019t do it like that \u2014 it\u2019s better when you do it like this.\u2019 I need to be able to say, confidently, this is why.\u201dMr. Spacey, who has admired \u201cClarence Darrow\u201d since he saw Henry Fonda perform it in 1974, said he was inspired to bring the play to Arthur Ashe Stadium about two years ago, after attending an opening-night concert for the United States Open.\u201cThe stage was not lit like a tennis match \u2014 it was lit like a concert,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought, drama happens on that court all the time, but it\u2019s not used for anything other than tennis. I wonder if it could be.\u201dThe play will be presented in the round, and Mr. Spacey said he was hopeful it would draw about 5,000 to 10,000 people a night.While he acknowledged the oddness of presenting \u201cClarence Darrow\u201d in an tennis stadium, he said a Broadway run would not have been possible. Only the Circle in the Square Theater offers in-the-round seating, but, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s oblong and three-sided, and 700-something seats. You\u2019d have to play it for so long.\u201d(Asked for her initial reaction to Mr. Spacey\u2019s staging idea, Ms. Sharrock said, \u201cWhat do you think my initial reaction was?\u201d Reacting to my laughter, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s what my initial reaction was.\u201d)Mr. Spacey relishes the moments when he can interact spontaneously with audience members nearest the stage \u2014 \u201cYou see the terror,\u201d he said \u2014 and said video cameras and big-screen TVs would help him reach those further back in the stadium.Mr. Spacey was largely mum about how he planned to approach the Tonys, which will be held at Radio City Music Hall and broadcast on CBS, except to say: \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to have a really good time. I don\u2019t think the whole show should be about the host.\u201dThe show\u2019s producers, Ricky Kirshner and Glenn Weiss, said in an interview that Mr. Spacey was, by no means, a last-ditch choice.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make him Neil Patrick Harris or James Corden,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cHe comes in with his skill sets, and we want to build something around him.\u201dMr. Spacey cited the example set by Johnny Carson, both as a frequent host of the Oscars and in his longtime role on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\u201cHis job was to entertain those 500 people sitting in that audience,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my job, to entertain those 6,000 people at Radio City. If they have a great time, I believe it will translate.\u201dMore sincerely, Mr. Spacey explained that, for all of his adjustments and suggestions, the young actors would have to learn to trust their instincts. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get trapped in the idea that there\u2019s a way that you have to do these things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to do them is the way you feel.\u201dBrimming with a familiar certainty, Mr. Spacey said that worrying too much about the expectations of an audience \u2014 whether an audition panel or paying customers \u2014 was the surest route to taking yourself out of a performance.\u201cThe last thing you should be thinking about,\u201d he said, \u201cis what they\u2019re going to think.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It will be 12 years after Fox canceled the show, and five years after Netflix revived it for a long-awaited fourth season.\u201cIn talks with Netflix we all felt that stories about a narcissistic, erratically behaving family in the building business \u2014 and their desperate abuses of power \u2014 are really underrepresented on TV these days,\u201d Mitchell Hurwitz, the series creator, said in a statement.The fifth season will get the whole family back together: Michael, George Michael, George Bluth Sr., Lucille, Gob, Buster, Lindsay, Tobias and Maeby (played by Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter, Will Arnett, Tony Hale, Portia de Rossi, David Cross and Alia Shawkat).Netflix did not say how many episodes would be in the new season, or if they would all be released at once, as Netflix typically does with its TV series.The show received critical acclaim but less-than-stellar ratings over three years on Fox between 2003 and 2006. It always enjoyed hearty enthusiasm on the internet, where reaction GIFs and in-jokes have scarcely receded more than a decade later.Fans begged for a Bluth reunion, and Netflix complied, creating a fourth season with 15 episodes that were released all at once in 2013.But that revival largely failed to meet sky-high expectations. While the season has its defenders, many fans and critics thought it lacked the charm of the original three seasons.\u201cSeason Four marked the first foray by Netflix into original comedy programming and this time, the Bluths will collectively be spending more quality time with their millions of fans around the world,\u201d Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hollywood Writers and Studios, Scrambling to Avert Strike, Reach Last-Minute Deal", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Hollywood writers reached a tentative deal for a new three-year contract with television and movie studios early Tuesday, averting a strike in dramatic overtime negotiations.At nearly 1 a.m. on the West Coast, weary union leaders, including Patric Verrone, the former president of the Writers Guild of America, West, emerged from the offices of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, and said that a favorable contract had been drawn up.In a statement posted on its website, the Writers Guild, West, said it had made \u201cunprecedented gains.\u201d It added, \u201cDid we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild\u2019s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.\u201dIn a one-sentence joint statement, writers and the producers\u2019 alliance said that they had secured \u201ca tentative agreement on terms for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement.\u201dThe previous contract between studios and more than 12,000 writers expired at midnight. The Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as soon as Tuesday morning.Union negotiators had locked horns with their studio counterparts all the way through. On Sunday, studios had made a new offer \u2014 one reflecting improvements in some areas (health care) and scant movement in others (raises for streaming series) \u2014 and the unions on Monday made counteroffers that held a hard line on multiple demands, according to three people briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings.A deal only started to take shape as midnight approached, with both sides scrambling to find common ground.Writers and studios did not see eye to eye on several issues involving technology. Most prominently, writers wanted pay rates for shows that run on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime to be more like those for blue-chip broadcast network series. The unions also wanted members to receive bigger residual payments for online reruns of old shows and movies.Another sticking point involved what is known as \u201cspan,\u201d or how long TV writers spend on each script. There are more shows than ever, but networks are ordering many fewer episodes per season \u2014 as few as six, compared with 22 or more in the past. At the same time, the episodes that are ordered are taking longer to produce \u2014 up to three weeks per episode, rather than the usual two. So series writers who are paid per episode are often making less while working more.Under proposals discussed Monday, according to analysts at Moody\u2019s, higher compensation for writers would cost some entertainment companies $100 million to $125 million annually for each year of a new three-year contract. Unions representing directors and actors \u201cwill likely key off any agreement\u201d with writers, adding to cost increases.The actors\u2019 contract with studios expires on June 30.As the entertainment capital waited for word on talks on Monday, union members, including one involved with talks, posted messages on Twitter using the hashtag #wgaunity. Eileen Conn, whose credits include the Disney Channel series \u201cK.C. Undercover\u201d and the 1990s sitcom \u201cJust Shoot Me,\u201d posted a photo of Sally Field as the title character from the film \u201cNorma Rae\u201d and wrote: \u201cWe are strong! We are united!\u201dSome prominent politicians joined them. \u201cI stand with the Writers Guild of America for fair pay and decent health care because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and because Bruce and I can\u2019t wait for the next season of \u2018Ballers\u2019 to start,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Facebook, referring to her husband, Bruce Mann.In the last big Hollywood strike, a decade ago, an enraged Writers Guild walked out for 100 days over pay for digitally distributed shows. Tens of thousands of entertainment workers were idled, and the action cost the Los Angeles economy more than $2 billion, according to the Milken Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Netflix-Cannes Clash Couldn\u2019t Be Avoided", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 France is a paradise for moviegoers, with thriving cinemas and state subsidies for new productions. Netflix is a global streaming giant founded on the concept that movie theaters are a thing of the past. So it was perhaps inevitable that the two worlds would collide over the Cannes Film Festival, which begins here on Wednesday.At the heart of the Cannes-Netflix clash is what\u2019s known as the French cultural exception, a law that requires a percentage of all box office, DVD, video on demand, television and streaming revenues to be pooled to finance homegrown films and help finance foreign films. The law also mandates a 36-month delay between theatrical release and streaming date. Netflix has not wanted to participate in the French system, and that offended some in the film industry here.\u201cThey are the perfect representation of American cultural imperialism,\u201d said Christophe Tardieu, director of the National Cinema Center, known as the CNC, a state entity that coordinates public financing of films. It also underwrites more than half the budget of the Cannes Film Festival and has seats on its board, as do French movie theater owners. \u201cI deplore Netflix\u2019s attitude in this affair, which showed total intransigence and refusing to understand and accept how the French cultural exception works,\u201d Mr. Tardieu added.Representatives of Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. After the festival\u2019s decision last week, Reed Hastings, a co-founder of Netflix, posted on Facebook, \u201cThe establishment closing ranks against us. See \u2018Okja\u2019 on Netflix June 28th. Amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into Cannes film festival competition.\u201dIn contrast, another streaming company, Amazon Studios, says it aims for theatrical releases for its films. It has a film in competition at Cannes this year, Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which will be shown in theaters in France.\u201cCannes misjudged,\u201d said Thomas Sotinel, a film critic and journalist at Le Monde. Festival programmers thought \u201cthey could get away with showing Netflix movies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they found out Netflix wouldn\u2019t move, and at the same time they were reminded that on the board of Cannes sit people like the theater owners, who don\u2019t want to budge either. So they were caught between those two very immovable protagonists \u2014 or rather, antagonists.\u201dIn France, the CNC said the Netflix films did not qualify for limited releases under an exemption for less mainstream work. But if Netflix had agreed to a wide release, it would have meant a 36-month wait before the movies could be streamed. That delay is part of France\u2019s \u201cmedia chronology\u201d in the cultural exception law, which sets a strict time frame in which a film moves from theaters to video-on-demand after four months, to cable television after 10 months, to free television after 22 months and finally to a streaming service.Most of the entities in France\u2019s film industry, as well as viewers, agree the 36-month wait is far too long, but complex talks about altering the time frame broke down just days before Cannes announced its rule change.Any new chronology must be approved by cinema owners, producers, cable and free television broadcasters, on-demand operators and associations representing writers, among others. Cable television operators like Canal Plus, which help finance productions aimed for theatrical releases, eventually want those films to be shown on their channels before they move to free channels or to a service that is not contributing to the financing system.\u201cThe difficulty is that you have a system that\u2019s extremely regulated but that works,\u201d said Marc-Olivier Sebbag, the general delegate of the National Federation of French Cinemas.\u201cThere are idiotic rules that don\u2019t let Netflix films come out for 36 months; I understand it\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Pascal Rogard, director general of the authors\u2019 society. \u201cThe real open question that will be given to the next culture minister is, \u2018Can we create a modernized media chronology so a film doesn\u2019t have to wait three years to go to Netflix?\u2019\u201dMr. Rogard and others said that they hoped the new government of President Emmanuel Macron would dedicate some political will to helping the parties shorten the time frame. Mr. Macron is expected to name a new culture minister this week.Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the Cannes Film Festival director who oversees selecting films for competition, said he had no comment beyond the official statement last week.That statement said that the festival was \u201caware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in France,\u201d adding that it had \u201casked Netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of French movie theaters and not only its subscribers.\u201d As a result, it stated, \u201cthe festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\u201dOn Monday, the festival announced that its opening and closing ceremonies would be broadcast to select French movie theaters \u2014 at the same time they\u2019re broadcast live on Canal Plus pay television.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Families of Teens at Suicide Risk, \u201813 Reasons\u2019 Raises Concerns", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byAs a mom who lost her son to suicide in 2013, a Houston nurse became concerned when she heard about the popular Netflix show \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d By then her 15-year-old daughter had already binge-watched it.In the series, the character Hannah Baker kills herself in despair, leaving audiotapes for the people she holds responsible, among them, her rapist, fickle friends and bullies. The tapes are part justification for her suicide and part vengeful accusation of her peers.Its creators have defended the show, saying they aimed to make the drama helpful to struggling kids.But for the nurse\u2019s family, the show has been devastating. Her daughter, who found her brother\u2019s body, has been working through depression and trauma ever since. With treatment and regular therapy, things got better \u2014 until she watched \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d Now the show has set off new thoughts of despair and suicide in her daughter, she said.\u201cIf I\u2019d known about the show beforehand I would have monitored her Netflix account a bit more,\u201d said the nurse, whose name is being withheld to protect her daughter\u2019s privacy. \u201cIf kids have a history of depression, self-harm or suicidal thoughts, I don\u2019t think they need to watch it.\u201dOn Friday, in a letter to parents, Robert Avossa, superintendent of Palm Beach County schools in Florida, reported that his employees have seen an uptick in self-mutilation and threats of suicide among elementary and middle school students since the show began.The Netflix series, which may be renewed for a second season, is based on the 2007 young adult novel \u201cThirteen Reasons Why,\u201d by Jay Asher. It includes a graphic scene in which Hannah kills herself with a razor. Its creators say it\u2019s an unglamorous death, and they worked hard to make sure it wasn\u2019t gratuitous.Netflix has created an accompanying 30-minute documentary \u201cBeyond the Reasons,\u201d that includes the cast, producers and mental health experts discussing some of the show\u2019s more difficult scenes. In the documentary Brian Yorkey, the creator of the series, said, \u201cWe did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted it to be very clear that there is nothing \u2014 in any way \u2014 worthwhile about suicide.\u201dIn a statement, Netflix said the writers sought the advice of medical professionals while writing the script, and the show carries a TV-MA rating as well as a warning about graphic content. \u201cOur members tell us that 13 Reasons Why has helped spark important conversations in their families and communities around the world,\u201d the statement said.Some parents have defended the show. Dawn Zawadzki, a paralegal from Fort Mill, S.C., said she watched part of the series with her 16-year-old daughter. \u201cEverybody is saying \u2018it glamorizes suicide,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think it does,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s making us wake up and look at it.\u201dNot everyone agrees. Just before its March 31 release, a producer sought the support of the JED Foundation, a teen suicide prevention group. \u201cI think they were looking for us to say, \u2018It was a great educational tool,\u2019\u201d or that \u201cthey handled the issues in a psychologically helpful way,\u201d said Dr. Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at the JED Foundation.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, because they got a lot of important issues out on the table,\u201d Dr. Schwartz said. But he\u2019s concerned that students could think of suicide as a way to get back at people and worried that showing the specific way Hannah died would spur imitators. \u201cThe missteps are high stakes,\u201d he concluded.The problem, suicide prevention experts said, is that even an ugly suicide can beget copycats. Research has shown that \u201csomeone else\u2019s death by suicide can reinforce a vulnerable person\u2019s motivation to die by suicide,\u201d said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia University.On Instagram, Paris Jackson, a 19-year-old model who has tried to kill herself in the past, called the series, \u201cextremely triggering.\u201d \u201cPlease only watch this show with caution and keep in mind that it may put you in a dark place,\u201d she wrote in a post that got more than 20,000 likes.The show\u2019s fatalism leaves the impression that suicide can\u2019t be stopped, experts said. In one concerning scene, a character agonizes that he could have done more to help his friend. A school counselor tells him: \u201cIf she wanted to end her life, we weren\u2019t going to stop her.\u201dThe statement runs counter to the advice given to teachers and peers about how to help at-risk teens.\u201cFor kids, that action is staying with your friend, not keeping it a secret, and telling a trusted adult,\u201d said Richard Lieberman, who coordinated suicide prevention for Los Angeles Unified School District for 25 years. Another option is to call the National Suicide Prevention line, 1-800-273-8255, or text HOME to 741741.Hours before her death, Hannah goes to see the school counselor, hints that a senior assaulted her, and cryptically says, her eyes welling with tears, that \u201cI need everything to stop, people, life.\u201d He hands her tissues, but doesn\u2019t conduct a suicide-risk assessment or consider hospitalization.\u201cThat was gross negligence,\u201d Dr. Miller said, and it sends \u201ca dangerous message\u201d that adults don\u2019t care.Although the creators of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d aspired to educate, the show itself never mentions a critical point: most children who die by suicide have a mental health disorder like depression that\u2019s treatable.And throughout the series, as other characters talk of suicide, little is done to address their struggles. \u201cThe series is actually depicting suicide contagion, and at the same time, it\u2019s denying the suicide contagion exists,\u201d Dr. Gould said. It\u2019s \u201cso upsetting to me on so many levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tituss Burgess: The First Time I Had to Parent My Mom", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byThe First TimeMy mother was a single parent for much of my youth. She worked during the day, and so when I was about 5 to 12 years old I would spend the summer at my grandparents\u2019 home in Georgia, with my mom bringing me back to Athens on the weekends. In my early years, I protested. You see, their home was large. I truly thought something would come and steal me in the night and that no one would hear my cry for help. The house sat on a farm off Highway 78, surrounded by trees and animals. Oh, the noises I would hear! If a small branch so much as dropped on the tin roof, I knew that was the end for me. But I learned to love being there as I got older and realized how special this time was with my grandparents.I was a grandma\u2019s boy. My granddad tried with all his might to get me to help work in the garden. He even taught me how to drive his tractor. I couldn\u2019t be bothered. I may or may not have messed up a few outdoor chores on purpose. Just to add a little sauce on it, I pretended to be devastated so he didn\u2019t suspect he had granted my wish. So I cooked and cleaned with Grandma, Rosena Burgess. She was a tall woman, a giant in my eyes. When we would take naps, I would sleep on her stomach to make sure she was breathing.My grandparents had eight children, and my mother, Sandra, was the baby. You can imagine the perks that come with that title. She relied on the comfort and love my grandmother gave her. I guess you could say she was her best friend. My mom had wrestled in some capacity with insecurities that followed her into adulthood. Being in Grandma\u2019s presence seemed to ease them for her. She seemed to understand my mom on a level I haven\u2019t even come close to matching. They shared a shorthand about all things work, church and family, and often would burst into hysterical laughter.As I got older and busier with my classes at the University of Georgia in the late \u201990s, I wasn\u2019t able to visit my grandparents as often as I liked. So one time I decided to spend the night with them. As we were watching Channel 5, one of the three stations they got clearly, I noticed my grandmother kept repeating questions. I answered them as many times as she asked. I just thought it was old age. But then she got on her knees to pray, and went to bed. She got out of bed and kneeled down to pray. She went back to bed, then sat up and said, \u201cGoodness, I forgot to say my prayers.\u201dWe were all devastated, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice what it did to my mom. She had not only lost her mother but also her best friend, her shield, her protector in a way. I did what I could to fill this new void, but nothing seemed to help. She would sleep all day. She barely ate. I would call, and it was a stranger on the line.When I was growing up, we got spankings. Accompanying them was the phrase, \u201cThis is out of love, not to hurt you.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand it at the time. But suddenly it was my turn to express firm, uncomfortable love. My mom wanted me to come and see her. I had been searching for a way to help her, and with that one request it occurred to me how to parent my own mother. I was scared as hell, as this is my mama I\u2019m talking to. It took everything in me to muster the words, but I said \u201cno.\u201dI told her: \u201cMommy, you are hurting, and I don\u2019t know how to help you. I will come for a few days, and it will offer some relief, but when I have to leave you will be that much more distraught. My leaving will compound grandmother\u2019s absence. I will come see you on one condition: You have to seek grief counseling. Not just for you but for me.\u201dOddly, that \u201cno\u201d ambushed the old Sandra into showing up. She couldn\u2019t believe I would talk back to her, let alone deny her this desire in a time of need.She hung up on me.The roles were reversed. I had a certain power now that I didn\u2019t know I had. And I had to use it to usher her through that difficult phase. We didn\u2019t speak for a few weeks. Then I got a call, and to my surprise she was telling me about a counselor she had been seeing. When I flew home, things were so different. We had all new roles to play. A whole new dynamic to learn.I will never forget as we sat at the kitchen table, seeing each other as adults for the first time, and I said, \u201cI did this out of love, not to hurt you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Networks Offer Taste of TV\u2019s Ad Future. Marketers Are Hungry for More.", "Date": "2017-05-21", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAmerica\u2019s biggest television networks invited advertisers to New York institutions like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center last week, giving them an early glimpse at their fall lineups and treating them to lavish parties and a parade of stars including Stephen Colbert, Kim Kardashian and Tony Romo, all with the aim of attracting billions of dollars in advertising by the end of the summer.The tradition dates to the 1960s, when viewing habits were entirely different. And while the networks have spent the past few years trying to convince marketers of their digital prowess despite falling ratings and new platforms for watching TV, Silicon Valley seemed to cast an especially long shadow this year.\u201cMost networks are starting to recognize that the standard model of 18 minutes of 30-second spots in a 60-minute show will never grow and is probably not sustainable,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief investment officer at the agency OMD. \u201cJust making more compelling shows is not going to solve that problem.\u201cThat goose continues to lay golden eggs; they\u2019re just smaller every year,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cThis is the same challenge the record companies had: How fast do you shift to a new model at the risk of your existing, lucrative one?\u201dTurner Broadcasting, which owns channels like CNN, TBS and TNT, especially impressed advertisers with its presentation. The company emphasized its willingness to experiment with new, longer formats for traditional commercials and said it would continue to reduce the number of ads it runs during shows. It is risky to cut back on ad inventory, especially as ratings decline, but the company contends that doing so creates a better viewer experience and more effective, engaging commercials.Turner also highlighted its new data and audience-targeting collaboration with its rivals Viacom and Fox Networks Group and the number of video-on-demand rentals its properties commanded in the first quarter.\u201cI was really kind of blown away by Turner,\u201d said Lou Paskalis, an executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who oversees paid media investments. He said the company\u2019s presentation, as well as some of the new advertising ideas discussed by Fox Networks Group and CBS, addressed the major concern that he and other marketers shared: How do you compete for consumers\u2019 attention, especially as they move to block ads and turn to platforms like Netflix, where running commercials is not an option?\u201cIf the consumer\u2019s in control, you have to figure out how to adapt your consumer experience to the device they\u2019re going to consume your content on,\u201d he said.The Fox group also discussed a new system for measuring the effectiveness of ads on its online properties to help marketers determine which versions to use just hours later on traditional TV.That fits into a broader narrative in the TV industry, in which executives have long complained that as Americans increasingly watch shows on an array of devices, and do so outside the three- or seven-day windows that are now measured, networks are not getting full credit for their total audience figures.Joe Marchese, Fox Networks Group\u2019s new ad sales chief, dismissed Facebook\u2019s claim that it could offer advertisers a \u201cSuper Bowl on mobile every day,\u201d saying that the number of video ad minutes available in Fox\u2019s prime-time broadcasts \u201cdwarf\u201d those on YouTube and Facebook.Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal\u2019s ad sales chief, expressed skepticism that people \u201cliking\u201d an ad or product on Facebook actually led to sales. And Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, cited Amazon, Apple and Google as companies that, like the network, were \u201call about mass audience\u201d while noting that all three also paid to advertise with CBS.Still, the new ideas about advertising did not dominate the presentations, in part because the concepts are still evolving but mostly because the traditional way of selling TV ads remains the biggest moneymaker for the networks.\u201cThe statement used to be \u2018digital pennies for TV dollars,\u2019\u201d said Mike Law, executive vice president for video investments at Amplifi, Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s investment arm. \u201cNow it may be digital nickels for TV dollars, but the vast amount of revenue these networks are generating is coming from TV. In a marketplace we think will be down a little bit in spend volume, networks getting their fair share of revenue is critical to them.\u201dThat may have to change, particularly now that networks have given marketers a taste of new possibilities. Mr. Paskalis of Bank of America, for one, was left wanting more.\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see the most, frankly, is even more focus on user experience and opportunities for marketers to join the conversation around the programming than just advertise adjacent to the programming,\u201d Mr. Paskalis said. He offered examples like creating polls in advance for marketers to run related to particular plot developments in scripted shows and allowing brands to sponsor limited commercial interruptions.\u201cHow can marketers do more to add to the experience,\u201d he said, rather \u201cthan just be the tax you have to pay to enjoy the experience?\u201dAdvertisement"}

(All seven episodes will be available on Netflix on Friday.) Anne is a 13-year-old who is mistakenly sent by her orphanage to Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert (Geraldine James and R. H. Thomson), an aging brother and sister who had expected a boy to help out on their farm. Matthew, after initial dismay, warms to Anne, but the match seems doomed to fail because of the stern Marilla\u2019s reaction.\u201cWhat good would she be to us?\u201d she asks her brother.He replies, \u201cWe might be some good to her.\u201dAnne is talkative to a fault and delightfully precocious; the contrast between her vocabulary and the vacuous drivel emitted by most teenage characters on Nickelodeon or the Disney Channel is startling.\u201cIt\u2019s all very well to read sorrowful stories and imagine yourself living through them heroically,\u201d she tells Marilla, \u201cbut it\u2019s not so easy when you\u2019re actually woeful, is it?\u201dWatch this series with young children and you\u2019d best be prepared to annotate it on the fly. But do feel free to watch it with young children. Parents dismayed by the frenetic pace and disrespectful tone of many modern kids\u2019 shows may be put off by the notion of an \u201cAnne\u201d that substitutes substance for saccharinity. They needn\u2019t be.Ms. James and Mr. Thomson lend the stability of skilled veterans to the proceedings, which helps Ms. McNulty do the difficult work of selling a complicated character who is simultaneously vulnerable and proud, self-denying and self-absorbed, practical and prone to fantasy. Her portrayal isn\u2019t seamless, but it\u2019s endearing. And it establishes Anne as, of all things, subversive, at least when measured against other teenagers on television and in film.It has become standard practice to turn youthful characters into psychology textbook cases: The kid commits a crime or dives into drugs, and soon we learn of an alcoholic parent or abusive uncle, the traumatic upbringing becoming the explanation for the waywardness.There\u2019s plenty of tragic truth to that construct, of course, but in Anne we have a more novel sort of child: one who, helped by her ability to use her imagination as a defense mechanism, remains generally upbeat despite the abuse in her past and the callousness of many of the grown-ups in her present. Yes, this rewarding series says, be sunny and positive. But don\u2019t assume those around you will be.Advertisement"}

This season features a black-and-white premiere inspired by Italian neo-realist cinema, a flashback episode that spans more than two decades in the lives of Dev and his friend Denise (Lena Waithe) and one episode that cuts seamlessly in and out of half a dozen first dates.In a phone interview, Mr. Yang discussed the series, one of the year\u2019s most critically acclaimed. These are edited excerpts from the conversation, which include spoilers for the entirety of \u201cMaster of None\u201d Season 2.New York looks so alluring on \u201cMaster of None.\u201d Were you trying to create a fantasy vision of the city?Not explicitly. But I love New York so much, and I think Aziz does, too. We want to make the show beautiful, and a lot of New York is beautiful and romantic, if you\u2019re looking at it with a certain eye.Another aspect of it is that Dev is a lucky guy, much like Aziz and I are lucky guys. Dev has a stupid job that pays him a lot of money, so he can take girls out on dates. That\u2019s not a given, and we understand that. But we wanted to reflect our own experience. We pick places that we like, and a lot of them have nice interiors because a lot of them are our friends\u2019 restaurants, and they have good taste. It does make New York look warm and convivial and fun, as opposed to a bleak, lonely hellscape.One of the season\u2019s great episodes is \u201cThanksgiving,\u201d which looks back on Dev and Denise\u2019s lifelong friendship, as well as her struggle to come out to her mom (Angela Bassett). What role did Lena Waithe, who\u2019s credited as a co-writer, play in its creation?Then me and Aziz and the writers started talking: \u201cWhat\u2019s a way to elevate this beyond just another coming-out story?\u201d We came up with the time jumps, that the episode would take place over 20 years, and then we came up with the Thanksgiving idea, which shows the development of Denise and Dev\u2019s relationship, but more important, Denise and her mom\u2019s relationship.Once we had that framework, we said, \u201cLena\u2019s a writer. It\u2019s her story. Let\u2019s have her co-write it.\u201d The result is such an interesting reflection of her life. Not every detail is the same, but the look of the house, Angela Bassett\u2019s wardrobe \u2014 a lot of that is stuff you can\u2019t fake. It\u2019s personal.At the end of Episode 5, there\u2019s a nearly wordless, static long shot of Dev riding home, alone and frustrated as the Soft Cell song \u201cSay Hello, Wave Goodbye\u201d plays. How did that come about?That\u2019s one of my favorite moments of the season. As the creators of the show, Aziz and I have a responsibility not just to entertain, but to challenge viewers. Moments like that \u2014 where you\u2019re sitting on a character for minutes \u2014 jolt the audience out of what they\u2019re used to seeing.A lot of it came out of improvisation on the day. It was Aziz\u2019s idea: \u201cJust keep the camera on me for this take. I don\u2019t know how much of it we\u2019re going to use.\u201d He and I both like Soft Cell, too, and we\u2019ve been on an \u201980s music kick for a while. There\u2019s something so haunting and beautiful about that song. At first, Bobby Cannavale\u2019s character, Chef Jeff, seems like a lovably gruff Anthony Bourdain type. But then he turns out to have a history of sexual harassment. I cannot! It\u2019s purposefully ambiguous. There\u2019s all sorts of ingredients that make the ending mysterious, and that was all on purpose: We talked about how many seconds the shot was, how long Aziz would open his eyes for. We wanted people to debate and decide, on their own, how much is real, how much is fake, how happy they are \u2014 all of that stuff. I love all the theorizing.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the character portrayed by Aziz Ansari in \u201cMaster of None.\u201d The character is Dev Shah, not Patel.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "TV Station Owners Rush to Seize on Relaxed F.C.C. Rules", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byThe media industry has been rife with consolidation in recent years: Cable companies, film studios and telecommunications firms have all been bought and sold at a rapid clip.Now, local television stations are at the center of the deal-making frenzy.Last week, a day after the Federal Communications Commission eased regulations over how many stations an owner may have, Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest local broadcast group in the country, said it would buy 14 New York-based stations for $240 million.The timing of Sinclair\u2019s deal may not have hinged directly on the change, but it demonstrated a demand for broadcast station mergers. Sinclair did not reply to requests for comment.And now, a bidding war has begun over Tribune Media, the owner of WGN America and, in New York, PIX 11.The Blackstone Group appears to be working with 21st Century Fox on a bid for Tribune. And Sinclair is also circling that company.\u201cThe F.C.C. has basically said: \u2018Game on. We\u2019re going to let you consolidate further than anyone had imagined,\u2019\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.Consolidation of local broadcast stations could lead to more expensive fees for consumers as providers pass on ever-higher fees from broadcasters and content creators to subscribers. But to media companies, the mantra of late has been that bigger is better.For broadcast station companies in particular \u2014 including Sinclair, Fox and the Nexstar Media Group \u2014 owning more stations increases their power over cable companies, which pay to retransmit the stations.Fox\u2019s motive for pursuing Tribune, which has more Fox affiliates than any other station owner, largely appears to be blocking a deal with Sinclair. It plans to form a joint venture with the Blackstone Group, an investment giant, in which Blackstone would provide the cash for a deal while Fox would provide its own television stations, according to people briefed on the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.If successful, Fox would then reduce its direct exposure to local television stations, Mr. Greenfield said, while still holding on to a piece \u2014 and while stymieing a rival.Details of the potential joint venture were unclear, as were the precise reasons that Fox was turning to Blackstone. Tribune is a relatively small company, with a market value of about $3.4 billion.But for companies like Fox and Sinclair, consolidation is also a defensive move, shoring them up at a time when online rivals like Netflix and Hulu are commanding more viewers. Content providers like CBS and the Walt Disney Company are also pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.Getting bigger through station acquisitions, then, is meant to help these companies drive harder bargains. And smaller operators have emerged as potential takeover targets: The stock prices of two other broadcast companies, E. W. Scripps and Gray Television, are both up sharply this year.Underpinning broadcasters\u2019 dreams of expansion is the hope that Ajit Pai, the F.C.C.\u2019s new chairman and a Republican, will let through the kinds of deal making that had been held up during the Obama administration.\u201cCompanies are talking about deals now because they have reason to believe the F.C.C. will relax all the ownership rules,\u201d said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen and Company.The first tangible step came with a 2-to-1 vote by the F.C.C. last week to reintroduce the so-called UHF discount.Longstanding rules prohibit companies from covering more than 39 percent of American households, but the UHF discount allows station owners to exclude certain stations that operate in ultrahigh frequencies. With the reinstated discount, according to calculations by Fitch Ratings, Sinclair\u2019s household coverage percentage has fallen to about 25 percent, from 38 percent, while Nexstar\u2019s has dropped to 27 percent, from 39 percent, opening the door to new mergers and acquisitions.\u201cThis represents a rational first step in media ownership reform policy allowing free and local broadcasters to remain competitive with multinational pay TV giants and broadband providers,\u201d Gordon Smith, the president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said in a statement.The F.C.C.\u2019s rule change followed pressure from industry groups. One week before the vote, Mitch Rose, NBC Universal\u2019s senior vice president for government relations, visited the office of the other Republican commissioner on the F.C.C., Michael O\u2019Reilly, urging him to reinstate the UHF discount.And in February, Tribune Media\u2019s general counsel, Edward Lazarus, met with Mr. Pai\u2019s chief of staff, Matthew Berry, and lobbied for the change in rules.Mr. Pai has long been critical of strict broadcast ownership rules. He has said that online media companies such as Google, Facebook and Netflix are competing for audiences that were once served only by television. He has also been skeptical of rules against broadcast ownership limits, given that the agency has approved mergers in competing industries, including Charter\u2019s purchase of Time Warner Cable and AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirecTV.At the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas last week, Mr. Pai announced his intention to re-examine other media ownership rules. Broadcasters hope that one limit that may be removed is a prohibition on owning more than two stations in a local market.Consumer groups and Democrats in Congress and at the F.C.C. warn that the changes will lead to great industry consolidation, giving a few companies great influence over news and public opinion.The action \u201cwill actually harm the public interest, by reducing diversity, competition and localism,\u201d Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat at the F.C.C., said after the UHF discount vote.\u201cThese were mergers that could never have been contemplated a year ago,\u201d Mr. Greenfield, of BTIG, said of the deals that might blossom under the new F.C.C. \u201cYou\u2019re enabling the impossible in many ways, so people are saying, \u2018Let\u2019s take a shot at this.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York City Landlords Are Offering Deals", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported by360 ViewNew York City\u2019s rental season kicks into high gear this month, as college graduates start looking for apartments, along with anyone else hoping to move when the weather is warm and school is out. Most years, apartment hunters see rents rise with the temperature. But this season, as the rental market enters its third slow year, renters may instead see some deals.In an effort to lure new tenants, landlords are coming up with increasingly creative offers. Want a free year\u2019s subscription to Netflix with that lease? You might be able to get it. How about a flat-screen TV? That could be on the table, too. Even the security deposit could be up for negotiation, as landlords have been reducing that fee, too.As thousands of new apartments flood the housing market, landlords face steep competition. Last year, 8,774 market-rate units opened in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with an additional 15,291 opening this year, according to Citi Habitats, a brokerage firm. Even though those apartments are among the most expensive in the city, so much new inventory is having an impact on prices at older buildings, even in neighborhoods without much new construction. So landlords are looking for more novel ways to stand out, without actually lowering the rent.Although discounts are concentrated in neighborhoods with new construction, like Downtown Brooklyn and the financial district, landlords across Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn are sweetening the pot. Such offers are not as prevalent in the Bronx or Staten Island, however, because those boroughs have yet to see the same rapid development and price escalations. New projects are scheduled to open in both boroughs in the coming years, potentially changing those markets.\u201cIt\u2019s a good season for renters,\u201d said Grant Long, the senior economist for StreetEasy, adding, \u201cThe concessions are here to stay.\u201dBecause of all these concessions, asking rents have largely held, even though the amount paid works out to be lower when the concessions are calculated. In April, the median rent in Manhattan was $3,417 a month, 0.1 percent higher than the same time a year ago; in Brooklyn, it was $2,800 a month, 0.7 percent higher than the previous year; and in Queens, where concessions were highest, the median rent rose 12.2 percent during that period, to $3,088 a month, according to the Douglas Elliman report.TF Cornerstone, which owns and operates over 7,000 rental units in the city, is one such landlord, offering discounts to avoid cutting the rent. For many of its listings, the company pays the broker\u2019s fee and reduces the security deposit to $1,000.Some offers seem more like gimmicks than genuine discounts. Does a one-year Netflix subscription, worth around $100, really make a difference in a tenant\u2019s life? Rents are punishingly high in New York, and the cost of moving is staggering. How much would a few free Uber rides really affect your bottom line if you pay $4,000-a-month rent? Renters who really just want to pay less rent might not be convinced.Shop around, and there\u2019s a good chance you can find a deal, or haggle until you get one.Some brokers, however, are confident the deals will shrink, and in some cases evaporate, come summer.But the market still has a long way to go before all the new apartments get rented. Thousands of units haven\u2019t even opened yet, and most cost more than what many New Yorkers can afford. As those apartments hit the market, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a roller coaster,\u201d said Mr. Maundrell.So what does renting in a roller coaster market feel like? For Beatriz Ramos, 33, who works in business development and recently moved to New York from San Francisco, it meant looking at 100 apartments in search of a $2,800 one-bedroom. About a third of the listings offered discounts. Some brokers called or emailed her a few days later, hoping to lure her back to apartments no one seemed to want.Without the discounts, Ms. Ramos said she would not have been able to afford the apartment, which has a 600-square-foot private terrace. \u201cI have trees and a hammock,\u201d she said. \u201cWho in New York has a hammock? I\u2019m pretty happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It gets double points for managing to pull off that project with style and charm, not self-seriousness.Mel has smartly identified that while there are seemingly boundless publications dedicated to chronicling the lives of teenage girls \u2014 see Seventeen, Teen Vogue, Rookie, et. al \u2014 few seem invested in adolescent men beyond their stereotypes, so it\u2019s publishing a yearlong deep dive into the lives of teenage boys.I am obsessed with this recently transplanted Japanese reality show. I\u2019ve decided it counts as reading because it has subtitles.Like any real American, I\u2019m well versed in the tropes of our nation\u2019s reality television traditions, and it\u2019s their absence that makes \u201cTerrace House\u201d so deliciously destabilizing to view. In this show, six young people are chosen to live in a house, and \u2026 that\u2019s it. There is truly no script \u2014 the scenes are too mundane to be invented. When conflicts unfold, the unfailingly earnest housemates try to solve them constructively.But then, at regular intervals, the show cuts to a panel of cynical Japanese comedians who viciously roast the participants and bicker over their romantic prospects. The guilty-pleasure narratives that are baked into the structure of so much of American reality TV are instead applied on top by the comedian panel, and the results are equal parts mesmerizing and confounding. I have no idea why it\u2019s called \u201cTerrace House.\u201d__________Edited by Andrea KannapellAdvertisement"}

(An eighth interstitial novel was released in 2012.) The first four books were published every four to six years. But after Mr. King was hit by a minivan in 1999 and almost died, he decided to finish the saga lest another accident finish the job. The final three books were published in 2003 and 2004.O.K., but what is it actually about?It is an epic tale about Roland Deschain, a \u201cgunslinger\u201d (think a medieval knight, but with the outward trappings of an American cowboy) who lives in a place called Mid-World, which runs parallel to our own. In that world is a giant black tower that serves as the center of all universes, including our own. But Mid-World has begun to fall apart and, in an effort to save it, Roland must pursue both a bad guy who dresses all in black and the Tower itself.In the film, Mr. Elba plays Roland and Mr. McConaughey plays Walter O\u2019Dim, a.k.a. the Man in Black. They are able to cross back and forth between their world and modern-day Earth, where they encounter Jake Chambers (the newcomer Tom Taylor), a boy who has been having visions of Mid-World.So it\u2019s a western? a fantasy?Both! It\u2019s also a sci-fi story and a horror story. There are evil wizards and crystal balls, people who come back to life and vampires and creatures with animal heads who wear human faces. It\u2019s a lot. Mr. King incorporated as many genre elements as possible, and it makes for a fun, though not easy to categorize, experience.This is still a little confusing. Should I read any of the books beforehand?Feel free. You should be aware, though, that the film is not a straight adaptation. Rather, it seems to be some combination of the first novel (\u201cThe Gunslinger\u201d) and the third (\u201cThe Waste Lands\u201d), while also incorporating significant story points from the last book. Reading all seven novels would also mean plowing through nearly 4,000 pages. So there\u2019s that.There are so many Stephen King movies.

And I was resisting delving into those depths.\u201d The answer came when Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner, the presidents of Plan B, Mr. Pitt\u2019s production company, sent him \u201cThe Operators.\u201d\u201cIt showed me the way in, which is satire,\u201d Mr. Mich\u00f4d said. \u201cThe book has a kind of gonzo levity and a group of characters who either by virtue of hubris or the simple insanity of war seem to be larger than life.\u201dWhile he wanted to respect the reality of the war, Mr. Mich\u00f4d also wanted the freedom to be loose with his vision, so early on he made the decision to fictionalize the characters. (One of the few real-life figures to retain a real name is the former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, played here by Ben Kingsley, who portrays him as almost touchingly distracted.)Mr. Mich\u00f4d\u2019s film is unusual in many ways. It goes on for almost 90 minutes before a single shot is fired. For much of its running time, it maintains an almost jaunty tone, steeped in mordant wit; it sometimes plays like the Coen brothers\u2019 \u201cBurn After Reading\u201d crossed with \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d \u201cWar Machine\u201d portrays the general\u2019s perspective throughout, as he grouses about modern irritants like \u201cPizza Kings and Burger Huts\u201d and relies on his I.T. aide to help him use his electric razor. Mr. Pitt comes very close to the margin of caricature, all gruff intonations and chest-pumping, but often General McMahon is not entirely unsympathetic. He has a Candide-like na\u00efvet\u00e9, which is not altogether charming in an individual who\u2019s in charge of a sprawling military force.Mr. Mich\u00f4d deliberately keeps \u201cWar Machine\u201d inside General McMahon\u2019s bubble for much of the movie. The Marines that General McMahon commands are flummoxed by their leader\u2019s do-gooder optimism. One corporal, played by Lakeith Stanfield (who makes the most out of his brief screen time with a passionate, grounded performance), bluntly complains about the expectation that he help people who are trying to kill him. In a battle sequence depicting General McMahon\u2019s plan to retake the Helmand Province, Mr. Stanfield\u2019s character breaks out of a pinned-down situation and comes upon a scene that encapsulates the absurd tragedy of the Marines\u2019 endeavor.\u201cI read somewhere in the vicinity of 50 books, and I\u2019ve lost all sense of what comes from where, to be completely honest,\u201d Mr. Mich\u00f4d said of his research for the film. \u201cThe one defining feature of all I\u2019ve read was just how frequently my reaction was, none of this makes sense. And the question then became, how can I see this while those charged with the expenditure of all this money, and all these lives, do not?\u201dMr. Pitt is both the movie\u2019s star and one of its producers, and Mr. Mich\u00f4d said, \u201cBrad engaged the script quickly and enthusiastically,\u201d adding, \u201cDuring the shoot, there were conversations every day on where to pitch the performance. I wanted the movie to not just be about madness but to be kind of insane in and of itself.\u201dNetflix \u2014 which also teamed up with Plan B on the coming sci-fi film \u201cOkja,\u201d directed by Bong Joon-ho and starring Tilda Swinton (who has a potent cameo in \u201cWar Machine\u201d) \u2014 was a partner throughout, reportedly providing the filmmakers with a $60 million budget, very unusual for a picture of this sort. \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d (2012) was reportedly made for $20 million less. \u201cWe had an enormous amount of freedom \u2014 and we needed it,\u201d Mr. Mich\u00f4d said. \u201cThis is a movie that\u2019s tonally complex; it\u2019s unusual and it\u2019s contentious.

{"Headline": "Sinclair Is Said to Be Near a Deal for Tribune Media", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byThe Sinclair Broadcast Group may not have much name recognition outside its home base near Baltimore, but the company is poised to cover most of the country\u2019s television households.Sinclair is near a deal to buy Tribune Media, people briefed on the matter said on Sunday, as it seeks to expand its empire of local television stations after rule changes by the Federal Communications Commission.Sinclair was expected to pay just under $44 a share, some of those briefed on the matter said, valuing Tribune at about $3.8 billion. Details were being ironed out as of Sunday afternoon, and the talks could still collapse.Sinclair stations cover local news, including fires, crime and traffic, but the company has also used them to advance a mostly conservative political agenda.Buying Tribune Media, once the Tribune empire\u2019s television arm, would give Sinclair control of properties like WGN in Chicago and WPIX in New York. The merged company would own 215 stations around the country, although it might have to sell some to meet federal regulations.The commission reintroduced what is known as the UHF discount, under which broadcasters can exclude from ownership caps stations that use ultrahigh frequencies.The change effectively lowered Sinclair\u2019s coverage of American households to about 25 percent, from a current limit of 39 percent, freeing it to pursue acquisitions.Growth would help the 46-year-old Sinclair gain more negotiating leverage in the television industry, which has consolidated rapidly in recent years. Adding stations would give the company more power over cable providers, which pay to retransmit stations\u2019 broadcasts. It could also give Sinclair a presence in most of the country\u2019s major markets.A deal for Tribune would also help Sinclair gird itself against growing online rivals like Netflix and Hulu, as well as content providers like CBS and the Walt Disney Company, which are themselves pushing for bigger fees from cable companies.Sinclair had already taken steps toward being a national player in the industry by buying properties like the Tennis Channel and Comet, a science fiction network.For its part, Tribune would gain from joining a larger corporate parent, with local television advertising sales, excluding political ads and the Olympics, flat last year and likely to drop this year.Acquiring Tribune would give Sinclair a particular advantage over Fox: It would control the most Fox affiliates of any station owner in the country.News of Fox\u2019s deliberations, and the anticipation of a bidding war, lifted Tribune\u2019s stock price by nearly 7 percent. (Tribune\u2019s shares closed at $40.29 on Friday.)Ultimately, Fox chose not to make a bid, people with knowledge of the matter said.Beyond giving Sinclair greater negotiating power, a deal for Tribune would increase the reach of the company\u2019s news operation, which has promoted a mostly conservative agenda since the presidency of George W. Bush.The Smiths have become active in politics. Some of their political donations have gone to Democrats, but the vast majority have gone to Republican causes, like a so-called super PAC that backed Mr. Trump and the National Republican Congressional Committee.Critics of Sinclair have taken aim at what they say are the similar leanings of the company\u2019s Washington bureau, which has provided commentary and syndicated reports that have generally praised Republicans and criticized Democrats. Last month, Sinclair hired Boris Epshteyn, a former spokesman for Mr. Trump, as its chief political analyst.With Tribune poised to be acquired, smaller TV station owners may find themselves courted. The stock prices of broadcasters like the E. W. Scripps Company and Gray Television are up sharply this year, largely on investor expectations that they may get new corporate owners.An article on Monday about plans by the Sinclair Broadcasting Group to buy Tribune Media misstated the share of television station ownership that the company would achieve with the acquisition. It would own about 15 percent of local commercial stations, not more than a third of them.Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It was started again from the beginning and the festival issued a statement apologizing for the technical problem.)\u201cYou must be feel small and humble in front of the image,\u201d he added.Mr. Sarandos called that view \u201cbeautifully romantic.\u201d\u201cWhy would we want to hold back a movie for an enormous number of people to enjoy throughout the entire country that a few hundred, maybe a few thousand people could see the film in Paris?\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cIt seemed to me like the right thing to do was to give the people, our subscribers, who pay to make these movies, access to them immediately all over the world,\u201d he added.Asked if the festival organizers were aware that Netflix wasn\u2019t seeking a wide theatrical release in France, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cThey were fully aware of our release strategy.\u201dNot everyone here was critical of Netflix. A Cannes juror, Will Smith, defended it at the news conference with Mr. Almod\u00f3var. \u201cIn my home it\u2019s done nothing but broaden my children\u2019s cinematic global comprehension,\u201d he said. Mr. Smith stars in \u201cBright,\u201d a thriller that will debut on Netflix this year.Another actor said that he was drawn to a Netflix project because of the company\u2019s large viewership. At a news conference for \u201cOkja\u201d here on Friday, Jake Gyllenhaal, a co-star, said he had wanted the movie \u2014 with its strong environmentalist message, and critique of capitalism and genetically modified food \u2014 to connect with a wide audience.\u201cThe platform of a film, how far it can reach, how many people it can get to reach a message, is extraordinarily important,\u201d Mr. Gyllenhaal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a true blessing when any art can reach one person if not hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.\u201dThe other Netflix-produced film at the festival is \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d directed by Noah Baumbach.Netflix has local content in 23 languages and is currently filming in 19 countries. This year it will distribute 50 feature films, not including documentaries. Mr. Sarandos wouldn\u2019t reveal how many subscribers Netflix has in France or elsewhere, saying only that half of its 100 million subscribers are in the United States and the rest are in 189 other countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive marketplace,\u201d he said, declining to break down the numbers any further.He said that about 30 percent of the content Netflix subscribers watch in any country on an average day was local, although that can vary, and that Netflix had invested 1.75 billion euros (about $1.9 billion) in European content since 2012.It was at a previous Cannes Film Festival that Mr. Sarandos made a connection with Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the festival\u2019s director. They went to a screening of a newly restored \u201cThe Lady From Shanghai\u201d by Orson Welles. \u201cThat\u2019s when we bonded and he saw I really do love movies,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said.Advertisement"}

Movies that operate on yearslong production schedules also wouldn\u2019t feel much immediate pain.But television programs that rely on a regular diet of fresh writing could be forced to air reruns.

I found it painful, a little too close for comfort and possibly the gentle push some kids might feel in crossing that line of no return.I write from firsthand experience, when I was in college. If it weren\u2019t for the teacher who happened to stop by her office on her day off and read the note I had left for her, I would not be writing this today. I struggled with depression and contemplated suicide too often during my teens and early 20s. My 24-year-old niece committed suicide a few years ago.MARGE KELLER, CHICAGOTo the Editor:My 13-year-old daughter made a serious suicide attempt after reading \u201cThirteen Reasons Why\u201d last year. While I don\u2019t think there was a strict cause and effect, I do believe that the book tipped the scale as she was going through a difficult time at school.She has since watched the series. Her perspective is that the book and the series are different. In her words: \u201cHannah was a more empathetic character in the book. She is not as likable in the series.\u201d It does appear that the producers molded the book content to modify the message. But the point remains in both the book and the series that no one recognized the signs and made an effort to help Hannah.Teenage suicide is real and needs to be discussed. The fact that this series created engagement around the topic is positive. I hope that parents, schools and students use it to start a conversation.K.S., PORTLAND, ORE.The writer\u2019s full name is being withheld to protect her daughter\u2019s privacy.To the Editor:The problem with the show is that it makes it seem as if there are no effective alternatives to suicide. It sends the message that adults are useless, peers are cruel and the only solution is to die. As a school counselor in a middle school, I find this message alarming.We don\u2019t want our young people to suffer in silence because they might see no other way. We don\u2019t want them to turn to risky behaviors when they are struggling. We want them to seek support. But they won\u2019t if they feel it\u2019s useless.Things go viral so quickly today, and in what seems like an instant, the whole teenage world is immersed in a series like \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d Its influence needs to be counteracted by parents, educators and mental health professionals.ROCHELLE GARNETT, RYE, N.Y.To the Editor:Many viewers of \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d are deeply disturbed by how utterly clueless and profoundly incompetent the \u201cresponsible adults\u201d are in this series. Well, that\u2019s the reality far too many of our children must deal with.Newspaper articles about a bullied child who killed himself or herself typically include a list of failures by the authorities to intervene in time. What\u2019s wrong with showing this? What\u2019s wrong with giving kids the relief of knowing they\u2019re not alone in having been betrayed? What\u2019s wrong with talking about this series everywhere?There is mental illness on both sides in my family, and before I decided to try to conceive, I made a vow that suicide could never again be an option for dealing with pain, even if that pain seemed as unbearable as before.And when my child entered adolescence, I discussed frankly with him the emotional storms that can complicate growing up; how distress clouds our judgment; and that if he might not want to talk about something with me, he should find someone else he trusted. I made clear that suffering in silence was not an option.Advertisement"}

And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has an interest (directly or indirectly) in a large number of tech companies \u2014 including several firms to which he refers, and those that both partner with and compete against them.Advertisement"}

Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Films of Hong Sang-soo Capture Pleasures and Pratfalls of Attraction", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byFilmmaker ProfileThis prodigious rate of creativity is normal for Mr. Hong, a chronicler of the human condition and the pleasures and pitfalls of attraction. Since his 1996 debut feature, \u201cThe Day a Pig Fell Into the Well,\u201d the director, now 56, has averaged a film a year (and more recently, two), and most of them have won prizes at major festivals, including Cannes.His two decades of disarmingly funny and honest storytelling most recently earned him a complete retrospective last year at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York.\u201cNobody probes deeper into the ways that men and women misread each other\u2019s feelings than Hong Sang-soo,\u201d the critic and programmer Tony Rayns, an authority on Mr. Hong and Asian cinema, has written. \u201cThe Korean Woody Allen\u201d is the way Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the director of the Cannes festival, referred to him.Mr. Hong\u2019s stories return to certain touchstones. A writer, a filmmaker, a student or some combination of these become romantically entangled. Drunken confessions and professional pratfalls invariably take place. Narratives are often retold from different perspectives, or ambiguously, as if they might be fantasies.\u201cI usually don\u2019t worry about doing something new,\u201d Mr. Hong wrote of his films, in an email from Seoul. \u201cI\u2019m anyway always different from yesterday, so I always react and collect and combine differently, however slightly.\u201d His understatement belies the nimbleness and nuance that characterize these studies in romantic behavior.In \u201cThe Day After,\u201d which premieres in the competition at Cannes, a woman named Areum (Kim Min-hee) learns that her predecessor at work was having an affair with the boss, leading to complications for all.Both features were produced in Mr. Hong\u2019s customary run-and-gun manner. He avoids preparing a script in advance, preferring to start with only a basic treatment and then writing scenes during the shoot.In South Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s biggest film industries and is home to its own avid blockbuster culture, the indefatigable director has succeeded in making his movies his own way on budgets averaging little more than $100,000. (For comparison of scale, Mr. Hong\u2019s Korean compatriot at Cannes is Bong Joon-ho, whose film \u201cOkja,\u201d featuring Tilda Swinton and a computer-generated image of a creature, is a Netflix release.)The production of \u201cClaire\u2019s Camera,\u201d which is a mere 69 minutes long, was especially resourceful. Mr. Hong shot for two weeks in Cannes during last year\u2019s festival, when Ms. Huppert was in town to promote Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cElle\u201d and Ms. Kim was there for Park Chan-wook\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaiden.\u201d (How did Mr. Hong get the project rolling with Ms. Huppert? \u201cI called her,\u201d he recounted, and said: \u201cI\u2019m interested in making a film in Cannes. Would you be interested?\u201d)The activity of the small production didn\u2019t wholly escape notice, but that didn\u2019t dampen Mr. Hong\u2019s enjoyment of collaborating with the French star again.\u201cShe is truly a great actress,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning I give her the script, and she reads it and I might give her one or two suggestions or none. And when she starts playing the role, she is totally into the role, in a way that I like very much.\u201d\u201cThe Day After,\u201d starring Kwon Hae-hyo and Kim Sae-byeok along with Ms. Kim, was shot in South Korea three months ago. In some ways, that production may have been more hectic for Mr. Hong than the fast-paced shooting schedule in Cannes. That is because in the past year, Mr. Hong has experienced the sort of complicated relationship drama that is characteristic of his films: Korean celebrity news reported assiduously on his separation from his wife and involvement with Ms. Kim.\u201cWhen I was shooting \u2018The Day After\u2019 on the streets in Seoul, I was harassed by paparazzi, but it was O.K.,\u201d Mr. Hong said, glossing over the question of whether the media attention affected his creative flow.He publicly acknowledged the romance at a Seoul news conference in March to promote \u201cOn the Beach at Night Alone.\u201d Critics at Berlin found it hard to miss echoes of Mr. Hong\u2019s personal life in the film: It begins with an actress (played by Ms. Kim) hiding out after ending an affair with a married filmmaker.Amid the frenzy of Cannes, however, the spotlight will fall directly onto the art and craft of Mr. Hong, a respected veteran of the festival. With \u201cClaire\u2019s Camera\u201d and \u201cThe Day After,\u201d he will have shown 10 films at Cannes (including the Directors\u2019 Fortnight section).It\u2019s a difficult record for any filmmaker to match, as is his achievement of premiering three films at top-flight festivals in one year. The only man to top his productivity could be Mr. Hong himself, who confirms that he has \u201cvague plans\u201d to make another film in the fall.It\u2019s only May, after all.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Viewers Drift Online, Advertisers Hold Fast to Broadcast TV", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byTV ratings are collapsing. Media stocks are falling. Cord cutting is accelerating.There has been no shortage of bad headlines for television networks over the last few months, as investors grow concerned over dropping viewership and as people increasingly find new ways to entertain themselves.Yet while audience attention has drifted toward platforms like Netflix, Facebook and YouTube, there is one group of stubborn holdouts who are not ready to give up on broadcast television: advertisers.This week, as ad buyers cram into New York institutions like Radio City Music Hall and Carnegie Hall to watch the broadcast networks talk up a new TV season, they will again prepare to spend as much as $9 billion to be a part of it. Though the market may be cooling this year, a significant drop is not expected.A reasonable person might ask how, in 2017, is that remotely possible?\u201cIt will continue to move forward this way as long as it works,\u201d said Lyle Schwartz, the president of investment for North America at GroupM, the ad buying arm of the advertising conglomerate WPP.But isn\u2019t buying a 30-second spot on television a little, well, out of date?As a media analyst at Pivotal Research, Brian Wieser, put it, advertising on TV is \u201cas archaic as water flowing through pipes.\u201d\u201cYou could set up a drone to take water from a reservoir and use fascinating technology and cutting-edge approaches to deliver it, but there\u2019s a good reason we use these systems,\u201d he said.In interviews, ad buyers and television executives pointed to a variety of reasons that advertisers remain attracted to ABC, NBC, Fox and CBS. Ratings aside, television still reaches more people and provides a reliable way for an ad to be seen on a full screen with sound. There is a limited amount of inventory, in contrast to the endless reach of the web, and marketers know rates will spike if they wait to buy airtime.It also does not hurt that Facebook and YouTube have had trouble in recent months with ads showing up next to objectionable content.\u201cSales directors at the networks are going to say, \u2018We have premium content that is professionally produced, and it\u2019s been vetted and won\u2019t be an issue for your brand to be associated with it,\u2019\u201d said Brad Adgate, a veteran media analyst. \u201cWith Google and Facebook, you\u2019ve seen stuff where they\u2019ve had to say that they have to do a better job.\u201dStill, there are serious questions about how sustainable all of this is. Trend lines certainly suggest things could go in the other direction. Networks are having trouble showing how many people are watching their content across a wide variety of platforms, audiences are growing accustomed to platforms where they can watch shows without commercials, and marketers are eager to find better ways to target potential customers.And at present, broadcast television is holding an edge thanks to an older audience. The median age for scripted TV\u2019s No. 1 show, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and one of its top reality shows, \u201cThe Voice,\u201d is 55. Among 18- to 49-year-olds, ratings in broadcast television fell by 11 percent this season.\u201cIf you just look at where the business is going, we\u2019re in a transitional phase now where to a large degree, boomers are keeping television as we define it today afloat,\u201d said Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment.Advertisers are aware that this may not last forever.GroupM predicted that digital platforms would be taking a growing share of new advertising dollars. Still, even though digital players are surging, television remains the established elder statesman for advertisers. GroupM noted that television accounted for 42 percent of advertising investments last year, compared with 31 percent for digital.The sophistication of Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s ability to target ads is no small matter, though, and TV networks have been scrambling to find ways to compete in that arena.Digital companies are capable of targeting audiences so narrow that they can pinpoint, say, Idaho residents in long-distance relationships who are contemplating buying a minivan. (Facebook\u2019s ads manager says that description matches 3,100 people.)As attractive as that slicing and dicing can be, television appears to have an advantage in terms of the actual commercial time it can offer marketers.\u201cIt\u2019s great if I can target someone I know is a truck driver who searched for the word \u2018truck\u2019 who visited my site a lot, but where do I get them to watch my ad?\u201d asked Joe Marchese, the newly named head of ad sales for Fox Networks Group. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make him or her watch it?\u201dAnd television still offers an enormous audience.\u201cThe number of minutes we show commercials is way more than YouTube or Facebook on a video basis \u2014 many multiples more,\u201d Mr. Marchese said.Rishad Tobaccowala, chief strategist for the Publicis Groupe, one of the world\u2019s largest advertising companies, said the millions who saw commercials on a hit show like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d could also be more valuable.\u201cIf you basically put that same advertising, say a million dollars, within Facebook and Google, the reality of it is that people are going to see those things in a very splintered fashion,\u201d he said.The so-called upfront season offers advertisers a chance to buy the bulk of their ads before marquee shows return in September. This creates a level of competition that advertisers cannot help but participate in.It also fosters a power dynamic that probably sounds foreign to a generation of consumers who tend to see automatically placed ads on YouTube content that could have been made a day earlier by anyone.\u201cWhat the networks do say is: \u2018Great, I\u2019m going to invite all my potential clients and clients to a room at the same time on the same day where I\u2019m going to show my shows that I may or may not actually put up this fall and may not keep for two episodes,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads. \u201c\u2018And I\u2019m going to make you sit next to your competitors and basically say here\u2019s the price of it, and if you don\u2019t pay this price now, it\u2019s going to cost you 30 percent more in six months.\u2019\u201dMass marketers aiming to drive people to, say, their stores or car dealerships rely on long-held TV plans to align with their product launches, and pulling out could be both expensive and risky.\u201cThe reason it\u2019s priced high and reason you have to buy in advance is because your competitors might buy it out,\u201d Mr. Morgan continued. It\u2019s like the Cold War but for brands, he said, adding, \u201cIf they have a bunch of missiles, you need a bunch more missiles.\u201dAnd so, for a week in mid-May, the networks still have the upper hand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Angry Over Zillow\u2019s Home Prices? You Can Win a Prize by Improving Them", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byMarket ValueSEATTLE \u2014 It\u2019s one of the oldest tricks in an internet company\u2019s playbook. Concoct a tool that gives the public new statistics on something \u2014 the quality of a restaurant or a toaster, say. Then watch visitors flock to the data and worry about accuracy later.Few such tools have been as controversial as ones that show people the market value of homes, using software algorithms to do the estimates. Homes are typically people\u2019s most valuable asset, so emotions run hot when these estimates are seen as too high or too low.The best-known of these tools \u2014 the Zestimate, from the online real estate website Zillow \u2014 began on the internet 11 years ago and has since amassed a huge audience of homeowners, shoppers and nosy neighbors. Sellers say unfair Zestimates can kill offers on their homes. About 171 million people visit Zillow each month, according to the company.The good news is that the overall accuracy of these home estimates appears to have improved significantly over time. But they continue to have meaningful error rates compared with actual home sale prices. That means that they shouldn\u2019t be used as more than a conversation point between homeowners, shoppers and their real estate agents when they\u2019re coming up with listing prices and offers for homes.At first, the Zestimates were pretty dubious. When Zillow started out in 2006 with 43 million homes listed, it calculated the median error rate across the site at about 14 percent, said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow. That means half were within 14 percent of final sale prices for homes, while those for the other half of homes were off by more than 14 percent \u2014 a big discrepancy for the real estate business.Through refinement of its algorithms and better data about homes, Zillow, now with 110 million homes accessible on the site, has a median error rate of around 5 percent, Mr. Humphries said.Even that still adds up. In a place like San Francisco, with a median home price of $1.1 million, being off on a home estimate by more than 5 percent means missing the final price by more than $55,000.While Zestimates can be amusing for some curious homeowners, they are infuriating for others. Barbara Andersen bought a home in Glenview, Ill., in 2009 with a view of a golf course, paying about $630,000. She wants to sell the home for about that amount, but the Zestimate on it is now about $536,000, which she believes is too low and has deterred buyers.\u201cIf it\u2019s not reliable, you shouldn\u2019t put it out there,\u201d she said in a phone interview, referring to Zestimates.Zillow said that the lawsuits are without merit and that Illinois law doesn\u2019t count computer-generated estimating tools as appraisals.Unlike Zillow, Redfin is a real estate brokerage, employing agents to buy and sell homes for clients, which means that its chief executive, Glenn Kelman, regularly hears from Redfin agents who either love its estimating tool or despise it. The latter would rather have a conversation about home values without the Redfin estimator having colored clients\u2019 expectations.\u201cI\u2019ve almost never talked to our field organization without having to address the estimate,\u201d Mr. Kelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very personal and emotional thing.\u201dThere\u2019s little chance that home value estimation tools will ever eliminate their error rates entirely.Susan Athey, an economist who is a professor at Stanford University, said she\u2019s impressed with Zillow\u2019s 5 percent median error rate for something as variable as homes. She said information like Zestimates are valuable for making a market like real estate function more smoothly.\u201cIf individuals do not understand the market value of their property, they may pass over offers, making both buyers and sellers worse off,\u201d Ms. Athey said.Even as they improve, it makes more sense to look at internet home estimates the way we look at Yelp reviews of a restaurant \u2014 helpful, but hardly the final word.Advertisement"}

More recently she has come to terms with her ever-evolving fashion sense: \u201cIt\u2019s all about finding your groove at every age.\u201dStill there are limits. \u201cI refuse to go into the future nomadic,\u201d she all but rasped. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wear some tentlike schmatta that doesn\u2019t say anything.\u201dHer pronouncement drew a smile from Babe, who had accompanied her to the previous evening\u2019s screening \u2014 never mind that the film includes a bounty of racy scenes. They provide grist for the film, which Ms. Winger characterized as \u201cnot a rom-com but a mystery, one that asks how do we keep love alive.\u201dLove and sex, like style, are part of an evolving process, she maintained. \u201cIt\u2019s all about chi, your life energy,\u201d she said with Yoda-like serenity. \u201cLike everything else, it goes through iterations.

What is your familiarity with the Canadian children\u2019s classic?Anne Shirley is the heroine of Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s beloved 1908 novel, \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d the chronicle of a spirited but previously unloved orphan taken into the town of Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, Canada, by the unmarried, middle-aged siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over a period of years and a nearly endless series of scrapes \u2014 falling off roofs, dyeing her hair green, accidentally intoxicating her best friend \u2014 Anne transforms the hearts of everyone around her while making a home for herself. The book has sold over 50 million copies and has been translated into at least 36 languages. Polish resistance fighters took \u201cGreen Gables\u201d with them to the front; the novel became a part of the Japanese school curriculum in the orphan-filled postwar 1950s; a television show based on the series aired in Sri Lanka; and the book occupies a pre-eminent place in Canada, where \u201cGreen Gables\u201d is taught in school and featured on postage stamps \u2014 a cultural export matched only by hockey and the Mounties. While contemporaneous tales of motherless girls, like \u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,\u201d \u201cPollyanna\u201d and \u201cA Little Princess\u201d have faded from popular memory, Anne has thrived, continuing to connect with audiences as she did with Mark Twain, who once described her as \u201cthe dearest and most lovable child in fiction since the immortal Alice.\u201dAnne is also, to use the blunt jargon of the entertainment business, a strong female character with a pre-existing fan base who recently entered the public domain: an adaptation waiting to happen \u2014 again. The novel and its seven Montgomery-penned sequels have already spawned a silent movie, a talkie and more than half a dozen TV shows, including the particularly adored 1985 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series starring Megan Follows as Anne and a recently aired PBS version starring Martin Sheen as Matthew. There is also a Japanese anime; a Canadian cartoon; multiple musicals, including Canada\u2019s longest-running one; an authorized prequel novel; and the entire bustling branch of the Canadian tourism industry that is the Anne-obsessed summer season in P.E.I. Starting next month, Netflix, in collaboration with the CBC, will air \u201cAnne With an E,\u201d the latest reimagining of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d \u2014 this time as an ambitious TV drama.\u2014 Did the article make you want to watch the show, or read or reread the book?

This is my fourth time at Cannes, which ends May 28; Manohla Dargis, co-chief film critic for The Times, is also here, to review the films. I see as many as I can, but as The Times\u2019s European culture correspondent, I mostly handle the \u201cmondanit\u00e9s\u201d \u2014 the parties, the news stories, the dressing up, the sourcing up. For anyone covering film, Cannes is like the Olympics meets the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2014 a place where you can see amazing performances and chat with people you\u2019d never be able to buttonhole back home. For me, home is Paris, so that means talking to film world people from New York and Los Angeles.Covering the festival can be an exercise in sleep deprivation, of racing around in a daze between screenings, interviews and deadlines. Over the years, I\u2019ve gotten more skilled at navigating Cannes\u2019s vastness \u2014 where the theaters are, how long it\u2019ll take to run to the different beach clubs and hotel rooftops where studios hold press events. A hierarchy of press badges grant varying levels of access: I\u2019m lucky to have a pink one with a yellow dot, which is the second-highest ranking after the famous \u201ccarte blanche.\u201d Lower-ranking badge holders spend as much time waiting in line as they do seeing movies.Every year there are images from around the festival that linger in my memory, like so many unsnapped Instagrams. As I ate a solitary salade ni\u00e7oise last week, the people at the next table were talking about how to modify a film to get it past Turkish censors. At a party for the Todd Haynes film \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d I had a real conversation with Michelle Williams, who is a co-star in the film and has never given a bad performance, and with Sandy Powell, one of the best costume designers in the world. As Ms. Powell talked, my platform heels sank several inches into the sand. At a party hosted by Netflix in a ros\u00e9-colored villa high in the hills above Cannes, Ben Stiller made me laugh.It can sometimes feel like living inside a surreal and even absurd bubble, especially when the festival coincides with horrible events elsewhere, like the deadly terrorist attack at a concert in Manchester, England, on Monday. This year\u2019s security has been intense, and you have to get to screenings at least 30 minutes in advance to clear the metal detectors.A few days after the Vanity Fair party, I went to Monoprix, France\u2019s answer to Target, to buy supplies to clean the floor of my tiny rented apartment in Cannes. It overlooks a highway and collects exhaust dust, but has everything I need for a coveted assignment that remains a highlight of my year. I swept under the sneakers I wore to run to screenings and under my new red suede heels, the ones I wore to the Vanity Fair party at the H\u00f4tel du Cap-Eden-Roc, just nine miles and several lifetimes away.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cannes Rolls Out the Red Carpet (Now With Metal Detectors)", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookThat\u2019s extreme, of course, although even in normal years a happy festival can be elusive. Cannes attracts a notoriously tough crowd, including movie critics and industry professionals from around the world who never hesitate to catcall even the most established of filmmakers. That the festival has remained an important draw, even in the face of fears about terrorism, is partly a testament to its branding muscle and a genius for riding out cycles of industry crises.The idea that a movie might mean more than the latest box office numbers may sound, well, fantastically foreign, but that\u2019s part of the pleasure of seeing films at Cannes, where art and industry retain a nervous, often precarious balance. Critics may like to grab copies of Variety on their way to screenings, but unlike the conversations in the halls and over dinners at, say, Sundance, the talk here doesn\u2019t necessarily revolve around deals. One reason is that industry professionals and critics tend to see the movies in different theaters. This can be liberating, even if watching movies with hundreds of other critics can be at times predictably exasperating.At this early point, the critics have been largely well behaved or are perhaps too jet-lagged to put on their customary self-flattering show. The opening-night selection, \u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d from the French director Arnaud Desplechin, has divided them but not passionately. Mathieu Amalric stars as a movie director who\u2019s plunged into a profound crisis, at once personal and professional, when his long-missing wife (an excellent, delectably sinister Marion Cotillard) abruptly returns, as if from the dead. In this busy, borderline chaotic and playful drama, the ghosts haunting Ismael include his younger self and Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo,\u201d which makes \u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts\u201d as much about male hysteria as it is about loss and desire.The violence in the harrowing competition entry \u201cLoveless,\u201d from the Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, meanwhile left some gasping. It hinges on a married couple, Boris and Zhenya, who are in the midst of a violent divorce and preparing to settle into new lives with their next partners. He has a young, pregnant girlfriend; she has an older, well-off lover. There are several inconveniences standing in Boris and Zhenya\u2019s way, however, namely an apartment they\u2019re trying to sell and their 12-year-old son, whom neither wants. It\u2019s a vision of breathtaking, casual cruelty that inexorably shifts from the personal into an indictment of a soul-sick country.Among the noncompetition titles is \u201cSea Sorrow,\u201d the first feature directed by the British actress Vanessa Redgrave. A heartfelt, formally messy documentary about the international refugee crisis, the movie is largely a plea for compassion and action. Although its message is fairly simple, Ms. Redgrave at times seems to be searching for the best way to express it as she jumps from archival images to interviews and protests. In some of the strongest passages, she turns to Shakespeare, using a section from \u201cThe Tempest\u201d delivered by Ralph Fiennes to speak of exile, suffering, a \u201crotten carcass of a boat\u201d and a sea-sorrow that is appallingly relevant.Advertisement"}

Whether or not I asked, nearly everyone I interviewed insisted on retelling the stories of their escapes. And at some point, almost everyone choked up.The last time I saw the city\u2019s mayor, Melissa Blake, was in Edmonton while the flames and smoke were still menacing Fort McMurray. She had just been evacuated by air and taken straight to a news conference. After the meeting with reporters, which was at Alberta\u2019s emergency management headquarters in a distant industrial park, Ms. Blake was stranded, so I gave her a lift across town to a relative\u2019s home.While the rebuilding that Ms. Blake predicted is gradually happening, she had another concern this week: Fort McMurray\u2019s emotional recovery. In the year since the fire, she told me that 29,000 people in the city had sought help with mental health issues. The figure for the preceding year was just 1,000.It would be wrong, however, to suggest that Fort McMurray is in the midst of a collective breakdown. Person after person told me that the past year has brought them closer to neighbors. And the city\u2019s rebuilding seems to have given new vigor to a longstanding campaign by many residents for laws requiring that oil sands workers move to Fort McMurray, rather than fly to their high-paying jobs there from other parts of Canada.When a journalist hits a wall of government secrecy, he starts wondering what is hiding on the other side. That\u2019s what happened back in February when I emailed British Columbia\u2019s ministry of finance, asking about an obscure provincial tax incentive program and its mysterious members, which have received over U.S. $100 million in tax refunds since 2008.Almost no information is publicly available about the province\u2019s International Business Activity program, which provides tax incentives to attract corporations to the province. Who are they? What has the province received in return? The ministry refused to say.So began a monthslong hunt for answers that involved scouring government records and exploring a private organization, which the program\u2019s participants are legally required to join, run by a former finance minister from the province. Among the group\u2019s members were a slew of Canadian property developers, Chinese state-owned corporations, an investment firm that solely manages the family fortune of a Wall Street billionaire and a trio of companies the U.S. government sanctioned last year for money laundering.Advertisement"}

Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, has been promoting the idea of bringing back the legislation, which would separate investment and consumer banks.It would be surprising if Mr. Trump followed through.The president has maintained that he wants to pare the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes stricter regulation on banks, but it would be a much bigger move to bring back Glass-Steagall.It could be that the two-tiered system of regulations that Mr. Trump and his team have discussed with community banks is a new interpretation of Glass-Steagall.But there is some question about the benefits of reviving the legislation, and it\u2019s not certain that it would encourage lending, an issue about which Mr. Trump has complained.\u201cIf Glass-Steagall had been in effect, we couldn\u2019t have had some of the failing firms taken over,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, a former Federal Reserve chairman, said of the financial crisis of 2008.A wave of consolidation has rolled across the media industry in recent years. And now that the Federal Communications Commission has eased regulations on ownership, local television is being lapped up, too.It also helps the broadcast companies build their defenses against online rivals, like Netflix and Hulu, and against content providers, like CBS and the Walt Disney Company, which are pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.Those factors may be what prompted a change of heart from James Murdoch, chief executive at 21st Century Fox.Just a few months ago, he denied having any interest in buying more television stations in the United States. Fox is now said to be teaming up with the private equity firm Blackstone to work on a deal for Tribune Media.But the grand acquisition plan comes as Fox\u2019s attempt to buy the European satellite group Sky awaits a ruling from British regulators (pending a \u201cfit and proper\u201d test) and risks a throwback to another era, when Rupert Murdoch, now the Fox chairman, was known for his capricious and overpriced deals, Ms. Saba writes.At the same time, Fox News is still dealing with the repercussions of a sexual harassment scandal.Questions about how far the company will go to clear up its corporate culture remain \u2014 Mr. Shine has been replaced by Suzanne Scott, a veteran executive who also has deep ties to Mr. Ailes.Could the home-sharing company be preparing a smoother ride to an initial public offering?The legal action could have hampered its expansion efforts.The company has now cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest United States markets: It dropped a suit about a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms.Airbnb still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets, but clearing up some of these regulatory issues should create a more stable environment for the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hackers Find Celebrities\u2019 Weak Links in Their Vendor Chains", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported byIn December, hackers impersonating an executive at Interscope Records, the record label owned by Universal Music Group, managed to bypass all the latest in digital defenses with a simple email.In a carefully tailored message, the hackers urged an executive at September Management, a music management business, and another at Cherrytree Music Company, a management and record company, to send them Lady Gaga\u2019s stem files \u2014 files used by music engineers and producers for remixing and remastering.With a click of a button, the files made their way into hackers\u2019 hands, according to three people who are familiar with the episode but are not allowed to discuss it publicly. Executives would not elaborate on the incident, and it is unclear what happened to the files.The heist \u2014 which has not been reported previously \u2014 was a classic example of how hackers exploit the weakest link in the extensive chain of vendors, postproduction studios and collaborators that corporations must trust with their most valuable intellectual property.In Hollywood, cybercriminals have found a lucrative niche: While they may not be able to break into a Universal Studios or a Netflix directly, they have learned that the highest-profile targets are supported by a system of soft targets \u2014 content collaborators, remixers, postproduction studios and others \u2014 that do not have the same resources, security technology or sense of paranoia. And the hackers have started capitalizing.TheDarkOverlord released Netflix episodes after Larson Studios, and then Netflix, didn\u2019t pay a ransom of 30 bitcoins, roughly $45,000. Now, that same hacker has threatened to leak content from Larson\u2019s other clients, including ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC, if the studios do not pay.In a message posted to Twitter, the hacker said: \u201cWho is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we\u2019re all going to have. We\u2019re not playing any games anymore.\u201d A couple of days later, TheDarkOverlord hinted that the next leaks were imminent: \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time to play another round.\u201dFor now, Hollywood studios say they have no intention of paying hackers\u2019 ransom, though they could pay dearly in lost revenue and viewers.\u201cWe see this over and over and over again,\u201d said Oren Falkowitz, chief executive of Area 1, a security company. \u201cThe problem is that security firms sell their software to the 1 percent of companies that can afford it, but the real damage continues to come from below.\u201dThe security weaknesses of vendors are increasingly the weaknesses of their clients, no matter how fortified their own networks.Mr. Falkowitz, other security executives and insurance underwriters say the status quo is untenable. Security companies have promised to protect their clients from cyberattacks, while ignoring the less secure vendors, consultants and distributors in clients\u2019 supply chains.Area 1 has started extending its services to its clients\u2019 principal vendors as part of its core offering, something that most security companies have been reluctant to do.\u201cIt\u2019s our job to protect your business,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sell software to every five-person mom-and-pop shop, so why not extend our services to those vendors for free?\u201dCompanies like BitSight Technologies and SecurityScorecard in have developed a rating system that allows corporations and government agencies to evaluate how hacker-friendly vendors and other third parties are.BitSight uses a scoring system of 250 to 900, similar to a credit score. SecurityScorecard gives grades from A to F.\u201cYou could have the most technically secure organization in the world, but the common denominator is people, and they are always susceptible,\u201d said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of Synack, a security company.Corporations hire Synack to perform sophisticated \u201cpenetration tests\u201d of their networks, and increasingly those of their suppliers. Synack then works with hackers they consider trustworthy, many of them freelancers, to find weaknesses in their clients\u2019 systems.Some of Synack\u2019s clients \u2014 and increasingly some insurance underwriters \u2014 have started asking the company to look into possible vendors. When Synack gets a vendor\u2019s permission, it performs a full-fledged penetration test to try to break into its network. When it does not have permission, Synack\u2019s hackers scan for open connections like wide-open ports and servers and easily crackable passwords to get a sense of a vendor\u2019s security.Most likely, hackers with bad intent are looking to do the same. For years, hackers tried to extort money from companies by taking their websites offline with floods of internet traffic \u2014 often during prime holiday shopping \u2014 and not letting up until their victims paid. More recently, cybercriminals have deployed ransomware, malware that encrypts data and locks out the user.Now hackers are resorting to old-fashioned extortion. Last year, TheDarkOverlord \u2014 the hacker believed to be behind the attacks against Netflix and Hollywood studios \u2014 menaced a midsize investment bank, a glue company, a cancer charity, health care providers and other charities across the country.In each case, the hacker made what it called a \u201chandsome business proposal\u201d: Pay a ransom, or see files deleted, sold or published online.In January, hackers breached Little Red Door Cancer Services of East Central Indiana, wiping its servers and backups and demanding that it pay 50 bitcoin, about $80,000, to have the data restored.These days, TheDarkOverlord has focused on the entertainment industry, where it found that it can easily get to Hollywood\u2019s crown jewels \u2014 its unreleased content. And there\u2019s more money in Hollywood than in charity.Advertisement"}

There was unmistakable pride in his smile when he found a punch line particularly amusing. He was completely present.Oh, and he was up next.\u201cI didn\u2019t know he smoked weed either!\u201d Tony said of his brother after taking the microphone. \u201cI\u2019m just shocked as you all are. I\u2019m telling!\u201dWhen entertainment is a family business, there is often a grueling process to establish your own identity, and in doing so, to escape the shadow of the most famous sibling. Sometimes the skin is shed \u2014 see Solange, a creative force and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s sister. Sometimes viewers can\u2019t get enough \u2014 see the three handsome Hemsworths. Sometimes the talent is all that matters \u2014 see Kate and Rooney Mara. And sometimes there\u2019s no overcoming the top dog. Without looking, name all the Baldwin brothers besides Alec.Professionally, Tony and Jordan have kept a distance from Chris. They described a generational gulf as well as one created by his fame. When Tony started his standup career, Chris was already a celebrity in New York City. When Jordan started, Chris was a megastar. It was important to the younger brothers to create lanes for themselves. The Rock name was both a gift and a burden, but neither felt compelled to lean on Chris or resent his success. Both brothers said Chris never tried to take a heavy hand in their careers \u2014 and, indeed, gave them space to succeed or struggle on their own. (Chris Rock did not respond to multiple interview requests for this article.)Chris, of course, is in the conversation for being one of the greatest comedians of his time and is in the midst of his first stand-up tour in nine years. His specials have influenced generations of comics. Many can still quote the memorable routine from his 1996 HBO special, \u201cBring the Pain,\u201d about what he called the two types of African-Americans. The joke cannot be published here.\u201cThat was just a common conversation we would have in the house,\u201d Tony said, speaking with a feverish excitement that brought Chris to mind, during one of several recent conversations. \u201cAnd it turned into this gigantic bit.\u201d\u201cKeep in mind, he\u2019s arguably the best comic in the country,\u201d Tony said, referring to Chris, about his reactions to these comparisons. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a minute before they go, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s entirely Tony Rock.\u2019\u201dBut it\u2019s different now.\u201cEvery time I go onstage, it\u2019s a little less \u2018Chris Rock\u2019s brother,\u2019\u201d Tony said.Jordan is still a relative unknown. Softer spoken than his brothers and with a sly smile, Jordan has one major onscreen credit, a recurring role on the Netflix show \u201cLove.\u201d Standing on a sidewalk outside, Jordan and Tony discussed whether this was the big break for Jordan\u2019s career after a day of shooting for the third season of \u201cLove.\u201d\u201cEverything is a big break,\u201d Tony said to Jordan. Referring to a club in New York City, he continued: \u201cWhen you first got into the Comic Strip, that was a big break.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s all equal,\u201d Jordan said.\u201cAt that level, getting into the Comic Strip is doing Vegas,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhen you get to a higher level, something else will take its place.\u201dJordan was fascinated by comedy as a teenager. Sherrod Small, a comedian in New York City and a cousin of the Rocks, said that Jordan would sit for hours in the basement of Chris\u2019s New Jersey home, looking through old tapes with them to help Chris prepare for another special.\u201cThere is no reason that a young kid would want to hang around this nonsense,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cOnce I saw that, I called Tony at midnight and said, \u2018Jordan is going to be a comedian, too.\u2019\u201dJordan grew up in Georgetown, S.C., after Rose Rock moved there with the younger siblings, and then headed to the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn by himself when he was 18, where his older brothers grew up, to pursue comedy. He didn\u2019t finish high school.Tony let Jordan open for him at spots around New York, including at the Gotham Comedy Club, one of the city\u2019s biggest venues. No matter how hard Jordan pushed, however, Tony initially resisted taking him on the road. Jordan was green. Tony offered pointers such as not holding the mic stand or leaning while performing.\u201cThe road is a different animal,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI wanted to see him put the work in and take his lumps.\u201dFinally, two years ago, the weekend before Christmas, Tony allowed Jordan to travel with him to Virginia Beach. \u201cI murdered Virginia Beach,\u201d Jordan said, \u201cand then Tony took me on the road after that.\u201dYears ago, Tony promised his mother that he would always look out for Jordan, the youngest in a sprawling family.\u201cTony has always just had a soft spot for Jordan,\u201d Ms. Rock said in an interview. \u201cMaybe because he\u2019s the baby. Tony always said to me, \u2018Mommy, don\u2019t worry about Jordan.\u2019\u201dBut with Chris, Tony had a different approach. \u201cWhen I was growing up with Chris, I was the little brother that was kind of annoying,\u201d Tony said. \u201c\u2018Can I come?\u2019 \u2018Get out of here.\u2019 \u2018Can I play?\u2019 \u2018Get out of here.\u2019 So that\u2019s our relationship. I just do my own thing. I leave him alone.\u201dJordan said his relationship with Chris was \u201cpartially the same.\u201d\u201cIt gets better as I get older,\u201d Jordan said. Turning toward Tony, Jordan said, \u201cProblems that I had in the beginning, I would just come to you with because I felt like his problems are up here,\u201d as he pointed upward.There are also stark personality differences. Tony and Jordan are expressive and gregarious, both with each other and strangers off the stage. Chris, according to their brother Kenny Rock, is the opposite.\u201cChris has a different, high-caliber circle of people around him, and he\u2019s very socially awkward,\u201d Kenny said. He just turned 34 and is the sixth of the eight siblings. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around him outside of work, you\u2019re not going to get many words out of him at all. He\u2019s very introverted.\u201dJordan said that he consults Chris on business matters more now, including a recent contract issue that he declined to discuss in detail. Chris\u2019s advice, he said, was \u201cget to work.\u201dTony said he never had a conversation with Chris about pursuing stand-up. There are no Rock brother writing sessions. They aren\u2019t giving one another notes. Any mentorship that is passed down seeps through like osmosis. The three have never performed together, although Tony and Jordan have both individually appeared with Chris.\u201cIt\u2019s not like a sit-down, \u2018Let me talk to you,\u2019 type thing,\u201d Tony said. \u201cYou see what it is. You see what I\u2019m doing. You see me working. You see me trying jokes. You see me writing every day. I lead by example.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never sought the advice,\u201d Jordan said.One place that Tony and Chris crossed paths: \u201cEverybody Hates Chris,\u201d a sitcom that Chris cocreated. It ran for four seasons starting in 2005 on UPN and was loosely based on his own upbringing. Tony had a recurring role as Uncle Ryan, based on their actual uncle.All three are very different comedians. Chris\u2019s comedy, according to Tony, is \u201cpolitical, cutting edge and pushes the envelope.\u201d In describing his own, Tony said, \u201cI talk to the audience like I talk to my friends on the stoop.\u201dIndeed, his set at Los Globos was more observational. He discussed moving to Silver Lake and Jordan\u2019s teaching him new dance moves. He aired his grievances with rap music.\u201cI hate when rappers do interviews,\u201d Tony told the crowd. \u201cThey say stuff like, \u2018If I wasn\u2019t doing this, I\u2019d be dead or in jail.\u2019 Like damn, those are the only two options? What about managing Kinkos?\u201dJordan is the millennial Rock brother, as well as \u201chipster, cool kid, skateboard and wise beyond his years,\u201d according to Tony. Paul Page, a D.J. and friend of both Tony and Jordan said, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely two walks of life.\u201d Mr. Page worked with Tony on \u201cAll Def Comedy.\u201d Mr. Page said, \u201cJordan is talking about stuff like apps and social media, very relevant in Generation X. Tony comes from \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say an old-school comedy \u2014 but he mixes the best of both.\u201dOnstage, Jordan compared President Trump to Lord Voldemort from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d world, saying that his liberal friends didn\u2019t like Mr. Trump\u2019s name being uttered. He compared Tinder to Pokemon Go.\u201cIt\u2019s actually the same exact app,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYou just open it up wherever you are, and you swipe until you get one.\u201dShortly after his set, Tony went home. He had an early morning. Jordan stayed for the rest of the show. He wanted to take it in. He wanted to grow. But he saw his brother again soon. Two days later, Tony took Jordan across the country to open for him in Philadelphia. After all, as Tony said, Jordan is his favorite comedian. High praise when you\u2019re in a family that includes Chris Rock.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Department Stores Close, Stitch Fix Expands Online", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThen there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories.Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow.For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.And while Stitch Fix executives say they have no specific plans to go public, the company is well positioned to file for an initial public offering as soon as this year.Should Stitch Fix go public, it would be the biggest retail offering since Etsy two years ago. Perhaps more important, it would be a Silicon Valley rarity: a profitable company that did not raise money at a sky-high valuation, and one that could potentially tap the public markets at a price many times greater than its current value.Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business\u2019 value last year.\u201cThose businesses have mostly struggled to grow and remain profitable over a long period of time,\u201d said Mark Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School who previously served as chief executive of Sears Canada. \u201cWill a loyalist want to receive this every month? Is anyone interested in consuming this much apparel and accessories?\u201dSo far, Stitch Fix has found success where other online clothing start-ups have struggled. To the company\u2019s founder, Katrina Lake, success comes down to delivering what consumers want: making it easier to shop.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of innovation around being the cheapest or fastest,\u201d she said in an interview at one of the company\u2019s warehouses south of San Francisco. In her view, what was important was helping customers find clothing they liked without taking lengthy shopping trips and returning dozens of items.Stitch Fix was founded in 2011 and was initially run out of Ms. Lake\u2019s apartment in Cambridge, Mass. At first the company catered only to women, but has since expanded to offer men\u2019s clothing, plus sizes and maternity wear.Each box contains a handful of selections from trendy brands like Citizens of Humanity, Scotch & Soda and Barbour. Up next is a \u201cluxe\u201d offering featuring clothes from higher-end labels like Theory, with price tags going from $150 to about $500 per item.Expansion plans like that drive home the diverging fortunes of struggling traditional retailers and fast-growing online rivals.Online retailers who sell luxury products for less are undercutting sales at high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. Nordstrom recently announced layoffs and told investors it plans to focus on e-commerce, despite its Trunk Club write-down. And J. Crew, which has hundreds of stores around the country, has suffered three straight years of losses and is deeply in debt.Stitch Fix\u2019s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The start-up\u2019s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists \u2014 most of them part time \u2014 then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.Mr. Colson excitedly illustrated on whiteboards how the company\u2019s systems can narrow down a broad range of women\u2019s pants to a relative few that each individual customer is statistically likely to keep.\u201cCustomers say, \u2018This thing you picked out for me, I would never have picked it out for myself,\u2019\u201d he said.Algorithms have even cut the number of steps needed for workers to pick out clothes for individual clients.But that data-driven approach has also been yoked to Ms. Lake\u2019s insistence on running a financially healthy company. Given her early troubles raising money from outside investors, Ms. Lake worked toward becoming profitable early.\u201cWe had a \u2018lean plan\u2019 and a \u2018lean-lean plan,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lake said of the business model.Stitch Fix declined to say what percentage of items are returned.Running so cheaply meant not taking out ads during Stitch Fix\u2019s early days. But word of mouth helped the company grow \u2014 and eventually drew investors like Mr. Gurley, whose interest was piqued by the number of assistants at his firm who swore by the service.Yet the question remains whether customers who are initially thrilled by receiving a customized box of clothing will remain customers for months or even years.Lauren Rivellino, an optometrist in Charlotte, Va., was a Stitch Fix enthusiast when she subscribed in 2015. She loved trying clothes on at home rather than a poorly lit dressing room, and most items were flattering and reflected her style.But a year later, Ms. Rivellino stopped using the service. \u201cI really have nothing bad to say about them,\u201d she said in a recent email. \u201cI just don\u2019t shop a lot.\u201dStitch Fix executives declined to share their retention statistics, but claim that they are above industry averages. Ms. Lake and Mr. Colson acknowledged that clients stop using the service for a variety of reasons, from dissatisfaction to their closets simply filling up.But the two argued that the company can analyze scores of data points to figure out ways to coax these customers back to the fold.An earlier version of a caption with this article described the person in the photo incorrectly. The person shown walking between racks of clothing is a Stitch Fix employee, but not one of the company\u2019s stylists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Focus on the Family Revives Brio, a Christian Magazine for Teenage Girls", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byThe magazine had roughly 260,000 subscribers at the end of its 19-year print run in 2009, Mr. DeMoss said, making it one of Focus on the Family\u2019s top-selling publications. The relaunched version is one of five magazines published by the group, which also draws almost 6.3 million listeners a week on over 1,000 American radio stations.Sorcha Brophy, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh who grew up reading Brio, said the magazine aims to \u201cnormalize being a Christian teen\u201d by telling readers it can be cool to go to church and shun drugs and partying.But she said its emphasis on moral uprightness can also create a lot of pressure. As an example, Ms. Brophy pointed to a feature she encountered during her research: a pop culture quiz that deducted points from a reader\u2019s score for correctly answered questions about mainstream music videos and celebrity gossip.\u201cThere\u2019s no suggestion in the magazine that teenagers should completely remove themselves from pop culture and mainstream society, but at the same time there is an expectation of constant vigilance about how you engage with those things and about what you\u2019re consuming and how you\u2019re consuming it,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of work is expected out of teenage readers.\u201dMs. Ridgely said the magazine has traditionally \u201cmodeled what Focus sees as the right kind of behavior\u201d and avoided mentioning things of which it disapproves.It may be unlikely to mention abortion at all unless it profiled \u201ca young woman with a young baby and everything is going swimmingly,\u201d she said. \u201cWith homosexuality, for girls especially, lesbianism almost never comes up in any of their material. Girls aren\u2019t depicted as people with a sex drive. Their whole job is to keep young boys\u2019 sex drive under control.\u201dMr. DeMoss, a writer and longtime \u201cyouth culture specialist\u201d who is vice president for content development at Focus on the Family, agreed that the new incarnation of Brio was unlikely to cover gay or transgender issues, even though they have become far more socially accepted since Brio\u2019s first issue in 1990. For example, he said, Brio probably would not have joined other magazines in profiling the reality star Caitlyn Jenner when she came out as transgender last year.\u201cIf those topics ever come up in the pages of Brio they will be handled in a non-shaming, grace-filled, welcoming \u2014 and by welcoming I don\u2019t mean \u2018hey, we have no standards\u2019 \u2014 way,\u201d Mr. DeMoss said.And what are those standards? \u201cWe use the Bible as a standard,\u201d he replied, before quickly changing the subject to topics like music reviews and human trafficking.When it was suggested that he was avoiding the topic, Mr. DeMoss laughed and said \u201cwe have more than one instrument in the band.\u201d\u201cWe would rather communicate to the 95 percent or so who are not dialed into that as a regular kind of thing,\u201d Mr. DeMoss said.Advertisement"}

During the event, many analysts\u2019 questions about the company were dismissed by Mr. Spiegel. None of the executives made a particularly impassioned case for why the business would be a success over the long term.On Thursday, Jim Cramer, the investor and CNBC host, said Mr. Spiegel needed to be \u201chazed\u201d and put through a \u201cgauntlet\u201d by investors because \u201che is so arrogant.\u201dSnap\u2019s earnings showed that \u201cyour house has to be in order before you go public,\u201d Ms. Lynn said. \u201cYour job is to predict what you\u2019ll hit and then do it.\u201dSnap declined to comment.While Snap may make people rethink what it means to be prepared for a public offering and how high investors might value a buzzy company, it will most likely not discourage companies from going public altogether. Generally speaking, newly public companies have done well for investors over the past couple of years, so there is an appetite to buy into more of these start-ups.\u201cThere\u2019s a buildup of potential I.P.O.s,\u201d said Scott Sandell, a venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates.Many start-ups also do not face the tough situation Snap is in now, in which it is being compared to a Goliath like Facebook, which is aggressively copying some of Snapchat\u2019s features.For many of the tech start-ups that are evaluating going public, Snap\u2019s trajectory offers valuable lessons, said Elad Gil, the founder of the genetic testing start-up Color Genomics. The kind of public market beating that Snap just went through can ultimately help a company become more focused and disciplined, he said.Just look at what happened with Facebook, Mr. Gil added. The social network\u2019s stock, which was priced at $38 for its I.P.O., at one point went as low as $18 a share in its first year as a public company.The investor skepticism helped Facebook concentrate on spreading into new areas, such as mobile advertising, where it has since become a juggernaut. On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s stock closed at $150.04.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Every Day Is a Rainy Day, What Am I Saving For?", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byOpinionThe only time I ever saw my mother in an actual bank was the day my parents sat down at the kitchen table and decided, much to the relief of every family within earshot of our suburban home, to finally get a divorce. They shook hands amicably, and Mom excused herself, then drove us both straight to the bank to withdraw all but one dollar from my parents\u2019 joint account.Shortly after my fourth birthday, we moved out of the house into one cramped apartment after another. The important business of my early life was negotiated at currency exchanges (where you could pay the bill for whatever utility was about to be shut off), Social Security offices and food pantries run out of church basements, and transacted in WIC vouchers and money orders and rolls of quarters for the laundromat. I had no idea what a credit card was. I thought rich people just dove headfirst into the piles of gold coins in their money rooms like Scrooge McDuck.I grew up without money, but adjacent to the kind of wealth that afforded my classmates cars with electronic windows and multiple pairs of quality jeans. It never occurred to me that once I got ahold of even the littlest bit of money myself, I should carefully ration it.I know I should have invested in a sturdy pair of those bootstraps people who speak at graduation ceremonies are always talking about, but what does that even mean? Pay the rent, throw some cash at the phone bill, sprinkle a little change on the light bill, divide the remaining 20 bucks between the laundromat and a stock portfolio? It all seemed so unmanageable. And the years of being deprived or feeling stressed about money didn\u2019t make me want to save; they made me want to spend, to immediately enjoy the fruits of the $7.25 an hour I made listening to people talk down to me in a customer service job.My first handful of jobs in high school were babysitting gigs, and let\u2019s be 100 percent clear about what I spent that money on: many issues of Sassy magazine; Sarah McLachlan\u2019s \u201cFumbling Towards Ecstasy\u201d and Bjork\u2019s \u201cPost\u201d on cassette; every brown and maroon drugstore lipstick I could get my hands on; and steel-toed Doc Martens. Not once did it occur to me that I should be saving for a rainy day.To me, the first 15 miserable years of my life had been one great big rainy day during which I gazed longingly at the material possessions of my classmates. As soon as I got my first envelope of $20 bills for chasing babies named Tommy and Caroline around playrooms big enough to dwarf our entire apartment, I started plotting all the ways I was going to waste it, like trading my nondescript blue backpack for one from Eddie Bauer. (It was the \u201990s. Give me a break.)When I got my first real paycheck, I opened a checking account at the bank across the street from my workplace, and I didn\u2019t even consider opening a savings account or learning about investments. That kind of stuff was for adults, adults who didn\u2019t have years of deprivation to undo.I was trying to fill this gaping hole inside me with \u201cstuff I couldn\u2019t have when I was a little kid,\u201d and I assumed that one day, when I had finally bought enough magazines and name-brand snack foods, the feeling would go away. But it hasn\u2019t. And because I know the value of a dollar, when I get one I want to buy the nicest thing I can with it.I\u2019m still like this: Still buying hardcover books with no discount, still daydreaming about what I\u2019m going to spend my 401(k) on when I withdraw it early, because who are we kidding, I\u2019m not trying to live to 65, are you nuts? I don\u2019t have any debt because I\u2019ve never owned anything and I dropped out of college before my loans got unmanageable. I pay for everything in cash because I don\u2019t understand A.P.R.s. My credit file was so thin from so many years of living pretty much off the grid that when I finally got around to applying for a Discover card, Experian thought I might be dead.Will my yawning internal pit of desire ever be full? Is there any amount of cash that\u2019s enough to fully satiate this ravenous beast? Will Netflix and Spotify and HBO ever stop providing me with unlimited access to hours upon hours of entertainment to distract from the ennui that awaits me in real life? How many lipsticks is too many?I was feeling bad about my shoes at a fancy cocktail lounge the other night while talking to a woman I know. She is, I am pretty sure, greater-than-slash-equal to me in terms of poverty. She made an elaborate show of heaving her giant designer purse onto the bar so that she could dig through it to find the laundry money she was going to use to pay for her Sazerac. \u201cThat\u2019s a really nice bag,\u201d I said, taking a sip of my light bill. \u201cDid you recently receive a settlement of some kind?\u201d She laughed heartily and poured her Obamacare deductible down her throat in one long swallow. \u201cGirl, naw, I bought this with money I should\u2019ve spent on my car payment.\u201d I clinked the ice in my checking account overdraft fees and nodded solemnly in agreement.A lot of us are living like this, right? How does anyone do the stuff they want to do with their money while they\u2019re doing the stuff they need to do? It\u2019s easy to make fun of people for buying avocado toast with precious take-home pay, but what if what I\u2019m spending isn\u2019t my mom\u2019s money? What if there\u2019s no clear path from $0 in your checking account to a down payment on a house that\u2019s fit to live in?

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Keepers\u2019 on Netflix: True Crime, and Lots of It", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byAll of these make \u201cThe Keepers,\u201d directed by Ryan White (\u201cThe Case Against 8\u201d), an often fascinating and devastating experience. If it\u2019s not quite as addictive, across seven hours, as the best of its competition, it\u2019s not for lack of effort or craft. But yoking together the disparate elements of the story Mr. White is trying to tell would have been a tall order for anyone.The show\u2019s primary hook is its cold case, the murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik, a young Baltimore nun and schoolteacher who disappeared in November 1969 and whose body was found two months later, dumped in a field. No one was ever charged in her death. Mr. White starts with that story and immediately introduces two memorable and appealing figures: Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub, former students of Sister Cesknik\u2019s who have devoted themselves in recent years to investigating her case.But there\u2019s more. In the series\u2019s second episode, we meet Jean Hargadon Wehner, who figures significantly in the Cesnik case but has her own, separate story to tell, about horrific abuse at the hands of a male faculty member at the same school where Sister Cesnik taught.From this point on, Mr. White is caught in a tricky balancing act, moving back and forth between two narratives that sometimes intersect and sometimes move along different tracks.Ms. Hargadon Wehner\u2019s story, which involves trying to obtain justice based on recovered memories, has the outlines of a classic tragedy, and Ms. Hargadon Wehner is a steely heroine. The Cesnik story, in contrast, is a noirish whodunit, and Ms. Hoskins and Ms. Schaub, despite the grimness of the material, are doughty, humorous presences.Each thread is compelling in its own right, and a convincing case is made for their connections. But the shifts back and forth between the abuse story, a well-documented tale of institutional malfeasance, and the murder story \u2014 full of circumstantial and conflicting theories \u2014 can be jarring. Mr. White employs the full true-crime arsenal, including black-and-white re-creations of events and a lot of b-roll of bleak Baltimore backdrops, to achieve a consistently artful atmosphere of foreboding, but \u201cThe Keepers\u201d doesn\u2019t quite add up to the unified argument he\u2019s trying for.Mr. White and his crew also employ a certain amount of narrative trickery, both to tie together the story strands and to stretch the drama across the episodes, strategically withholding and reordering information. It raises a question that could be asked of all these shows: Since their stories could all be told in shorter and more straightforward ways without losing any significant facts, what\u2019s gained by turning them into multipart sagas?In the end, \u201cThe Keepers\u201d is as much a character study as it is a crime documentary, if not more so. Lawsuits and investigations may not be resolved to our satisfaction, but we can be heartened by the perseverance of victims and their supporters. Not too heartened, though \u2014 one of the last images we see is Ms. Hargadon Wehner responding to further stonewalling from church authorities by unhappily pouring herself a very generous glass of red wine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Network Ad Wrangler Undaunted by Facebook and Google", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingAfter completing her first year as the head of advertising sales for NBCUniversal, Linda Yaccarino went out to dinner with her husband to celebrate.She soon found herself crying into a bowl of shrimp scampi.The tears were a rare reaction to what she called the hardest year of her career, when Ms. Yaccarino started dragging an ad sales operation for television programming as varied as \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and Bravo reality shows into the digital future.Things haven\u2019t gotten any easier in the television ad world, but five years later, Ms. Yaccarino, 54, is still at it. And far from weeping, she has become an outspoken leader in an industry that is contending with far-reaching changes in how people watch television while competing against a host of technology companies that have begun to vie for those same audiences by investing in original video content.Ms. Yaccarino, who oversees $10 billion in annual ad revenue, has drawn particular attention for her vocal criticism of Nielsen ratings, which have long been the standard for how TV ads are bought and sold, and for her use of digital properties that NBCU has either invested in or forged partnerships with, like Snapchat, BuzzFeed and Apple News.\u201cLinda has the ability to stay a step ahead, and I think she\u2019s done that wherever she\u2019s been,\u201d said Julie Rieger, the executive vice president for media at 20th Century Fox, who has known Ms. Yaccarino for more than a decade. \u201cShe is in some ways the Wayne Gretzky of media. It\u2019s not about where the puck is \u2014 it\u2019s about where the puck is going.\u201dAs broadcast television audiences shrink and people spend more time on digital platforms, Ms. Yaccarino has reoriented herself to think of the competitive landscape as stretching beyond NBC\u2019s rival networks to include online behemoths like Facebook and Google. During this week\u2019s annual ritual known as upfronts, when networks trot out their biggest stars and announce new shows in an attempt to lure advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino will surely be promoting the fact that the NBCU universe includes more than 17 cable channels, 50 online destinations and partnerships that reach to all sorts of platforms and devices.During a recent interview in her sun-filled office, Ms. Yaccarino explained the ways that marketers might use NBCU\u2019s properties and partnerships to reach, say, a young, busy mother.First, she wakes up and checks Apple News on her phone, Ms. Yaccarino said. Then she might turn on the \u201cToday\u201d show while making breakfast, catch up on E! on Snapchat at the school drop-off and check stock prices on CNBC or sports scores during the day. In the evening, she\u2019ll tune in to a show like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d then end the evening watching Jimmy Fallon. Each presents a distinct marketing opportunity.\u201cIt\u2019s about the media mix,\u201d she said.Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s desk faces two flat-screen televisions mounted side by side, and her office is peppered with photographs of stars like the Kardashians, whom she adores in part because of E!\u2019s success in marketing their reality show. She\u2019s married with two children, but jokes that Jack Pearson, the character from \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d will be her second husband once she figures out what to do with the first. And she professes excitement for the \u201cpinch me\u201d moments in her job, like holding business meetings with Mr. Fallon and talking with Megyn Kelly about her move from Fox to NBC.She has forged new relationships, inviting the sales chief of a rival network to speak at an NBCU innovation event this year and teaming up with AOL for automated advertising a couple of years ago \u2014 when the notion was viewed as \u201cheresy in the TV world,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said.She first oversaw sales for NBCU\u2019s cable channels and was quickly promoted to overseeing all of the network\u2019s ad sales, a move that combined its broadcast, cable and digital properties for the first time.Previously, sales teams for divisions like NBC Sports, Bravo and USA functioned independently of one another. With the new structure, the idea was that if buyers wanted to be on \u201cThe Voice\u201d or \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d they could also be sold on \u201cModern Family\u201d reruns, Bravo shows and more, providing the network with more scale and efficiency.Wrangling a 1,000-plus person organization and 15 teams into doing that was the grueling part for Ms. Yaccarino. But it also forced her to grow comfortable with acting quickly in an industry where her competitors were changing by the day.\u201cHer job is understanding the marketplace and how to combine the assets she has under NBCU, connecting the dots between all the channels and ensuring the parent company gets as much revenue as possible,\u201d said Irwin Gotlieb, the chairman of GroupM, the media investing arm of the ad giant WPP. While that may occasionally make it harder for buyers, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what she does, and she does it well.\u201dIf that was Act 1 of Ms. Yaccarino\u2019s time at NBCU, she\u2019s now ready for Act 2.\u201cThe next frontier is: How do we really bring it all together in terms of linear and digital?\u201d she said.\u201cImagine if the advertising-supported ecosystem went away,\u201d she said. \u201cThere would be no Hulu, no Netflix, no Amazon, because that\u2019s what fuels all their content. They\u2019d have to go to 100 percent original, and the cost for the consumer would be absolutely unaffordable. So I think everyone agrees that advertising-supported content needs to remain the main driver or the epicenter of the business. We just need to figure out a way to do it respectfully to consumer behavior today.\u201dThe frustrations have cast old rivalries in a new light. Joe Marchese, who was named the head of ad sales at Fox Networks Group last week, was invited by Ms. Yaccarino to speak at an internal NBCU event this year.\u201cIt was kind of like a Macy\u2019s-Gimbels type of thing for her to invite a senior person from Fox to come up and talk about where the industry is headed,\u201d Mr. Marchese said. But it reflects the challenges networks are facing as some viewers opt out of ads entirely through platforms like Netflix, while at the same time TV ratings numbers are being compared with online ad views on Google and Facebook.TV executives have seethed in the past two years over a frequently repeated remark from Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, who said the social network has a Super Bowl on mobile every day in terms of the people it can reach. While the size of audiences on Facebook and YouTube are undeniable, there is fierce debate over the value of video views on such platforms, particularly when the ads take up only, say, half of the screen, or appear for a couple of seconds without sound.\u201cFrom a consumer experience, we all know what it\u2019s like to experience a Super Bowl as you have people over your home, family, friends, or you go somewhere and you\u2019re watching this communal experience and you\u2019re talking about the show and you\u2019re yelling and screaming and holding your breath and talking about the commercials,\u201d Ms. Yaccarino said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Super Bowl.\u201dShe held up her phone and exaggeratedly swiped the screen without breaking eye contact. \u201cDoes this look like a Super Bowl?\u201d She kept swiping. \u201cThis is not a Super Bowl.\u201dNBC, it should be noted, will air the game next year.While much has been said about technology companies coming for TV advertising dollars, Ms. Yaccarino said the companies were \u201creally coming for TV content.\u201d She pointed to Twitter\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s deals with the N.F.L. and YouTube\u2019s new ad-supported shows with stars like Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres.\u201cReally, you just can\u2019t snap your fingers and invent that,\u201d she said of premium content.And that is why she believes her focus on aligning with tech companies and reaching a large number of people on a variety of platforms will pay dividends.\u201cIt\u2019s about real audiences, real people who buy stuff, because they experienced your content all throughout the day,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we can do that, then we can really compete with the Google, Facebooks, Twitter, etc., etc., or whoever\u2019s next of the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Australia Bungled Its $36 Billion High-Speed Internet Rollout", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byBRISBANE, Australia \u2014 Fed up with Australian internet speeds that trail those in most of the developed world, Morgan Jaffit turned to a more reliable method of data transfer: the postal system.Hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have downloaded Hand of Fate, an action video game made by his studio in Brisbane, Defiant Development. But when Defiant worked with an audio designer in Melbourne, more than 1,000 miles away, Mr. Jaffit knew it would be quicker to send a hard drive by road than to upload the files, which could take several days.\u201cIt\u2019s really the big file sizes that kill us,\u201d said Mr. Jaffit, the company\u2019s co-founder and creative director. \u201cWhen we release an update and there\u2019s a small bug, that can kill us by three or four days.\u201dAustralia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya.For many here, slow broadband connections are a source of frustration and an inspiration for gallows humor. One parody video ponders what would happen if an American with a passion for Instagram and streaming \u201cScandal\u201d were to switch places with an Australian resigned to taking bathroom breaks as her shows buffer.But the problem goes beyond sluggish Netflix streams and slurred Skype calls. Businesses complain that slow speeds hobble their effectiveness and add to their costs. More broadly, Australia risks being left behind at a time when countries like China and India are looking to nurture their own start-up cultures to match the success of Silicon Valley and keep their economies on the cutting edge.\u201cPoor broadband speeds will hold back Australia and its competitive advantage,\u201d said John O\u2019Mahony, an economist at Deloitte Access Economics. A 2015 report by Deloitte valued the nation\u2019s digital economy at $58 billion and estimated that it could be worth 50 percent more by 2020. \u201cThe speed of that growth is at risk if we don\u2019t have the broadband to support it,\u201d he said.The story of Australia\u2019s costly internet bungle illustrates the hazards of mingling telecommunication infrastructure with the impatience of modern politics. The internet modernization plan has been hobbled by cost overruns, partisan maneuvering and a major technical compromise that put 19th-century technology between the country\u2019s 21st-century digital backbone and many of its homes and businesses.The government-led push to modernize its telecommunications system was unprecedented, experts say \u2014 and provides a cautionary tale for others who might like to try something similar.\u201cAustralia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered,\u201d said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort. \u201cThe fact it was a government plan didn\u2019t necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.\u201dAustralia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.\u201cYears of failed policy have left Australia as a broadband backwater,\u201d said Kevin Rudd, then the prime minister and leader of the Labor Party.But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australia\u2019s big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector.The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.\u201cAustralia had an aggressive, forward-looking, visionary government project to build a fiber network,\u201d said Mike Quigley, who was chief executive of the project until 2013. He added, \u201cthat opportunity\u2019s been absolutely lost because of bad judgments, ideologically and politically driven.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Liberal Party said that under its stewardship, the initiative was connecting more new users than the Labor Party ever did. But neither party placed fixing the internet high on their campaign platforms in national elections last year, perhaps indicating how difficult the problem will be to solve.Average speeds have more than doubled since 2013, according to Akamai, but other countries are connecting their populations faster, meaning Australia\u2019s lag with the rest of the world has grown. Big businesses can opt to pay for fast connections, but the cost can be considerable for smaller companies.GO1, an education technology company near Brisbane, spent about $22,000 on a speed upgrade in September 2015. It now pays nearly $1,000 a month for its high-speed, 100 megabit connection. \u201cAs a software company, our two main costs are internet and staff,\u201d said Andrew Barnes, the chief executive and co-founder. \u201cIf the former was lower, then we have more to spend on building up the team.\u201dMr. Barnes said that employees in Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam, had far fewer issues joining the company\u2019s weekly webinars.\u201cVietnam\u2019s one of those countries where you look out the window and the telephone wires are just a mess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut somehow, despite the obvious infrastructure problems, the internet there is much, much better.\u201dThe video game industry in particular has pushed for better speeds. \u201cRight now, we are all on dirt roads,\u201d Ben Britten, chief technology officer at Mighty Games Group, said at a Senate hearing last year on his industry\u2019s future. \u201cWe are trying to push huge semi trucks down dirt roads, and we just need to have some highways.\u201dOthers, for their part, look for ways around the barriers \u2014 including old-fashioned radio.Nick Lorenzi, who lives in Cairns, in northeastern Queensland, was frustrated with his copper-wire speeds, especially since a friend just a few miles away had a much faster fiber connection. Investigating online, Mr. Lorenzi, 25, an information technology worker, found out how to bum bandwidth from the friend using two transmitter dishes that cost $440 total.\u201cI just knew that the internet was rubbish where I was, so I thought, what else can I do here?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up really high on a hill, so I can take advantage of that.\u201dMr. Lorenzi has since moved, and he says his copper-based connection speed once again is \u201cjust rubbish.\u201d\u201cFor a country as far along as we are, our internet\u2019s just not aligned with that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just pathetic, really.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the sound bites in this mockumentary, where their whining and conniving are exposed, are filmed in a cramped studio in the production offices here belonging to its creator and showrunner, Kulap Vilaysack.The dues-paying of the past, or the traditional pairing of younger showrunners with more experienced hands, is no longer as great a concern for TV executives. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a point-of-view shift where the industry is beginning to value the audiences that those producers bring to the table,\u201d said Evan Shapiro, a former president of IFC and the former executive vice president of digital enterprises for NBC Universal, who greenlighted \u201cBajillion.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten past the tipping point on that.\u201dAn inveterate viewer of reality shows like Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d and HGTV\u2019s \u201cProperty Brothers,\u201d she concocted \u201cBajillion\u201d and its diverse coterie of hypercompetitive real estate brokers. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, the improv and sketch performers who created \u201cReno 911!,\u201d joined \u201cBajillion\u201d early in development as executive producers, and the show sold to Seeso, NBC\u2019s streaming network devoted to comedy.\u201cI thought that real estate world \u2014 high stress, high stakes \u2014 and that \u2018Million Dollar Listing\u2019 style would lend itself to comedy,\u201d she said.Even though a spoof of reality TV doesn\u2019t seem like the stuff of heartfelt, first-person storytelling that you see on shows like \u201cLove\u201d or HBO\u2019s \u201cInsecure,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack has been able to layer in personal touches. One of the leads on \u201cBajillion\u201d is a go-for-the-jugular broker named Victoria \u2014 \u201ca bully with daddy issues,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack said. The character\u2019s father, a real estate tycoon with his own reality show, never went to her fencing competitions when she was growing up, and she\u2019s still bitter about it. In a Season 2 episode, Victoria has an uncomfortable lunch with her father, who praises a waitress more than he does his own daughter. Ms. Vilaysack directed and was a writer for the episode.\u201cI have daddy issues; I have mommy issues,\u201d Ms. Vilaysack said over takeout salads in her office after a talking-head taping in late April. \u201cI have the feeling that I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\u201cWe were looking for something to write together, and that set our brains on fire,\u201d Ms. Flahive said. \u201cWe sent Jenji Kohan [the creator of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and \u201cWeeds\u201d] a one-line email asking if she wanted to work on a show about women\u2019s wrestling in the \u201980s,\u201d Ms. Mensch said, \u201cand she wrote back, \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201dZander Lehmann, the creator of \u201cCasual\u201d on Hulu, who had no previous TV experience, found a different route to showrunner: being discovered by the TV version of an angel investor. Mr. Lehmann, armed with a psychology degree from Washington University in St. Louis, sold an HBO pilot when he was 25 that didn\u2019t go forward. A year later, he wrote a pilot called \u201cCasual,\u201d a dramedy about a pair of romantically challenged adult siblings, that caught the eye of the filmmaker Jason Reitman.\u201cI thought it would be a good sample to get staffed on a TV series,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said over drinks at a pool hall in Glendale, Calif., in April a few hours after wrapping production on Season 3. \u201cI got really lucky.\u201dThat Mr. Reitman, the director of \u201cJuno\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d liked the script wasn\u2019t the lucky part; directors read good scripts all the time. Lucky was Mr. Reitman looking for a TV project in 2014 just after Mr. Lehmann had written one and Hulu, Netflix, Seeso and other services were broadly expanding the market for offbeat comedies. Season 3 of \u201cCasual\u201d began Tuesday, May 23, on Hulu.The brothers Shipley (Justin, 28, and Jordan, 26) were recent college graduates with no Hollywood experience as well when they sent their script for \u201cWrecked\u201d \u2014 a comedy set on a Pacific island \u2014 to TBS.\u201cIt\u2019s about a plane crash, and the nose of the plane actually falls out of a tree and crushes a guy in the first episode,\u201d Justin Shipley said by phone from Fiji, where the brothers are in production on the second season, which debuts June 20. \u201cWe never thought it was producible as a half-hour comedy.\u201dAs with Mr. Lehmann and \u201cCasual,\u201d the Shipley brothers had impeccable timing with \u201cWrecked.\u201d TBS was replacing its light comedies with darker, higher-concept shows \u2014 a lineup that would eventually include \u201cThe Detour,\u201d \u201cPeople of Earth\u201d and \u201cSearch Party\u201d \u2014 at the same time the Shipley brothers were shopping their millennial take on \u201cLord of the Flies.\u201dAnother avenue that could grow over the next several years is the migration from YouTube to more mainstream platforms. The YouTube channel started by Ms. Ballinger, 30, has 7.7 million followers and nearly 1.3 billion views. \u201cHaters Back Off!,\u201d the Netflix spinoff that is a surprisingly touching series about teenage alienation and tolerance, is now in production on its second season.All these first-time showrunners are being helped by the voracious appetite for new material fed by streaming services like Hulu, Amazon, Seeso and especially Netflix. According to FX Networks data, the combined number of original scripted shows on broadcast, cable and premium channels has been essentially flat since 2014, while the number of shows on streaming has exploded \u2014 to 92, from 32 \u2014 during those same years.And it\u2019s not a fluke that comedies are the shows being greenlighted. \u201cComedies are less risky,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, the former Seeso and IFC executive. \u201cThey\u2019re cheaper, they\u2019re easier to make, and the audiences for comedies tend to be more open to the way Aziz Ansari [the co-creator of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None\u201d] brings a completely different point of view to the table.\u201dMr. Shapiro is in development on a weekly panel show that would primarily book nontraditional \u2014 that is, not straight, white, middle-class, male \u2014 comedian panelists. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to hear from everyone else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(There are a handful of returning comedies, too, like \u201cCarmichael Show\u201d and \u201cDifficult People,\u201d but those don\u2019t require any catching up.) To help bring you up to speed, here\u2019s a quick refresher course.The most important moment in Season 4 was the final one, where Claire joined Frank in a fourth-wall-breaking stare, right after they mutually vowed to \u201ccreate chaos\u201d and to \u201cattack\u201d Americans\u2019 hearts. It\u2019s part of a wag-the-dog plan to distract voters from the damaging news about how Frank manipulated the previous president and about Frank\u2019s involvement with (the ambitious and ultimately murdered) Zoe Barnes all the way back in Seasons 1 and 2. Recall, too, that it\u2019s election season: Frank and Claire are running together, with her as his vice-presidential candidate. \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is good at mood and style, but it\u2019s not as good at plot mechanics, or maintaining a sense of momentum. Don\u2019t worry too much about understanding exactly who is mad at whom and why, because the show itself doesn\u2019t worry too much about it. Just remember that everyone maintains a discreet simmering rage.Season 5, Netflix, June 9The most important thing to remember from last season is that a prison guard killed Poussey, by kneeling on her back and eventually suffocating her. Enraged by this latest injustice, as well as the constant abuse and degradation they\u2019re experiencing, the prisoners at Litchfield Penitentiary start to riot, and the season finale ends with Daya holding a gun to the head of the corrections officer Humphrey. (He\u2019s the one who brought the gun to prison in the first place.) \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d has grown increasingly diffuse, with characters that barely interact with one another; more of the meat of episodes takes place in the character-development flashbacks, while the goings-on within Litchfield tend to take a back seat.Season 4, TV Land, June 28Liza\u2019s big secret finally caught up on her on \u201cYounger\u201d: that she\u2019s not in her 20s, but in her 40s. In the closing moments of the season, she finally \u2014 finally, finally, finally \u2014 told Kelsey about her (not actually convincing) ruse, though that\u2019s probably the least of Liza\u2019s troubles. Her could-be romance with her boss, Charles, seemed like it was about to go somewhere when they shared a kiss \u2014 a kiss that Liza\u2019s boyfriend, Josh, caught a glimpse of when he came to surprise Liza with a marriage proposal. Josh later dumps her, but perhaps it\u2019s for the best.Season 2, OWN, June 20The oldest sister, Charley (Dawn-Lyen Gardner), persuades her fellow sugar-cane farmers to use her start-up mill, which she finances partly with money garnered by blackmailing a basketball player who assaulted several women. The middle sister, Nova (Rutina Wesley), gets back together with her married white-cop boyfriend. But the biggest shake-up comes from the youngest brother, Ralph Angel (Kofi Siriboe), who discovers his father\u2019s revised will, which leaves the entire farm to him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norm Macdonald, Comic Nonpareil. (That\u2019s a Word He Might Use.)", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byOn ComedyIf you\u2019re looking for the funniest way to say, \u201cGo kill yourself,\u201d listen closely to Norm Macdonald.\u201cNew York City was the site of my great success,\u201d he wrote in \u201cBased on a True Story,\u201d his delightfully oddball quasi memoir with an unreliable narrator. \u201cI made it there, and then I didn\u2019t make it anywhere else. I guess Frank Sinatra isn\u2019t so smart after all.\u201dMr. Macdonald is also very smart about playing dumb: \u201cYou know how people have opinions? I don\u2019t got none,\u201d he says in one setup on his special. Don\u2019t be fooled: He does not have the vocabulary of a rube. When his jokes are punched up by an unusual or esoteric word, he isn\u2019t showing off. It\u2019s strategic.When he mocks a waiter at a fancy restaurant \u2014 an utterly mundane target \u2014 his language adjusts to suit the character. \u201cGuy shows up, and he\u2019s got a big tray at a canted angle,\u201d he says, employing an adjective that draws attention to itself before shifting into something similar to the overheated prose of an ad for a luxury product. \u201cEvery confection known to man is on it.\u201dMr. Macdonald\u2019s jokes aren\u2019t just informed by word choice; they are often about it. He has a bit mocking metaphors and making the case for literal speech, and another that zeros in on the opening line of the Gettysburg Address to rib Lincoln gently for his use of the word \u201cscore.\u201dSometimes his premises just seem like elaborate excuses to say a phrase that tickles him. In the middle of exploring the idea that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, he finds himself searching onstage for another way to say \u201cbeauty,\u201d and what he comes up with \u2014 \u201coptic trick\u201d \u2014 is the highlight of the entire joke, a term with a strong point of view and a pair of rhyming consonant sounds that echo off each other.On \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Mr. Macdonald could come off as just another sarcastic wise guy with an ironic attitude, a humbler Dennis Miller. And the content of his stand-up right now is pretty banal stuff, often from the well-worn perspective of an older guy marveling at how technology or fame or dining has changed since he was young. But listen to enough of his comedy, and what becomes clear is this ordinary fella has an aesthete\u2019s attention to form.\u201cHitler\u2019s Dog\u201d starts in the middle of a joke \u2014 comedy in medias res, to use a fancy term he might try out \u2014 and it ends abruptly. In bookending his show this way, Mr. Macdonald not only toys with the meaning of a joke, but he also drives home the point that the part can be funnier than the whole.Audiences saw something similar when Mr. Macdonald memorably said goodbye to David Letterman (who had Mr. Macdonald do the last stand-up set on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d), displaying an emotional side that took many by surprise. \u201cMr. Letterman is not for the mawkish, and he has no truck with the sentimental,\u201d he said with obvious feeling. \u201cBut if something is true, it is not sentimental. And I say in truth, I love you.\u201dStartlingly straightforward and moving, it was quintessentially the work of this comic. After all, when was the last time you heard anyone use the phrase \u201chas no truck with\u201d?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Take a Walk Down Memory Lane. It Can Be Healthy.", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byAround this time of year, every year for the last 10 or so, I have indulged in a strange but comforting ritual. I see the Facebook photos of tassels turning, I get the feels \u2014 lots of them \u2014 and then I plunge into the depths of my music library to rediscover Vitamin C\u2019s \u201cGraduation.\u201dOne listen \u2014 much like one potato chip \u2014 seldom satisfies. So I lean in, playing the song on repeat, often while flipping through pages of my high school yearbook until, eventually, normal levels of subconsciousness set in.Of course, the feelings elicited by the song have a name: nostalgia. And it\u2019s spreading on college campuses nationwide right about now.Thankfully, there are people who study this stuff, and because of them, our way of thinking about nostalgia has turned upside down in recent years. We even know the sorts of things that can trigger it. (Trigger warning: The rest of this post may make you long for the past.)The outlook got only slightly brighter and broader over the next several hundred years when experts began defining nostalgia as \u201cimmigrant psychosis,\u201d a form of \u201cmelancholia\u201d and a \u201cmentally repressive compulsive disorder.\u201dIn 2006, Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides and their colleagues published a study that changed the paradigm. Nostalgia, the study found, was a positive thing; thankfully, because most people say they experience it at least once a week, and some more than that.Researchers say it\u2019s a \u201cphenomenon\u201d \u2014 a high-order emotional experience more on par with love than, say, fear. It\u2019s about yourself and those close to you; big moments in your life or memorable settings. Experts have found that people turn to nostalgia when they are trying to avoid something unpleasant or feeling lonely, to counteract their social anxieties.And it works. Nostalgia helps bring your psychological state back into balance. It elevates your mood and your deflated self-esteem. Researchers say you come out of the experience with a stronger sense of belonging.Say you\u2019re moving to the other side of the country for a new job. That disruption can trigger a bout of nostalgia in which you recall childhood fishing trips with your dad. You think back fondly, and realize, \u201cHey, I still love to fish, and I still love my dad.\u201d So you begin to feel like there\u2019s some continuity between your past and present, like you\u2019re living a full and meaningful life. And in that context, the cross-country move that\u2019s been stressing you out may suddenly seem less daunting.In a Skype interview, Dr. Wildschut and Dr. Sedikides cautioned against using nostalgia as your primary way to cope with problems. Talking to a friend, for example, might be a better way.\u201cIf other things fail, nostalgia is a back up,\u201d Dr. Sedikides said, \u201cand it\u2019s not as bad as people think.\u201dA recent study out of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, involved showing students born in the 1990s the introductory scenes of cartoons that were popular when they were children.Some that produced nostalgia were:Scooby DooRugrats Research suggests that music is also a quick way to spark nostalgia. It can elicit both positive and negative emotions, and sometimes we purposely decide to leverage it when we want to feel sad, said Jeff T. Larsen, a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.Researchers have found that whereas upbeat songs may bring out the happy in you, slower songs can draw out both happiness and sadness simultaneously.My Vitamin C song, for instance, has both upbeat and somber undertones. But Dr. Larsen hypothesizes that \u201cthe most important ingredient is the personal meaning\u201d I attach to the song.Meaningful music sends all the good times flooding back, he says.Even if those times were complicated.Perhaps no one, Dr. Sedikides said, explains the power of nostalgia as a marketing technique more eloquently than Don Draper in \u201cMad Men.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s Star Wars (always Star Wars), which has managed to somehow evoke nostalgia for over four decades.\u201cThe products and franchises that do it right don\u2019t do carbon copies, but they try to extract the core elements that made something special, and then add new elements or take the ideas in new directions that make it feel fresh,\u201d Dr. Routledge said.Sound familiar?The research proves that yes, nostalgia makes you want to cry.So I\u2019ll just leave this right here. I hope you have \u2026 oh, nevermind.Advertisement"}

And I\u2019m white.\u2019\u2009\u201dBlum stopped. His eyes welled up. \u201cYou\u2019re black, and I\u2019m white,\u201d he repeated, his voice cracking. \u201cAnyway, I really, really loved your movie.\u201dRees shifted in her seat, facing the room as Blum, still overcome, swayed. Everyone else seemed very still, until Rees beamed at him. \u201cI just want you to know,\u201d she said, \u201clast week I saw \u2018Get Out\u2019 in TriBeCa and. . . .\u201d Nearly everyone who saw \u201cGet Out\u201d has some version of the story Rees then told. About how, in the darkened, packed theater, this unexpected horror movie about a black man visiting his nominally woke white girlfriend\u2019s family had tapped a surprisingly deep emotional current. It also became one of the best-reviewed horror movies of all time, and among the most profitable \u2014 nearly $200 million and counting on a production budget of $4.8 million. Rees said she stood and applauded at the end. \u201cSo, thank you.\u201dRees, it emerged, was a serious horror fan. She told Blum about two recent movies that she especially admired, \u201cHush\u201d and \u201cCreep,\u201d and Blum said that as it happened they were also Blumhouse projects. Rees said she had an idea for her own low-budget horror picture \u2014 one location, tiny cast \u2014 set in a small town not unlike the one where she has lived for the last year. Blum listened carefully.\u201cYou\u2019ve got me and my wife, two black lesbians, and when we first moved in, we fought every day over all these little things: \u2018Why is this over there? Did you move that?\u2019\u2009\u201dBlum leaned in, nodding. This was promising.\u201cMaybe it was a ghost,\u201d Rees continued. \u201cOr maybe it was some other force \u2014 like us not wanting to be there or fitting in.\u201d Blum was nodding more rapidly. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s my horror-movie pitch,\u201d Rees said.\u201cIt almost makes me nervous,\u201d Blum said, then leaned back and looked up. \u201cThe idea of working with you.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut anything you want to do, I\u2019m in. I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in.\u201dBlum has more or less always been a producer \u2014 his first feature credit was in 1995 at 26, for his college roommate Noah Baumbach\u2019s first movie, \u201cKicking and Screaming.\u201d Since then, Blum has worked on a variety of independent films, including a contemporary adaptation of \u201cHamlet\u201d in 2000, with Ethan Hawke in the title role. But for the last eight years, Blum has primarily made horror movies, few of them costing more than $5 million, and some of them \u2014 including the \u201cInsidious\u201d and \u201cPurge\u201d franchises, as well as the M. Night Shyamalan comeback, \u201cSplit\u201d \u2014 grossing into the hundred millions.Horror movies occupy a special place in the hearts of producers. They are cheap, their fans don\u2019t demand well-known actors and the ratio of risk to reward can be astonishing. \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d cost $114,000 to produce in 1968 and has since grossed at least $30 million; \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d cost $60,000 to produce in 1999 and has since grossed $249 million. Blumhouse\u2019s own \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d shot in one house with two unknown actors and almost no crew, cost just $15,000, yet its box-office return since its 2009 release has been $193 million, a return on investment of about 1.3 million percent.Blum\u2019s approach represents a particularly enterprising way out of the dilemma in which Hollywood finds itself in the age of endless \u201cTransformers\u201d sequels and \u201cSpider-Man\u201d reboots. A typical blockbuster can cost around $200 million, with another $100 million for marketing. At that rate, the studios can\u2019t afford to make a lot of movies, which means the ones they do make can\u2019t fail. This year Disney will release just seven movies, and all but one of them will be a sequel or a reboot. Blum, by contrast, makes a lot of movies on small budgets, and many of them never even go into wide release. Because the production cost is low, he can consider other options for movies that don\u2019t seem likely to break big \u2014 ones that don\u2019t require an additional multimillion-dollar marketing commitment but could still recoup the initial investment with maybe a little extra as well. Some Blumhouse productions appear on a few hundred screens, often targeted at narrow fan niches. Others might appear in a festival or two then get sold to a streaming service like Netflix.Some projects fizzle \u2014 \u201cJem and the Holograms,\u201d for instance, had the worst opening weekend of 2015, just $1.4 million. But when Blum sees a glimmer of something bigger, he can pole-vault his low-budget films into wide release with the help of a major studio. \u201cGet Out\u201d is a critical success thanks to the specific genius of Jordan Peele, but the reason you saw it in a packed theater is that Universal spent $20 million to $30 million on marketing. (The day after Blum spoke to the Sundance donors, he delivered a rented ice-cream truck to Universal\u2019s marketing department, as a thank-you.)Blum\u2019s low budgets give him plenty of leeway for experimentation. He recently produced some not-so-scary movies, including \u201cWhiplash,\u201d which won three Academy Awards, and documentaries, including \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d which won two Emmys. At the moment, Blumhouse has four movies in release and two more coming in the next five months, six more wrapping and scheduled for release next year, a dozen soon-to-be in production and another few dozen with screenplays or awaiting screenplays, including Blum\u2019s decade-long white whale: a movie based on the very quiet 1965 John Williams campus novel \u201cStoner.\u201d The company also recently started its own television studio, with a series in production based on the \u201cPurge\u201d franchise, and another, for Showtime, based on the journalist Gabriel Sherman\u2019s biography of Roger Ailes.Blum said he got into television because he wanted to say yes to good ideas, and there were a lot of good ideas happening in TV. Making space for artists, talking to them about their ideas, other movies, shows, art, \u201cthat\u2019s maybe what I love the most,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where you get the best tips.\u201d By way of illustration, he told me a story about his father. Irving Blum was an art dealer whose Los Angeles-based Ferus Gallery was the first on the West Coast to feature a solo show by Andy Warhol. One day, Blum said, Irving went to visit Warhol, who had recently started drawing comics. Andy, he said, where are the comics? Warhol told Irving that there was another guy doing comics now, and they were much better than his, much better than any comics he\u2019d ever do, so he\u2019d stopped. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how my dad discovered Roy Lichtenstein.\u201d\u201cParanormal Activity\u201dIrving spent his days with the likes of Frank Stella, Dennis Hopper, Steve Martin and Christopher Isherwood, who in his diaries described life in the Blum house as \u201cexactly like living in an art gallery.\u201d The family moved to New York when Blum was 5, and his parents divorced soon after. His mother, Shirley, an art historian, relocated up the Hudson, to Dobbs Ferry. His father stayed in Manhattan, on the Upper East Side. Blum lived what he calls \u201ca double life\u201d \u2014 weekdays in Dobbs Ferry were normal, quiet, suburban; weekends in the city were fast, loud and filled with artists.Blum was good at math and bad at reading. He went to Vassar College, acted a little, watched Hitchcock a lot, roomed with Baumbach and then in 1991 moved with him to Chicago. Blum took a couple of summer classes at Northwestern University \u2014 microeconomics and Shakespeare \u2014 and sold cable-television subscriptions door to door. Baumbach wrote what would eventually become \u201cKicking and Screaming,\u201d and Blum decided that if the movie was ever going to get made, he was going to be the one to make it happen. They moved back to New York City, where Blum \u2014 now working as a real estate broker \u2014 met Ethan Hawke, already an established young movie star, and Hawke hired him to run his nascent theater group, Malaparte. \u201cMy world in the city at that time was just chockablock with people dying to be artists,\u201d Hawke recalls. \u201cNobody our age then said they were or wanted to be a producer. Nobody! Except Jason.\u201dIn 1993, Blum took a job at Arrow Films, a small distribution company, buying genre movies for no more than $50,000 to license to cable and home-video companies. With a letter from his dad\u2019s old friend Steve Martin, he also found the first backers for \u201cKicking and Screaming.\u201d Then for five years he worked for Harvey Weinstein at Miramax. It was there, Blum says, that he learned how to do what it is that he does: \u201cGet in a room and talk to the people who have a thing that is the most important thing in their professional life and convince them to give that thing to you.\u201dWhen he left Miramax to start Blumhouse in 2000, he stuck to producing what he knew, making a string of artsy indie movies \u2014 \u201cEasy Six,\u201d \u201cThe Darwin Awards,\u201d \u201cHysterical Blindness\u201d \u2014 that hardly anyone saw. But it was the horror movies that seemed to work, and so he began pursuing more and more of them. He also made one moderately high budget ($48 million) crowd pleaser, \u201cTooth Fairy,\u201d starring Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, that was a minor hit ($112 million). But he otherwise stayed small, an atypical decision for a successful Hollywood producer. He found his niche, and it led him from \u201cKicking and Screaming\u201d \u2014 an extremely white, male-dominated movie \u2014 to pursuing a filmmaker like Rees. Not out of a sense of racial justice or marketing acumen, but simply because, shallow as his niche might be, it is also very wide.A few weeks after Blum met Rees, I called her to see if anything had come of their impromptu pitch meeting. Something had, Rees said. They\u2019d met for lunch and talked about a deal. She told me what was most surprising wasn\u2019t that she was suddenly developing a horror movie centered on the domestic lives of black lesbians in rural America but that Blum had followed up at all. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how rare it is that people mean what they say in this business,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just letting me make the best possible version of what I want to make.\u201dThis was perhaps a premature assessment for Rees, but Peele had told me the same thing, and many of Blum\u2019s other directors seemed to agree. He was the rare producer who stayed out of the way.When I asked Blum about his hands-off approach, he told me another story about that first Warhol exhibition, which featured the artist\u2019s 32 iconic Campbell\u2019s soup cans. The show was a minor bust. \u201cSomething like six people bought a painting for, I think, $100 apiece.\u201d But then Blum\u2019s father, the art dealer, had an idea. He tracked down each buyer (one was Dennis Hopper) and bought the paintings back so the 32 soup cans could remain a set \u2014 then waited 37 years and made a deal to give them to the Museum of Modern Art for an estimated $15 million. He found the right size for the project and the right market.Producers want to give the audience what it wants, but the audience, often as not, is the last to know what that really is. Blum seems to give the audience what it wants by giving the artists what they want. But he also knows what he wants. In fact, the final version of \u201cGet Out\u201d differed from Peele\u2019s initial vision. \u201cWe tested it with a darker ending,\u201d Peele said, one without as much of a hero and more of a message. The audience didn\u2019t go for it. \u201cIt was pretty clear from the test screening that they didn\u2019t need to be slapped in the face.\u201dPeele had no qualms about the change. He raised and quickened his voice, an impression of Blum. \u201c\u2009\u2018Buddy, buddy \u2014 you gotta do the happy ending! Give the people what they want!\u2019 That\u2019s what Jason does. He lets you do your thing, lets you be an artist, then gently reminds you: \u2018Buddy, it\u2019s entertainment. We\u2019re in the entertainment business.\u2019\u2009\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s no concurrent surge in scripted television shows capturing the pro-Trump zeitgeist, though there would seem to be an audience for one (\u201calt-TV?\u201d).He says he\u2019s working on a new show that will do that.Resistance/Woke/Whatever-You-Want-to-Call-It TV didn\u2019t dominate the Top 10 shows this television season. According to Nielsen, among the most-watched shows were the sitcom \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which has an average audience of 14 million people on CBS; the zombie thriller \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d the second-most watched show, with an average audience of more than 11 million people on AMC; \u201cThe Voice\u201d with more than 10.6 million people on NBC; and \u201cThis is Us\u201d with nearly 10 million people tuning in on NBC.The audience for the new streaming hit \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d may pale in comparison, given that Hulu had 12 million users at the last official count. (Netflix counts nearly 99 million.)But something\u2019s going on for sure, considering that Hulu says the show\u2019s premiere a few weeks ago was the biggest in the company\u2019s short history.Based on the Margaret Atwood novel of the same name, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d is about once-modern women forced into indentured servitude to bear children. The production team\u2019s embrace of the political moment is extraordinary by historical television standards.\u201cWe think that Planned Parenthood is an essential part of the fabric of this country and we don\u2019t want to back away from having an association,\u201d said the show\u2019s executive producer, Warren Littlefield.Mr. Littlefield probably wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to sign off on that kind of overtly political cross promotion in the job he\u2019s best known for, the former president of NBC Entertainment.His own career progression says it all. He helped preside over NBC\u2019s rise to the top of the broadcast television ratings, drawing audiences of tens of millions with hits like \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d That was \u201ca show about nothing,\u201d the perfect subject for those carefree days before September 11.That brings me to the key ingredients in all of this: television\u2019s nichification and a leap into original programming by the streaming services, which, led by Netflix and Amazon, took spending on original programming to almost $50 billion last year, according to Boston Consulting Group.In this Peak TV era, there\u2019s room for everything, especially shows that hit the political moment. That doesn\u2019t mean being merely topical or overt. \u201cThe idea of, \u2018Hey, be politically aware, deal with the politics of the moment\u2019 \u2014 good,\u201d David Nevins, the Showtime chief executive told me. \u201c\u2018Be politically correct\u2019 \u2014 the caricature of lefty identity politics \u2014 not so interesting.\u201dQuality has to be part of the equation. The money is there to do it, and the market is there for it. And this is where the idiot box\u2019s self-improvement comes in.That raises the question: If television got us here, can it get us out?The Mediator column on Monday, about the popularity of political issues on television shows, misstated the surname of the writer of an article on the online magazine The Root who commented about the interest in a new Netflix show \u201cDear White People.\u201d He is Jason Johnson, not Jones. The column also misidentified the celebrity who was the face of a Pepsi commercial that appeared to incorporate a Black Lives Matter protest. The ad featured Kendall Jenner, not her sister Kylie.Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cannes Is Changing Rules After Outcry Over Netflix Streaming", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Facing pressure from French theater owners upset that Netflix films would go straight to streaming, the Cannes Film Festival said Wednesday that it would change its rules to require all future competition films to commit to distribution in French movie theaters.Among the films vying for the Palme d\u2019Or in the festival, which begins May 17, are \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d directed by Noah Baumbach, and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u201cOkja,\u201d both produced by Netflix. Neither is getting a theatrical release in France, and the federation of French cinema owners has protested that the films wouldn\u2019t be shown in theaters.\u201cThe Festival de Cannes is aware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in France,\u201d the festival said in a statement on Wednesday.It added: \u201cThe festival asked Netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of French movie theaters and not only its subscribers. Hence the Festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\u201dNetflix has bristled at a French rule requiring a 36-month delay between a film\u2019s release in theaters and on streaming platforms. \u201cOkja\u201d is being released in American theaters on June 28. An American theatrical release is also planned for \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories.\u201dA spokeswoman for Netflix\u2019s European operations, Lindsay Colker, said the company had no comment. A spokesman for Netflix in Los Angeles did not return a request for comment.(The statement from the festival also confirmed that the films would remain in competition.)But French cinema owners had criticized Netflix for not fully participating in France\u2019s unique system, in which a percentage of box office revenues go toward financing new films.\u201cWe\u2019re really sorry that Netflix didn\u2019t understand the specificity of the French market,\u201d Richard Patry, the president of the National Federation of French Cinemas, which has a seat on the festival\u2019s board. \u201cThey stuck with their position that they wouldn\u2019t let the two films \u2014 which were done by great directors and deserve to be shown in competition at Cannes \u2014 be seen by viewers in cinemas.\u201dIn the statement, the festival tried to strike a balance between its role as an important film festival and its identity as a French institution.\u201cThe festival is pleased to welcome a new operator which has decided to invest in cinema but wants to reiterate its support to the traditional mode of exhibition of cinema in France and in the world,\u201d the statement read. It said the new rule would apply starting with next year\u2019s festival.\u201cIt\u2019s the best solution,\u201d Thomas Sotinel, who covers film for Le Monde, said of Wednesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cThey\u2019ve bowed to the pressure of the theater owners without compromising this year\u2019s festival.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fox Picks New Head of Ad Sales, Just as Selling Season Starts", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byFox Networks Group, days before the start of the annual advertising selling season, named a new head of ad sales on Wednesday.He will oversee advertising for properties including the Fox Television Group, Fox Sports and FX, expanding his previous focus on the group\u2019s \u201cnontraditional\u201d ad ventures and revenue sources, like Fox\u2019s shows on Hulu and its own websites. (He will not be responsible for Fox News, which operates separately.) The selection of Mr. Marchese, who also recently helped Fox forge a data partnership with its rivals Viacom and Turner, highlights the TV industry\u2019s shifting landscape, as it contends with ad-free platforms like Netflix, competition from YouTube and Facebook, and the challenge of tracking viewership across a range of devices.The current TV ad model \u201cdoesn\u2019t properly value what we\u2019re doing and kind of turns consumers off to our storytelling,\u201d Mr. Marchese said in an interview. \u201cIs there a way we can get back to making brands heroes because they\u2019re the ones making the programming you love? That\u2019s hard to do especially when consumers are being taught that ad-free options are easy.\u201dHe also rankled at comparisons of online video views to cable TV viewership.\u201cWe\u2019re having consumers sit through almost 20 times the ads in some cases as a YouTube or Facebook might over the same period \u2014 we\u2019re not making 20 times the money,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a misconception about where people are spending time with marketing messages, and I want to get that focused.\u201dAdvertising makes up about 30 percent, or $7.7 billion, of 21st Century Fox\u2019s annual revenue. The company does not break out how much Fox Networks Group brings in, but its chief financial officer said in March that news and sports together account for half of that.Advertisement"}
