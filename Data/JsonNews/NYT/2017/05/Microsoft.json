{"Headline": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Caring About Tech News", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byBitsLook at all the sides Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.Isn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hot Stocks Can Make You Rich. But They Probably Won\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIndividual stocks can be hazardous to your financial health.You may not want to hear that right now, with the stock market regularly hitting new highs.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index set another record on Wednesday after reaching a new high on Monday. It set records on two days the previous week, too. Counting dividends, it has returned more than 6 percent this year and more than 15 percent in the last 12 months.What\u2019s more, big bets on hot stocks are generating enormous gains. So far in 2017, for example, two companies in the S.&.P. 500 \u2014 the biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the video game developer Activision Blizzard \u2014 have each returned more than 50 percent to their fortunate shareholders. No question about it, if you pick a sizzling stock at just the right time, you can become rich. Some stock pickers have done well over long periods, too.But before you jump headlong into stock picking, you may want to consider the odds. It\u2019s not just that bull markets like this one eventually come to an end. It\u2019s that over the long run, while the total stock market has prospered, most individual stocks have not.A new study by Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at Arizona State University, demonstrates persuasively that while investing in the overall stock market makes sense, the obstacles facing individual stock pickers are formidable. It\u2019s much less risky to invest with diversified low-cost mutual funds.What\u2019s more, 58 percent of individual stocks since 1926 have failed to outperform one-month Treasury bills over their lifetimes, he found. That is a low bar, given the piddling returns on one-month Treasury bills, which now yield less than 1 percent.Professor Bessembinder found that a mere 4 percent of the stocks in the entire market \u2014 headed by Exxon Mobil and followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM \u2014 accounted for all of the net market returns from 1926 through 2015. By contrast, the most common single result for an individual stock over that period was a return of nearly negative 100 percent \u2014 almost a total loss.All that gloom about individual stocks may seem counterintuitive. After all, it\u2019s often said that stocks outperform bonds over the long haul. That\u2019s why long-term investors are generally advised to hold stocks in their portfolios.The problem is that the rosy long-term outlook for stocks, as opposed to bonds, is based entirely on the big picture. When you look more closely, the details are disconcerting.\u201cMany studies have shown that stocks outperform bonds over all, and I don\u2019t question that data at all,\u201d he said in an interview.How can those two sets of facts \u2014 the underperformance of the typical stock and the outperformance of the overall stock market \u2014 both be correct?It is because a relative handful of stocks tend to outperform all others by tremendous amounts.There is a technical explanation for this. Bear with me. In the language of statistics, the stock market generally has a positive skew \u2014 meaning, a relatively small number of outliers like Exxon or Apple have such great returns that they pull up the average stock, which has a mediocre showing. Put another way, the average return is higher than the median or typical return.What does all of this mean for investors?It does not imply that stock picking can\u2019t be successful or that it\u2019s wrong for those who do it with their eyes wide open. \u201cSome people who pick the right stocks can have lottery-like returns,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cThey may want to take that risk and do that.\u201dBut it does imply that most people picking stocks are unlikely to do well for very long.In response to a question, Professor Bessembinder said that he, personally, favors low-cost index mutual fund investing, through which he maintains a widely diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks.That is a less risky strategy \u2014 though investing in stocks always involves risks, perhaps especially in a period like this one, when stocks have been rising for a long while. And it\u2019s not a revolutionary approach by any means. It won\u2019t produce the stratospheric returns that are possible if you are able to pick the one stock that will outperform all others for the next several decades.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that it will be a stock that we haven\u2019t even heard of,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said.If you are confident that you can identify that stock, good for you. I\u2019m sticking with dull, diversified mutual funds because I know that I can\u2019t.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Small Countries\u2019 New Weapon Against Goliaths: Hacking", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 Hackers in Vietnam have been attacking foreign companies and other targets for years, seeking information and using tactics that suggest links to the Vietnamese government, a cybersecurity company said Monday.FireEye, a company based in California that deals with large network breaches, said it had watched a Vietnamese group known as OceanLotus target foreign companies in the manufacturing, hospitality and consumer products sectors since at least 2014. While identifying hackers or the governments that might back them can be difficult, FireEye said OceanLotus had used tactics similar to those in attacks previously identified by experts as having targeted Vietnamese dissidents, journalists and governments at odds with the country.The OceanLotus group \u201caccessed personnel details and other data from multiple victim organizations that would be of very little use to any party other than the Vietnamese government,\u201d said Nick Carr, a security expert at FireEye and the primary author of the report.Le Thi Thu Hang, a spokeswoman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, called the findings of the report \u201cgroundless\u201d and said the country looked forward to working internationally to fight digital breaches. Vietnam \u201cdoes not allow cyberattacks on organizations or individuals,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cAll cyberattacks or threats to cybersecurity must be condemned and severely punished in accordance with regulations and law.\u201dFireEye experts said OceanLotus was the first of 32 state-linked hacking groups it had identified worldwide that was neither Russian nor Chinese.State-sponsored hacking is \u201cthe new way to do espionage in the 21st century because it\u2019s much easier to resource compared to a human operation,\u201d said Tim Wellsmore, FireEye\u2019s Asia director of threat intelligence. \u201cThis is a low-cost, high-return model.\u201dPlainclothes security forces in Vietnam, a one-party authoritarian state, regularly spy on journalists, activists and political dissidents, sometimes in almost comically obvious ways \u2014 tailing them by motorbike, for example, or eavesdropping in a cafe. Activists in the Vietnamese diaspora have also reported being targeted by what they say is state-sponsored hacking.The report also documented the group\u2019s hacking of companies from Vietnam, China, Germany, the Philippines, Britain and the United States. It did not analyze specific breaches in detail, but it said one European manufacturing company had been compromised in 2014 before building a factory in Vietnam. It also said that OceanLotus malware had been detected last year on the network of a global hospitality developer that was planning to expand into the country.Ben Wootliff, who oversees digital security at the business consultancy Control Risks, said online crime was a risk for local and international companies in Vietnam for a number of reasons, including a rapid pace of digitalization and an improvisational business environment. \u201cThere is a lack of desire, awareness and capability to implement decent cyberhygiene,\u201d he said.The European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi said hacking was a growing problem for businesses in the country.\u201cMore and more companies have to hire experts and train the staff to understand the security risks that are part of their everyday working routine,\u201d said Amanuel Flobbe, the chairman of the Information and Communications Technology Sector Committee at the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.Digital security experts say private-sector cybercriminals or activists are responsible for much of the hacking in Southeast Asia. But FireEye said OceanLotus was notable because it appeared to be state-sponsored and used some unique malware that was not commercially available.The proliferation of government- and military-run hacking in developing countries also raises a broader prospect of what rules should apply to cyberconflicts. This year, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, called for a digital Geneva Convention to push back against a raft of political hackings that have targeted elections in the United States and Europe. Reports on other hacking efforts, like United States officials\u2019 targeting of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program and North Korean hackers\u2019 attacks on Sony Pictures, have also heightened concerns.Mr. Wellsmore said state-sponsored hacking groups in Asia were increasingly using multimillion-dollar tools to achieve their goals.\u201cThat sort of level of sophistication is generally nation-state-sponsored,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re the ones that have that strategic interest and are willing to invest that sort of money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "British Patients Reel as Hospitals Race to Revive Computer Systems", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byMr. Hardy, 52, a caregiver for his father, said his surgeon told him the operation could not be carried out because the hospital\u2019s computer system was not working and his condition was not life-threatening.Ms. Rudd said the number of affected N.H.S. organizations in England and Scotland had risen to 48 (20 percent of the 248 public health trusts), of which all but six were back to normal. Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center is working with the N.H.S. to ensure the attack is contained.The opposition Labour Party criticized the government sharply on Saturday for what it called negligence in not updating N.H.S. software after Microsoft provided a security patch against such ransomware attacks in March. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said in a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, \u201cThe incident highlights the risk to data security within our modern health service and reinforces the need for cyber security to be at the heart of government planning.\u201dMs. Rudd conceded that the N.H.S., where many computers had outdated software vulnerable to malware and ransomware, had been ill prepared, despite numerous warnings. \u201cI would expect N.H.S. trusts to learn from this and to make sure that they do upgrade,\u201d she said.On Saturday at Royal London, a world-renowned teaching hospital in the Bethnal Green neighborhood, patients expressed a mix of frustration, resignation and gratitude as the medical staff worked to provide care while still grappling with the cyberattack. The hospital, which has 675 beds and hosts one of Europe\u2019s largest accident and emergency departments, has been an imposing and beloved presence in its multicultural neighborhood since the 18th century. Welcome signs in the hospital greet visitors in English, Chinese and Arabic.Zahid Ahmed, 23, a local shopkeeper whose son was born at the hospital, said the cyberattack was an assault on the social fabric of the neighborhood, where the hospital was part of life, from cradle to grave.\u201cEveryone in this neighborhood relies on this hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cA hospital is like a mosque or a church or a school.\u201d Castigating the attacker, he added, \u201cIs there nothing sacred?\u201dOn Saturday, some doctors and nurses there said that they had been unable to gain access to patient computer files and that they had been using paper files and recording patient histories by pen, as they had done in the pre-internet age. Several nurses said they were struggling to obtain blood test results. Members of the urology clinic said they were unable to work because the computers were down.\u201cThis attack is horrible because it disturbs the service and strikes at the heart of a hospital,\u201d said Beverly Somera, a nurse, as she left the hospital after her night shift. \u201cWe have to do everything by hand, and this can slow things down.\u201dA note on the door of the emergency room warned patients that the hospital was experiencing information technology problems and that there could be delays. A man with a cast and crutches said he had been turned away.Fred Bird, a retired truck driver, said he had been called by the hospital earlier in the week to pick up X-rays before a colonoscopy procedure, only to arrive on Saturday morning and find the imaging department\u2019s doors closed.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame the hospital, but surely the N.H.S. knew this could happen?\u201d he said, his face reddening with anger. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand why their computers weren\u2019t secure. We all pay into the N.H.S., and this is what we get. What on earth is going on in this country?\u201dSamantha Tugushi, 28, said she had arrived at a clinic hoping to be treated for an infection, only to be turned away after a long wait. \u201cI guess I will go home and take a paracetamol,\u201d she said.At St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Central London, the computer systems were back up and running and the accident and emergency department appeared to be processing patients in an orderly fashion.Still, some patients were worried about their records. Amanda Wilson, 64, who went to St. Mary\u2019s on Saturday for an X-ray, said with a nervous laugh: \u201cI\u2019m worried they\u2019ve lost my files. What do I do then? I don\u2019t remember all the different procedures I\u2019ve been through.\u201dAcross Britain, medical officials were grappling with how to increase security after the attack.\u201cI had expected an attack,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut not on this scale.\u201dHe had warned in the article that hospitals were especially vulnerable to ransomware attacks because they held vital data, and were probably more willing than others to pay a ransom to recover it. He said in the interview that many of the N.H.S. computers still ran Windows XP, an out-of-date software.He warned that if hospitals paid the ransoms, it could lead to a slippery slope of other attacks.Steven Erlanger and Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Stock Market, International Is Actually First", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIf you had taken his words at face value, you might have expected that big American companies that make nearly all of their money in the United States would flourish in a new, America First environment.But that\u2019s not the way it has turned out, at least not in the stock market so far.Shares of American companies that make nearly all of their sales domestically have lagged behind those that generate most of their revenue outside American borders. In fact, those globalized companies \u2014 I\u2019ll call them International First companies \u2014 have outperformed America First companies by a wide margin.Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, ran the numbers at my request. He found that 113 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index make at least 50 percent of their sales outside the United States. Their fortunes depend, to a large extent, on the rest of the world\u2019s economic trends.By contrast, the America First category contains 161 S.&.P. 500 companies that make at least 90 percent of their sales within the United States. The group includes retailers like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Target, railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern, and regional natural gas and petroleum companies like Southwestern Energy, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural. All of their fortunes are determined mainly by events and policies within the United States.While each stock has its own story, Mr. Hickey said he found a clear pattern in the overall data. From the presidential election on Nov. 8 through this past Tuesday, he said, shares in the International First group gained an average 13.56 percent, compared with only 8.15 percent for the America First shares, for a spread of 5.41 percentage points.Why have the internationally oriented companies outperformed the domestically focused ones? Several factors explain the discrepancy.First, the initial wild enthusiasm in financial markets for Trump policies faded.\u201cThere was a lot of optimism by people in the markets about America First policies right after the election,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, \u201cbut in 2017 in actual terms, that has been completely flipped.\u201dSoon after the election, when the Trump rally in the overall stock market had the most momentum, the America First companies did outperform the International First group. The markets may then have been reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s publicly stated views, which he summarized in his inaugural address this way: \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\u201dAmerican companies with little foreign exposure maintained an advantage in the stock market until mid-March, when the tables turned and the International First group pulled ahead.More precisely, measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar peaked in strength on Jan. 3 \u2014 with a 6.53 percent gain since the election \u2014 and then began to plummet. On Thursday, the dollar was still stronger than it had been on Election Day, but by less than 1 percent.Some of that decline may have been simple mean reversion, a tendency of markets to return to an average level after a big move. But there was more to it than that.Domestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda. That helps globalized companies.\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about America First policies these days,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming clear that even if you don\u2019t get thorough tax policy reform done or a big infrastructure stimulus program done, the stock market isn\u2019t falling apart. Instead, the stocks that are leading the market now are not America First plays, they are international plays \u2014 companies geared toward international exposure that benefit from a weaker dollar and better growth overseas.\u201dThen there is the tax question. Despite the political turmoil in Washington, tax cuts and a possible windfall for the International First companies remain on the table. The administration still aims at repatriating at least some of the $2 trillion in stranded overseas corporate cash and ending the taxation of newly minted corporate profits earned abroad. Market analysts are already calculating the potential benefits to companies with substantial foreign earnings and big cash hoards, like Apple.Put all of that together, and you get a recipe for a rally in International First companies. America First may be the administration\u2019s slogan, but for the most part, the stock market has been ignoring it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hackers Came, but the French Were Prepared", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Everyone saw the hackers coming.The National Security Agency in Washington picked up the signs. So did Emmanuel Macron\u2019s bare-bones technology team. And mindful of what happened in the American presidential campaign, the team created dozens of false email accounts, complete with phony documents, to confuse the attackers.The Russians, for their part, were rushed and a bit sloppy, leaving a trail of evidence that was not enough to prove for certain they were working for the government of President Vladimir V. Putin but which strongly suggested they were part of his broader \u201cinformation warfare\u201d campaign.The story told by American officials, cyberexperts and Mr. Macron\u2019s own campaign aides of how a hacking attack intended to disrupt the most consequential election in France in decades ended up a dud was a useful reminder that as effective as cyberattacks can be in disabling Iranian nuclear plants, or Ukrainian power grids, they are no silver bullet. The kind of information warfare favored by Russia can be defeated by early warning and rapid exposure.But that outcome was hardly assured on Friday night, when what was described as a \u201cmassive\u201d hacking attack suddenly put Mr. Macron\u2019s electoral chances in jeopardy. To French and American officials, however, it was hardly a surprise.Testifying in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said American intelligence agencies had seen the attack unfolding, telling their French counterparts, \u201cLook, we\u2019re watching the Russians. We\u2019re seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. What can we do to try to assist?\u201dBut the staff at Mr. Macron\u2019s makeshift headquarters in the 15th Arrondissement at the edge of Paris didn\u2019t need the N.S.A. to tell them they were being targeted: In December, after the former investment banker and finance minister had emerged as easily the most anti-Russian, pro-NATO and pro-European Union candidate in the presidential race, they began receiving phishing emails.The phishing mails were \u201chigh quality,\u201d said Mr. Macron\u2019s digital director, Mounir Mahjoubi: They included the actual names of members of the campaign staff, and at first glance appeared to come from them. Typical was the very last one the campaign received, several days before the election on Sunday, which purported to have come from Mr. Mahjoubi himself.\u201cIt was almost like a joke, like giving us all the finger,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said in an interview on Tuesday. The final email enjoined recipients to download several files \u201cto protect yourself.\u201dEven before then, the Macron campaign had begun looking for ways to make life a little harder for the Russians, showing a level of skill and ingenuity that was missing in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and at the Democratic National Committee, which had minimal security protections and for months ignored F.B.I. warnings that its computer system had been penetrated.\u201cWe went on a counteroffensive,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t guarantee 100 percent protection\u201d from the attacks, \u201cso we asked: what can we do?\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi opted for a classic \u201ccyber-blurring\u201d strategy, well known to banks and corporations, creating false email accounts and filled them with phony documents the way a bank teller keeps fake bills in the cash drawer in case of a robbery.\u201cWe created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we prevented them. We just slowed them down,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it made them lose one minute, we\u2019re happy,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahjoubi refused to reveal the nature of the false documents that were created, or to say whether, in the Friday document dump that was the result of the hacking campaign, there were false documents created by the Macron campaign.But he did note that in the mishmash that constituted the Friday dump, there were some authentic documents, some phony documents of the hackers\u2019 own manufacture, some stolen documents from various companies, and some false emails created by the campaign.\u201cDuring all their attacks we put in phony documents. And that forced them to waste time,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the quantity of the documents we put in,\u201d he added, \u201cand documents that might interest them.\u201dOddly, the Russians did a poor job of covering their tracks. That made it easier for private security firms, on alert after the efforts to manipulate the American election, to search for evidence.In mid-March, researchers with Trend Micro, the cybersecurity giant based in Tokyo, watched the same Russian intelligence unit behind some of the Democratic National Committee hacks start building the tools to hack Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. They set up web domains mimicking those of Mr. Macron\u2019s En Marche! Party, and began dispatching emails with malicious links and fake login pages designed to bait campaign staffers into divulging their usernames and passwords, or to click on a link that would give the Russians a toehold onto the campaign\u2019s network.It was the classic Russian playbook, security researchers say, but this time the world was prepared. \u201cThe only good news is that this activity is now commonplace, and the general population is so used to the idea of a Russian hand behind this, that it backfired on them,\u201d said John Hultquist, the director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye, the Silicon Valley security firm.Mr. Hultquist noted that the attack was characterized by haste, and a trail of digital mistakes. \u201cThere was a time when Russian hackers were characterized by their lack of sloppiness,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cWhen they made mistakes, they burned their entire operation and started anew. But since the invasion of Ukraine and Crimea,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen them carry out brazen, large scale attacks,\u201d perhaps because \u201cthere have been few consequences for their actions.\u201dThe hackers also made the mistake of releasing information that was, by any campaign standard, pretty boring. The nine gigabytes worth of purportedly stolen emails and files from the Macron campaign was spun as scandalous material, but turned out to be almost entirely the humdrum of campaign workers trying to conduct ordinary life in the midst of the election maelstrom.One of the leaked emails details a campaign staffer\u2019s struggle with a broken down car. Another documents how a campaign worker was reprimanded for failure to invoice a cup of coffee.That is when the hackers got sloppy. The metadata tied to a handful of documents \u2014 code that shows the origins of a document \u2014 show some passed through Russian computers and were edited by Russian users. Some Excel documents were modified using software unique to Russian versions of Microsoft Windows.Other leaked documents appear to have been forged, or faked. One purported to detail the purchase of the stimulant mephedrone, sometimes sold as \u201cbath salts,\u201d by a Macron campaign staffer who allegedly had the drugs shipped to the address of France\u2019s National Assembly. But Henk Van Ess, a member of the investigations team at Bellingcat, a British investigations organization, and others discovered that the transaction numbers in the receipt were not in the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.\u201cIt\u2019s clear they were rushed,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cIf this was APT28,\u201d he said, using the name for a Russian group believed to be linked to the GRU, a military intelligence agency, \u201cthey have been caught in the act, and it has backfired for them.\u201dNow, he said, the failure of the Macron hacks could just push Russian hackers to improve their methods.\u201cThey may have to change their playbook entirely,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a member of the investigations team at Bellingcat. He is Henk Van Ess, not Van Ness.Adam Nossiter reported from Paris, David E. Sanger from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.

We are implementing remediation steps as quickly as possible.\u201d\u25a0 In a typical attack, hackers send their victims an email that includes a link to what appears to be for an innocuous web address or email attachment. In this case, attackers appear to have sent their victims encrypted .zip file attachments intended to make it more difficult to detect their nefarious purpose.\u25a0 Victims who click on that attachment soon find their computers infected. The program encrypts files, folders, and drives on the computer \u2014 and potentially the entire networks to which they are connected. \u201cUsers and organizations are generally not aware they have been infected until they can no longer access their data or until they begin to see computer messages advising them of the attack and demands for a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption key,\u201d according to the F.B.I.\u25a0 The messages that victims receive include directions for paying the attackers a ransom.

{"Headline": "Amazon to Share New Building With Homeless Shelter in Seattle", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region\u2019s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came.Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary\u2019s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall.Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators.\u201cI see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,\u201d said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary\u2019s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. \u201cYou come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you\u2019re in, and then you say goodbye. That\u2019s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.\u201dIn an interview at the current Mary\u2019s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon\u2019s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d on the design and construction of the shelter\u2019s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary\u2019s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff.\u201cToo often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,\u201d Ms. Roman said. \u201cKeeping them as neighbors is nice.\u201d\u201cIts reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,\u201d said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. \u201cDoing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.\u201dAmazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It now has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle\u2019s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods.One of the residents of Mary\u2019s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon\u2019s support for the organization at the shelter\u2019s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company.\u201cThere\u2019s people out there who really do care,\u201d Ms. Abbott said.Mr. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon\u2019s senior leadership, including Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive. Mr. Schoettler made the invitation to Ms. Hartman of Mary\u2019s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday.\u201cIt\u2019s permanent,\u201d Mr. Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, \u201cUntil homelessness is solved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hacking Attack Has Security Experts Scrambling to Contain Fallout", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe global efforts came less than a day after malicious software, transmitted via email and stolen from the National Security Agency, targeted vulnerabilities in computer systems in almost 100 countries in one of the largest \u201cransomware\u201d attacks on record.In Romania on Saturday, the carmaker Dacia, owned by the French carmaker Renault, sent home some employees at a large factory complex in the city of Mioveni because the attack had disrupted its systems.As people fretted over whether to pay the digital ransom or lose data, experts said the attackers might eventually pocket more than $1 billion worldwide before the deadline ran out to unlock the computers.But as of Saturday afternoon, the money raised by the attackers, who demanded payment using the virtual currency Bitcoin, was much lower. Funds totaling the equivalent of about $33,000 were deposited into several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies.That figure is likely to increase as deadlines approach for payment, security researchers said. Victims may also start digging into their wallets as others publicly confirm that paying the ransom actually unlocks their files.\u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee of service even if they do pay,\u201d said Becky Pinkard, vice president for service delivery and intelligence operations at Digital Shadows, a cybersecurity firm. \u201cNo one on Twitter is going to care about your complaint on this one.\u201dThe attack is believed to be the first in which such a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A. has been used by cybercriminals against computer users around the globe.While American companies like FedEx said they had also been hit, experts said that computer users in the United States had so far been less affected than others because a British cybersecurity researcher inadvertently stopped the ransomware from spreading.The hackers, who have yet to be identified, included a way of disabling the malware in case they wanted to shut down the attack.

News about the attack began trending on Chinese social media on Saturday. Most attention was focused on university networks, where there were concerns about students losing access to their work.The attack spread like wildfire in Europe, including to companies like Deutsche Bahn, the German transport giant, and Telef\u00f3nica, a Spanish telecommunications firm, though no major service problems had been reported across the region\u2019s transportation or telecommunications networks.Nissan, the Japanese auto giant, said its manufacturing center in Sunderland in the north of England had been affected. A spokesman declined to comment on whether production had stopped.In Britain, the National Health Service may be one of the largest institutions affected worldwide. It said that 45 of its hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices and ambulance companies had been crippled. Surgical procedures were canceled and some hospital operations shut down as government officials struggled to respond to the attack.\u201cWe are not able to tell you who is behind that attack,\u201d Amber Rudd, Britain\u2019s home secretary, told the BBC on Saturday. \u201cThat work is still ongoing.\u201dIn Russia, Leonid Levin, the chairman of the parliamentary committee on information policy, said the attack showed the need for the country to add to legislation protecting \u201ccritical information infrastructure.\u201d That body of laws has drawn criticism in recent years from rights groups for blocking the free flow of information into and out of Russia.On Saturday, Russian news reports detailed attacks against computers used by the country\u2019s traffic police to deliver new drivers\u2019 licenses. The report followed confirmation that more than 1,000 computers using the Windows operating system had been affected at the country\u2019s Interior Ministry.The connection to the N.S.A. is likely to draw further criticism from privacy advocates who have repeatedly called for a clampdown on how the agency collects information online.Industry officials said law enforcement officials would find it difficult to catch the ringleaders, mostly because such cyberattacks are borderless crimes in which the attackers hide behind complex technologies that mask their identities. And national legal systems were not created to handle such global crimes.Brian Lord, a former deputy director for intelligence and cyberoperations at Government Communications Headquarters, Britain\u2019s equivalent to the N.S.A., said that any investigation, which would include the F.B.I. and the National Crime Agency of Britain, would take months to identify the attackers, if it ever does.\u201cIt was well thought-out, well timed and well coordinated,\u201d he said of the current attack. \u201cBut, fundamentally, there is nothing unusual about its delivery.

{"Headline": "How Google Took Over the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Education DisruptedThe tech giant is transforming public education with low-cost laptops and free apps. But schools may be giving Google more than they are getting.Supported byCHICAGO \u2014 The sixth graders at Newton Bateman, a public elementary school here with a classic red brick facade, know the Google drill.In a social-science class last year, the students each grabbed a Google-powered laptop. They opened Google Classroom, an app where teachers make assignments. Then they clicked on Google Docs, a writing program, and began composing essays.Looking up from her laptop, Masuma Khan, then 11 years old, said her essay explored how schooling in ancient Athens differed from her own. \u201cBack then, they had wooden tablets and they had to take all of their notes on it,\u201d she said. \u201cNowadays, we can just do it in Google Docs.\u201dIn the space of just five years, Google has helped upend the sales methods companies use to place their products in classrooms. It has enlisted teachers and administrators to promote Google\u2019s products to other schools. It has directly reached out to educators to test its products \u2014 effectively bypassing senior district officials. And it has outmaneuvered Apple and Microsoft with a powerful combination of low-cost laptops, called Chromebooks, and free classroom apps.Today, more than half the nation\u2019s primary- and secondary-school students \u2014 more than 30 million children \u2014 use Google education apps like Gmail and Docs, the company said. And Chromebooks, Google-powered laptops that initially struggled to find a purpose, are now a powerhouse in America\u2019s schools. Today they account for more than half the mobile devices shipped to schools.In doing so, Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education \u2014 prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas. It puts Google, and the tech economy, at the center of one of the great debates that has raged in American education for more than a century: whether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers.The director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, touched on that idea in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dSchools may be giving Google more than they are getting: generations of future customers.Google makes $30 per device by selling management services for the millions of Chromebooks that ship to schools. But by habituating students to its offerings at a young age, Google obtains something much more valuable.That doesn\u2019t sit well with some parents. They warn that Google could profit by using personal details from their children\u2019s school email to build more powerful marketing profiles of them as young adults.\u201cMy concern is that they are working on developing a profile of this child that, when they hit maturity, they are able to create a better profile,\u201d said David Barsotti, an information technology project manager in the Chicago area whose daughter uses Google tools in elementary school. \u201cThat is a problem, in my opinion.\u201dMr. Rochelle of Google said that when students transfer their school emails and files to a personal Google account, that account is governed by Google\u2019s privacy policy. \u201cPersonal Gmail accounts may serve ads,\u201d he said, but files in Google Drive are \u201cnever scanned for the purpose of showing ads.\u201dGoogle, a unit of the $652 billion Alphabet, is the latest big contender in a decades-old battle among tech companies to hook students as future customers. \u201cIf you get someone on your operating system early, then you get that loyalty early, and potentially for life,\u201d said Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource Consulting, a research company.Google captured these next-generation users so quickly by outpacing its rivals in both educational product development and marketing.In 2013, while other tech firms seemed largely content to sell their existing consumer and business offerings to schools, Mr. Rochelle, a co-developer of Google Docs, set up a team at Google to create apps specifically for schools.10 Photos\u201cTeachers really helped to drive adoption of Google in the classroom, while Apple and Microsoft continued to leverage traditional sales channels,\u201d said Phillip DiBartolo, the chief information officer of Chicago Public Schools.But that also caused problems in Chicago and another district when Google went looking for teachers to try a new app \u2014 effectively bypassing district administrators. In both cases, Google found itself reined in.Mr. Bout said that student data in Google\u2019s core education services (including Gmail, Calendar and Docs) \u201cis only used to provide the services themselves, so students can do things like communicate using email.\u201d These services do not show ads, he said, and \u201cdo not use personal data resulting from use of these services to target ads.\u201dSome parents, school administrators and privacy advocates believe that\u2019s not enough. They say Google should be more forthcoming about the details it collects about students, why it collects them and how it uses them.\u201cIf my daughter came home and logged on to Google Docs on my computer at home, they\u2019ll know it was now coming from this address,\u201d said Mr. Barsotti, the Chicago-area project manager. \u201cIf this is truly for educational purposes, what is their business model and why do they need to collect that?\u201dMr. Casap quickly persuaded university officials to scrap their costly internal email service (an unusual move at the time) and replace it with a free version of the Gmail-and-Docs package that Google had been selling to companies. In one semester, the vast majority of the university\u2019s approximately 65,000 students signed up.And a new Google business was born.This became Google\u2019s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers.The strategy proved so successful in higher education that Mr. Casap decided to try it with public schools.\u201cThat caused the same kind of cascade,\u201d Mr. Casap said. School districts around the country began contacting him, and he referred them to Mr. Nelson, who related Oregon\u2019s experience with Google\u2019s apps.By then, Google was developing a growth strategy aimed at teachers \u2014 the gatekeepers to the classroom \u2014 who could influence the administrators who make technology decisions. \u201cThe driving force tends to be the pedagogical side,\u201d Mr. Bout, the Google education executive, said. \u201cThat is something we really embraced.\u201dAlthough business practices like encouraging educators to spread the word to their peers have become commonplace among education technology firms, Google has successfully deployed these techniques on a such a large scale that some critics say the company has co-opted public school employees to gain market dominance.\u201cCompanies are exploiting the education space for sales and public good will,\u201d said Douglas A. Levin, the president of EdTech Strategies, a consulting firm. Parents and educators should be questioning Google\u2019s pervasiveness in schools, he added, and examining \u201chow those in the public sector are carrying the message of Google branding and marketing.\u201dMr. Bout of Google disagreed, saying that the company\u2019s outreach to educators was not a marketing exercise. Rather, he said, it was an effort to improve education by helping teachers learn directly from their peers how to most effectively use Google\u2019s tools.\u201cWe help to amplify the stories and voices of educators who have lessons learned,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it can be challenging for educators to find ways to share with each other.\u201dAt Chicago Public Schools, the teacher-centric strategy played out almost perfectly.\u201cWe were bootlegging using Google apps,\u201d Ms. Magiera recalled in a phone interview. \u201cI just knew I needed my kids to collaborate,\u201d she said, touching on one of Google\u2019s own main arguments for its products.Chicago administrators like Lachlan Tidmarsh, then the school district\u2019s chief information officer, visited Ms. Magiera\u2019s classroom to observe. Mr. Tidmarsh said he concluded that if individual teachers were already using Google\u2019s services, the district should officially adopt the platform \u2014 to make sure, for instance, that younger children couldn\u2019t email with strangers.Ms. Magiera\u2019s advocacy came at an ideal moment. Chicago Public Schools was looking to trim the $2 million a year it was spending on Microsoft Exchange and another email service; it had opened bidding for a less expensive program.Quickly, though, a data privacy and security issue emerged, exposing a culture clash between Google\u2019s business practices and a major school district\u2019s values.Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, Mr. Wagner said, and followed up by emailing links to those policies \u2014 terms that the company could change at any time. \u201cOur lawyers were a little bit apoplectic when they were given links to security things,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a link that can change.\u201dMr. Nelson, the former education official in Oregon, reported similar frustrations over student privacy when his state negotiated a contract with Google. \u201cThat\u2019s why it took 16 months,\u201d he said.Mr. Bout of Google said that the tech company had \u201calways taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.\u201d He added that \u201ceven early versions\u201d of the company\u2019s agreements for its education apps had \u201caddressed\u201d the federal education privacy law.Today, Google\u2019s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law.Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesman said.\u201cWe were always enthusiastic to tell the Google story,\u201d Mr. Tidmarsh said. \u201cI would like to think dozens of school districts switched, based on our success.\u201d(Ms. Magiera has since occasionally worked as a paid speaker for education technology organizations that train teachers on Google\u2019s tools.)\u201cYou can see it radiate out from certain geographic hubs, and that is very deliberate,\u201d Mr. Bout said of Google\u2019s growth strategy for education. \u201cWe are taking a very geographic approach because we know it works.\u201dBy then, Google had developed a simplified, low-cost laptop called the Chromebook. It ran on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and revolved largely around web apps, making it cheaper and often faster to boot up than traditional laptops loaded with locally stored software.But there was one interested audience: public schools. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks.Mr. Casap didn\u2019t talk tech specs. Instead, he held the audience spellbound as he described the challenges he had faced as a Latino student growing up on welfare in a tough Manhattan neighborhood.His message: Education is the great equalizer, and technology breaks down barriers between rich and poor students.In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students in his blue-collar district near O\u2019Hare International Airport faced similar struggles. On the spot, Mr. Markey said, he abandoned his previous plans to buy Microsoft Windows laptops for 3,500 high school students. Now he wanted Chromebooks for them instead.\u201cI went up to Jaime immediately after the presentation and said, \u2018Are you guys ready to ship these?\u2019\u201d Mr. Markey said.Then Mr. Markey went back to his district to inform administrators and teachers that he wanted to order an unproven device that most of them had never heard of. \u201cIt was a tough announcement to make,\u201d he conceded.It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools. Districts administering new online standardized tests needed laptops for students to take them on. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.Another attraction: The Chromebook\u2019s cloud-storage approach made sharing among students easier. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used.\u201cThat is one of the big reasons we took off in education,\u201d said Rajen Sheth, who oversees Google\u2019s Chromebook business. \u201cIn less than 10 seconds, a student can grab a Chromebook and be off and running.\u201dThe Chromebook\u2019s price and usability fit neatly into Mr. Casap\u2019s argument that, for students, access to technology was an issue of fairness. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be vendors in the space,\u201d he said of Google\u2019s education philosophy in an interview last year at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex. \u201cI wanted us to be thought leaders, to have a point of view.\u201dAs he spoke, a group of students trooped past wearing purple superhero capes emblazoned with the logo for Microsoft OneNote, a rival classroom service. Spotting the capes, Mr. Casap said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d He added dryly, \u201cI love gimmicks.\u201dSome critics, though, contend that the equity argument for technology is itself a gimmick that promotes a self-serving Silicon Valley agenda: playing on educators\u2019 altruism to get schools to buy into laptops and apps.\u201cIt centers learning on technology, not students,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, the learning app analyst. \u201cIt is a very narrow lens on equity that leaves out things like student-teacher ratios.\u201d(Mr. Casap said he would not advise school districts with deficiencies in areas like teaching or student support services to invest first in classroom technology.)Mr. Markey, the East Leyden High School principal, had another equity concern. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. How would they do their homework on a Chromebook, which required a connection?Google was already working on offline capabilities, Mr. Casap said, and ultimately modified its education apps so that students could take their work home on Chromebooks, then upload homework the next day using school Wi-Fi.\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever remember when a specific device and platform has taken off so quickly across different kinds of schools,\u201d said David Andrade, a K-12 education strategist at CDW-G, a leading Chromebook dealer.In 2014, Google\u2019s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. The culture clash illuminated profound differences between Google, a build-it-first-and-tweak-it-later Silicon Valley company, and a large, bureaucratic school district with student-protection rules to uphold.At the time, she was the school system\u2019s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district\u2019s technology administrators \u2014 effectively making a district policy decision from the outside. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies.\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand out product and hope it will work in the classroom,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. \u201cYou have to work with the districts to make sure that you are keeping the kids and the teachers safe.\u201dJim Siegl, technology architect for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the nation\u2019s 10th-largest school district, reported a similar experience.He said that Google had directly contacted certain Fairfax teachers who had volunteered to beta-test Classroom, giving them early access to the app. In so doing, he said, the company ignored the Google settings he had selected that were supposed to give his district control over which new Google services to switch on in its schools.Mr. Siegl added that Google did not tell him which, or even how many, Fairfax teachers the company had enlisted to try out the Classroom app. And by the time he was able to shut off the app, Mr. Siegl said, teachers had already set up virtual classrooms on the service and started using it with their students.He said he complained to Google.\u201cBecause of who they are and how sprawling the ecosystem is,\u201d Mr. Siegl said, \u201cthey are held up and need to meet a higher standard than any other vendor schools deal with.\u201dIn an emailed statement, Mr. Bout said of the company\u2019s core education services, \u201cIn all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school\u2019s domain.\u201dClassroom was the brainchild of Mr. Rochelle, who started Google\u2019s education apps group, and Zach Yeskel, a Google product manager and former high school math teacher. They said they envisioned the app as a kind of \u201cmission control\u201d dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks like assigning and correcting homework, freeing teachers to spend more time with students. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers.\u201cThey developed a real momentum with teachers,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. \u201cGoogle Classroom was key to that.\u201dThat was too fast for Chicago Public Schools.Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers\u2019 needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Ms. Hahn said, she collected teachers\u2019 feedback and sent it to Google.\u201cWe wanted to help them do it right,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive.\u201cIt took us a long time to get them to do it,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. She added, \u201cUnfortunately, there were things that a district of our size needed that Google did not understand.\u201dGoogle eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. \u201cWe have said to Google many times, \u2018If it works in Chicago, it will work anywhere,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hahn said.Mr. Bout of Google agreed, saying that Chicago Public Schools often made more stringent demands on Google than other school districts did.\u201cIf you can get it in Chicago, it\u2019s sort of like you have passed a lot of tests,\u201d Mr. Bout said, \u201cand then you can probably get it into any school in the country.\u201dThe relationship has benefited Chicago Public Schools, too.Today, about 15 million primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Classroom, Google said.Google\u2019s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labor. \u201cIt\u2019s a private company very creatively using public resources \u2014 in this instance, teachers\u2019 time and expertise \u2014 to build new markets at low cost,\u201d said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California.Mr. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback \u2014 otherwise it might develop products that worked for only a few of them.\u201cOur goal is to build products that help educators and students,\u201d Mr. Rochelle said. \u201cTeachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.\u201dMs. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees. She said that schools were getting something substantive in return from Google, something they had rarely received from other tech companies: quick product improvements that responded to teachers\u2019 feedback.After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google\u2019s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company\u2019s innovations. \u201cThey no longer just turn stuff on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to us first.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hackers Hit Dozens of Countries Exploiting Stolen N.S.A. Tool", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byBREAKINGSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hackers exploiting malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency executed damaging cyberattacks on Friday that hit dozens of countries worldwide, forcing Britain\u2019s public health system to send patients away, freezing computers at Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry and wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of computers elsewhere.Transmitted via email, the malicious software locked British hospitals out of their computer systems and demanded ransom before users could be let back in \u2014 with a threat that data would be destroyed if the demands were not met.The attacks appeared to be the largest ransomware assault on record, but the scope of the damage was hard to measure. It was not clear if victims were paying the ransom, which began at about $300 to unlock individual computers, or even if those who did pay would regain access to their data.Security experts described the attacks as the digital equivalent of a perfect storm. They began with a simple phishing email, similar to the one Russian hackers used in the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets last year. They then quickly spread through victims\u2019 systems using a hacking method that the N.S.A. is believed to have developed as part of its arsenal of cyberweapons. And finally they encrypted the computer systems of the victims, locking them out of critical data, including patient records in Britain.The connection to the N.S.A. was particularly chilling. Starting last summer, a group calling itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d began to post software tools that came from the United States government\u2019s stockpile of hacking weapons.The attacks on Friday appeared to be the first time a cyberweapon developed by the N.S.A., funded by American taxpayers and stolen by an adversary had been unleashed by cybercriminals against patients, hospitals, businesses, governments and ordinary citizens.The United States has never confirmed that the tools posted by the Shadow Brokers belonged to the N.S.A. or other intelligence agencies, but former intelligence officials have said that the tools appeared to come from the N.S.A.\u2019s \u201cTailored Access Operations\u201d unit, which infiltrates foreign computer networks. (The unit has since been renamed.)The attacks on Friday are likely to raise significant questions about whether the growing number of countries developing and stockpiling cyberweapons can avoid having those same tools purloined and turned against their own citizens.A new strain of ransomware spread rapidly around the world on Friday.They also showed how easily a cyberweapon can wreak havoc, even without shutting off a country\u2019s power grid or its cellphone network.In Britain, hospitals were locked out of their systems and doctors could not call up patient files. Emergency rooms were forced to divert people seeking urgent care.In Russia, the country\u2019s powerful Interior Ministry, after denying reports that its computers had been targeted, confirmed in a statement that \u201caround 1,000 computers were infected,\u201d which it described as less than 1 percent of its total. The ministry, which oversees Russia\u2019s police forces, said technicians had contained the attack.Some intelligence officials were dubious about that announcement because they suspect Russian involvement in the theft of the N.S.A. tools.But James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said he suspected that criminals operating from Eastern Europe acting on their own were responsible. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like state activity, given the targets that were hit,\u201d he said.Those targets included corporate computer systems in many other countries \u2014 including FedEx in the United States, one of the world\u2019s leading international shippers, as well as Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica and Russia\u2019s MegaFon telecom giant.It could take months to find who was behind the attacks \u2014 a mystery that may go unsolved. But they alarmed cybersecurity experts everywhere, reflecting the enormous vulnerabilities to internet invasions faced by disjointed networks of computer systems.There is no automatic way to \u201cpatch\u201d their weaknesses around the world.\u201cWhen people ask what keeps you up at night, it\u2019s this,\u201d said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York security firm tracking the attacks. Mr. Camacho said he was particularly disturbed at how the attacks spread like wildfire through corporate, hospital and government networks.Another security expert, Rohyt Belani, the chief executive of PhishMe, an email security company, said the wormlike capability of the malware was a significant shift from previous ransom attacks. \u201cThis is almost like the atom bomb of ransomware,\u201d Mr. Belani said, warning that the attack \u201cmay be a sign of things to come.\u201dOne reason the ransomware on Friday was able to spread so quickly was that the stolen N.S.A. hacking tool, known as \u201cEternal Blue,\u201d affected a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows servers.Hours after the Shadow Brokers released the tool last month, Microsoft assured users that it had already included a patch for the underlying vulnerability in a software update in March.But Microsoft, which regularly credits researchers who discover holes in its products, curiously would not say who had tipped the company off to the issue. Many suspected that the United States government itself had told Microsoft, after the N.S.A. realized that its hacking method exploiting the vulnerability had been stolen.Privacy activists said if that were the case, the government would be to blame for the fact that so many companies were left vulnerable to Friday\u2019s attacks. It takes time for companies to roll out systemwide patches, and by notifying Microsoft of the hole only after the N.S.A.\u2019s hacking tool was stolen, activists say the government would have left many hospitals, businesses and governments susceptible.\u201cIt would be deeply troubling if the N.S.A. knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,\u201d Patrick Toomey, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, said on Friday. \u201cThese attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world.\u201dDuring the Obama administration, the White House created a process to review software vulnerabilities discovered by intelligence agencies, and to determine which should be \u201cstockpiled\u201d for future offensive or defensive cyberoperations and which should be reported to the companies so that they could be fixed.Last year the administration said that only a small fraction were retained by the government. But this vulnerability appeared to be one of them, and it was patched only recently, suggesting that the N.S.A. may have concluded the tool had been stolen and therefore warned Microsoft.But that was clearly too little, and far too late.On Friday, hackers took advantage of the fact that vulnerable targets \u2014 particularly hospitals \u2014 had yet to patch their systems, either because they had ignored advisories from Microsoft or because they were using outdated software that Microsoft no longer supports or updates.The malware was circulated by email. Targets were sent an encrypted, compressed file that, once loaded, allowed the ransomware to infiltrate its targets. The fact that the files were encrypted ensured that the ransomware would not be detected by security systems until employees opened them, inadvertently allowing the ransomware to replicate across their employers\u2019 networks.Employees at Britain\u2019s National Health Service had been warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday. But it was too late. As the disruptions rippled through at least 36 hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices and ambulance companies across Britain, the health service declared the attack a \u201cmajor incident,\u201d warning that local health services could be overwhelmed.Britain\u2019s health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was briefed by cybersecurity experts, while Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s office said on television that \u201cwe\u2019re not aware of any evidence that patient data has been compromised.\u201dAs the day wore on, dozens of companies across Europe, Asia and the United States discovered that they had been hit with the ransomware when they saw criminals\u2019 messages on their computer screens demanding $300 to unlock their data. But the criminals designed their ransomware to increase the ransom amount on a set schedule and threatened to erase the hostage data after a predetermined cutoff time, raising the urgency of the attack and increasing the likelihood that victims would pay.Without the ability to decrypt their data on their own, security experts said that victims who had not backed up their data were faced with a choice: Either live without their data or pay. It was not clear how many victims ultimately paid.Security experts advised companies to immediately update their systems with the Microsoft patch.Until organizations use the Microsoft patch, Mr. Camacho said, they could continue to be hit \u2014 not just by ransomware, but by all kinds of malicious tools that can manipulate, steal or delete their data.\u201cThere is going to be a lot more of these attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see copycats, and not just for ransomware, but other attacks.\u201dNicole Perlroth reported from San Francisco and David E.

{"Headline": "Giving the Behemoths a Leg Up on the Little Guy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtEvery year, the internet gets a little less fair. The corporations that run it get a little bigger, their power grows more concentrated, and a bit of their idealism gives way to ruthless pragmatism.And if Ajit Pai, the new chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gets his way, the hegemons are likely to grow only larger and more powerful.This column is nominally about network neutrality, the often sleep-inducing debate about the rules that broadband companies like Comcast and AT&T must follow when managing their networks. But really, this is a story about ballooning corporate power.Which brings us to net neutrality. The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.So the better way to think about the rules isn\u2019t in terms of what these companies do, but rather in terms of size. Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?Probably not. In fact, it could entrench their power even further.But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.Excerpts from and analysis of rules and explanations released by the Federal Communications Commission regarding an Open Internet.\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201dBut Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201dThe internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace. Consumers and the internet ecosystem benefit when start-ups can leapfrog incumbents, and net neutrality is key to preserving this ethos.\u201dMeanwhile, opponents of network neutrality argue just the opposite \u2014 that removing the rules would actually strengthen start-ups.\u201cThe big companies are already getting huge speed advantages because they\u2019ve built out massive online infrastructure,\u201d said Bret Swanson, who studies telecom policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cBut the upstart that doesn\u2019t have the massive infrastructure and doesn\u2019t have tens of billions of dollars to build it, that company could use things like paid priority to enter this competitive market.\u201dIn other words, if broadband companies start taking money to speed up certain content, start-ups could use that offer to make their content just as fast as that of any tech giant.Well, maybe. Mr. Swanson\u2019s theory rests on the assumption that the new rules would not permit unfair practices. If Google, Facebook or some other giant offered a broadband company millions to block a rival\u2019s service, Mr. Swanson said that could trigger antitrust investigations and other negative consequences for the behemoth.\u201cThe basic antitrust and competition laws will still be applicable, and so companies couldn\u2019t just exclude rivals in this way,\u201d he said.I\u2019m less sanguine. American regulators have shown a near total lack of interest in pursuing tech giants \u2014 and most other companies \u2014 on anticompetitive issues. It does not look like that\u2019s going to change under President Trump.The giants seem likely to keep getting bigger. If we give them a chance to buy up every fast lane online, we\u2019ll be removing another check on their untamed power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Digital Tools, Even Nonexperts Can Wage Cyberattacks", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Hackers are discovering that it is far more profitable to hold your data hostage than it is to steal it.Ransomware is nothing new. For years, there have been stories of individuals or companies horrified that they have been locked out of their computers and that the only way back in is to pay a ransom to someone, somewhere who has managed to take control.But computer criminals are discovering that ransomware is the most effective way to make money in the shortest amount of time. The advent of new tools that wrap victims\u2019 data with tough encryption technology, hard-to-trace digital currency like Bitcoin, and even online sites that offer to do the data ransoming in return for a piece of the action, have made this method of cybertheft much easier.\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have any skills to do this anymore,\u201d said Jason Rebholz, a senior director at the Crypsis Group who has helped dozens of victims of ransomware.Ransomware has allowed people who are not computer experts to become computer thieves. It used to be that hackers had to be a little creative and skilled to get money out of people. There were fake antivirus scams that promised to clean up your computer \u2014 for a fee.Sometimes they resorted to so-called Trojan horse programs that lay in wait on e-commerce or banking sites, ready to get your credit card numbers. And there was old-fashioned hacking, grabbing all sorts of personal credentials that could be sold on the so-called dark web.Four years ago, investigators were pursuing roughly 16 variants of ransomware that were predominantly being used on victims in Eastern Europe. Now there are dozens of types of ransomware, and they are supported by an entire underground industry. And catching and convicting the people responsible is difficult.As of Saturday afternoon, several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware had received the equivalent of $33,000, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. And the number could grow.The attack should not have been a shock. As data has become our lifeline, cybercriminals have elevated their game and their demands. Just five years ago, attackers in Eastern Europe were locking up victims\u2019 computers and demanding ransoms of $100 to $400 to unlock them.These days, it\u2019s a 50-50 split between those who pay the ransom and those who refuse, either because they have adequate backups, are philosophically opposed or simply cannot afford to pay.Ransoms now range from as little as one Bitcoin, which equates to roughly $1,700, to as many as 30 Bitcoin, nearly $51,000, with the median ransom equating to four Bitcoin, or nearly $7,000, according to researchers at the Crypsis Group.Bitcoin has given cybercriminals an easy and anonymous way to get their profits, and it is much harder to track than credit cards or wire transfers.There is even now a concept of \u201cransomware as a service\u201d \u2014 a play on the Silicon Valley jargon \u201csoftware as a service,\u201d which describes the delivery of software over the internet.Now anyone can visit a web page, generate a ransomware file with the click of a mouse, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to restore access to the files. If the victim pays, the ransomware provider takes a cut of the payment.Ransomware criminals also have customer service lines that victims can call to get help paying a ransom. There are even live chat options. And while some amateur ransomware attackers may not restore victims\u2019 data once the ransom is paid, the more professional outfits worry that if they do not decrypt a victim\u2019s data, their reputation and \u201cbusiness\u201d may suffer as a result, Mr. Rebholz said.The most notorious of these attackers, a group called SamSam after its type of ransomware, is known for demanding the highest ransoms, 25 to 30 Bitcoin. But they reliably decrypt a victim\u2019s data after being paid.Most small- to medium-size businesses pay the ransoms because they do not have backups of their data and feel they have no other option, Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cThat data is the bloodline of their business in many cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can either go out of business or pay the ransom.\u201dCybercriminals have also found a soft target in universities, which usually have more open systems that allow for the free flow of information.More recently, they have found a niche in health care, where ransomware attacks take on a new level of urgency as doctors and emergency rooms in Britain discovered on Friday when hackers blocked their access to patient records, and patients had to be turned away.Imperial College Healthcare in London, for example, was hit with ransomware 19 times over 12 months, according to freedom-of-information requests submitted by SentinelOne, a security firm.In the United States, the number of reported ransomware attacks rose fourfold between 2015 and 2016, as did the ransom payments to hackers, to $1 billion, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201cIn the past three months, health care providers have been preparing themselves for these attacks, either with Bitcoin at the ready or with professional incident responders,\u201d said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York company that tracked Friday\u2019s attacks.Nearly half of ransomware attacks begin by persuading an employee to click on an email. Sometimes the methods used by cybercriminals are more complex. A \u201cwatering hole attack,\u201d for example, infects a website with ransomware code. When users visit the site, that code is downloaded onto their machine.The other half, Mr. Rebholz and others said, target victims with \u201cbrute force\u201d methods: Hackers scan an organization for software vulnerabilities, weak passwords or other unlocked digital doors. After that, ransomware attackers try to encrypt as many files as possible. The SamSam group is known to move from file to file, manually encrypting hundreds of systems, so it can demand the highest in Bitcoin ransoms, according to the Crypsis Group, Symantec and others.It seems no one is immune. In January, a hacker held hostage a small cancer charity in Indiana, wiping the organization\u2019s main and backup servers and demanding 50 Bitcoin \u2014 more than $87,000 \u2014 in return for restoring their data. They did not pay.And ransomware attackers are not above playing martyr. In one recent attack that Mr. Rebholz tracked, the attackers tried to convince their victim that paying a \u201ccontribution\u201d \u2014 or ransom \u2014 would benefit sick children around the world.\u201cThat\u2019s where we are,\u201d Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cThreat actors are now trying to play people\u2019s emotions, trying to put a pretty face on criminal activity by pretending to be a charity case.\u201dMark Scott contributed reporting from Riga, Latvia, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

He saw it as a way for others to avoid the same immigration travails he suffered a few years earlier.Then came the American presidential election. \u201cTrump accelerated everything,\u201d said Mr. Moravej, 33, the chief executive of a software start-up named Botler AI.Mr. Bengio is adding his intellectual firepower to ease the way for what could become a migration of high-tech talent. Canada stands to benefit from the American political climate and the Trump administration\u2019s efforts \u2014 stalled in court so far \u2014 to sharply restrict travel into the United States from six predominantly Muslim nations. After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, applications to Canada for student and temporary visas surged.Immigration is a linchpin in Canada\u2019s economic policy. One-fifth of the country\u2019s population of 36 million is foreign-born. Canada has dozens of provincial and federal programs, but a priority is placed on highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs, often with points assigned for specialized expertise, education and language proficiency.Not only are Canadian A.I. start-ups like Botler AI now building on interest in immigration and on homegrown talent, but major American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and IBM, have also been adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada.Canada has well-funded programs intended not only to lure A.I. experts to the country, but also to persuade A.I. researchers, educated at Canadian universities, to remain in Canada rather than depart for Silicon Valley, as so many have done before.The nation\u2019s policy makers also want to persuade expatriate engineers and entrepreneurs to return to Canada \u2014 and the political climate in the United States has influenced some to do so.But last month, Ross, whose software can read through thousands of legal documents and rank relevant cases for lawyers, opened an office in Toronto. Five members of its team, including senior engineers and two co-founders, are moving from San Francisco to Canada. The group includes two Canadians, a Brazilian, a Belgian and an American.The Toronto outpost, said Jimoh Ovbiagele, a co-founder and chief technology officer of Ross, \u201callows us to really recruit from the global talent pool.\u201dMr. Ovbiagele, one of the Canadians who is relocating to Toronto, said Ross had received dozens of inquiries from international students concerned about the immigration risk of working in America. Ross, he said, recently hired engineers who were international students and graduates of Princeton, Cooper Union and the University of Toronto.Another technologist making the move to Canada from Silicon Valley is Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, 31, who returned to Montreal a few weeks ago after working for Apple for 13 months. There were other considerations, she said, but \u201cthe election of Trump did play a role\u201d in convincing her that she would prefer to live in Canada.So when an opportunity to work at Mr. Bengio\u2019s A.I. institute in Montreal became available recently, Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert did not hesitate. Her new salary is about a third of her income at Apple.Then again, Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert observed, her rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Montreal is less than a third of the monthly rent she paid for a one-bedroom apartment in Sunnyvale, Calif. And Montreal, she added, is a cosmopolitan city.\u201cLiving in Montreal is pretty good,\u201d Ms. Chevalier-Boisvert said.Back at Botler AI, a lot of work remains \u2014 including landing funding and figuring out a business plan. But the addition of Mr. Bengio is a sign that the start-up needs to be taken seriously.Mr. Bengio, in an interview, said he was joining the start-up partly because Botler AI\u2019s technology fits neatly with research underway at his A.I. institute. What\u2019s more, he added, the company\u2019s work around immigration could \u201chelp a lot of people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Yoshua Bengio\u2019s title at Botler AI.

That has often led to claims by tech executives that the region has an anti-American bias, accusations that European policy makers deny.Facebook, experts say, is only the latest in a long line of Silicon Valley companies to face European regulatory anger, though this time, the focus is likely to be on the reams of online data gathered, including information that Facebook collects on both its users and nonusers through third-party websites.While Facebook started in the United States and has expanded aggressively across the developing world, its actions in Europe \u2014 and the response to those acts by local officials \u2014 are likely to have implications on its global operations.The company\u2019s international headquarters are in Dublin. Though that is mostly for tax purposes, it gives European data protection and antitrust officials wide scope to monitor and police Facebook activities involving its more than 1.5 billion users outside North America.In the past, for instance, Facebook has been forced to alter its privacy settings for all of its users worldwide after European privacy campaigners brought legal challenges to how the social network collected and used people\u2019s data.The changes come as policy makers worldwide vie for influence over how people use digital services, including potentially putting limits on how companies like Facebook operate so as to exert some control over the internet.\u201cIt was inevitable that there would be this type of struggle,\u201d Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, said in an interview last year. \u201cThe internet is not used to national borders.\u201dAfter Facebook announced last year that it would use WhatsApp data to bolster its wider advertising business, American privacy campaigners filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, putting forward similar arguments to those made against the partnership in Europe.\u201cU.S. antitrust law has failed to keep up with the digital economy and the emergence of monopoly services,\u201d Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said in an email. \u201cThere is far too much \u2018lock in\u2019 with a dominant provider, and far too much consolidation of personal data.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And consumers often have an incentive to switch between competing services, based on convenience and price.Not only are these titans vulnerable to regular existential threats (recall Microsoft\u2019s unbreakable hegemony over PC software that didn\u2019t translate to mobile computing), they are also all converging \u2014 therefore competing \u2014 with one another.It is easy to see how commentators get worked up about Facebook, given it controls several large, overlapping networks including WhatsApp and Instagram. But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that \u201csleep\u201d is his company\u2019s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet \u2014 not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players \u2014 prevent Netflix from running away with the market.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth \u2014 it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google\u2019s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search\u2019s centrality to the web\u2019s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power \u2014 especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.However, as consumers continue to migrate to mobile, neutrality matters less. Mobile carriers already use \u201czero rating\u201d (whereby certain services don\u2019t count toward data caps) to advantage their own content (or that of their partners). And unlike in fixed broadband, consumers are afforded some protection by the real choice they have in mobile carriers.Plainly there is no cause to be Pollyannaish. It\u2019s sensible to be wary of acquisitions and potential overreach. And there may be specific cases that cross the line and should be reined in. Over all though, the kind of competition we see among Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft tends to sort things out naturally and brutally.The only surefire winner from this battle is the consumer.Jeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital and an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He has an interest (directly or indirectly) in a large number of tech companies \u2014 including several firms to which he refers, and those that both partner with and compete against them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byTech FixRansomware, which is often transmitted by email or web pop-ups, involves locking up people\u2019s data and threatening to destroy it if a ransom is not paid. The global cyberattack has affected 200,000 Windows computers in more than 150 countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Germany and Britain.\u201cNot only individuals, but even governments and big companies with so much to lose fail to secure their systems and train their employees about necessary security practices,\u201d said Marty P. Kamden, a marketing executive for the private network service provider NordVPN. \u201cCautious online behavior would probably have prevented the malware from infecting the network in the first place.\u201dWhat can businesses and individuals do to protect themselves from ransomware? Here are some tips from security experts.Security experts believe the malware that spurred this global attack, called WannaCry, may have initially infected machines by getting people to download it through email. After that, the malicious code was able to easily travel to a broader network of computers that were linked together through the Windows file-sharing system. (Users of Macs or other non-Windows computers were not affected.)The most disheartening revelation from the cyberattack was that there was a fix available for the ransomware before the attack. Microsoft, which makes Windows, released a patch for the WannaCry vulnerability eight weeks ago, said Chris Wysopal, the chief technology officer of Veracode, an application security company.In other words, if people had simply stayed on top of security updates, their machines would not have been infected. \u201cPeople kind of got complacent and not vigilant about updating their machines,\u201d Mr. Wysopal said.Consumers can remedy this by configuring their Windows machines to automatically install the latest software updates.Even though WannaCry specifically targeted Windows machines, that does not mean Mac or Linux users are off the hook in the future. Other breeds of malware may infect various operating systems, so no matter which device you are using, you should regularly update your software to install the latest security enhancements.A new strain of ransomware spread rapidly around the world on Friday.In addition to keeping Windows up-to-date with the latest security enhancements, antivirus software can prevent malware from infecting your computer. Mr. Kamden of NordVPN said 30 percent of popular antivirus systems were capable of detecting and neutralizing the ransomware.Of course, with antivirus software, the same principle applies: Make sure to keep the antivirus app up-to-date, too, so it blocks the latest emerging malware. Also, download antivirus apps only from reputable vendors like Kaspersky Lab, Bitdefender or Malwarebytes, Mr. Kamden said.Security experts believe WannaCry may have initially infected machines via email attachments. The lesson: Avoid clicking links inside dubious emails, Mr. Kamden said.How do you spot a fishy email? Look carefully at the email address of the sender to see if it is coming from a legitimate address. Also, look for obvious typos and grammatical errors in the body. Hover over hyperlinks (without clicking on them) inside emails to see whether they direct you to suspicious web pages. If an email appears to have come from your bank, credit card company or internet service provider, keep in mind that they will never ask for sensitive information like your password or social security number.In addition, ransomware developers often use pop-up windows that advertise software products that remove malware. Do not click on anything through these pop-ups, then safely close the windows.In the event that a hacker successfully hijacks your computer, you could rescue yourself with a backup of your data stored somewhere, like on a physical hard drive. That way, if a hacker locked down your computer, you could simply erase all the data from the machine and restore it from the backup.For larger businesses with hundreds or thousands of employees, applying security updates organizationwide can be difficult. If one employee\u2019s machine lacks the latest security software, it can infect other machines across the company network.Mr. Wysopal said businesses could learn from how WannaCry spread through the Windows file-sharing system by developing a strict schedule for when computers companywide should automatically install the latest software updates. Businesses should determine the best time to apply these security updates to office computers without interrupting productivity, he added.If you are already a victim of ransomware, the first thing to do is disconnect your computer from the internet so it does not infect other machines. Then report the crime to law enforcement and seek help from a technology professional who specializes in data recovery to see what your options might be. If there are none, don\u2019t lose hope: There may be new security tools to unlock your files in the future.In some extreme cases, it might make sense to pay a ransom if you have no backups and the encrypted files are valuable, Mr. Wysopal said. But he added that with WannaCry, people definitely should not pay the ransom. That\u2019s because the hackers are apparently overloaded with requests from victims asking for their data to be released \u2014 and many who have paid the ransom are not hearing back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGreat things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The World Is Getting Hacked. Why Don\u2019t We Do More to Stop It?", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byThe path to a global outbreak on Friday of a ransom-demanding computer software (\u201cransomware\u201d) that crippled hospitals in Britain \u2014 forcing the rerouting of ambulances, delays in surgeries and the shutdown of diagnostic equipment \u2014 started, as it often does, with a defect in software, a bug. This is perhaps the first salvo of a global crisis that has been brewing for decades. Fixing this is possible, but it will be expensive and require a complete overhaul of how technology companies, governments and institutions operate and handle software. The alternative should be unthinkable.Just this March, Microsoft released a patch to fix vulnerabilities in its operating systems, which run on about 80 percent of desktop computers globally. Shortly after that, a group called \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d released hacking tools that took advantage of vulnerabilities that had already been fixed in these patches.It seemed that Shadow Brokers had acquired tools the National Security Agency had used to break into computers. Realizing these tools were stolen, the N.S.A. had warned affected companies like Microsoft and Cisco so they could fix the vulnerabilities. Users were protected if they had applied the patches that were released, but with a catch: If an institution still used an older Microsoft operating system, it did not receive this patch unless it paid for an expensive \u201ccustom\u201d support agreement.The cash-strapped National Health Service in Britain, which provides health care to more than 50 million people, and whose hospitals still use Windows XP widely, was not among those that signed up to purchase the custom support from Microsoft.They were out in the cold.On May 12, a massive \u201cransomware\u201d attack using one of those vulnerabilities hit hospitals in Britain, telecommunication companies in Spain, FedEx in the United States, the Russian Interior Ministry and many other institutions around the world. They had either not applied these patches to systems where it was available for free, or had not paid the extra money for older ones.Computer after computer froze, their files inaccessible, with an ominous onscreen message asking for about $300 worth of \u201cbitcoin\u201d \u2014 a cryptocurrency that allows for hard-to-trace transfers of money. Ambulances headed for children\u2019s hospitals were diverted. Doctors were unable to check on patients\u2019 allergies or see what drugs they were taking. Labs, X-rays and diagnostic machinery and information became inaccessible. Surgeries were postponed. There was economic damage, too. Renault, the European automaker, had to halt production.The attack was halted by a stroke of luck: the ransomware had a kill switch that a British employee in a cybersecurity firm managed to activate. Shortly after, Microsoft finally released for free the patch that they had been withholding from users that had not signed up for expensive custom support agreements.But the crisis is far from over. This particular vulnerability still lives in unpatched systems, and the next one may not have a convenient kill switch.This isn\u2019t all Microsoft\u2019s fault though. Its newer operating systems, like Windows 10, are much more secure. There are many more players and dimensions to this ticking bomb.During this latest ransomware crisis, it became clear there were many institutions that could have patched or upgraded their systems, but they had not. This isn\u2019t just because their information technology departments are incompetent (though there are surely cases of that, too). Upgrades come with many downsides that make people reluctant to install them.For example, the more secure Windows 10 comes with so many privacy concerns that the Electronic Frontier Foundation issued numerous alerts about it, and the European Union is still investigating it. My current Windows 10 machine is more secure but it advertises to me in the login screen. (Are they also profiling me to target advertisements? A fair question in this environment.)Further, upgrades almost always bring unwanted features. When I was finally forced to upgrade my Outlook mail program, it took me months to get used to the new color scheme and spacing somebody in Seattle had decided was the new look. There was no option to keep things as is. Users hate this, and often are rightfully reluctant to upgrade. But they are often unaware that these unwanted features come bundled with a security update.As an added complication, the ways companies communicate about upgrades and unilaterally change the user interface make people vulnerable to phishing, since one is never sure what is a real login or upgrade message and what is a bogus one, linking to a fake website trying to steal a login.The next crisis facing us is the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d: devices like baby monitors, refrigerators and lighting now come with networked software. Many such devices are terribly insecure and, worse, don\u2019t even have a mechanism for receiving updates. In the current regulatory environment, the people who write the insecure software and the companies who sold the \u201cthings\u201d bear no liability.If I have painted a bleak picture, it is because things are bleak. Our software evolves by layering new systems on old, and that means we have constructed entire cities upon crumbling swamps. And we live on the fault lines where more earthquakes are inevitable. All the key actors have to work together, and fast.At a minimum, Microsoft clearly should have provided the critical update in March to all its users, not just those paying extra. Indeed, \u201cpay extra money to us or we will withhold critical security updates\u201d can be seen as its own form of ransomware. In its defense, Microsoft probably could point out that its operating systems have come a long way in security since Windows XP, and it has spent a lot of money updating old software, even above industry norms. However, industry norms are lousy to horrible, and it is reasonable to expect a company with a dominant market position, that made so much money selling software that runs critical infrastructure, to do more.Microsoft should spend more of that $100 billion to help institutions and users upgrade to newer software, especially those who run essential services on it. This has to be through a system that incentivizes institutions and people to upgrade to more secure systems and does not force choosing between privacy and security. Security updates should only update security, and everything else should be optional and unbundled.The United States government has resources and institutions to help fix this. N.S.A.\u2019s charter gives it a dual role: both offensive and defensive. That the agency discloses software vulnerabilities it finds to companies more quickly may be a good idea, but doing so doesn\u2019t solve this problem, since finding bugs is not limited to the N.S.A. \u2014 criminals and other nations can keep finding them. Nor are bugs in limited supply, so we cannot get to the bottom of the problem by fixing them one by one. There are, however, many technical measures that can be taken to build operating systems that are structurally less vulnerable to bugs. In other words, we can\u2019t eliminate bugs, but with careful design, we can make it so that they cannot easily wreak havoc like this. For example, Chromebooks and Apple\u2019s iOS are structurally much more secure because they were designed from the ground up with security in mind, unlike Microsoft\u2019s operating systems.It is past time that the N.S.A. shifted to a defensive posture and the United States government focused on protecting its citizens and companies from malware, hacking and ransomware \u2014 rather than focusing so much on spying. This isn\u2019t just about disclosing vulnerabilities, a hot-button topic that often distracts from deeper issues. It also means helping develop standards for higher security \u2014 something an agency devoted to finding weaknesses is very well suited to do \u2014 as well as identifying systemic cybersecurity risks and then helping fix them, rather than using them offensively, to spy on others.There is also the thorny problem of finding money and resources to upgrade critical infrastructure without crippling it. Many institutions see information technology as an afterthought and are slow in upgrading and investing. Governments also do not prioritize software security. This is a sure road to disaster.As a reminder of what is at stake, ambulances carrying sick children were diverted and heart patients turned away from surgery in Britain by the ransomware attack. Those hospitals may never get their data back. The last big worm like this, Conficker, infected millions of computers in almost 200 countries in 2008. We are much more dependent on software for critical functions today, and there is no guarantee there will be a kill switch next time.It is time to consider whether the current regulatory setup, which allows all software vendors to externalize the costs of all defects and problems to their customers with zero liability, needs re-examination. It is also past time for the very profitable software industry, the institutions that depend on their products and the government agencies entrusted with keeping their citizens secure and their infrastructure functioning, step up and act decisively.Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cTwitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Frightful Five: They\u2019ve Got Us", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtA few weeks ago, I bought a new television. When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.The Big Five tech companies increasingly dominate our lives. Could you ditch them?When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.It\u2019s when I imagine getting down to the last two that life becomes something else. It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five. Or, more likely, it already is. It\u2019s too late to escape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Game Raised $148 Million From Fans. Now It\u2019s Raising Concerns.", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byMark Kearns, 38, a web designer and gamer from Chicago, stumbled upon a new video game called Star Citizen while online in late 2013. The game, which was in development, promised to revive the spaceflight simulation genre with a sprawling universe for players to explore.Intrigued, Mr. Kearns decided to pledge money to see the game come to fruition. In total, he donated $175, which gained him access to Star Citizen\u2019s alpha version \u2014 a playable version of the game in its early stages \u2014 plus a virtual ship to use in the game.\u201cMy expectation was that we\u2019d raise around $4 million,\u201d said Chris Roberts, 48, the founder of Cloud Imperium Games. \u201cI had investors lined up to help with the rest but Sandy, my wife, told me not to worry about investors \u2014 that we\u2019d make it to $20 million. I told her she was crazy, and then it kind of went from there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already building the best game I can,\u201d said Mr. Roberts, who acknowledged the bumps. \u201cBut imagine \u2014 the game I can build with $140 million is going to be very different to the one I could build with $10 million. If I can build a bigger and more robust experience, I will.\u201dStar Citizen\u2019s tale highlights the promise and perils of crowdfunded video games, which have become increasingly popular in recent years. Creators have flocked to crowdfunding to make niche games for specific audiences of passionate fans and to interact with gamers earlier in development. Crowdfunding has helped spawn a revival of classic role-playing games like Baldur\u2019s Gate and Divinity, which were popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s.According to Eedar, a video game market research company owned by the NPD Group, about 30,000 successfully funded video game projects were on Kickstarter as of February, and more than $593 million had been pledged to them.Yet several prominent crowdfunded video games have failed to live up to expectations. Mighty No. 9, a game pitched by the developer Keiji Inafune as a \u201cspiritual successor\u201d to the classic Mega Man action series, raised $4 million, but was delayed several times before being released in 2016 to lukewarm reviews. In 2014, a first-person sword-fighting game called Clang that had raised $500,000 in crowdfunding was canceled when the developer failed to secure additional funding.\u201cCrowdfunding projects, even those from established developers, are not seen by consumers as a sure bet as they were five years ago,\u201d said Patrick Walker, vice president for insights and analytics at Eedar.Still, for players, giving money to help develop a video game like Star Citizen offers a way into exclusive content \u2014 as well as something more emotional.\u201cInvesting in Star Citizen gives you the tantalizing pleasure of looking forward to a deferred enjoyment, a slow, continuous build that stretches out the anticipation and taps into the power of our imagination to fill out the details of its imaginary world,\u201d said Frank Lantz, director of the New York University Game Center.Cloud Imperium Games was founded in 2011 by Mr. Roberts, who has a long history in the video game business. He started making games as a teenager in England, and later gained renown with the Texas-based video game company Origin Systems, where he made the game Wing Commander. Released in 1990, the sci-fi spaceflight simulation game was a critical and commercial success and produced several sequels.\u201cI wanted to do the same thing, without having to deal with a big video game publisher,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cStar Citizen certainly doesn\u2019t fit the blockbuster video game mold. I love the idea that people can support a game that wouldn\u2019t probably be made by a big studio.\u201dStar Citizen began with a dual crowdfunding effort on its website, plus a Kickstarter campaign in 2012 to increase interest in the project. The Kickstarter campaign ended with just over $2 million raised. From then on, Cloud Imperium Games relied on donations through the Star Citizen site.The minimum donation to support the game was $5, but players couldn\u2019t get a ship to play in the game until they had given at least $30. The highest donation amount was $10,000. Cloud Imperium Games said many people contacted the studio to ask about giving even larger amounts.By the end of 2013, Star Citizen had raised $35.5 million. At the end of 2015, the amount stood at $104.4 million.The success of the crowdfunding campaign allowed Mr. Roberts to hire developers worldwide. Cloud Imperium Games has now opened four studios: in Los Angeles; Austin, Tex.; Manchester, England; and Frankfurt. It has hired more than 400 people.For Matthew Slattery, 18, a Star Citizen backer from South Australia, the idea of being able to play the game while it was still in development was a big draw. He has pledged about $100 to date.\u201cGetting to learn the process of game development, communicate with the developers and ask questions directly to the best in the field is a very rare opportunity,\u201d Mr. Slattery said.Clifford Zernicek, a 36-year-old designer from Houston, has pledged more than $15,000 to Star Citizen. He said he liked that the development of the game \u201cisn\u2019t behind closed doors, like normal publishers.\u201dFor now, both donors are willing to wait for Star Citizen \u2014 even though its initial release of 2014 was pushed back to 2016, and has been pushed back again. It now has no set release date.Even so, gamers know Mr. Roberts is adding more features to the game. Mr. Roberts said he was investing in film-level graphics for Star Citizen, as well as building an ever-increasing universe with multiple solar systems and planets for players to explore \u2014 all rendered in elaborate detail.\u201cOf course I have reservations about whether or not Cloud Imperium Games can meet their goals,\u201d said Mr. Kearns, the web designer in Chicago. But he added that \u201cafter a few updates and patches, I considered my pledge money well spent and anything else that came from the game was a bonus.\"Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Computer Attacks, Clues Point to Frequent Culprit: North Korea", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Intelligence officials and private security experts say that new digital clues point to North Korean-linked hackers as likely suspects in the sweeping ransomware attacks that have crippled computer systems around the world.The indicators are far from conclusive, the researchers warned, and it could be weeks, if not months, before investigators are confident enough in their findings to officially point the finger at Pyongyang\u2019s increasingly bold corps of digital hackers. The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month.Security experts at Symantec, which in the past has accurately identified attacks mounted by the United States, Israel and North Korea, found early versions of the ransomware, called WannaCry, that used tools that were also deployed against Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Bangladesh central bank last year and Polish banks in February. American officials said Monday that they had seen the same similarities.All of those attacks were ultimately linked to North Korea; President Barack Obama formally charged the North in late 2014 with destroying computers at Sony in retaliation for a comedy, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d that envisioned a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader.The computer code used in the ransomware bore some striking similarities to the code used in those three attacks. That code has not been widely used, and has been seen only in attacks by North Korean-linked hackers. Researchers at Google and Kaspersky, a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, confirmed the coding similarities.Those clues alone are not definitive, however. Hackers often borrow and retrofit one another\u2019s attack methods, and government agencies are known to plant \u201cfalse flags\u201d in their code to throw off forensic investigators.\u201cAt this time, all we have is a temporal link,\u201d said Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec who was among the first to identify the Stuxnet worm, the American- and Israeli-led attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and North Korea\u2019s effort to steal millions from the Bangladeshi bank. \u201cWe want to see more coding similarities,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cto give us more confidence.\u2019\u2019The new leads about the source of the attacks came as technology executives raised an alarm about another feature of the attacks: They were based on vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems that were found by the N.S.A. and apparently stolen from it.Over the past few months, it has become clear that the intelligence community\u2019s version of Tomahawks \u2014 the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d the N.S.A. and C.I.A. have spent billions of dollars to develop to break into foreign computers and foil Iranian nuclear programs or North Korean missiles \u2014 are being turned against everyday computer users around the world.\u201cWe have seen vulnerabilities stored by the C.I.A. show up on WikiLeaks,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote, \u201cand now this vulnerability stolen from the N.S.A. has affected customers around the world.\u201dThe N.S.A.\u2019s tools were published last month by a hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which enabled hackers to bake them into their ransomware, which then spread rapidly through unpatched Microsoft computers, locking up everything in its wake.There is no evidence that the North Koreans were involved in the actual theft of the N.S.A. hacking tools. There are many theories, but the favorite hypothesis among intelligence officials is that an insider, probably a contractor, stole the information, much as Edward J. Snowden lifted a different trove of information from the N.S.A. four years ago.But hackers quickly seized on the published vulnerabilities to wreak havoc on computer systems that were not \u201cpatched\u201d in recent months, after the N.S.A. quietly told Microsoft about the flaw in their systems. The damage wreaked in recent days could well escalate into the billions of dollars, security experts say, particularly now that any criminal, terrorist or nation state has the ability to tease the tools apart and retrofit them into their own hacking tools.Not surprisingly, government officials say it is not entirely their fault. They will not confirm or deny what Mr. Smith says outright: That these \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d come out of America\u2019s growing cyberarsenal. At a news conference at the White House on Monday, Thomas Bossert, President Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, told reporters, \u201cThis was not an exploit developed by the N.S.A. to hold organizations ransom,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a vulnerability exploit that was part of a much larger tool put together by the culpable parties.\u201d\u201cThe provenance of the underlying vulnerability is not of as much concern to me,\u201d Mr. Bossert said, stepping around the delicate question of the N.S.A.\u2019s role.The weapons used in the attacks that started Friday, government officials insist, were cobbled together from many sources. And the fault, they argue, lies with whoever turned them into weapons \u2014 or maybe with Microsoft itself, for not having a system in place to make sure that when they issue a patch that neutralizes such attacks, everyone around the world takes the time to fix their systems. Or with the victims, who failed to run their security updates made available two months ago, or who continue to use so-called \u201clegacy\u201d software that Microsoft no longer supports.When asked about the source of the attack, Mr. Bossert said on Monday, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d He told reporters at the White House. \u201cAttribution can be difficult. I don\u2019t want to say we have no clues. But I stand assured that the best and brightest are working on this hack.\u201dAs Mr. Bossert was speaking to reporters, yet another N.S.A. hacking tool, very similar to the one used in the weekend\u2019s ransomware attacks, was being retrofitted by cybercriminals and put up for sale on the underground dark web. In private hacking forums, cybercriminals were discussing how to develop more than a dozen other N.S.A. hacking tools for criminal use.Another round of attacks using the N.S.A. tools could well affect another big issue that the Obama administration debated and never resolved when it left office: whether the government can demand that all companies assure that investigators can \u201cunlock\u201d encrypted communications. Before he was fired last week, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, often complained that the government was \u201cgoing dark,\u201d and that intelligence agencies and local police departments needed a way to crack the encrypted mobile conversations of terrorists or kidnappers.But the N.S.A.\u2019s loss of its own hacking tools has undercut that argument, executives say. If the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. cannot keep their hacking tools locked up, companies like Apple are asking, why should Americans trust them with the keys to unlock every private communication and bank transfer? Won\u2019t those leak, too, meaning that hackers, blackmailers and thieves will all have access to everyone\u2019s private email, health records and financial transactions?Nine years ago, the White House created a process for deciding what unpatched holes to disclose to manufacturers like Microsoft and its competitors, and which to keep in its arsenal.That process was refined by Mr. Obama and in 2015, Adm. Michael Rogers, the director of the NSA, said the agency had shared 91 percent of the zero-days it had discovered that year. A zero-day is a previously undisclosed flaw that leaves computer users with zero days to fix the vulnerability.But Michael Daniel, the White House cybercoordinator in the Obama administration, noted, \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a good rating system for vulnerabilities in terms of their severity. Not all zero-days are created equal,\u201d he said.The N.S.A.\u2019s wormlike tool was leaked online by the Shadow Brokers last month.\u201cWhat happened with the Shadow Brokers in this case is equivalent to a nuclear bomb in cyberspace,\u201d said Zohar Pinhasi, a former cybersecurity intelligence officer for the Israeli military, now the chief executive of MonsterCloud, which helps mitigate ransomware attacks. \u201cThis is what happens when you give a tiny little criminal a weapon of mass destruction. This will only go bigger. It\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about hints that hackers linked to North Korea may have been involved in recent ransomware attacks misspelled the given name of the country\u2019s leader in some copies. He is Kim Jong-un, not Kim Jung-un.Nicole Perlroth reported from San Francisco, and David E. Sanger from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Is Reluctant to Blame North Korea, Its Ally, for Cyberattack", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 North Korea tests nuclear weapons less than 100 miles from China\u2019s border. It launched a missile hours before a major speech by President Xi Jinping of China on Sunday, a move Chinese analysts called a diplomatic slap in the face. Its counterfeiting of Chinese and American currency costs China millions of dollars a year.North Korea\u2019s history of erratic behavior has embarrassed China in many ways. But through it all, China has remained stoic about its neighbor and ally.As evidence mounts that North Korea may have links to a ransomware attack that destroyed more than 200,000 computers globally \u2014 and hit 40,000 institutions in China \u2014 China\u2019s response has been muted. Which raises the question: How far can North Korea go without getting disciplined by its more powerful neighbor?China has been one of the biggest victims of the attack, which crippled computers at universities, major businesses and local governments, adding a potentially dangerous new element to a relationship that has increasingly tested Chinese leaders.\u201cNorth Korea has been a constant threat in terms of missiles and nuclear weapons,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cAll of a sudden, it poses a cyber threat.\u201dHe added: \u201cThis time if it\u2019s from North Korea, the malware was targeted indiscriminately against all computers. That\u2019s a big change. It harms and threatens China.\u201dEven though the timing of the launch suggested it was a deliberate ploy to embarrass Mr. Xi at an inopportune time, it was not reported in the Chinese state media.Regarding the ransomware attack, China analysts say Beijing will hesitate before directly casting blame on North Korea even if evidence, still inconclusive, directly ties the North to the attack. Beijing is more likely to single out other actors, particularly the United States, experts say.The attack took advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows software through a tool stolen from the United States\u2019 National Security Agency. That plays into broader Chinese concerns about its overreliance on American software.China\u2019s influence over North Korea\u2019s hacking efforts has been significant. By some accounts, the idea to experiment with cyberattacks came to North Korea from China.Initially, the North Korean government viewed the internet as a threat. But in the early 1990s, a group of computer experts returned from China with the idea of using the web to take secrets and attack government enemies, according to one defector.Security analysts say North Korean hackers operate out of hotels, restaurants and internet cafes in northeastern Chinese cities like Shenyang and Dandong, which are outposts for trade with North Korea. Though many still operate in China, North Korean hackers have increasingly moved further afield, to countries in Southeast Asia, where government surveillance and control is less strict.The moves are also intended to protect cyberattack options in the event of a war on the Korean Peninsula. Security analysts say some attacks are also carried out from North Korea, but are limited by the fact that the country has only one main portal to the internet, through China\u2019s state telecom operator China Unicom.Despite evidence suggesting a North Korean role in the ransomware attack, the most common reaction among experts and on Chinese social media was to blame the United States.\u201cMany criticized the U.S. government, saying that it was responsible for this spread of ransomware. Obviously this accusation is reasonable,\u201d the editor in chief of state-run Global Times wrote in a prominent commentary on Monday.\u201cAttacks always happen,\u201d said Chen Zhong, a professor in computer science at Peking University. \u201cWhat catches our eyes this time is that the attack used a tool that leaked from the N.S.A.,\u201d he said.On the social media site Weibo, users almost uniformly blamed the United States for the attack.\u201cHell, if North Korea could do this they would have showed it off long ago,\u201d said one user. \u201cNorth Korea would have become a major power if they can pull this off,\u201d said another.But Mr. Cheng of Renmin University said that if events more definitively linked the attack to North Korea, it was likely to pose a new test to China\u2019s increasingly rocky relationship with Pyongyang.\u201cSince North Korea started its nuclear program in 2006, China-North Korea relations have gradually deteriorated, and are currently at an abnormal level. If we add another virus, the image of North Korea in the eyes of China will be even worse.\u201dChina\u2019s news organizations, both state-run and private, reported on the hacking attacks, as well as the possible links to North Korea, hours after it occurred, but they did so in a controlled fashion that was confined to inside pages of newspapers, and played in modest ways on websites.Still, several news portals wrote that cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky Lab had found initial evidence that pointed to North Korea. The news portal Sina pointed to previous attacks \u2013 in Bangladesh, against Sony and the South Korean subway \u2013 that may have originated from the North.Should the evidence against North Korea mount, it would add to other indignities China has suffered at the hands of its neighbor.Over the years, North Korea has flooded northeastern China with counterfeit $100 bills of American currency. It has also mass manufactured counterfeit Chinese renminbi, but China says little about the problem.This year, South Korea accused the North of assassinating the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The relative, Kim Jong-nam, was considered a friend of China and he had lived in the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau, where he was protected by state security.Chinese state-run media reported on the killing but refrained from associating Mr. Kim, the half brother, with China.South Korean intelligence said the killing of the uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was ordered by Mr. Kim as he was consolidating power over North Korea. His death meant that China lost its most important interlocutor with the North, and was an early signal from Mr. Kim that under his rule relations between China and North Korea would not be business as usual. But China withstood the insult without public recrimination.Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Jane Perlez reported from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Little-Known Accounting Change Could Have a Big Impact", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneA tsunami of change is coming to the regulations that govern corporate America, if President Trump and Republicans in Congress get their way.But there is also a little-noticed change coming down the pike that will have a major impact on business. And this one has corporate executives up in arms \u2014 and scrambling to comply.It\u2019s a new accounting rule promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, known as FASB. The rule, with the blandly mellifluous title \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2013Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d or Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, will change the way companies, both big and small, account for their equity investments in other companies, specifically for those stakes smaller than 20 percent.Like much of what the accounting standards board tries to do, the new rule is intended to provide investors and creditors with better information and more clarity around a company\u2019s financial statements, with the lofty goal of helping them make more informed decisions when providing capital to a company or business.But Update 2016-01 could significantly affect \u2014 and distort \u2014 the way companies like Alphabet, Intel, IBM and Salesforce.com, which make a lot of small investments in other companies, report their earnings. It could also curtail such investments from being made in the first place, because some businesses say the costs of complying with the rule are too high.Here\u2019s how things would change with the new rule: Now, when a company buys a stake of less than 20 percent in another company, it usually accounts for the investment on its balance sheet at cost \u2014 the price it paid for it. Over time, under the old rules, if the value of the investment goes down, the rules required a corresponding write-down of the value, both through the company\u2019s income statement and on its balance sheet. But if the value increases over time, the investment can still be kept at cost.While investors were fully informed when an investment lost value, there was less transparency for them when an investment increased in value. What investors lost in transparency on the upside, it has been argued, was gained in not requiring corporate executives to place a number on these often difficult-to-value investments every quarter.That\u2019s what is going to change after Dec. 15. From then on, each minority investment a public company makes will have to be valued quarterly, whether that value has increased or decreased. That potential volatility will soon be required to flow through a company\u2019s income statement, with the possibility of causing fluctuations to earnings per share from something that is not even a core business.Corporate executives will have two choices on how to go about valuing these investments.They can either spend the time valuing these investments themselves (or hire an accounting firm or a valuation firm like Duff & Phelps), or they can choose to wait until there is a market-driven valuation event and then mark up the value of the investment accordingly. How a company chooses to value these investments \u2014 whether every quarter or when there is a market event \u2014 has to be selected soon, and then cannot be changed. This, too, has added to the corporate executives\u2019 concerns.Take, for example, investments that have been made over the years in Uber, which now has a valuation of around $70 billion. In 2013, Google Ventures, now part of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, invested $258 million in Uber at a post-money valuation of $3.76 billion. Four years later, that investment is now worth around $4.8 billion.That\u2019s a nice return on investment, although it has nothing to do with Google\u2019s core business. At the moment, the word \u201cUber\u201d does not appear in Alphabet\u2019s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Alphabet\u2019s latest quarterly filing, it explains that all of its minority investments in private companies have a so-called carrying value of $1.7 billion, which presumably includes its investment in Uber at the cost of $258 million.Under the new rules, Alphabet will basically have to value its Uber investment at market, or closer to the $4.8 billion (either because of its own valuation or based on the recent new investments in the company). That increase in the value of Google\u2019s investment in Uber, around $4.5 billion, would have to flow through Alphabet\u2019s income statement. Considering that in the first quarter of 2017 Alphabet had net income of $5.4 billion, adding in the Uber gain of around $4.5 billion could have quite the distorting effect. It could have a similar effect on the downside if in subsequent quarters Uber\u2019s valuation takes a hit.The whole matter could be further complicated if Alphabet chooses to take one approach to how it values Uber and, say, Microsoft, another small Uber investor, takes a different one. It will soon be possible for Alphabet to value its stake in Uber using a different methodology than Microsoft does for the exact same investment.Or take Google\u2019s 2014 investment in Cloudera, a chip manufacturer, at a $1.8 billion valuation. Then, Intel invested at a $4.1 billion valuation \u2014 big gain. But Cloudera went public at a $2 billion valuation \u2014 big loss.But the new rule also has the potential to confuse investors about the value of these equity stakes, too. It would force corporate executives to remind listeners on every quarterly conference call that the fluctuations in the value of these investments have nothing to do with their core business and should be ignored, and that something like \u201cadjusted net income\u201d without these fluctuations is the way to look at their earnings. Even Ernst & Young, the big accounting firm, acknowledges that putting the new rule into effect could be a tough slog for many companies.Sounds to me like the new rule will have the unintended consequence of muddling the presentation of financial statements, not clarifying them. And since this really was not broken in the first place, why go to the trouble of fixing it?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Echo Speakers, Amazon Lets You Ask Alexa to Phone Mom", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byNow Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers \u2014 and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them.On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a seven-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices.The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Apple\u2019s FaceTime and Google\u2019s Hangouts, underline the company\u2019s ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone.The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people\u2019s homes \u2014 a system that can help you shop online, control your home\u2019s temperature and, now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker.\u201cAmazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,\u201d said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm.Amazon said it planned to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360.According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year.Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be compelled to go and interact with the screen \u2014 you should be able to do it with your voice,\u201d Mr. Limp said in a product briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from traditional computing as we\u2019ve known it for the last three decades.\u201dYet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address.The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them.\u201cI think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies.The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Mr. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability.Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Ms. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling.\u201cWe\u2019re so used to using our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cFinding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we\u2019re engaged with.\u201dBrian X.

{"Headline": "U.K. Health Service Ignored Warnings for Months", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s National Health Service ignored numerous warnings over the last year that many of its computer systems were outdated and unprotected from the type of devastating cyberattack it suffered on Friday.The attack caused some hospitals to stop accepting patients, doctor\u2019s offices to shut down, emergency rooms to divert patients, and critical operations to be canceled as a decentralized system struggled to cope.At some hospitals, nurses could not even print out name tags for newborn babies. At the Royal London Hospital, in east London, George Popescu, a 23-year-old hotel cook, showed up with a forehead injury. \u201cMy head is pounding and they say they can\u2019t see me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said their computers weren\u2019t working. You don\u2019t expect this in a big city like London.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, the N.H.S. said its inquiry into the attack was in its early phases but that \u201cat this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.\u201dMicrosoft discontinued the security updates for Windows XP in 2014. It made a patch, or fix, available in newer versions of Windows for the flaws that were exploited in Friday\u2019s cyberattacks. But the health service does not seem to have installed either the newer version of Windows or the patch.\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve known that N.H.S. uses computers running old versions of Windows that Microsoft itself no longer supports and says is a security risk,\u201d said Graham Cluley, a cybersecurity expert in Oxford, England. \u201cAnd even on the newest computers, they would have needed to apply the patch released in March. Clearly that did not happen, or the malware wouldn\u2019t have spread this fast.\u201dThe N.H.S., founded after World War II, employs 1.6 million people with a combined budget of \u00a3140 billion, making it one of the largest employers in the world.But its budget is always under pressure and the Conservatives, while increasing funding, have been sharply criticized by opposition parties for not devoting enough resources for new, more expensive treatments and to cope with an aging population.As the attack unfolded on Friday, N.H.S. officials struggled to get a handle on the problem, but urged patients who had emergencies to go to hospitals or seek care as they normally would.At St. Bartholomew\u2019s, a sprawling hospital in London\u2019s financial center, nonessential appointments and surgeries were canceled. Some ambulances were diverted to other hospitals.One surgical resident, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to journalists, said he was in the middle of a heart operation around lunchtime when several computers suddenly flickered off, although monitoring equipment remained operational. He said his group was able to safely perform surgery.He said the hospital had canceled any noncritical operations because of the difficulty of getting into patient medical records, but that patient safety was not at risk.Esther Rainbow, a manager of cardiac services at the Barts unit of the N.H.S. in London, said in an interview that in coping with the attack, the hospitals had to use older systems involving patient notes on paper. \u201cPretty much everything now is electronic,\u201d she said. \u201cEach patient has a folder of notes, but we\u2019re doing that less and less. So had to revert back to the older paper note system.\u201dPrescriptions for pharmacies, which are normally ordered online, had to be written on paper, too, she said.The hospitals also struggled with some heart scanning machines that feed into the computer network, and had to shut those down, she said.\u201cFor us the main issue has been getting information,\u201d she said. \u201cAt Barts, we were told not to use our work mobiles and to turn off all Wi-Fi. Later in the day we were told to unplug everything from the network. The main impact in terms of the diagnostics was that we had no idea who was turning up and which patient was seeing which unit.\u201d\u201cAs the day went on it felt a little bit more scary,\u201d Ms. Rainbow added, \u201cas we were told to shut things down and unplug things. We also don\u2019t know what other patients are due to come in. There may be a knock-on effect for Monday and Tuesday.\u201dHe cites a report that 1 in 3 N.H.S. trusts \u2014 the entities that focus on geographic areas or specialties like mental health or ambulance services \u2014 reported a ransomware attack in 2016.Reuters reported that N.H.S. employees were warned about the ransomware threat earlier on Friday.Dr. Emma Fardon, a doctor in Dundee, told the BBC that she came back from house visits around 1 p.m. \u201cto find all our computers hit by the virus,\u201d and so was unable to access patient records or issue prescriptions.\u201cEverything is fully computerized,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can\u2019t access the appointments system. We\u2019ve had to try and phone as many people to rearrange their appointments to next week.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to accommodate who we can. We are still seeing people who really need it.\u201dCamilla Schick and Prashant S. Rao contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ubben has long been a different kind of activist investor. Mr. Ubben, a founder of ValueAct Capital, largely avoids the limelight and mostly works with companies behind the scenes to improve performance, often focusing heavily on corporate governance.Now Mr. Ubben is practicing what he preaches by putting into effect his own orderly succession.In passing control of the firm\u2019s $16 billion portfolio to his longtime deputy, Mason Morfit, Mr. Ubben is promoting a degree of continuity that is rare in the hedge fund world. Mr. Morfit was one of his first hires after ValueAct\u2019s founding in 2000, and he has played a major role in some of its most prominent investments, including holding board seats at Microsoft and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.Having learned the ropes over nearly two decades, Mr. Morfit is positioned to continue the kind of constructive activism that has produced annualized returns of 15 percent a year. Mr. Ubben will remain chief executive, where one main challenge will be to support his new chief investment officer without stepping on his toes.Mr. Morfit has his work cut out for him. Despite rising equity markets and signs that individual stocks are once again being traded on their merits rather than en masse \u2014 an environment that stock pickers hope will favor their approach over index investments \u2014 the typical hedge fund has failed to perform remotely well enough to justify the industry\u2019s high fees. The HFR Global Hedge Fund index is up a little over 2 percent so far this year, trailing the 7 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.At a Reuters forum on activism in February, Mr. Ubben said ValueAct had been selling holdings and building a $3 billion cash position because it regarded stocks as too expensive.Other hedge funds face similar challenges, but few have handled succession as deftly as ValueAct. Ray Dalio has shaken up management at Bridgewater Associates twice in the past year, while Eric Mindich never groomed a successor at Eton Park before pulling the plug on the multistrategy firm in March, for example.Fund founders looking to preserve their legacy can learn from Mr. Ubben\u2019s example.Advertisement"}

He said the loss of the so-called malware, and the damage it has caused, \u201cposes a very serious threat to the future of the agency.\u201d\u201cTheShadowBrokers is launching new monthly subscription model,\u201d said the post, in the faux broken English that the group has repeatedly used in public statements. \u201cIs being like wine of month club. Each month peoples can be paying membership fee, then getting members only data dump each month. What members doing with data after is up to members.\u201dMichael Sulmeyer, a former top Pentagon policy official who now runs the cybersecurity program at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said the Shadow Brokers episode was a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the National Security Agency that underscored how the stakes of leaks from the agency had changed.\u201cTen years ago, the costs were fairly low for things going wrong at N.S.A.,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. Then, he said, leaks could cut off important sources of intelligence, but today the agency wields powerful malicious software. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a risk for public safety.\u201dThe agency has spent hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars to develop an arsenal of stealthy software tools to break into foreign computer networks and gather intelligence. When it lost control of those exploits, it was a less lethal version of the Air Force awakening one morning to find many fighter jets missing \u2014 and then learning that the fighters were randomly strafing cities around the globe.\u201cWe auction best files to highest bidder,\u201d the note said.The announcement created a scramble in the intelligence world to assess the damage and to find the source. There were at least three theories: that Russian hackers had somehow swiped the tools from the agency or a contractor; that N.S.A. operators had inadvertently left them unguarded on a \u201cstaging server\u201d used to conduct espionage; or that a disgruntled insider had leaked or sold the malware.The last scenario \u2014 an insider leak from among the 35,000 N.S.A. employees and thousands more contractors \u2014 is now in the lead, officials say. About the time the leak hunt began, the F.B.I. arrested Mr. Martin, a veteran intelligence contractor who had worked at the National Security Agency, including in its Tailored Access Operations unit. An N.S.A. employee was arrested in 2015 but never identified, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That employee\u2019s possible role in leaks remains unclear.Mr. Martin was not charged with sharing the tools. It is uncertain what charges have been filed against the second person.The Shadow Brokers found few bidders for their stolen wares. They offered a few more announcements, including screenshots of computer code, without stirring up sales.\u201cIs being too bad nobody deciding to be paying theshadowbrokers for just to shutup and going away,\u201d the notice said. \u201cTheShadowBrokers rather being getting drunk with McAfee,\u201d an apparent reference to the antivirus company, \u201con desert island with hot babes.\u201dWhen he saw the files, Sven Dietrich, who teaches computer security at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told his class that it was only a matter of time before the escaped N.S.A. malware began doing damage.\u201cIt\u2019s too tempting to have nation-state level exploits available for free on the web,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was a prewarning of what was to come,\u201d said Tiago Henriques, the chief executive of BinaryEdge. Using another exploit, called EternalBlue, attackers began targeting vulnerable machines with a self-replicating software \u201cworm\u201d that locked files and posted a ransom demand.Even the April release of N.S.A. exploits is not close to exhausted, according to several cyberspecialists. On the underground dark web, they said, another N.S.A. tool has been weaponized and offered for sale, and hackers are discussing how to use another dozen agency exploits.But Mr. Henriques did have a kind of compliment for the work of the National Security Agency, now under siege.\u201cThese tools were beautifully made,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to detect and easy to use. They were pretty much point and shoot. Even under the circumstances, you have to appreciate good engineering.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the connection between the ransomware attack and computers at an Army base in Arizona. One computer was communicating with the ransomware for research purposes; the attack did not lock up computers at the base.David E.

{"Headline": "A Price Amazon Is Content to Keep High: $1,000 a Share", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 On Monday, Amazon.com\u2019s share price briefly crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time in its 20-year history as a publicly traded company.Cracking the arbitrary threshold of a four-digit stock price is a reminder of just how heavy Amazon has become.It is now the fourth most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The top five, Apple, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have emerged as the dominant forces in technology. Amazon\u2019s shares are up almost 33 percent for the year and up 368 percent over five years.Crossing the $1,000 mark, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Amplify ETFs, which includes a fund that holds Amazon shares, \u201cspeaks to the triumph of e-commerce and the vision of Jeff Bezos.\u201dThe investor optimism about Amazon is, in many respects, unchanged from when it went public in 1997.Amazon remains a long-term play based on a wager that online shopping will replace a healthy chunk of traditional retail over time. Even with all of Amazon\u2019s staggering growth \u2014 $136 billion in revenue last year, compared with $148 million in 1997 \u2014 e-commerce still represents only around 10 percent of total retail spending in the United States, the company\u2019s most mature market.That leaves Amazon \u2014 which accounted for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the United States last year, according to Slice Intelligence \u2014 with a lot of room to grow. Some analysts say its gains could be especially large in the coming years as more physical retailers close stores and file for bankruptcy.\u201cFor any stock analyst trying to find growth and return on investment in the retail sector today, they\u2019re clearly putting money into Amazon because that\u2019s where they anticipate the growth coming from,\u201d said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, a retail research firm.Ty Rogers, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. The stock closed at $996.70 on Tuesday, up 0.09 percent.Amazon has also given investors reason to believe it is not content to remain simply an e-commerce giant. Through its Amazon Web Services business, it is now the largest provider of cloud computing services in the world. It stands to benefit for many years as hundreds of billions of dollars in information technology spending shifts from traditional purchases of hardware and software to effectively renting them in the data centers.Because profit margins in cloud computing are wider than those in the retail business, Amazon, which had only a passing familiarity with profits over most of its life, is now consistently in the black.After an embarrassing smartphone venture, Amazon demonstrated that it, too, could stay ahead of important changes in consumer technology with the invention of Echo, a voice-activated speaker powered by an artificially intelligent assistant called Alexa. Although the company says little about sales of the devices, other than that tens of millions have been sold, Alexa appears to be emerging as a significant new technology platform, and Amazon\u2019s strategy is being widely imitated by rivals.One of those rivals, Alphabet, is not too far behind Amazon in chasing the $1,000 a share milestone (the market capitalization of Alphabet, which is far more profitable than Amazon, is still about $200 billion higher than that of the internet retailer).The most powerful technology companies are becoming even more powerful. Of course, that is no guarantee of staying power. Apple and Microsoft, much older than Amazon, each lost its way for a time. And tech pioneers like Hewlett-Packard, which split into two companies two years ago, and IBM have struggled to adapt to technology changes.Amazon is known for being ruthlessly competitive on prices for products it sells on its website, but that does not extend to its share price. Last week at the company\u2019s annual investor meeting in Seattle, a woman who said she was a longtime Amazon shareholder beseeched Mr. Bezos to split the company\u2019s stock to help make it more accessible to less wealthy investors.Mr. Bezos said Amazon considered such possibilities from time to time but had no plans for a split.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 S\u00f6ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.Instead, he went to China.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Schwertfeger said.Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China\u2019s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.China\u2019s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu \u2014 often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition \u2014 this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.\u201cIt\u2019s a race in the new generation of computing,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe difference is that China seems to think it\u2019s a race and America doesn\u2019t.\u201dFor Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.\u201dQuantifying China\u2019s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn\u2019t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation\u2019s spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cIt\u2019s the habit that yes is more risky than no.\u201dAuthorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China\u2019s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.\u201cThe lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut it has started to change.\u201dAt the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America\u2019s research institutions.Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.It\u2019s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.Baidu is a leader in China\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary \u2014 take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is \u2014 into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.In an apparent effort to harness Baidu\u2019s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a \u201cmilitary-use intelligent ground robot,\u201d was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China\u2019s seven schools of national defense.A company spokeswoman said: \u201cBaidu develops products and services that improve people\u2019s lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.\u201dStill, there are advantages in China\u2019s developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.\u201cAfter AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,\u201d said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, \u201cthe content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.\u201d Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Mr. Shirky said, \u201cunlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that\u2019s never been Beijing\u2019s favorite characteristic.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and John Markoff from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "China, Addicted to Bootleg Software, Reels From Ransomware Attack", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byResearchers believe large numbers of computers running unlicensed versions of Windows probably contributed to the reach of the so-called ransomware attack, according to the Finnish cybersecurity company F-Secure. Because pirated software usually is not registered with the developer, users often miss major security patches that could ward off assaults.It is not clear whether every company or institution in China affected by the ransomware, which locked users out of their computers and demanded payment to allow them to return, was using pirated software. But universities, local governments and state-run companies probably have networks that depend on unlicensed copies of Windows.Zhu Huanjie, who is studying network engineering in Hangzhou, China, blamed a number of ills for the spread of the attack, including the lack of security on school networks. He said piracy was also a factor. Many users, he said, did not update their software to get the latest safety features because of a fear that their copies would be damaged or locked, while universities offered only older, pirated versions.\u201cMost of the schools are now all using pirate software, including operation system and professional software,\u201d he said. \u201cIn China, the Windows that most people are using is still pirated. This is just the way it is.\u201dOn Monday, some Chinese institutions were still cleaning computer systems jammed by the attack. Prestigious research institutions like Tsinghua University were affected, as were major companies like China Telecom and Hainan Airlines.China\u2019s securities regulator said it had taken down its network to try to protect it, and the country\u2019s banking regulator warned lenders to be cautious when dealing with the malicious software.Police stations and local security offices reported problems on social media, while university students reported being locked out of final thesis papers. Electronic payment systems at gas stations run by the state oil giant PetroChina were cut off for much of the weekend. Over all, according to the official state television broadcaster, about 40,000 institutions were hit. Separately, the Chinese security company Qihoo 360 reported that computers at more than 29,000 organizations had been infected.At China Telecom, one of the country\u2019s three main state-run telecommunications providers, a similar scramble occurred over the weekend, according to an employee who was not authorized to speak on the matter. When a company-provided software patch did not work, the employee was told to use one from Qihoo 360, which supports pirated and out-of-date versions of Windows, the person said. A spokesman for China Telecom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On Monday, the main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, quoted an unidentified person in charge of internet security saying that the ransomware was still spreading but the speed of transmission had slowed. It said that regulators overseeing banks, schools, the police and other groups had given orders to stop the risk and that it had instructed users on how to avoid exposure.Using copied software and other media has become embedded in China\u2019s computing culture, said Thomas Parenty, founder of Archefact Group, which advises companies on cybersecurity. Some people are under the impression that using pirated goods in China is legal, while others are simply not used to paying for software, he said.Mr. Parenty cited an instance when he was working at the Beijing office of an American client. \u201cIt turned out every single one of their computers, all the software, was bootlegged,\u201d he said.The twin problems of malware and the unwillingness to pay for software are so ingrained that they have led to an alternative type of security company in China. Qihoo 360 built its business by offering free security programs; it makes money from advertising.The issue has led to political battles between Microsoft and the Chinese government.In a bid to get more organizations in China to pay for their software, Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., has tried education and outreach. It has also stopped distributing Windows on discs, which are easy to copy.One effort in 2014 put it at loggerheads with Beijing.The Chinese government has been less focused on software piracy \u2014 and more on building local alternatives to Microsoft. After leaks by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about American hacking attacks aimed at monitoring China\u2019s military buildup, leaders in Beijing accelerated a push to develop Chinese-branded software and hardware that would be harder to breach.For now, however, much of China relies on Windows. And for all of the impact of the weekend\u2019s cyberattack, Mr. Parenty said he did not think that there would be a big effect on attitudes toward pirated software.\u201cThe only way I see this changing things is if the central government decides there is a risk to critical infrastructure from this threat and force people to buy legitimate software,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see that happening right now.\u201dKeith Bradsher and Sui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Beijing, and Carolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Looks to Regain Lost Ground in the Classroom", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byREDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Last week, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, slipped on a glove made of cardboard and clenched his hand into a fist, causing a robotic hand with fingers made of drinking straws to mimic his movements.The glove was one of several engineering projects built in a makeshift laboratory on Microsoft\u2019s campus. The company spent the last year talking to thousands of teachers and designing high-tech experiments that require mostly low-cost parts. It will give the designs to schools for free so teachers can use them in their lesson plans.The projects are part of a major push the company announced Tuesday at an event in New York to make its products more attractive to school administrators, students and teachers. The push includes a new version of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system for classrooms, tweaks to its Office applications and a new Surface laptop for students in a collection of bold colors.While the dollars available in the education market are compelling enough for big technology companies like Microsoft, classrooms also offer an opportunity to make a first impression on young people who could eventually buy their products.\u201cThe second-order effects of education, of being relevant in education, are going to be very, very key for us,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in an interview last week. He added, \u201cThe devices the kids take to their school, or to their college, is going to be influenced by what they were familiar with.\u201dGoogle has gained ground in public schools by offering a tightly connected system of free classroom apps, lower-cost laptops called Chromebooks and a web-based console that allows schools to remotely manage thousands of student devices.Industry analysts said Microsoft\u2019s initiative was the company\u2019s first credible response to Google\u2019s recent encroachment into education.\u201cI am not going to predict that they are going to take back the entire market or anything like that, but this is the best move that I could have seen them making against Chromebooks,\u201d said J. P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, where Microsoft is one of his clients.Some of Microsoft\u2019s moves are intended to make its products more appealing to educators by simplifying them and, in some ways, restricting them. The new version of its operating system, Windows 10 S, will run only applications that have been vetted by Microsoft and placed in its online app store, to prevent students from downloading software that could slow the performance of their computers.Microsoft has also devised a way for schools to get new computers running on a network quickly, without manually configuring each one, by plugging in a USB memory stick. A Microsoft management system called Intune for Education allows schools to set further limits on classroom computers, like locking them down so students cannot cheat by surfing the web during tests.The tools are designed to be easy enough for teachers to use, since many schools do not have dedicated technology administrators. \u201cSometimes school districts aren\u2019t managing the devices,\u201d said Terry Myerson, a Microsoft executive vice president. \u201cTeachers are on the front lines of managing the devices.\u201dThe company is also making full versions of its Office applications, rather than more limited web versions, available to schools for free. It has modified a version of its Microsoft Teams group-chat tool so teachers can collaborate with students. It is also waiving the cost of an educational version of Minecraft, a popular video game it owns, for the first year schools use it.While much of Microsoft\u2019s focus is on software that makes using inexpensive devices \u2014 often in the $200 to $300 range \u2014 more palatable, the company will also release a $999 device called the Surface Laptop, a twist on its Surface tablets. The device will run Windows 10 S.Tech companies are fiercely competing for business in primary and secondary schools in the United States, a technology market expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Ibis Capital, a technology investment firm, and EdtechXGlobal, a conference company.It is a matter of some urgency for Microsoft.Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, compared with less than 1 percent in 2012, according to Futuresource Consulting, a research company. By contrast, Windows laptops and tablets made up 21.6 percent of the mobile-device shipments to schools in the United States last year, down from about 43 percent in 2012.Outside the United States, Microsoft Windows devices accounted for about 64 percent of mobile-device shipments to schools last year, Futuresource said.Like Microsoft, Apple is not taking the Chromebook phenomenon lying down. Apple recently introduced an iPad management app called Classroom, which enables teachers to assign shared iPads to students and create virtual classrooms to guide students through lessons. Apple also introduced lower pricing for educational institutions on its newest iPad model. The iPad starts at $329 for consumers and at $299 for schools.By contrast, Mr. Gownder of Forrester Research said that Microsoft software is so feature-rich that technology experts in many school districts have had to devote their summers to preparing Windows laptops for students one device at a time.And some of Microsoft\u2019s initial attempts to contend with Google\u2019s rise in schools stumbled. In 2014, Microsoft announced it would be going head-to-head with Chromebooks by working with device manufacturers to introduce cheaper Windows laptops. But some schools found the lower-priced Windows devices too cheaply made to withstand student use and too low-powered to efficiently run Microsoft software.\u201cThe cheapest of them would not work,\u201d said Hal Friedlander, a former chief information officer of the New York City Department of Education.Google began to win the classroom software wars as well. In 2014, the company introduced Google Classroom, an app that teachers could use to digitize daily tasks, like assigning homework or taking attendance. It quickly became a hub where teachers could hold class discussions, communicate with individual students and keep parents updated on classroom news.While Microsoft had successfully developed a loyal following among teachers for certain tools \u2014 like Skype and its OneNote notebook organizer program \u2014 the company had no answer for the classroom management system, which Google had developed specifically for teachers.Officials at Omaha Public Schools, which spends about $570,000 annually on Microsoft software and is investing $8 million to buy students Windows devices, welcomed the company\u2019s more comprehensive approach to the classroom.About 200 teachers in the district have completed professional development activities called the Microsoft Innovative Educator program. Some of those teachers are already using the Microsoft Teams chat service with their students.\u201cNow it\u2019s not four or five different experiences based on which app you are using,\u201d said Rob Dickson, the executive director of information management services for Omaha Public Schools. \u201cIt\u2019s a single app with all those experiences within it.\u201dNick Wingfield reported from Redmond, Wash., and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}

Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)It\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.In Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.And in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201dAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.Though corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.Coal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201dFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.Last year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201dOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.Appalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.Those companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.With the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.An announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201dMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russia, This Time the Victim of a Cyberattack, Voices Outrage", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia was again at the center of a global hacking scandal when computer systems the world over were frozen this weekend by a variant of malicious software known as WannaCry. But this time, Russians were among the victims of the attack, not suspected of being the perpetrators.In fact, of all the countries afflicted in the first wave of the spread of the malicious software, Russia was hit the hardest: The virus tried to infect more computers in Russia than anywhere else, according to an analysis by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company.While government computers were crashing, banks, cellphone operators and railroads in Russia were fending off attacks designed to freeze their systems in demand for ransoms to unlock the data.Now on the business end of a cyberattack, Russian officials were quick to voice outrage.\u201cHumanity is dealing here with cyberterrorism,\u201d said Frants Klintsevich, the deputy chairman of the Russian Senate\u2019s defense committee, according to the state-run Tass news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s an alarming signal, and not just a signal but a direct threat to the normal functioning of society, and important life-support systems.\u201dComputer researchers have yet to determine the origin of the \u201cransomware\u201d attack, but Mr. Klintsevich said the hackers\u2019 intended targets were global.Hacking \u2014 far from an exclusive trick of the Russians \u2014 is a global scourge, Russian officials have said, and the ransomware attack became a painful illustration of their point.The malware was based on a program developed by the N.S.A. and stolen in a breach of the United States government\u2019s servers. The version of the program used to demand ransoms from the operators of frozen computer systems exploits vulnerabilities in older and unlicensed versions of Microsoft Windows, used widely in Russia, that did not have security patches.On Friday, Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry reported attacks on about 1,000 computers using the Windows operating system, but said the computers had been isolated from ministry networks.A spokeswoman for the ministry, Irina Volk, told Russian news agencies that key servers had been unaffected because they were running domestic software, including a little-known operating system called Elbrus, first developed in the late Soviet period.A new strain of ransomware spread rapidly around the world on Friday.Russian cybercriminals were among the pioneers of ransomware, although there is no evidence linking them to the latest WannaCry attack.In recent years, a prominent Russian malware system called Gameover Zeus, which had been used for bank thefts and government espionage, also distributed a particularly ruthless ransomware program called Cryptolocker.In December, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on the Russian hacker associated with Gameover Zeus, Evgeniy M. Bogachev, who is also wanted by the F.B.I. in connection with cybercrimes including bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft.Mikhail Delyagin, the director of the Institute of Problems of Globalization in Russia, said he suspected the United States government was behind the WannaCry attack, saying it could be the retaliation the Americans threatened against Russia for its hacking efforts last year.\u201cI respect the honesty of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threaten us with a cyberattack, and a cyberattack follows. It\u2019s logical.\u201dStill, prominent Russian computer researchers have refrained from blaming the United States, although the malicious software originated with the N.S.A.\u201cSpecial state cyberforces evidently would not exercise such a stupid attack,\u201d Igor Ashmanov, a member of the Council for Digital Economy, a government advisory body, said in an interview. Any government-backed attack on Russian institutions would be considered an act of war, he said.And this time, he said, \u201cof course it wasn\u2019t Russian hackers,\u201d given that Russia appeared to be a main target.An earlier version of this article misstated part of the name of the agency that the malware used in a global cyberattack was stolen from. It is the National Security Agency, not the National Security Administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Not the Government, Is Building the Future", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtBut don\u2019t be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn\u2019t just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you\u2019ve ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren\u2019t just funding big things \u2014 they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.At the same time, the American government\u2019s appetite for funding big things \u2014 for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs \u2014 keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Trump.This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them.Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world \u2014 a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert \u2014 and the phone will give you more information about what you\u2019re looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert).The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year\u2019s show, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an \u201cA.I.-first\u201d company \u2014 that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques.A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn\u2019t making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the A.I.-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit.Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of A.I. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care.There are two ways to respond to the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerized methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care.What\u2019s more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching A.I. with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and \u2014 through their cloud server businesses \u2014 they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest A.I. tech.But the tech industry\u2019s huge investments in A.I. might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government.\u201cWe created OpenAI partly because industry is investing such vast sums of money into A.I. research that commercial, private entities were on track to create the first powerful A.I. systems, and these entities don\u2019t have a built-in mechanism to ensure that everyone benefits from advances,\u201d Mr. Brockman told me in an email.He went on to note that one reason the internet has been so successful is that it was created through government funding to be open and accessible to everyone. If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201dWhat\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in \u2014 or let them take over the future for themselves.An earlier version of this article incorrectly included Peter Thiel as among those who helped create OpenAI. While Mr. Thiel was among those who sponsored it, he was not a creator.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ransomware\u2019s Aftershocks Feared as U.S. Warns of Complexity", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byAs a new workweek started Monday in Asia, there were concerns the malicious software could spread further and in different forms, with new types of ransomware afflicting computers around the globe.President Trump has ordered his homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, who has a background in cyberissues, to coordinate the government\u2019s response to the spread of the malware and help organize the search for who was responsible, an administration official said Sunday.The attack is more complicated because \u201cthe experts tell us that this code was cobbled together from many places and sources,\u201d according to an administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss the government\u2019s cybersecurity plans. The more potential sources of the malicious code, the harder it is for investigators to run down the trail of possible perpetrators.The source of the attack is a delicate issue for the United States because the vulnerability on which the malicious software is based was published by a group called the Shadow Brokers, which last summer began publishing cybertools developed by the National Security Agency.Government investigators, while not publicly acknowledging that the computer code was developed by American intelligence agencies as part of the country\u2019s growing arsenal of cyberweapons, say they are still investigating how the code got out. There are many theories, but increasingly it looks as though the initial breach came from an insider, perhaps a government contractor.Five businesses in South Korea reported ransomware attacks over the weekend, according to the government\u2019s internet security agency, and a Korean theater chain said late-night moviegoers on Sunday alerted them when computer ransom notes appeared on screens instead of programmed advertisements.The spread of the malicious software, or malware, has focused attention on several questions, including why a software patch, issued by Microsoft in March, was not installed by more users. But for many systems, especially older systems, such patches are not installed automatically \u2014 a fact the hackers took advantage of. Microsoft has not said how it became aware of the vulnerability, but it seems likely it was tipped off by the National Security Agency.Mr. Smith said that Microsoft had the \u201cfirst responsibility\u201d for addressing vulnerabilities in its software, and that customers must be vigilant. But he said the latest attack showed the dangers of governments\u2019 \u201cstockpiling of vulnerabilities.\u201d\u201cRepeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote.So far, the main targets of the attack have been outside the United States. But neither the federal government nor American corporations assume that this will continue to be the case.Monday could bring a wave of attacks to the United States, warned Caleb Barlow, the vice president of threat intelligence for IBM. \u201cHow the infections spread across Asia, then Europe overnight will be telling for businesses here in the United States,\u201d he said.The cyberattack has hit 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, according to Rob Wainwright, the executive director of Europol, Europe\u2019s police agency.Robert Pritchard, a former cybersecurity expert at Britain\u2019s defense ministry, said that security specialists might not be able to keep pace with the hackers.\u201cThis vulnerability still exits; other people are bound to exploit it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current variant will make its way into antivirus software. But what about any new variants that will come in the future?\u201dAllan Liska, an analyst with Recorded Future, a cybersecurity company, said a new version of the ransomware he examined Sunday did not have the kill switch. \u201cThis is probably version 2.1, and it has the potential to be much more effective \u2014 assuming security defenders haven\u2019t spent all weekend patching,\u201d he said.The Microsoft patch will help, but installing it across large organizations will take time.Microsoft has complained for years that a large majority of computers running its software are using pirated versions. The spread of hacking attacks has made legal versions of software more popular, as they typically provide automatic updates of security upgrades.Governments around the world were bracing themselves for new attacks.He confirmed that one hospital \u2014 Dharmais Hospital in the capital, Jakarta, which specializes in cancer treatment \u2014 had been afflicted by the malware, but without major effects on patients.In Britain, fallout continued Sunday. Two opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, asserted that the governing Conservative Party had not done enough to prevent the attack. With a general election June 8, officials have been racing to get ahead of the problem.Reporting was contributed by Austin Ramzy, Motoko Rich, Keith Bradsher, Joe Cochrane, Steve Lohr, Paul Mozur, Richard C.

{"Headline": "What Happens When Your Car Gets Hacked?", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPatching is how the computer industry maintains security in the face of rampant internet insecurity. Microsoft, Apple and Google have teams of engineers who quickly write, test and distribute these patches, updates to the codes that fix vulnerabilities in software. Most people have set up their computers and phones to automatically apply these patches, and the whole thing works seamlessly. It isn\u2019t a perfect system, but it\u2019s the best we have.Fast forward five to 10 years, and the world is going to be filled with literally tens of billions of devices that hackers can attack. We\u2019re going to see ransomware against our cars. Our digital video recorders and web cameras will be taken over by botnets. The data that these devices collect about us will be stolen and used to commit fraud. And we\u2019re not going to be able to secure these devices.Like every other instance of product safety, this problem will never be solved without considerable government involvement.For years, I have been calling for more regulation to improve security in the face of this market failure. In the short term, the government can mandate that these devices have more secure default configurations and the ability to be patched. It can issue best-practice regulations for critical software and make software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities. It\u2019ll be expensive, but it will go a long way toward improved security.But it won\u2019t be enough to focus only on the devices, because these things are going to be around and on the internet much longer than the two to three years we use our phones and computers before we upgrade them. I expect to keep my car for 15 years, and my refrigerator for at least 20 years. Cities will expect the networks they\u2019re putting in place to last at least that long. I don\u2019t want to replace my digital thermostat ever again. Nor, if I ever need one, do I want a surgeon to ever have to go back in to replace my computerized heart defibrillator in order to fix a software bug.No amount of regulation can force companies to maintain old products, and it certainly can\u2019t prevent companies from going out of business. The future will contain billions of orphaned devices connected to the web that simply have no engineers able to patch them.Imagine this: The company that made your internet-enabled door lock is long out of business. You have no way to secure yourself against the ransomware attack on that lock. Your only option, other than paying, and paying again when it\u2019s reinfected, is to throw it away and buy a new one.Ultimately, we will also need the network to block these attacks before they get to the devices, but there again the market will not fix the problem on its own. We need additional government intervention to mandate these sorts of solutions.None of this is welcome news to a government that prides itself on minimal intervention and maximal market forces, but national security is often an exception to this rule. Last week\u2019s cyberattacks have laid bare some fundamental vulnerabilities in our computer infrastructure and serve as a harbinger. There\u2019s a lot of good research into robust solutions, but the economic incentives are all misaligned. As politically untenable as it is, we need government to step in to create the market forces that will get us out of this mess.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victims Call Hackers\u2019 Bluff as Ransomware Deadline Nears", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byWith the clock ticking on whether a global hacking attack would wipe out his data, Bolton Jiang had no intention of paying a 21st-century ransom.\u201cEven if you do pay, you won\u2019t necessarily be able to open the files that are hit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no solution to it.\u201dTens of thousands of computer users around the world made the same decision, refusing to pay the anonymous hackers behind the ransomware attack known as WannaCry. The attackers had demanded that individuals pay up to $600 by Friday to regain control of their machines, or face losing their data.But the malicious software, which attacked versions of Microsoft\u2019s Windows software, exposed the widespread vulnerability of computers to such attacks and offered a peek at a new type of crime capable of being committed on a global scale.New threats could emerge soon, given that the Shadow Brokers, the anonymous group that posted the first batch of N.S.A. tools online, is promising to release more of the software \u2014 including malware that attacks routers, smartphones and current versions of Windows \u2014 every month.Early estimates of what the virus could ultimately yield for those who unleashed it had ranged from the tens of millions to even hundreds of millions of dollars. Victims were given seven days to pay from when their computers were first infected, so the deadline will vary from case to case.But the attackers are unlikely to act on their threat even after the deadline passes, said Zohar Pinhasi, chief executive of MonsterCloud, an internet security company. Instead, he predicted, they will increase the ransom to squeeze those who conclude they must have the data. \u201cMaybe in a week, the number will jump to $10,000,\u201d he said.Along with broad attacks in Europe, many of the estimated 200,000 computers hit by WannaCry were in Asia, where widespread use of pirated software has increased their vulnerability. Those affected, including hospitals, government offices and universities, have lost access to business information, term papers and even medical records.Some victims have struck a defiant tone. The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, which was identified in the news media as a victim, declined to confirm those reports on Friday but said it had no intention of paying a ransom and that it expected to be fully secure against future attacks by Monday. Nissan Motor, another Japanese industrial giant, also said it would not pay a ransom.In Britain, where the National Health Service was among the largest organizations affected by the ransomware, some medical institutions were still struggling to get back to normal.Yet cybersecurity experts have generally advised those affected not to pay.\u201cIt costs the perpetrators peanuts to carry out an attack like this,\u201d said Rafael Sanchez, an international breach response manager at Beazley, an insurer in London that has handled thousands of ransomware attacks for corporate clients. \u201cAnd any ransom will only likely lead to more attacks,\u201d he added.\u201cIt looks like the attackers had no intent in decrypting anything,\u201d said Tom Robinson, a founder of Elliptic, a company in London that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies and helps organizations respond to digital attacks.According to law enforcement agencies, paying ransom could leave victims vulnerable to being targeted again.In Berhampur, a city of about 380,000 on India\u2019s eastern coast, two computers at the Berhampur City Hospital were hit by the WannaCry malware. Dr. Saroj Mishra, assistant health officer for the surrounding district of Ganjam, said that most of the data had been recovered, and that health officials had no intention of paying the hackers.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the permission to pay the hackers,\u201d Dr. Mishra said. \u201cThere is no question of compromising.\u201dIn other cases, those affected simply cannot afford to pay.\u201cThe hacker asked for $300 to $600,\u201d said Zhu Huanjie, a college student in Hangzhou. \u201cAverage students can\u2019t afford that.\u201dMikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said that the total amount of ransom that had been paid remained relatively low because large organizations \u2014 many with detailed data retrieval plans \u2014 were the main victims of the attack.Such preparations, he added, meant that while the daily activities of such organizations had been severely hamstrung in recent days, most had already replaced the affected data.Xu Hengyu, the information technology manager of Renxing Pictures, a Shanghai entertainment company, said the firm had intended to send more than $720 to hackers threatening to delete two months\u2019 worth of data.But Mr. Xu said that when he tried to negotiate the price down, the hackers told him he could wire the money to a Chinese bank account in local currency rather than Bitcoin. Mr. Xu said he was unsure whether the hackers were the same as those behind the WannaCry attack.\u201cWe thought about reporting to the police, but we haven\u2019t so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought if this problem could be solved by the direct payment, we\u2019d rather stay that way and not go to the police, as the police must already have many cases.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe still prioritize data recovery over everything else.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, Mark Scott from Rome and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.

At the R\u00edo Piedras terminal where Mr. Rivera works, the drivers and cleaning crews huddled to gripe about waning business and pensions, as well as ever-rising fees and water and electricity bills.Although the move on Wednesday was hardly a surprise, it left a sense of gloom and anxiety here, as civil servants question whether their pensions will ever be paid and private companies suffer the consequences of the brutal domino effect that results when taxes rise, salaries drop and the middle class takes off on a mass exodus for Florida.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here, even if I make only $1,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.The government plans sweeping austerity measures in the coming months that will hit teachers especially hard. On Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s education secretary announced a proposal to close 184 schools. Teachers may see their hours trimmed by two days a month.So while the government seeks protection from lawsuits from the hedge funds and other financial firms that invested in Puerto Rico\u2019s risky debt, residents of this United States territory are taking the squeeze. Fines for parking and other traffic violations have doubled. Dozens of government agencies are on the chopping block, while perks like the annual Christmas bonus and pay for unused sick time make for wistful memories.\u201cAt some point I will have to decide whether I live in a house, or with medical insurance,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, 55, a retired electronics teacher. \u201cAnd the food?\u201d he said, letting the thought trail off.His pension is about $1,900 a month, of which $556 goes to pay his family\u2019s medical plan.Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, who took office in January, acknowledged that low-income people without access to health care and parents with children in public schools would be the most vulnerable in the months ahead.\u201cThere has to be sacrifice everywhere,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe have been very clear about what that sacrifice is.\u201dThe last two administrations cut tens of thousands of positions from public payrolls, and now Mr. Rossell\u00f3 has vowed to make \u201cstrategic cuts\u201d that do not cause layoffs but put the government in a position to better negotiate with its creditors. Among the ideas is to cut government pensions by 10 percent, which will hurt retired police officers and teachers most, because they do not receive Social Security benefits.Creditors were unimpressed, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.\u201cThey don\u2019t think that fiscal plan is appropriate; they think they should get more money and that the people of Puerto Rico should get less,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, my position is I am completely against that, and I will protect the people of Puerto Rico over anything.\u201dWhen he took office, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said his first task was to determine \u201chow deep the rabbit hole went.\u201d He expected a $3 billion deficit, and instead found a deficit of $7.5 billion.\u201cWhat was happening in Puerto Rico is the definition of a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said.Roberto Pag\u00e1n, vice president of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Service Employees International Union, said he expected that up to 400,000 people would lose health plans because they will not be able to afford it. Public services like filing a child abuse complaint will probably go unattended.\u201cIn this fiscal plan, we see proposals that are very optimistic and hardly realistic,\u201d Mr. Pag\u00e1n said.Mr. Domenech, 50, the general contractor, who lives in Aguadilla in western Puerto Rico, said he had no idea where people like him stood in the new Puerto Rican reality. With the government owing huge sums to credit unions and companies like Microsoft, hedge funds and gasoline suppliers, where do his unpaid bills fit in?Not only are his savings tied up in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, but his contracting business also went under, he said, largely because the government did not pay the invoices on an airport renovation project that dragged on and went over budget.\u201cThey left me with no money,\u201d Mr. Domenech said. \u201cI feel frustrated and helpless.\u201dHe has thought about moving to Canada.His father-in-law, Mr. Torres, 63, owns Librer\u00eda La Tertulia, the island\u2019s oldest book store, which depends on the disposable income of students and professors at the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s campus in R\u00edo Piedras. But students protesting severe budget cuts have been on strike for over a month, and the store\u2019s profits dipped up to 70 percent this semester, Mr. Torres said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pharmacy, it\u2019s the grocery store.\u201dHe said that it would be easy for him to blame the slow foot traffic on the student strike but that he looks at the deteriorating urban core around him and blames decades of neglect that pushed more people to suburban shopping malls and still others off the island altogether. The boarded storefronts at Paseo de Diego, a nearby pedestrian mall, underscore his point.\u201cA lot of this is perception, but it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. \u201cGo walk around the plaza.\u201dData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Puerto Rico\u2019s work force dropped by about 300,000 in the past decade, said Carlos J. Saavedra-Guti\u00e9rrez, the labor secretary here.\u201cThis is a new chapter,\u201d he said, as he rattled off labor changes he hopes will stimulate the economy and create \u201ca stopgap to the exodus.\u201dMany of those left behind do not have the money to leave. Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez, 53, has spent 30 years sweeping the streets of San Juan, but with the cuts coming to pensions, he estimates that he will have to stay on the job until he is at least 70.\u201cThe fiscal board making all the decisions is going to take it all from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to.\u201dBoth of Iris D. Matos\u2019s grown children moved to the mainland in search of work. She and her husband, both retired electric company employees, are bracing for a $500 monthly cut in their pensions, even as their grandchildren depend on them for basic necessities.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single sector that hasn\u2019t been hit: The older people are worried about their retirements, the parents have had their hours cut, and the young people are on strike at the university, and the kids are about to see their schools closed,\u201d Ms. Matos, 64, said. \u201cThey are spreading the pain, but to only one class of people: us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When you get it for free, you\u2019re the product. In these straitened times for districts, it\u2019s really becoming a question of whether you go with Google and Chromebooks and accept what they entail or do without.BRIAN NADEL, PELHAM, N.Y.To the Editor:Sadly, American public education lurches from one fad to another. Remember \u201cschools without walls\u201d or the \u201cnew math\u201d? Chromebooks are simply the latest fad. There is little evidence that computers in classrooms produce student outcomes superior to traditional teaching methods, at least when the latter are implemented properly.Elite private schools have computers, but they are far less central to the educational process. Instead, smaller class sizes and better teachers are emphasized. However, these are a lot more expensive than Chromebooks.SCOTT OCHILTREE, WASHINGTONTo the Editor:The big question everyone should be asking here is: Are we educating our kids to become active citizens or passive, unquestioning consumers? Which society do you want your kids to live in?To the Editor:I am the parent of two elementary-school children. Our school district has Google accounts for all the schoolchildren, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. My children have learned how to use word processing, create spreadsheets, make and give presentations, and use email \u2014 all at a young age in a safe environment. They can log into their accounts from anywhere, do their homework (it even saves their work automatically every few seconds), communicate with their teachers and classmates, and even submit their homework online. All their work is saved and accessible anywhere, anytime. They both have cellphones and can also access their accounts on their phones.To the Editor:Chromebooks might make a teacher\u2019s job easier, but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they will produce better educated and more responsible citizens, more creative kids or a highly skilled work force. The distractions that Chromebooks present offset many of the advantages. If Google or Apple or Facebook were serious about providing a useful tool for students, the platform would have looked much different. It would have limited access to the web, disallowing all sites but those with strictly educational value. We would never use textbooks jammed with advertisements, inappropriate pictures or games.I know there is no getting this toothpaste back in the tube, but the last thing children need is more screen time. Google has been virtually giving out Chromebooks like lollipops. It knew full well that the temptation to stray from schoolwork into cybertainment would be inevitable, providing Google with infinite data mining and marketing research opportunities.The Chromebook movement at the high school level has also spawned some very creative ways to \u201cshare\u201d homework, classroom assignments and screenshots of tests.RICK BOBRICK, MEDUSA, N.Y.The writer is a junior high school science teacher.To the Editor:Google\u2019s education apps group director, Jonathan Rochelle, questions the value of teaching students the skills of mathematical thinking when students can just \u201cask Google for the answer.\u201d The purpose of education should not be to teach students how to mindlessly search the internet and locate the answer to a question. Whether the class is mathematics, history, literature, science, civics or the arts, a good teacher will encourage students to think critically for themselves, ask their own questions and discover answers.It is hard for this reader to accept that a laptop with a bunch of apps will ever teach students more meaningfully than a skilled and inspiring teacher standing up in front, armed only with chalk, and challenging students to think.DAVID E. COHEN, WYCKOFF, N.J.To the Editor:This article gave copious details about how the tech giant Google won over numerous school districts around the country, and beat out Microsoft, but I wish it had focused more on what the Google tools were, and how they helped students gain knowledge and acquire inspiration.I was appalled by a quote from the director of Google\u2019s education apps group, Jonathan Rochelle, who disparaged rote memorization of equations in a speech at an industry conference last year. Referring to his own children, he said: \u201cI cannot answer for them what they are going to do with the quadratic equation. I don\u2019t know why they are learning it.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t ask Google for the answer if the answer is right there.\u201dDuring my years in junior high school I learned the formula for solving quadratic equations and how it worked, and as an aerospace physicist for more than 40 years, I found I needed it often. By being stored in my memory it was at my immediate disposal.Of course we should use computers as we do libraries to look up information. But certain fundamental rules, laws, processes and shortcuts should be memorized, so they are conveniently available. I also found that depending on computers for solving problems can often result in a \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d situation. If you can\u2019t solve the problem as a rough \u201cback of the envelope\u201d calculation, you\u2019ll never know if your computer got it right.To the Editor:Good for Google. It figured out how to level the playing field across different types of schools and districts to help close the digital divide. And it has helped spawn a new generation of digital citizens who are learning how to use technology in a social, positive manner geared toward learning. Schools can be left scrambling to find ways to give each student full access to a good education. At low cost and with easy-to-use tools, Google has skinned the cat.Yes, Google also has almost unfettered access to a new generation of consumers. That\u2019s a price worth paying given the high returns to students in the form of contemporary, relevant learning.MATT LEVINSON, SEATTLEThe writer is the author of \u201cFrom Fear to Facebook: One School\u2019s Journey.\u201dTo the Editor:The article raises many valid concerns about the infiltration of Google into the lives of our children. The question, however, as to \u201cwhether the purpose of public schools is to turn out knowledgeable citizens or skilled workers\u201d is no longer relevant. They must be one and the same. I hope the public schools can embrace and facilitate this reality.PAUL FIEDLER, NEW HAVENAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Prepare for an Automated Future", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byRobot RevolutionThe logical response seems to be to educate people differently, so they\u2019re prepared to work alongside the robots or do the jobs that machines can\u2019t. But how to do that, and whether training can outpace automation, are open questions.How do we educate people for an automated world?At universities, \u201cpeople learn how to approach new things, ask questions and find answers, deal with new situations,\u201d wrote Uta Russmann, a professor of communications at the FHWien University of Applied Sciences in Vienna. \u201cAll this is needed to adjust to ongoing changes in work life. Special skills for a particular job will be learned on the job.\u201dSchools will also need to teach traits that machines can\u2019t yet easily replicate, like creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, adaptability and collaboration. The problem, many respondents said, is that these are not necessarily easy to teach.\u201cMany of the \u2018skills\u2019 that will be needed are more like personality characteristics, like curiosity, or social skills that require enculturation to take hold,\u201d wrote Stowe Boyd, managing director of Another Voice, which provides research on the new economy.Can we change education fast enough to outpace the machines? About two-thirds of the respondents thought it could be done in the next decade; the rest thought that education reform takes too much time, money and political will, and that automation is moving too quickly.\u201cI have complete faith in the ability to identify job gaps and develop educational tools to address those gaps,\u201d wrote Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and founder of Data and Society, a research institute. \u201cI have zero confidence in us having the political will to address the socioeconomic factors that are underpinning skill training.\u201dAndrew Walls, managing vice president at Gartner, wrote, \u201cBarring a neuroscience advance that enables us to embed knowledge and skills directly into brain tissue and muscle formation, there will be no quantum leap in our ability to \u2018up-skill\u2019 people.\u201dWill college degrees still be important? \u201cHuman bodies in close proximity to other human bodies stimulate real compassion, empathy, vulnerability and social-emotional intelligence,\u201d said Frank Elavsky, data and policy analyst at Acumen, a policy research firm.But many survey respondents said a degree was not enough \u2014 or not always the best choice, especially given its price tag. Many of them expect more emphasis on certificates or badges, earned from online courses or workshops, even for college graduates.One potential future, said David Karger, a professor of computer science at M.I.T., would be for faculty at top universities to teach online and for mid-tier universities to \u201cconsist entirely of a cadre of teaching assistants who provide support for the students.\u201dEmployers will also place more value on on-the-job learning, many respondents said, such as apprenticeships or on-demand trainings at workplaces. Portfolios of work are becoming more important than r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9s simply are too two-dimensional to properly communicate someone\u2019s skill set,\u201d wrote Meryl Krieger, a career specialist at Indiana University. \u201cThree-dimensional materials \u2014 in essence, job reels that demonstrate expertise \u2014 will be the ultimate demonstration of an individual worker\u2019s skills.\u201dWhat can workers do now to prepare? Consider it part of your job description to keep learning, many respondents said \u2014 learn new skills on the job, take classes, teach yourself new things.Focus on learning how to do tasks that still need humans, said Judith Donath of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society: teaching and caregiving; building and repairing; and researching and evaluating.The problem is that not everyone is cut out for independent learning, which takes a lot of drive and discipline. People who are suited for it tend to come from privileged backgrounds, with a good education and supportive parents, said Beth Corzo-Duchardt, a media historian at Muhlenberg College. \u201cThe fact that a high degree of self-direction may be required in the new work force means that existing structures of inequality will be replicated in the future,\u201d she said.Even if we do all these things, will there be enough jobs?Jonathan Grudin, a principal researcher at Microsoft, said he was optimistic about the future of work as long as people learned technological skills: \u201cPeople will create the jobs of the future, not simply train for them, and technology is already central.\u201dBut the third of respondents who were pessimistic about the future of education reform said it won\u2019t matter if there are no jobs to train for.\u201cThe \u2018jobs of the future\u2019 are likely to be performed by robots,\u201d said Nathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast, an email company. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t how to train people for nonexistent jobs. It\u2019s how to share the wealth in a world where we don\u2019t need most people to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ransomware Attack, Where Does Microsoft\u2019s Responsibility Lie?", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 When malicious software first became a serious problem on the internet about 15 years ago, most people agreed that the biggest villain, after the authors of the damaging code, was Microsoft.As a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files.This time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system.He went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the \u201cdegree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers,\u201d the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency.On Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smith\u2019s post.To prepare for fallout with customers, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, sent an email to the company\u2019s field sales team on Sunday encouraging them to be supportive of businesses targeted by the attack, or even those who were simply aware of it.\u201cOur key direction to you is to remember that we are in this with our customers \u2014 we are trusted advisers, counselors, and suppliers to them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore than technical guidance, I want you to make sure you are spending the time needed to understand the concerns they have and that they know we are here to help.\u201dWhile Microsoft\u2019s reputation has suffered in the past because of security problems, the company\u2019s stock is barely down from the close of trading on Thursday, just before reports of the ransomware.\u201cPeople have extremely short memories when it comes to this,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research. \u201cI think, realistically, people will move on pretty quickly.\u201dMicrosoft has recognized the risk that cybersecurity poses to it since about 2002, when Bill Gates, the former chief executive, issued a call to arms inside the company after a wave of malicious software began infecting Windows PCs connected to the internet.But security experts challenged that argument, saying that Microsoft could not be expected to keep updating old software products indefinitely. Providing updates to older systems could make computers more insecure by removing an incentive for users to modernize, Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer of F-Secure, a security firm.\u201cI can understand why they issued an emergency patch for XP after WannaCry was found, but in general, we should just let XP die, \u201d Mr. Hypponen said.Despite the high profile of WannaCry, widespread malware outbreaks have become less common over the years, as Microsoft has improved the security of its systems, said Ziv Mador, vice president for security research at Trustwave, a security services firm. But the profits that criminals can make through ransomware and other malicious code ensure the problem will never vanish.\u201cEven though it\u2019s becoming harder and harder, the incentives have increased tremendously,\u201d said Mr. Mador, who previously worked on security response at Microsoft.Advertisement"}
