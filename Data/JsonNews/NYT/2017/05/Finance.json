{"Headline": "Going Beyond Bad Trump", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byDon\u2019t let Montana ruin your weekend.Granted, it was a lousy way to get into a Memorial Day celebration. We\u2019re supposed to be thinking about good times and a change in the seasons. Then Montana gives its sole House seat to a Donald Trump supporter who had just assaulted a reporter for having the temerity to ask a question about health care legislation.\u201cGreat win in Montana,\u201d said Trump. This was shortly after the president\u2019s disastrous appearance at a NATO meeting in which he behaved like the unpopular rich kid whose idea of making small talk is telling people how much his shoes cost.But about that election. We\u2019re going to come up with a useful explanation, and then start grilling with a peaceful heart.The story began with the incumbent congressman, Ryan Zinke, being appointed secretary of the interior. You will remember that Zinke was the cabinet member who rode to his new job on a horse named Tonto. In the list of bizarre things done by Trump appointees, this did not even make the top 100.So the seat was open, and the Republicans nominated Greg Gianforte, a very rich and unlovable software mogul who had lost the governor\u2019s race to a Democrat last year while Trump was carrying the state by 20 points. The Democrats chose Rob Quist, a country music singer.Quist appeared to be a nice guy, but he wasn\u2019t the perfect pick \u2014 there was a history of unpaid taxes, and some voters found it unnerving that he performed regularly with his daughter at a nudist resort. Also, he got precious little help from the national Democrats, who had doubts about his ability to win.But Quist got backing from Trump-weary Americans around the country, who donated $6 million to his race. Hope twitched.Then on election eve Gianforte assaulted Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian, while screaming that he was \u201csick and tired of you guys.\u201d It was the kind of hysterical response you might anticipate if a gang of journalists were surrounding him, yelling, \u201cWhat about that pole dancer?\u201d But Jacobs just wanted to know Gianforte\u2019s ever-evolving position on the Republican health care bill.Still, what happened with this one? You\u2019ve got a thug of a candidate who\u2019s now facing a misdemeanor assault charge, attached to a president who\u2019s on track to inspire more investigations than the entire \u201cLaw & Order\u201d franchise.And it\u2019s not as if Democrats can\u2019t win elections in Montana \u2014 right now there\u2019s a Democratic governor and one senator from each party. (Because the voters are so open-minded, we will not mention that Montana has exactly the same number of senators as California, which has 38 times as many people.)The answer is that when it comes to the House of Representatives, Montana goes for the party, not the person. And that makes a certain sense \u2014 the House is a super-partisan place where generally the most individuals can do is bring home some pork and maybe torture their leadership.The current Republican Party is obviously, um, flawed. But the state hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the House since 1994 and it\u2019s going to require something large to turn things around.The message of Montana is that right now, Republican-leaning voters need to hear a real Democratic message. The party\u2019s great at complaining, but not very clear on how it wants to fix Obamacare or make college affordable or transform the economy beyond raising the minimum wage.It\u2019s all well and good \u2014 and really very satisfying \u2014 to harp constantly about the terribleness of Donald Trump. But people need to see the Democratic line on the ballot and think of something more than Not as Dreadful.Then comes the great turnaround. Looking forward. Meanwhile, have a hot dog on me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Watch in Montana\u2019s Special Election", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe costly campaign for Montana\u2019s at-large House seat had evolved into a referendum on decidedly national issues even before fisticuffs broke out.But the question on Thursday morning was whether the misdemeanor assault charges filed against the Republican candidate, Greg Gianforte, after a heated run-in with a reporter, would affect his race against the Democrat Rob Quist.The story of the encounter between Mr. Gianforte and the reporter, Ben Jacobs of The Guardian \u2014 who went to a Bozeman emergency room after he said he was \u201cbody-slammed\u201d by the Republican candidate \u2014 exploded on social media after Mr. Jacobs posted an audio recording of the episode.At a final rally for Mr. Quist in a brewpub in Missoula, activists were electrified by the news, and some of them said they intended to play the tape for those yet to vote when canvassing for Mr. Quist.Washington-based Republicans were already grumbling about having to spend millions of dollars on behalf of Mr. Gianforte, who is a multimillionaire. Montana still occasionally elects Democrats statewide, but it leans Republican and has not sent a Democrat to the House for over two decades.Republican groups have sought to support their nominee by attempting to focus the race largely on Mr. Quist\u2019s personal financial difficulties, lashing him in a well-financed advertising campaign. Yet Mr. Gianforte has made it difficult for his party, which is concerned about the intensity of liberal voters in Montana and beyond who are hungry to send a message to President Trump.Mr. Gianforte irritated Republican officials earlier this month when he said on a conference call with Washington lobbyists that he was \u201cthankful\u201d that the House had passed legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after suggesting to Montana voters that he would not have supported the bill. Democrats have seized on an audio recording of that call, pointing to his comments as evidence that he is sending contradictory messages to different audiences.Now he is facing another audio recording that could prove even more threatening. The question, though, is whether there are enough outstanding ballots to make a difference in the race.Voting by mail is common in the state, and officials in both parties believe that more than half of the total ballots that will be cast in the election had been submitted before Thursday.The race had become nationalized well before the fracas on Wednesday.\u201cI\u2019m running to go back there to be a voice for Montana and to work with Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Gianforte said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cMy opponent clearly has said he\u2019s going to obstruct Donald Trump. That\u2019s the decision here.\u201dIf Mr. Gianforte is trying to test the depth of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal in a heavily rural state with an enduring populist streak, Mr. Quist is seeking to demonstrate just how much of a political liability the House-passed health care bill is for congressional Republicans. Mr. Quist, a banjo-strumming folk singer, has refocused his campaign in its final weeks on the Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.An old rule in Montana politics \u2014 that the winner of a statewide election could be gleaned by watching who won Yellowstone County, home to Billings \u2014 has receded in recent years. But the county, Montana\u2019s most populous, still merits a close eye. If Mr. Gianforte does not amass a significant margin of victory there, the race could prove competitive. Similarly, if Mr. Quist does not come out of Cascade County, where Great Falls sits, with a substantial advantage, it will be difficult for him to keep the contest close.But the most important task for Mr. Quist in a special election where turnout is so crucial may be to drive up his margins in the two liberal-leaning counties that are home to Montana\u2019s large state universities: Missoula and Gallatin.As Montana Republicans know all too well, Libertarians here have a history of siphoning enough votes to hand statewide races to Democrats. And there is a Libertarian, Mark Wicks, on the ballot Thursday. While Democrats have not overtly tried to promote Mr. Wicks, as they have Libertarian candidates in previous elections, both parties acknowledge that he could capture about 5 percent of the vote \u2014 enough to make a difference.If we have piqued your curiosity about this race, here is a suggestion: Get some coffee. It\u2019s going to be a long night. The polls close at 10 p.m. Eastern, and The Associated Press is often slow to make projections in Montana.The race for governor in November was not called until 10 a.m. the next day, even though Steve Bullock, the Democrat, was re-elected by a fairly comfortable four-point margin. Similarly, the Democratic presidential primary wasn\u2019t called until after 2 a.m.; Bernie Sanders ultimately won by seven points.Why? It often takes a long time for Montana\u2019s conservative and rural areas to report. It is also tricky because so many ballots are cast by mail. More than 250,000 have been returned already, a significant enough portion of the just over 699,000 registered voters in the state to potentially mitigate the effects of Mr. Gianforte\u2019s assault charge. The substantial early vote will also make it harder to get a quick grasp on the race, since the mailed votes can differ from those cast on Election Day.Beyond policy, a defeat or close call here for Mr. Gianforte would underscore the intensity on the left, bolstering Democrats\u2019 effort to recruit candidates to run next year and nudging some Republican incumbents toward retirement. And if Mr. Quist does fall short by a small margin, it will inflame tensions between energized progressives determined to leave few districts uncontested and more pragmatic party officials loath to spend money in forbidding territory.This year\u2019s special elections have been heralded as a critical test of whether Democrats can retake the House next November. But it can be a mistake to read too much into the results of a single contest, and whatever happens on Thursday, it is clear that the national political environment is favorable to Democrats.Republicans have already struggled on conservative terrain this year: winning the House seat in Kansas by just seven points after carrying it by 32 points last year, and watching Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, capture over 48 percent and nearly avert a runoff in the first round of voting last month for Mr. Price\u2019s seat in Georgia. The Democrats benefited from strong turnout and grass-roots fund-raising in both contests.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s large margin of victory here, even a fairly comfortable win for Mr. Gianforte would still be consistent with the emerging pattern of Democratic strength.The strong performances by Democrats are not especially surprising with the president\u2019s approval rating in the high 30s. They suggest that the House may be in play next November if Mr. Trump\u2019s political fortunes don\u2019t improve.The Democratic Party\u2019s ascendant populist wing, led by Mr. Sanders, believes that a more ambitious economic message can lure back Trump voters. But in 2018, there\u2019s a catch: Most of the competitive House districts are in well-educated and affluent suburbs where Mr. Trump fared poorly last November.Mr. Ossoff\u2019s success in the Georgia race, in one of the most well-educated districts in the country, has already shown that Democrats have a path forward in traditionally Republican parts of the Sun Belt. A solid performance by Mr. Quist in Montana, an overwhelmingly white and working-class state, could do the same for populists who argue that the party can win back such voters with the right kind of candidate.Mr. Sanders campaigned for Mr. Quist last weekend across the state, drawing thousands, and his supporters here and beyond will surely claim some of the credit for a strong showing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remaking Baltimore\u2019s Waterfront, With a Splash of Whiskey", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported bySquare Feet10 PhotosBALTIMORE \u2014 Rising high above the new Sagamore Spirit distillery in South Baltimore is a white water tower with three maroon diamonds on each side, a nod to the jockey silks of the thoroughbred farm that provides the spring water for the company\u2019s rye whiskey.The distillery, which opened a few weeks ago, is the latest endeavor of the growing business empire of Kevin A. Plank, founder and chief executive of the sportswear company Under Armour. His new enterprises \u2014 collectively they are called Plank Industries but nearly all have Sagamore in their names \u2014 are reshaping Baltimore\u2019s waterfront and restoring luster to Maryland traditions and landmarks.In March, Mr. Plank\u2019s Sagamore Pendry hotel opened not far away in the Recreation Pier building in the Fells Point neighborhood after a roughly $60 million renovation. That the pier, built in 1914 and vacant since 1999, needed significant structural work mattered little to Mr. Plank. He often gazed at the property from his Under Armour office across the harbor and dreamed about its possibilities.Outside the hotel, a fleet of new water taxis owned by Mr. Plank and modeled after Chesapeake Bay deadrise boats will soon ferry riders to Port Covington, the industrial South Baltimore waterfront area that is undergoing a $5.5 billion overhaul led by his real estate firm, Sagamore Development.In September, the Baltimore City Council approved the use of $660 million in bonds to pay for infrastructure around that mixed-use project, which will include a new Under Armour campus. Under an arrangement called tax-increment financing, the bonds will be repaid through future property taxes generated by the development.Sagamore is also hoping to receive nearly $600 million in state and federal investments for a light-rail extension, modifications to Interstate 95, and other improvements.Many of the efforts from Mr. Plank, a former football player for the University of Maryland who founded Under Armour in 1996, have been greeted with open arms from the community.But against the backdrop of all this rejuvenation, Under Armour\u2019s stock has fallen about 48 percent in the past 12 months, as the company struggled in the face of a quickly changing retail industry. Its chief financial officer, Chip Molloy, resigned in February. In April, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a public company.Mr. Plank, responding to questions by email, said he was fully focused on Under Armour and left the day-to-day work of Plank Industries to his employees.\u201cI am incredibly proud of the Plank Industries team for all that they have built and of the economic impact we have been able to have here in Baltimore,\u201d he said.The former councilman Carl Stokes, who ultimately voted in favor of the deal, said he still wondered why his peers were eager to push it through without pursuing that analysis.\u201cKevin\u2019s been a good guy for the city of Baltimore, but he himself would not O.K. a deal that he didn\u2019t vet,\u201d he said.There is no doubt, though, that Mr. Plank has managed to make sweeping changes to the downtown area. And even to those closely involved, it is almost unthinkable that all this development flowed from a horse farm in Glyndon, Md., less than 30 miles to the northwest.Sagamore\u2019s biggest success may end up being the whiskey business it has spawned.Approached about putting a vineyard on the farm, Mr. Plank, a whiskey drinker, looked into making the spirit instead. It turned out that Sagamore sat atop a limestone shelf and featured a springhouse built in 1909 that held the kind of calcium-rich water that has nourished Kentucky\u2019s famed horses and bourbons for decades.That he settled on rye was no accident; it was an opportunity to revive another tradition. The Mid-Atlantic States, especially Pennsylvania and Maryland, produced the spirit as early as the 1700s. But production slowed during Prohibition and ended during World War II, allowing blended Canadian rye to dominate the market.Demand for American whiskey has come roaring back in recent years, including for rye, setting up a nice business opportunity. From 2009 to 2016, rye whiskey volumes sold in the American market have grown 780 percent, to 775,000 cases from 88,000, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.Inside the production center of Sagamore Spirit\u2019s three-building complex in Port Covington, another three-diamond-stamped beacon greets passers-by: a 40-foot copper column still with a mirror finish that is believed to be the first of its kind.Asked why the finish was essential, Brian Treacy, president of Sagamore Spirit, channeled Mr. Plank, a childhood friend. \u201cBecause it\u2019s all about brand,\u201d he replied.Production of Sagamore Spirit Rye began in Indiana in 2012, under a longtime master distiller from Seagrams, Larry Ebersold. It was unveiled at last year\u2019s Preakness. On April 10, the crew cooked its first batch in its new home.\u201cThe fact that they have him, and they have a column still, tells me that they are in this to make a lot of whiskey and to be really competitive,\u201d David Wondrich, a cocktail historian and author, said of Mr. Ebersold.In April, with help from Sagamore Spirit, the American Distilling Institute held its conference in Baltimore for the first time. Many attendees visited the distillery, which has received 13 awards in 11 months.\u201cIt was sort of the look-we-did-it moment,\u201d Mr. Treacy said. \u201cThe ultimate compliment was when someone from Kentucky would come through and say, \u2018Great job.\u2019\u201dThe Sagamore Pendry is another extension of the brand. Managed by Montage Hotels and Resorts, it is anchored by Rec Pier Chop House, a restaurant run by Andrew Carmellini, the James Beard Award-winning chef, and includes a whiskey bar serving Sagamore Spirit products.Across the street, Jason Bass and Aaron Jones have a front-row seat to the buzz enveloping the neighborhood. In 2013, Mr. Bass, 37, and Mr. Jones, 29, started Treason Toting Company, a maker of tote bags. With financial help from Sagamore Ventures, which develops and supports local entrepreneurs, they were able to open a store in Fells Point in August.Since the hotel opened, Mr. Bass said, friends who ordinarily would have driven to Washington for a night out visit the Pendry instead.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of grit to what Fells Point offers, which is fantastic, but this hotel provides a level of sophistication and gives people a reason to dress up,\u201d Mr. Bass said.For about a year, the pair have made their bags at City Garage, a former bus depot that Sagamore Ventures turned into an innovation center in Port Covington. City Garage, the distillery and the first Under Armour building of the relocated campus \u2014 called Building 37 in a nod to Mr. Plank\u2019s uniform number \u2014 are the first new inhabitants of Port Covington. Sagamore Development has estimated that the project will create 26,500 permanent jobs and have a $4.3 billion annual economic impact once it is completed.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of people in this area who would reach back or make themselves available in support the way that he has and continues to do,\u201d Mr. Bass said of Mr. Plank.Asked what Vanderbilt would think of all this, Mr. Treacy replied: \u201cI think he would think it\u2019s cool. He sounded like he was a bit of a disrupter and did things his way, and we kind of look at ourselves as disrupters, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: An Insider-Trading Case in Health Care", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byPlenty of political intelligence firms make money exchanging information between Washington and Wall Street \u2014 the data is, after all, valuable stuff for hedge funds.David Blaszczak, a Washington consultant, and four other men were accused Wednesday of using confidential information about government financing to trade shares in health care companies that would be affected by the changes.Three current and former partners at Deerfield Management, a health care hedge fund firm, paid Mr. Blaszczak to provide inside information about policy decisions at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, leading to millions of dollars in illegal profits, prosecutors and regulators said.Two of the partners, Rob Olan and Ted Huber, were named in the indictment on Wednesday. Jordan Fogel, who worked at Deerfield from 2006 until last year, was charged separately and pleaded guilty this month.Federal prosecutors have been investigating for more than a year, and it is the most prominent insider-trading case to be filed by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan since its chief, Preet Bharara, was fired in March.The centers spend more than $1 trillion a year on health care programs and are major buyers of medical devices, drugs and services.Dow and DuPont said they were reviewing their plan after coming under shareholder pressure to alter the makeup of the three new companies.Mr. Loeb wants to split the resulting company into as many as six publicly traded entities, arguing that this structure could create as much as $20 billion in additional value.Before Donald J. Trump assumed the American presidency, he promised that his company would donate to the United States Treasury \u201call profits\u201d from foreign government patronage of his hotels.\u201cTo fully and completely identify all patronage at our properties by customer type is impractical in the service industry,\u201d the Trump Organization wrote in a document that was shared with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.That disclosure has raised new questions about whether the president could run afoul of a provision in the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits federal government officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments.\u201cMembers generally judged that it would be prudent to await additional evidence indicating that the recent slowdown in the pace of economic activity had been transitory before taking another step in removing accommodation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oren Moverman: An Actor\u2019s Director, Almost by Accident", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byIn many ways, Mr. Moverman, 50, is an unlikely, almost accidental filmmaker. He was born in Israel (and still speaks with a faint hint of an Israeli accent) and fell in love with movies there, even though he hadn\u2019t actually watched very many. \u201cI read a lot about movies, researched them,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew a lot about movies I\u2019d never seen and could have very intelligent conversations about them.\u201dAfter serving in the Israeli military for four years, he came to this country, hoping to become a director, though he wasn\u2019t exactly sure what a film director did. He supported himself for a while doing what he calls \u201cgood Israeli jobs\u201d \u2014 moving furniture, working as an airport security guard.Mr. Moverman said that sometimes actors of the caliber of those in \u201cThe Dinner\u201d try to do a director\u2019s job for him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get them to talk over each other, because they know I\u2019m not going to get clean sound, and I\u2019ll have problems in the editing room.

That\u2019s part of the danger and the fear, but also the pleasure of it. I\u2019d rather get it raw and untested and unrehearsed and unsoiled.\u201dIn an email, Mr. Coogan, who, like Ms. Linney, had never worked with Mr. Moverman before, said he particularly welcomed the no-rehearsal policy: \u201cWhat a take lacked in refinement, it gained in an authentic spontaneity. Rather than paddling the shallows, it felt like jumping off a cliff.\u201dWhat interested Ms. Blanchett about \u201cThe Dinner,\u201d Mr. Moverman said, was the question of parental responsibility. (Ms. Blanchett didn\u2019t respond to queries seeking comment for this article.) He found himself equally fascinated by the theme of mental illness, embodied by the Coogan character, and decided that the movie itself should have a sort of nervous breakdown. He shot an extended scene, not in the book, when the two brothers visit the battlefield at Gettysburg together. \u201cWhat I wanted to do, very pretentiously \u2014 as pretentious as the restaurant serving the food,\u201d he said, \u201cwas to make a movie that has its own diagnosis and its own mental health issues and its own inability to keep it all together.\u201dHe laughed and added: \u201cI wanted to use all the flavors and textures and ingredients and seasonings and other clich\u00e9s that I could.\u201d He pointed out that besides being divided into \u201ccourses,\u201d as the book is, his movie also has several narrative layers, and even different looks and soundtracks. \u201cOne of the many Hollywoodisms you hear when they give you notes,\u201d he said, \u201cis \u2018Make a meal of it,\u2019 and I thought, O.K., that\u2019s one note I\u2019m not going to get on this movie. We\u2019re going to make a meal of every single element.\u201d He paused a moment and said the point of the film, like the book, was to provoke a discussion and at the same time overwhelm it.

Over sporadic heckling, and at some points to the backs of gown-clad graduates refusing to face her, Ms. DeVos implored: \u201cOne of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree. And while we will undoubtedly disagree at times, I hope we can do so respectfully. Let\u2019s choose to hear each other out.\u201dThe crowd obliged only a handful of times during her roughly 20-minute-speech.And in the days before her address at Bethune-Cookman, in Daytona Beach, Fla., opponents made it clear with petitions and protests that she would not be all that welcome.The school\u2019s president, Edison O. Jackson, had to pause the ceremony about one minute into Ms. DeVos\u2019s address to tell the crowd of students, \u201cIf this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you.\u201dAbove the jeers, Ms. DeVos delivered the standard exhortation to graduates to live a life of service, with courage and grace in the spirit of their school\u2019s namesake.It was a message that thousands believed Ms. DeVos \u2014 who many contend represents an administration that has shown only superficial knowledge of and support for historically black colleges and universities \u2014 was in no position to deliver to the 380 graduates of the school, which was founded by the educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune.\u201cEven though she apologized, she has shown how tone deaf she is, and how disconnected she is from our community,\u201d said Dominik Whitehead, a 2010 graduate of Bethune-Cookman, who generated the first petition calling for Ms. DeVos to be replaced as this year\u2019s graduation speaker.Activists dropped off boxes of petitions, which they said had more than 50,000 signatures, to the school\u2019s administration on Tuesday night in a last-ditch effort to stop Ms. DeVos from speaking.In a letter to the community defending the choice of Ms. DeVos, Mr. Jackson wrote, \u201cI am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community.\u201dOther prominent black leaders also defended the university\u2019s decision to invite Ms. DeVos. Michael Lomax, president and chief executive of the United Negro College Fund, wrote on Twitter shortly after Ms. DeVos was named speaker, \u201cI believe we should hear Secretary DeVos at @bethunecookman, just as we want her and President Trump to hear the voices of #HBCUs.\u201dThe jeers crescendoed when Ms. DeVos said that she would visit the childhood home and grave site of Ms. Bethune.\u201cHer commitment to service is what has brought us together today. This inspired daughter of slaves refused to accept repulsive and systemic racism,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cShe moved mountains, changing the lives and futures of countless students and families across generations.\u201dBut Ms. DeVos drew cheers when she highlighted individual Bethune-Cookman graduates by name and described the challenges they overcame to graduate, and when she praised graduates who were pursuing a career in teaching.In her speech, Ms. DeVos said she wanted to reaffirm the administration\u2019s commitment and cited its decision to restore year-round Pell Grants, which many low-income students use to finance their college educations.\u201cI am at the table fighting on your behalf, and on behalf of all students across this great nation,\u201d she said.But Jasmine Smith, 21, a rising junior at Bethune-Cookman, said she was worried about other measures Ms. DeVos\u2019s department had taken that could affect the next two years at Bethune-Cookman. Her biggest worry was Ms. DeVos\u2019s decision to roll back protections for student loan borrowers.Ms. Smith was among about 100 protesters who gathered at Bethune-Cookman several hours before Ms. DeVos was to deliver her address Wednesday morning.\u201cI\u2019m protesting because she will continue to directly affect me after this and make it harder for me to get to graduation,\u201d she said.Mr. Whitehead said he did not believe that Ms. DeVos\u2019s speech contained any promises of substance, and called the graduates\u2019 demonstration of contempt for her \u201can amazing moment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m proud of what happened,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said. \u201cI hope for the sake of the institution, the sake of the students and the graduates, that regardless of the protests and the petitions, she really wants to build this relationship \u2014 that this is the real thing.\u201dMs. DeVos ended her speech by encouraging the students to maintain grace as they face adversity and dissent.\u201cThe natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mind-set of grace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "McConnell May Have Been Right: It May Be Too Hard to Replace Obamacare", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after President Trump took office, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, met privately with his colleagues to discuss the Republican agenda. Repealing the Affordable Care Act was at the top, he said. But replacing it would be really hard.Mr. McConnell was right.Mr. McConnell faces an increasingly onerous math problem. He can afford to lose only two Republicans if he is to get a bill through the Senate, and that would require the help of Vice President Mike Pence, who would have to cast the tiebreaking vote. But at least three senators in the party are diametrically opposed to the views of at least another three, so the path to agreement is narrow.Republicans are roughly split over whether the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act should be rolled back or continued, at least in the short run. They disagree about how the federal government should grant states more control over setting insurance standards.They are also divided over a critical portion of the House bill, which would allow states to obtain waivers from two of the most important federal mandates: a requirement to provide a minimum set of health benefits, and a prohibition against charging higher prices to people with pre-existing medical conditions.The challenges facing Senate Republicans are so great that overhauling the tax code as Mr. Trump has proposed \u2014 by slashing the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, reducing the number of brackets for individuals to three from seven, and doubling the standard deduction \u2014 is starting to look easier by comparison. \u201cI allow that\u2019s a possibility,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is closely involved in negotiating both issues, and favors a rollback of the Medicaid program.Most Republicans in Congress would like to keep their vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but they face a more urgent challenge: to stabilize insurance markets that, in some states, are in danger of melting down next year.Every week brings word of insurers seeking big rate increases or announcing plans to pull out of another market in 2018. It is conceivable that the two parties could, at some point, work together on short-term fixes outside the repeal process.\u201cI don\u2019t think we want the market to fail,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, which is responsible for tax legislation and much of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWe don\u2019t want premiums to be so high that people can\u2019t afford them.\u201dRepublicans could pass a repeal measure and return to the health care system that was largely in place before the Affordable Care Act became law. But Speaker Paul D. Ryan, among others, has repeatedly stated that his party has a plan to make the system better, which would require the replacement part of the repeal-replace equation.With health care negotiations sputtering, many Republicans are quietly turning their attention to changes in the tax code as a possible path for legislative success. Generally, Republicans are more unified around the fundamentals of a tax overhaul than on the details of health policy. The White House team working on tax issues is far less ideological than the team directing health care efforts, and it has worked harder to build early momentum, Republican aides say.Though Republicans have been calling for a repeal of the health care law almost since President Barack Obama signed it in 2010, those calls have become more urgent as some of the insurance exchanges have struggled.But with millions of Americans newly insured under the law, many governors, including some Republicans, are loath to roll it back, and many senators agree. Twenty Republican senators come from states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.The House bill, starting in 2020, would sharply reduce federal payments to states to cover those who became eligible for Medicaid as a result of the Affordable Care Act.The law also has provisions to help drug addicts, and the opioid crisis sweeping many states with Republican senators has been a key motivator.\u201cThe opioid issue definitely plays a role,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cA lot of the young population that is being insured under Medicaid has problems with substance abuse or mental illness.\u201dWhile fixing the nation\u2019s tax code has long been considered even harder than passing health care legislation on Capitol Hill, the opposite could end up being the case.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, have held numerous meetings with lawmakers \u2014 including Democrats \u2014 on the matter and have attended several hearings against the backdrop of the contentious health care talks.\u201cTaxes has more consensus with Republicans and some Democrats,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.Republican senators have been watching closely as House Republicans have twisted themselves in knots over the tax \u201cblueprint\u201d they released last summer, which represented a dramatic move away from taxing income to a system that basically taxes consumption, lowering rates on high income earners and capital gains. Many lobbyists and tax experts are hoping that the Senate emerges as a voice of reason.Republican senators continued free-flowing conversations among themselves this week to analyze their options and search for consensus on a health care bill that they said would be significantly different from the one passed by the House.Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip, and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said they expected staff experts to draft legislative language for Republicans to consider when the Senate returns from a weeklong recess on June 5.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about this nonstop between ourselves,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of the Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s an appropriate time now to have leadership and committee staff, working with leadership and committee chairmen, sit down and draft a bill, a proposal, for discussion.\u201dIf the Senate decided not to vote on a health care bill, it would quite likely enrage the White House, as it did when Mr. Ryan at first failed to produce a bill that could pass. However, Mr. Trump has considerably less leverage with Mr. McConnell than he did over House leaders, as Mr. McConnell and Republican senators are less susceptible to pressure from the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s New Cybersecurity Law Leaves Foreign Firms Guessing", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 As China moves to start enforcing a new cybersecurity law, foreign companies face a major problem: They know very little about it.The law \u2014 which was rubber-stamped by the country\u2019s Parliament last year \u2014 is part of wide-ranging efforts by Beijing to manage the internet within China\u2019s borders. Those efforts have been stepped up in the years since Edward J. Snowden, the whistle-blower and former American intelligence contractor, revealed that foreign technology firms could help governments spy.And while Chinese officials say the new rules will help guard against cyberattacks and prevent terrorism, critics, many of them from businesses, have their concerns. Companies worry that parts of the new law, which takes effect on Thursday, will make their operations in China less secure or more expensive. In some cases, they argue, it could keep them out entirely.The law will have a big impact on how business is done in China, said Michael Chang, an executive with the Finnish technology company Nokia and the vice president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. But, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s unfortunately a lot of confusion.\u201d\u201cIndustry is not ready because the implementation rules are not clear,\u201d Mr. Chang said, speaking at an event organized by the lobbying group to announce the results of its annual business confidence survey.\u201cWe still have a lot of unclarified territory that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.\u201dThe law would require that companies store their data within China, and would impose security checks on companies in sectors like finance and communications. Individual users, meanwhile, would have to register with their real names to use messaging services.But Mr. Chang said that officials had conveyed \u201cless than half\u201d of the specifics of how the law would be implemented.\u201cA wide range of companies are doing data transfers \u2014 it\u2019s the lifeblood of their business,\u201d he said.Executives have complained that the wording of the law is ambiguous, fearing that it gives China\u2019s ruling Communist Party substantial leeway to target them.One instance cited by Mats Harborn, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, in a round-table discussion with journalists, was that the government said it wanted to regulate \u201ccritical information infrastructure,\u201d but had not defined what that meant.\u201cThe way it\u2019s enforced and implemented today and the way it might be enforced and implemented in a year is a big question mark,\u201d added Lance Noble, the chamber\u2019s policy and communications manager. He warned that uncertainty surrounding the law could make foreign technology firms reluctant to bring their best innovations to China.In May, a coalition of business lobby groups representing European, American and Asian companies called on China to delay implementing the law, while the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China asked for additional time to allow companies to adhere because of the \u201csubstantial compliance obligations.\u201dThe Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s internet regulator, has so far decided to delay implementation only of the regulations governing cross-border data flow, which will now take effect at the end of 2018, according to a revised draft of the rules that was seen by The New York Times.The regulator could not be reached despite multiple telephone calls.Paul Triolo of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group noted the decision to delay that component of the law, saying in a report last week that \u201cgetting the cross-border data flow issue right is a prerequisite for Beijing\u2019s efforts to promote economic globalization.\u201d He wrote that China, for the time being, \u201cis eager to avoid being seen as stifling digital trade.\u201dThe European Union and China plan to hold a summit meeting on Thursday in Brussels. Friction between them has mounted after the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Beijing, accusing it of flooding the European market with cheap steel.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Is China the World\u2019s New Colonial Power?", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "The Money IssueThe rising superpower has built up enormous holdings in poor, resource-rich African countries \u2014 but its business partners there aren\u2019t always thrilled.Supported byDylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o\u2019clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. \u2014 China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u2083O\u2088, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u201cWe had a big ceremony that day,\u201d Teng says.One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u2019s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u2019s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u2019s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future \u2014 his own and his country\u2019s \u2014 under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. \u201cI never imagined,\u201d he says, \u201cI would end up halfway around the world.\u201dJust north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u2019s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u2019re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u2019s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u201call-weather friends.\u201d (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u201cWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u201d Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u2019s minister of finance, told me. \u201cThe Chinese say, \u2018We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u2019\u2009\u201d But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u201cThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u2019s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u201dChina\u2019s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u201cwin-win cooperation.\u201d And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u2014 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u2014 might never be built without them. China\u2019s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u201cWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u201d Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u201cNow we\u2019re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u201dFor some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u2019t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u2014 financed by the Chinese \u2014 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u2014 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u2014 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u2019s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u201cFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u201dThe question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u2014 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u201cYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u2014 or the worst,\u201d says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u201cChina in Africa Podcast.\u201d \u201cThe beauty is in the complexity.\u201dThe couple\u2019s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u2019s most remote places: I\u2019ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u201cMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u201d Rose told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re still Chinese first and foremost.\u201dLike many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u2014 and thousands more across Africa.On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u2019s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u2019s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u2019s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u2019 poor quality \u2014 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u201cMany Namibian children didn\u2019t even have shoes before we got here,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u201dOne of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.Huang\u2019s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u2019s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u2019s elections since its independence \u2014 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u2019s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u2019s founding father, as \u201cmy special adviser.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u2019s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u2014 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)Huang\u2019s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u2019s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u2019s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u2019s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u2019s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u201cI kept warning Jack,\u201d says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t get too close to the fire. You\u2019ll burn your fingers.\u2019\u2009\u201dSean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u2019s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u2019t expected to venture far beyond his village\u2019s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u2014 a legacy of the government\u2019s restrictive family-planning policy \u2014 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u201cbare branch\u201d (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u201cI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u201d he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u2019an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u2019s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even recognize me,\u201d he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u2019s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u2019 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u2019m making now.\u201dIn Teng\u2019s first job after graduation \u2014 at the Beijing-based Uranium Resources Company, a C.G.N. subsidiary \u2014 he learned about the company\u2019s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u2019s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u2019s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u201cThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u201d Teng says.To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u2019s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u2019s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u201cHusab was my salvation.\u201dThere is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u2019s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.Nearly 88 percent of China\u2019s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u2014 and shed the ignominious title of world\u2019s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u2014 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u2019s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u2019s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told The Guardian that the plan is \u201cinsane.\u201dC.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u2019s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u2014 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u2019s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u2019s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u201cThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the implementation can be hell.\u201d Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u2019t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u2019 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u2019s convenient for them to review and plan \u2014 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u2014 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u201cWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u2019s all part of the \u2018going out\u2019 policy.\u201dMining is hardly China\u2019s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u2019s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u2014 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u2014 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u2019s incursion into Africa.Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u201dSuch criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u201cWe\u2019re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u201d says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u2019s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u201cWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u201dNamibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u2019s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u201cIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u201dThe pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u2014 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u2019s own Namibian Chamber of Environment, the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u2014 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u2014 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\u201cYou are abusing China\u2019s good nature,\u201d one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u201cOnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u201d\u201cNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u201d Brown replied. \u201cI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u201d\u2029When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u201cThey got quieter and quieter,\u201d Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u201crotten apples\u201d tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u201cListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u201d he says he argued. \u201cOr we can come together to solve this problem.\u201d The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u2019s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u2014 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of corporate social responsibility. \u201cIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u201d he says, \u201cso they have to be part of the solution.\u201dPoaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u201cLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u201d my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u201cThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u201d In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u201cBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u201d says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u201cBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u201dPublic anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the environment. One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u2019s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u2019s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u2019s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u2014 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.Three months after Brown\u2019s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u2019s recent ban on all ivory sales \u2014 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star Yao Ming \u2014 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u2019s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u2019 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u2019s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u2014 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u201cWhen my \u2018friend\u2019 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u201d Geingob told a local paper later. \u201cThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u201dHuang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u2014 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u201ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u201d The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u2019s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u201cAll the while they were yelling, \u2018Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u2019s the rhino horn?\u2019\u2009\u201d Xia recalls. \u201cI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u201dIt\u2019s a chilly Saturday in April \u2014 the antipodal winter is coming \u2014 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive \u2014 or latitude \u2014 to venture out into the alien environment, especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea \u2014 but had no idea where it was.The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China \u2014 thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue \u2014 Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He\u2019d married the visitor \u2014 mission accomplished \u2014 joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng\u2019s other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China\u2019s continued rise. \u201cThis is an important thing for China, \u201d he says, \u201cand I want to be a part of it.\u201dThe Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises \u2014 and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It\u2019s not just the shared food, culture or language \u2014 or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh environment. What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.Advertisement"}

She has declared her intention to begin negotiations with Brussels to overhaul European institutions as soon as she is elected, and said she would pull France out of European trade agreements that, in her view, harm its interests.\u201cWe won\u2019t make our influence greater without making Europe a stand-alone global power.\u201d \u2014 Mr. MacronMr. Macron says any withdrawal from the bloc would be a disaster from which France \u2014 and Europe \u2014 might never recover. He ridiculed Ms. Le Pen in Wednesday\u2019s debate for failing to understand how leaving the euro would harm French businesses and the economy. \u201cSo a small-business owner will buy its products in euro but pay its employees with the franc?\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He wants more cooperation with the European Union on fiscal, trade and social legislation, and he has called for a dedicated budget for the eurozone.\u201cWe are in the world; France is not a closed country.\u201d \u2014 Mr. MacronAs other European countries recover from the financial crisis, France\u2019s economy has remained stagnant, with unemployment stuck around 10 percent for four years.Mr. Macron says he will jump-start stagnant growth with a business-friendly labor and tax overhaul that would make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers. He has vowed to cut taxes for workers and corporations and to invest 50 billion euros, or about $55 billion, in training, the environment, agriculture and infrastructure, while cutting \u20ac60 billion in public spending.\u201cRampant globalization leads to mass unemployment.

{"Headline": "Hot Stocks Can Make You Rich. But They Probably Won\u2019t.", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byStrategiesIndividual stocks can be hazardous to your financial health.You may not want to hear that right now, with the stock market regularly hitting new highs.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index set another record on Wednesday after reaching a new high on Monday. It set records on two days the previous week, too. Counting dividends, it has returned more than 6 percent this year and more than 15 percent in the last 12 months.What\u2019s more, big bets on hot stocks are generating enormous gains. So far in 2017, for example, two companies in the S.&.P. 500 \u2014 the biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals and the video game developer Activision Blizzard \u2014 have each returned more than 50 percent to their fortunate shareholders. No question about it, if you pick a sizzling stock at just the right time, you can become rich. Some stock pickers have done well over long periods, too.But before you jump headlong into stock picking, you may want to consider the odds. It\u2019s not just that bull markets like this one eventually come to an end. It\u2019s that over the long run, while the total stock market has prospered, most individual stocks have not.A new study by Hendrik Bessembinder, a finance professor at Arizona State University, demonstrates persuasively that while investing in the overall stock market makes sense, the obstacles facing individual stock pickers are formidable. It\u2019s much less risky to invest with diversified low-cost mutual funds.What\u2019s more, 58 percent of individual stocks since 1926 have failed to outperform one-month Treasury bills over their lifetimes, he found. That is a low bar, given the piddling returns on one-month Treasury bills, which now yield less than 1 percent.Professor Bessembinder found that a mere 4 percent of the stocks in the entire market \u2014 headed by Exxon Mobil and followed by Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and IBM \u2014 accounted for all of the net market returns from 1926 through 2015. By contrast, the most common single result for an individual stock over that period was a return of nearly negative 100 percent \u2014 almost a total loss.All that gloom about individual stocks may seem counterintuitive. After all, it\u2019s often said that stocks outperform bonds over the long haul. That\u2019s why long-term investors are generally advised to hold stocks in their portfolios.The problem is that the rosy long-term outlook for stocks, as opposed to bonds, is based entirely on the big picture. When you look more closely, the details are disconcerting.\u201cMany studies have shown that stocks outperform bonds over all, and I don\u2019t question that data at all,\u201d he said in an interview.How can those two sets of facts \u2014 the underperformance of the typical stock and the outperformance of the overall stock market \u2014 both be correct?It is because a relative handful of stocks tend to outperform all others by tremendous amounts.There is a technical explanation for this. Bear with me. In the language of statistics, the stock market generally has a positive skew \u2014 meaning, a relatively small number of outliers like Exxon or Apple have such great returns that they pull up the average stock, which has a mediocre showing. Put another way, the average return is higher than the median or typical return.What does all of this mean for investors?It does not imply that stock picking can\u2019t be successful or that it\u2019s wrong for those who do it with their eyes wide open. \u201cSome people who pick the right stocks can have lottery-like returns,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cThey may want to take that risk and do that.\u201dBut it does imply that most people picking stocks are unlikely to do well for very long.In response to a question, Professor Bessembinder said that he, personally, favors low-cost index mutual fund investing, through which he maintains a widely diversified portfolio of bonds and stocks.That is a less risky strategy \u2014 though investing in stocks always involves risks, perhaps especially in a period like this one, when stocks have been rising for a long while. And it\u2019s not a revolutionary approach by any means. It won\u2019t produce the stratospheric returns that are possible if you are able to pick the one stock that will outperform all others for the next several decades.\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that it will be a stock that we haven\u2019t even heard of,\u201d Professor Bessembinder said.If you are confident that you can identify that stock, good for you. I\u2019m sticking with dull, diversified mutual funds because I know that I can\u2019t.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growing Up in, and Outgrowing, Manhattan", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byWhen asked whether he considers New York City to be his home, my father responds with, \u201cNo, I am a man of the world.\u201d His affected response is probably that of many a prototypical Manhattanite. For him and others like him, this slender island between the Hudson and East Rivers is a conduit to something much more.His identity, like mine, is tied to Manhattan. Though born in Biloxi, Miss., my father chose to raise his two children in the city that never sleeps because he and my mother saw it as a privilege, a rite of passage, a hometown that would challenge us and shape us.Which is, I now realize, something of a hyperinflated view of Manhattan. My sister and I grew up quickly, never learning what it meant to relax but rather to always keep moving. It did, however, offer certain benefits. We were exposed to vastly different ethnic customs and languages. We tasted new cuisines each week, and Broadway shows and museums were routine family outings.Eventually I moved away from the city, the natural course of life trickling down Interstate 95 and to the South, then to the West. But when I did return home, Manhattan was out of reach for me \u2014 too expensive and too hurried. I had since mellowed, softened, perhaps, by living outside the frenzied work and party life of the big city. Shut out of my native Upper West Side, I made a great effort to experience living in every borough, making my way through Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg in Brooklyn; Sunnyside and Rockaway Park in Queens; and West Brighton on Staten Island. I failed only in trying to nail down an apartment one year in the Bronx, the borough where I have not lived, because housing there had also become tight.In a way, stretching outside Manhattan made the city seem smaller to me, more intimate and unique. In Rockaway Park, I found what is arguably the best Uzbek restaurant in the city and learned that bedroom communities offer a more diverse portrait of New York; and in Williamsburg, I found that not everything had to do with hipsters or what\u2019s trending next.Today I find that born-and-raised Manhattanites who still call their native borough home are a scarce breed. But for other natives, leaving Manhattan was not as simple as it was for me. Many are priced out and learn what residents of the other boroughs have always known: There is life outside Manhattan. Some discover, though grudgingly, that Brooklyn is not as bad as they were brought up to believe, or that Queens and the Bronx aren\u2019t really all that far away. And maybe happiness can be found in places far from the place that was for so long the center of their universe.Leslie Marshall, 53, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, began selling properties in 2002 in Brooklyn, her adopted home after years in Manhattan. She said she spent much of her time coaching buyers who hesitate at the thought of moving out of Manhattan. Their decision to explore another borough often comes with worries that Manhattanites rarely consider: How long is the commute? Who is responsible for snow removal and trash pickup if there are no doormen? Will friends ever visit if they have to transfer to another subway? Will the newspaper be delivered to an address without an apartment number?\u201cYou have to teach them to manage,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to have these basic conversations with these people because they don\u2019t know.\u201dThis may seem an overblown caricature, but to many native Manhattanites the thought of becoming part of the bridge-and-tunnel crowd is filled with dread, because the Manhattan lifestyle is one of inherent chauvinism. Preconceived notions of traveling to and from \u201cthe city\u201d for work or play are rooted in visions of gritty commutes inside graffiti-filled subway cars and along dark, unfamiliar corridors. Many, therefore, are willing to put up with extreme space constraints and higher rents so as to hang onto a Manhattan ZIP code and the coveted 212 area code.Some people would rather live in squalor in a Manhattan tenement \u201cthan in a beautiful apartment in Bushwick,\u201d said Michelle Bar, 28, who was born on the Upper East Side and moved to Forest Hills, Queens, when she was very young. \u201cI just feel like if I\u2019m financially stable enough to live in Manhattan, why wouldn\u2019t I?\u201dMs. Bar lives in NoHo with her boyfriend, Alex Gumer, 28, a lifelong Manhattanite who works in finance. He said that many Manhattan neighborhoods seem to blend together now.\u201cYou used to be able to feel the atmospheric change,\u201d Mr. Gumer said. \u201cNow you can jump from Duane Reade to Duane Reade and kind of miss the neighborhood. That\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, but also not entirely untrue. I would say Brooklyn and Queens have gained some ground on Manhattan.\u201dCensus data suggest that Manhattan is no longer the main draw for newcomers. A total of 55,211 residents arrived in New York last year, according to the Census Bureau; with Queens adding 16,700 residents, Brooklyn 16,015, the Bronx 13,687, and Manhattan only 7,552. Staten Island saw just 1,257.Growing up, Ben Berkon, 30, had all the trappings of a wistful Manhattan childhood: Zabar\u2019s, H & H Bagels and Eeyore\u2019s Books. Mr. Berkon, a writer and voice actor, recently moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn, a place his younger self would have never imagined could be considered home. After a brief stay in Williamsburg, where he shared an apartment for $900 a month, he moved to his own one-bedroom rental for $2,025 a month. Mr. Berkon said he justified the expense by weighing the cost against what he would have had to pay in Manhattan, even if he shared an apartment with two or more roommates.\u201cI wasn\u2019t specifically looking to move to Park Slope,\u201d he said. He remembers thinking one day about how the move meant he would become a Brooklynite.\u201cIt was always this thing, this divide, between people who lived in Manhattan and not,\u201d he said. \u201cA tug of war: Are you going to come meet me in Manhattan? Or are you going to force me to come to Brooklyn.\u201d Now, he said, he thinks people who live in Manhattan have lost their leverage.When Mr. Berkon told his parents, also die-hard Manhattanites, that he was moving to Brooklyn, they were in shock. They asked him if he was sure, if he needed money.\u201cWhat\u2019s funny is, I definitely lost that edge a bit now that I live in Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friends, especially those I didn\u2019t grow up with, think I\u2019m a hipster.\u201d But, he argues, that would be impossible, since he grew up in Manhattan.For others, admitting to and shedding their Manhattan provincialism takes more time.Michael Grosinger, 27, moved to Williamsburg after spending his formative years in Manhattan. He attributes the move to needing \u201ca breath of fresh air,\u201d but still finds himself tongue-tied when non-natives ask where he\u2019s from. His answer, of course, is \u201cthe city,\u201d which for lifelong Manhattanites obviously means Manhattan.He cherishes his childhood on the Upper West Side: taking the subway alone to see Rangers games at Madison Square Garden, getting bumped into on the subway, fighting for space in a crosswalk and learning to navigate the city alone at age 12.\u201cThat\u2019s part of what makes it so great, right? The chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, I feel like I\u2019ve learned to channel that chaos and live through it.\u201dAt least some of that chaos is reflected in Williamsburg, he said. Moving to Brooklyn brought him a residential upgrade.\u201cI am in a brand-new building with all new amenities,\u201d he said. His disappointment at being priced out of Manhattan is tempered by his appreciation for his new neighborhood. \u201cI always enjoyed spending time in Williamsburg and I think it\u2019s got a great night-life scene, one that rivals the city, and an even better music scene.\u201dLife changes will often push lifelong Manhattanites out of their comfort zone. For Phoebe Lapine, 31, leaving for Brooklyn was an obvious choice when she and her boyfriend decided to move in together. She gave up her 400-square-foot loft in Chelsea, and they recently moved into a two-bedroom in Vinegar Hill with floor-to-ceiling windows, an elevator and a lobby.\u201cWe just would have never been able to afford this\u201d in Manhattan, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying what we would have for a one-bedroom in my old neighborhood.\u201dMs. Lapine was born on Bank Street in the West Village. Her family moved to Paris when she was 4, then to Westchester County, N.Y., returning to Manhattan when she was in third grade. Her parents, much like Mr. Berkon\u2019s parents, consider any move away from Manhattan unthinkable.\u201cMy parents treat Brooklyn like it\u2019s a separate city,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you get anything you need in a 10-block radius, it can make you particularly lazy about leaving that 10-block radius.\u201dWhich is not to say that Ms. Lapine thinks Brooklyn is a world removed from her Manhattan childhood. \u201cToday, Brooklyn, depending on the neighborhood, is just a shade different than the Upper West Side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have the same strollers and cockapoos.\u201dFor some lifetime Manhattanites, moving to a new neighborhood for the lower prices can come with the uncomfortable knowledge that they are part of a wave of gentrification. Raphael Nunberg, 31, a software project manager born on the Upper East Side, grapples with the label of gentrifier now that he has moved to Long Island City, Queens.In some respects, he said, he is guilty. But, he said, \u201cI do think the housing boom in Long Island City is forcing the neighborhood to evolve in some positive ways, bringing more offerings that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201dMr. Nunberg\u2019s decision to move was part of a real estate evolution for him. \u201cWhen I was growing up, I really thought I\u2019d be living in Manhattan my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cI just thought that was the place to be. I thought everyone wanted to be there.\u201dWhen certain parts of Brooklyn became coveted alternatives to Manhattan, he and his wife, Abby, looked there. But, he said, \u201cwe were offered the world\u2019s smallest apartment in Clinton Hill, and I think we would have killed each other if we lived there.\u201dThen a broker showed the couple a one-bedroom renting for less than $3,000 a month in Long Island City. \u201cIt was perfect for us, with its convenience to getting to the city, the neighborhood being up-and-coming, and the apartment was brand-new and super-affordable for us,\u201d he said.Having based myself in Brooklyn, I found that I share this mentality. What is perfect for me now is not what was perfect in my youth. I found what Mr. Nunberg found, but in Williamsburg: a quiet two-bedroom on the top floor of a red brick building that for its size and access to the city seems like a steal. And from there I can look out my window and see the Manhattan skyline.An article last Sunday about Manhattan natives who cannot afford to live there as adults but are finding that there is life in other boroughs misidentified, in some editions, the birthplace of Michelle Bar, who now lives in NoHo, and misstated the surname of her boyfriend. Ms. Bar was born on the Upper East Side, not the Upper West Side, and her boyfriend is Alex Gumer, not Grommer.Advertisement"}

Baumol, 95, \u2018One of the Great Economists of His Generation,\u2019 Dies", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byProfessor Baumol, who taught for decades at both Princeton University and New York University, identified what has come to be known as Baumol\u2019s cost disease. This so-called affliction is actually a critically important economic insight that explains why the cost of services, like haircuts and college educations, rises faster than the cost of goods, like T-shirts.It was in 1965 that Professor Baumol began explaining how technological advances raise productivity and naturally push up wages as workers are able to produce more goods, from hammers to coffee cups, at lower cost.But those same increases in productivity, he found, do not apply to labor-intensive activities like concert performances, doctor examinations, college lectures, soccer matches and oil changes.For example, he said, it takes exactly the same number of people and the same amount of time to play a Beethoven string quartet today as it did in, say, 1817. Yet the musicians who spent years studying and practicing \u2014 and still have to eat and live somewhere while doing that \u2014 cannot be paid the same as their 19th-century counterparts. Their wages, too, will rise, even though they are no more productive than their predecessors were. As a result, their work eventually becomes increasingly expensive compared with more efficiently produced goods.There is no cure for the cost disease, Professor Baumol said, and he warned that the rising relative expense of health care, education and other essential services, including garbage collection and police patrols, would make them seem less and less affordable.\u201cWhat this says is that the quality of life 30 years from now could deteriorate,\u201d Professor Baumol said in 1983, \u201cbecause many of the services that we associate with quality of life will become relatively more expensive while mass-produced things become cheaper and cheaper.\u201dHis work influenced not only generations of economists but also policy makers, including the architects of the Clinton administration\u2019s health care initiative \u2014 even if his ideas were not always incorporated in the final product.\u201cCost increases are in the nature of the health care beast,\u201d he wrote in an essay in The New York Times in 1993. \u201cEfforts to alter this nature will be fruitless or harmful.\u201cThe real danger is that the nation, mistakenly thinking it must rein in runaway costs, will curtail valuable health services and render them inaccessible for the less affluent. Well-meaning reformers may take the same misstep in education, law enforcement and other handicraft services.\u201dHis insight about the low productivity growth in services also helped explain why overall growth in an economy increasingly dominated by services can stagnate.Professor Baumol did pioneering research \u2014 published in dozens of books, hundreds of papers and several congressional testimonies \u2014 on entrepreneurs, environmental policy, corporate finance, stock sales, the economics of Broadway theaters, inflation, and competition and monopolies, winning a wagon-full of awards and prizes along the way.William Jack Baumol was born in the South Bronx on Feb. 22, 1922, to Solomon and Lillian Baumol, immigrants from Eastern Europe. His interest in economics, he said, began in high school, after he started reading the works of Karl Marx. His parents, he said, instilled in him a strong social conscience.He served in the Army in World War II and got a job at the Agriculture Department, where he worked on allocating grain supplies to starving countries.He graduated from City College, where he met his future wife, Hilda Missel, and he enrolled in the London School of Economics in 1947 after initially being rejected. Less than six weeks after school started, he was hired to become a member of the faculty.He landed at Princeton in 1949 and remained there for the rest of his life as a researcher and eventually as a professor emeritus. He joined the faculty of N.Y.U. in 1971 and retired from there only in 2014.Art was Professor Baumol\u2019s other passion: He painted in oils and had a one-man show in New York. He braced himself against the possibility of negative reviews by declaring that he rejected the idea of set standards for aesthetic criticism. \u201cI like Mozart better than rock \u2019n\u2019 roll,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because of the way I happened to have been educated.\u201dHe later began sculpting in wood before moving on to computer art.\u201cNobody ever explained to him the difference between work and play,\u201d Daniel Baumol said of his father. \u201cDuring a long trip, he would sit in the back of the car, oblivious to the world, and as we pulled in, he would announce, \u2018I just finished that article.\u2019\u201dPatrick Bolton, a professor of economics at Columbia, described Professor Baumol as \u201csomeone who could come to a big problem and bring an extremely simple analysis that really shaped the way people would think about it.\u201dAsked by the economist Alan Krueger in 2000 where his blockbuster ideas came from, Professor Baumol said he was always looking for a theory to explain any given human phenomenon, and if he were lucky, his speculation would turn out to be right.\u201cAnd sometimes I\u2019m very lucky,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I turn out to be totally wrong.

{"Headline": "A Dignified End for New York\u2019s Forgotten Veterans", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byErnest R. Garcia\u2019s body sat for more than a month in his Bronx apartment before the authorities finally entered in January and found it decomposing.\u201cThey had to bring in a fumigation team, the smell was so bad,\u201d said Clarence Smith, 73, a neighbor of Mr. Garcia, who had died of a heart attack at age 72.But there was one pivotal fact that steered Mr. Garcia away from this grim fate \u2014 he was a veteran, an Army corporal who had served honorably during the Vietnam War, and therefore entitled to a military burial paid for by the federal government at a national veterans cemetery.Late in life, he wound up homeless and was placed in his Bronx apartment last year by city officials, who after his death recalled his veteran status and confirmed with federal officials that he was indeed eligible for a burial at Calverton National Cemetery on Long Island, complete with an honor guard and a flag-folding ceremony.Though city and federal funds are available for a coffin and transportation to a cemetery, government officials do not handle the arrangements. Instead, they rely on an unofficial network of about a half-dozen veterans groups that volunteer to help provide ceremonies and burials for the 50 or so veterans who die poor and alone in New York City every year. A similar ad hoc system provides dignified send-offs for hundreds of poor veterans across the country.In Mr. Garcia\u2019s case, city officials reached out to Paul Schottenhamel, 69, a retiree in Queens whose main duties these days are minding his young grandchildren and serving as the adjutant for the Queens County American Legion.As Mr. Schottenhamel put it, a respectable coffin headed to Calverton is far preferable to the pine boxes used in the mass graves dug on Hart Island by inmates from Rikers Island.He and other volunteers help schedule burials and organize viewings by engaging funeral homeowners to provide services for little or no fee. They recruit groups of veterans to attend because mourners who knew the deceased almost never come.James Mullarkey, commander of Post 222 of the Catholic War Veterans, said his group had organized memorial services for about 60 unclaimed veterans in the past 30 months, \u201cand only once did a loved one show up \u2014 one veteran\u2019s landlady who rented him a room.\u201dOn a recent weekday, Mr. Mullarkey, an Army special forces captain who served in Vietnam, stood at the George Werst Funeral Home in Queens, gazing at three flag-draped coffins containing Corporal Garcia and two other service members \u2014 Gilfred D. Sowell and Cesar Irizarry, Air Force veterans who served during the Vietnam and Korean Wars, respectively.Two dozen military veterans filed into the funeral home, which has held about 100 free services for unclaimed veterans and has donated coffins and transported bodies to Calverton.Mr. Schottenhamel announced that the three veterans had been \u201ccalled to the high command.\u201d With no details known about their lives, the service was brief.\u201cWe know nothing more about these men, but we don\u2019t need to know anything more than that they honorably served their country,\u201d said Mr. Schottenhamel, who served in Vietnam and has helped arrange burials for 52 veterans.Though special outreach and housing programs have reduced the number of homeless veterans in New York City to 500 today from about 5,000 five years ago, many veterans still die alone in shelters and on the street.Cassie Erpenbeck, an outreach supervisor with the city\u2019s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said workers check for military affiliation as part of the review process of all unclaimed bodies, including contacting hospitals, friends and neighbors and looking for any indication of military service, such as a military-themed tattoo, a snapshot in uniform or a military benefits card.Possible veterans cases are then referred to Ines Adan, director for human services at the city\u2019s Department of Veterans\u2019 Services, who confirms eligibility for a military burial, something she has done for more than 400 unclaimed veterans since 2008, she said.She then reaches out to veterans groups, whose names get listed on each unclaimed veteran\u2019s paperwork as \u201cunrelated next of kin.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the circumstances were, where these folks became disenfranchised from their families,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they raised their hand for their country and for everything we hold dear, so they are eligible for their final honors.\u201dFor unclaimed veterans, the National Cemetery Administration, part of the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, offers up to $2,069 for a coffin, up to $163 for an urn, a $300 burial allowance and additional funds for transportation to national veterans cemeteries.Last year, Cemetery Administration officials said benefits were paid for the burials of 390 unclaimed veterans.But many more burials have been financed and organized by groups like the Homeless Veterans Burial Program run by Dignity Memorial, a national network of funeral, cremation and cemetery service providers owned by Service Corporation International.Since the burial program was established in 2000, it has helped bury more than 3,000 unclaimed veterans, officials said, all without government financing. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s a good enough cause to help out these veterans who might otherwise have ended up in a pauper\u2019s grave,\u201d said Bob Budway, a Navy veteran who runs Dignity Memorial in the New York City area.The program expanded to New York six years ago to help organize the burial of 20 unclaimed veterans from New York City in a single ceremony at Calverton, with the help of the Missing in America Project, a volunteer network that contacts funeral homes, morgues and crematories nationwide to identify unclaimed veterans.At the recent service in Queens for the three veterans, Mr. Smith sat in front of Mr. Garcia\u2019s coffin and recounted how he and Mr. Garcia were staying together at the Bellevue Men\u2019s Shelter in Manhattan before being placed in housing in the Bronx.Mr. Smith, also a Vietnam-era Army corporal, said he routinely checked on Mr. Garcia, and after weeks of not seeing him he became concerned. That is what led to the discovery of Mr. Garcia\u2019s body.\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s getting a proper burial, rather than ending up in potter\u2019s field,\u201d Mr. Smith said as funeral home staff members loaded the coffins into hearses and the aging veterans snapped to attention and saluted their military colleagues.Flanked by a motorcycle escort, the Patriot Guard Riders, the hearses headed east on a 90-minute trip to Calverton, where so far this year about three dozen indigent vets have been interred.At the cemetery, Pete Jepson, one of the Patriot Guard Riders, hopped off his Harley-Davidson and directed his riders to form a ceremonial walkway through which the coffins were guided to an alcove in a serene stand of pines.Rifle shots sounded out and a bugler played taps. An honor guard \u2014 active service members in dress uniforms \u2014 conducted the ritual folding of the American flags taken off the coffins.\u201cThese men are unsung heroes, but for whatever reason, they died alone,\u201d Mr. Jepson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Flynn Misled Pentagon About Russia Ties, Letter Says", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, misled Pentagon investigators about his income from companies in Russia and contacts with officials there when he applied for a renewal of his top-secret security clearance last year, according to a letter released Monday by the top Democrat on the House oversight committee.The House letter, written by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, was made public hours after Mr. Flynn formally rejected a subpoena from senators investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and chose to instead invoke his right against self-incrimination, a person familiar with his decision said.Mr. Flynn had been ordered by the Senate Intelligence Committee to hand over emails and other records related to any dealings with Russians as part of that panel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. His decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment right puts him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, which can also result in a criminal charge.\u201cHe is the target on a nearly daily basis of outrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the United States government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by evidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him,\u201d his lawyers wrote.They also reiterated his willingness to testify in exchange for immunity. A lawyer for Mr. Flynn, Robert Kelner, did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Cummings\u2019s letter.The controversies surrounding the Trump White House\u2019s ties to Russia have overshadowed the early months of the new administration, and Mr. Flynn has been at the center of the maelstrom. He is under scrutiny both by congressional committees and by federal law enforcement agencies for his ties to Russia and his business dealings with Turkey.In a letter to Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking minority member, requested a subpoena for documents related to any connections between Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, and Russia. In the request, Mr. Cummings highlights an encounter between Mr. Flynn and high-level Russian officials that he failed to disclose for a security clearance check as reasoning for the subpoena.Lawmakers previously said that Mr. Flynn had failed to disclose the income he received for the Moscow trip when he was seeking clearance to work in the White House. The letter released Monday showed that he had misled investigators during a previous attempt to renew his clearance, months before Mr. Trump was elected.Mr. Cummings\u2019s letter indicated that Mr. Flynn misled Pentagon investigators during the clearance process, including during an in-person interview in February 2016. Mr. Cummings quoted directly from the Pentagon report detailing Mr. Flynn\u2019s clearance process. The document itself was not included with his letter, sent to Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican who is the chairman of the oversight committee.As Mr. Flynn\u2019s legal problems have accumulated, White House officials have tried to distance themselves from him. They have also tried to shift blame, pointing out that it was during the Obama administration that his security clearance was renewed. Mr. Flynn, a former three-star general, ran the Defense Intelligence Agency from mid-2012 until 2014.The House committee has asked the White House to turn over all documents used by Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to vet Mr. Flynn, as well as any communications among Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides about Mr. Flynn\u2019s contacts with foreign officials.The White House has thus far refused to comply with the request. Mr. Cummings has been pushing Mr. Chaffetz to issue a subpoena demanding the documents.\u201cIn refusing our requests for a subpoena, you have made the same argument as President Trump \u2014 that you believe the White House bears no responsibility for vetting General Flynn for the position of national security adviser because he received his latest security clearance renewal under the Obama administration in early 2016,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote to Mr. Chaffetz.Previous documents released by the oversight committee revealed that Mr. Flynn was paid more than $65,000 by companies linked to Russia in 2015. In addition to RT, he received $11,250 from a Russian cargo airline, Volga-Dnepr Airlines, which had been implicated in a bribery scheme involving Russian officials at the United Nations. In October 2015, he was paid another $11,250 by Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, the American branch of a Russian cybersecurity firm.Retired generals are ordinarily allowed to keep a clearance as a courtesy, but they must report all income from foreign sources to the Pentagon. Possessing a security clearance opens up potentially lucrative jobs with government contractors, who prize contacts and insider knowledge.In a letter to Congress last month, the Pentagon\u2019s acting inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, said his office had opened an investigation into whether Mr. Flynn failed to properly report income from foreign governments.As for his refusal to comply with the Senate\u2019s subpoena, it is up to lawmakers to decide whether to hold him in contempt of Congress. Mr. Flynn said in March that he would talk to congressional investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Lawmakers declined his offer, though they did not rule out the possibility of revisiting the issue.Senators Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman and Democratic vice chairman, vowed in a statement to continue seeking the documents, as well as Mr. Flynn\u2019s testimony.Two other people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit during the campaign \u2014 Roger Stone, a longtime adviser, and Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman \u2014 have provided some documents requested by the Senate Intelligence Committee, a person close to the investigation said Monday.His assertion of the Fifth Amendment may not hold up in court. Raymond Granger, a New York-based lawyer and former state and federal prosecutor, said it was \u201ca common mistake\u201d for witnesses to try to apply their right to protect themselves against self-incrimination to documents.\u201cHowever, if they try to litigate this, they would lose quickly and badly,\u201d Mr. Granger said of Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyers. He said the Fifth Amendment generally does not apply to documents because it is intended to shield Americans from having their compelled statements used against them \u2014 not statements made voluntarily, such as on a document, or supplied by a third party.Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyers disputed that notion in their letter, referring to producing the documents as \u201ca testimonial act\u201d that would be protected by the Fifth Amendment.Should he testify before the committee, Mr. Flynn could invoke his Fifth Amendment right at that time.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who ran Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team until a few days after the election, said publicly for the first time Monday that he had advised Mr. Trump against selecting Mr. Flynn for a White House position.\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that General Flynn and I didn\u2019t see eye to eye,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters during a news conference in Trenton. \u201cAnd that I didn\u2019t think that he was someone who would bring benefit to the president or to the administration. And I made that very clear to candidate Trump, and I made it very clear to President-elect Trump.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Chaffetz said he had decided to postpone a potential oversight committee hearing with testimony from Mr. Comey after the two spoke Monday.Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Corasaniti from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

A director of communications at Caixin, Ma Ling, declined to answer questions and referred to the online statement.Caixin\u2019s latest report on Anbang has been part of a burst of unwelcome attention for the company and Mr. Wu, which has thrown into doubt his business acumen and his reputation for political invulnerability.A lawsuit would pit a company that has recently appeared politically vulnerable against a magazine that has proved skilled at navigating censorship to report on corruption and financial shenanigans in China.The questions raised by the article, and by the possibility of a lawsuit, may test whether the desire for stability will outweigh the government\u2019s vows to take on nettlesome financial issues.\u201cAnbang is definitely a little bit more extreme and more aggressive than other Chinese insurance companies,\u201d Mr. Balding said. \u201cBut at the same time, if you look at the finances of the insurance industry at large, and at individual insurance companies, their revenue and building and things like that were exploding by just astounding rates in the past few years.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s family and personal ties are at the heart of the growing questions about Anbang, which he co-founded in 2004.Now Caixin has laid out similar doubts for its readers. The Chinese news media had already raised questions about Anbang\u2019s spending spree, but Caixin stepped into more sensitive territory by examining the group\u2019s ownership and accounts in painstaking detail.In 18 months from October 2014, Caixin estimated, Anbang had spent $16 billion on overseas acquisitions. But Caixin also said Anbang\u2019s successive injections of capital, which have helped finance these deals, appeared to often involve companies linked to Mr. Wu\u2019s relatives and associates, raising the possibility that they were not real injections by outside investors.Anbang appeared to have \u201cused circular injections of funding to magnify its capital,\u201d the report said.The Caixin report said those doubts were reinforced by Anbang\u2019s complicated ownership. Many of those companies registered under obscure addresses, with little capital registered in their names, and often they were formed in clusters shortly before they bought into Anbang \u2014 findings that echo the Times report. The names, addresses and other details of dozens of people registered as holding shares suggested that they were Mr. Wu\u2019s relatives and associates.Until recent days, Anbang was mostly silent about the reports on Mr. Wu and the group\u2019s finances, including internet-born rumors that he had been held as part of a criminal investigation. No Chinese officials have said anything to suggest that Mr. Wu was detained or under investigation.Mr. Wu said in the interview that Anbang was especially enthusiastic about Mr. Xi\u2019s plan to expand Chinese investment and construction abroad in a much-promoted plan called \u201cOne Belt, One Road.\u201d Now investors and political analysts will watch to see whether Mr. Xi\u2019s government takes sides in the dispute between Anbang and Caixin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why China\u2019s Growing Debt Load Worries the World", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byMoody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating of China\u2019s sovereign debt one notch on Wednesday, citing concerns over growing debt in the country, which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In recent years, as China\u2019s stunning economic performance of past decades has become difficult to sustain, the country has used debt to fuel growth.Now, Moody\u2019s says, China will have to borrow more and more to maintain the levels of economic growth the government wants. The concerns Moody\u2019s raises will sound familiar to those who follow the Chinese economy closely. Expressed by one of the world\u2019s top credit ratings agencies, however, the misgivings will be harder to ignore.In short: China doesn\u2019t just have debt; it has a lot, and has accumulated it very fast.When it comes to pumping money into a financial system, China has made the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank look almost lackadaisical. It has expanded its broadly measured money supply by more than the rest of the world combined since the global financial crisis. Now it has 70 percent more money sloshing around its economy than the United States does, even though the American economy is bigger.China has accumulated its towering debt remarkably quickly. Goldman Sachs looked last year at how fast debt had accumulated relative to the size of the economy in 55 countries since 1960. It found that by the end of 2015, China was already in the top 2 percent of all credit expansions \u2014 and its debt shot up even higher last year. All of the other large expansions occurred in very small economies, some of which essentially lost control of their finances.The incredible part is that Goldman Sachs acknowledges that its calculations may underestimate the extent of China\u2019s debt buildup.That\u2019s because Goldman\u2019s calculations exclude what is often called shadow banking, a little-regulated, murky area of finance outside traditional banking channels in which China has also emerged as a world leader.Bank lending jumped 10 percent last year in China. But, over the same period, investments known as wealth management products, a speculative category of loans and other investments that banks keep off their balance sheets, zoomed up 30 percent.More than half of the bank debt in China consists of loans from state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.The banks are not going to cut off lending to even the most debt-ridden state-owned enterprises. Already, economic growth is showing some signs of slowing after a strong start in the first three months of this year. Tighter lending policies could result in factories closing and in unemployment, as well as in defaults on previously issued loans.Chinese families and companies might start smuggling more money out of the country, further weakening the financial system. China has $3 trillion in foreign reserves to counter that, but even that large sum would not last forever.If China\u2019s residential real estate prices tumble, construction companies and developers may be unable to repay their debts, which could also hurt banks.It could accept a lower pace of economic growth, but that might risk fewer jobs for its vast work force.It could bail out the banking system, but that could lead its borrowers to believe that the government will always be there to rescue them.Or it could do nothing, and hope its debt does not weaken the economy further or create a broad financial crisis someday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Property Brothers Are Fixing to Take Over the World", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byGALVESTON, Tex. \u2014 Inside a bungalow under renovation, Jonathan Scott, one half of the squeaky-clean Property Brothers, was yanking a toilet out from the floor.\u201cLet\u2019s do it one more time,\u201d said a producer, watching from a nearby monitor.Mr. Scott walked into the small bathroom again, acting surprised as he spied the toilet. Then he pulled it from the floor.Mr. Scott, who is a perfect mix of rugged and well coifed, a man who gets his work boots dirty even as his hair stays untousled, went for a house that could be considered a major fixer-upper. His identical twin brother, Drew, who is as handsome if not quite as hair-sprayed, and favors suits and ties over Timberlands, opted for a ramshackle heap that was larger and had better access to some of the island\u2019s canals.\u201cHe\u2019s desperate to win,\u201d said Jonathan, who has won on the last two seasons of the show. \u201cI was also born first, so I also won that competition,\u201d he said, a joke typical of the brothers\u2019 repartee both on- and offscreen.Around the corner, in a different bayside house sitting high up on stilts, Drew was dealing with dislodged materials for his own renovation. The day before, strong winds had ripped a thin metal chimney from the roof. It had landed to the side of the driveway. Now it was time to recreate the scene. \u201cThis is a high-intensity moment,\u201d a production assistant whispered.The director called to the house, \u201cI need some workers out front!\u201d A crew of tradesmen walked out onto a second-floor porch and pretended to work.\u201cBang!\u201d the director said.Drew ran from the house. He looked at the chimney with feigned shock. He rubbed his eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s do the run out again,\u201d the director said.Drew walked back inside and ran out again. He pretended to notice the chimney again, and looked up toward the workmen. \u201cGo inside, guys! I don\u2019t want you to work outside; it\u2019s too windy!\u201dThe workers went back inside, and then came back out, and went in, for a third take.\u201cAt the end of the day, it has to be interesting television,\u201d Drew said later. \u201cBut when we find a load-bearing wall, we are really finding a load-bearing wall.\u201dAt a time when politics have riven the nation, an old-fashioned, wholesome shelter show is something many can agree on. In seven years, Drew and Jonathan Scott, 39, have gone from aspiring celebrities on a small Canadian cable network to HGTV headliners who star in, and in some cases produce, some of the most popular television shows in America.They know that some of their fans are supporters of President Trump, but Jonathan is not a fan. \u201cI believe our show is about finding solutions for the little guy, and I think the current administration is doing stuff that is counterproductive to serving the little guy,\u201d he said.Property Brothers programming is now international, on the air in more than 150 countries. The brothers live in a constant cycle of product promotion and never tire of posing for selfies with fans from San Antonio to Singapore, where they were met by thousands when they visited. This was initially a surprise to them, since Asian housing stock and ways of living differ so greatly from those of North America. But, Jonathan pointed out, \u201cEveryone lives somewhere.\u201dThough both brothers are constantly promoting themselves, they agree that Drew is more high-strung, a man who took a conference call while atop the Eiffel Tower, and who won\u2019t attempt a leisure activity without taking lessons (currently: Ping-Pong, guitar and golf).\u201cI\u2019m very good at relaxing,\u201d said Jonathan, who comes off as a Type A-minus at best.\u201cI am so anal about everything,\u201d Drew said.The Scotts\u2019 mother and father are involved in the family business too.Jim Scott, 83, immigrated from Scotland, eventually settling in western Canada, where he worked as a horse stuntman, then as a director\u2019s assistant on the set of Hollywood movies shot on location near Vancouver. He has told his sons about an idea for a film in which a cowboy is unjustly sent to prison and struggles to adapt to a changed world upon his release. His sons gave him a deadline, and he wrote the screenplay on a typewriter. They say they plan to produce the film one day.Joanne Scott, 73, spends a lot of time following her sons on social media platforms and looking for comments left by followers that might be off-Scott-brand. \u201cIf there is anything I think needs their attention,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m on the phone.\u201dThe Scott brothers realize that their wholesomeness is the key to their appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s safe programming,\u201d Drew said over a gluten-free lunch quickly eaten amid the filming of \u201cBrother vs. Brother.\u201d \u201cThe shows are not so foofy that guys don\u2019t want to watch, kids want to watch because we\u2019re goofy and women appreciate it because you\u2019re getting real design knowledge.\u201dThey do, however, enjoy many perks. Just a few days before Barack Obama left the White House, the brothers took a private tour of the Oval Office and West Wing. (\u201cThere is a lot of great character you would want to keep,\u201d Drew said, \u201cbut there are a lot of things that are due for an update.\u201d) They recently visited NASA and experienced virtual reality with astronauts. While filming in Galveston, they took in a Houston Rockets game and played Ping-Pong with the team\u2019s general manager.When they were children, they said, they performed frequently in comedy and improv, and as clowns for hire. The brothers began buying, renovating and flipping real estate when they were 18. The idea was to use real estate as a vehicle to finance careers in entertainment.In 2009, producers in Canada saw an opportunity to get in on the reality TV real estate boom. The pitch, Jonathan said, was \u201ctwo good looking guys in tight jeans doing home renovations; we said, \u2018Sure, we\u2019ll do that.\u2019\u201d The show aired on Canadian cable in 2010 and in 2011 was picked up by HGTV.Their ambitions go much further than posts and beams.They would like to do a talk show, and say they have been approached by \u201cseveral big broadcast networks\u201d but don\u2019t think the timing is right. Jonathan said he was \u201cvery into conservation and solar energy.\u201d He has written a documentary series about renewable energy, and would like to write more in the future, moving beyond his usual output of \u201cinspirational things and cheesy things for our fans.\u201dTogether, the brothers have also written two screenplays, which they plan to produce (in addition to their father\u2019s cowboy picture). The first one they would like to make, Jonathan said, is \u201ca dark comedy that follows the life of a professional \u2018hook up\u2019 artist as he discovers his own loneliness through the romantic misery of others \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like \u2018Hitch\u2019 meets \u2018The Hangover.\u2019\u201d Another, he added, \u201cis about a band of brothers who come from a small-town upbringing with wholesome values.\u201dWho might they envision playing the lead roles? Originally Drew envisioned his brother and himself as the stars. But what he really wants to do is direct.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Republicans Move to Gut Bank Regulations", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans took a big step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, and they took a small step toward dismantling another of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature pieces of legislation, the Dodd-Frank Act.With only the support of Republicans, the House Financial Services Committee voted in favor of the Financial Choice Act, a bill that would gut central financial regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The bill is expected to get a vote from the full House in the coming months. But, in its current form, it is not expected to pass in the Senate, where it would need support from Democrats to garner the necessary 60 votes.The Choice Act would exempt some financial institutions from capital and liquidity requirements, essentially excusing them from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act if they hold enough cash.It would replace the Orderly Liquidation Authority, which critics say reinforces the idea that some banks are too big to fail, with a new bankruptcy code provision intended for large financial institutions.It also would weaken the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the proposed law, the president could fire the agency\u2019s director at will.Republicans hailed the committee vote as a win for financial institutions. \u201cOur plan replaces Dodd-Frank\u2019s growth-strangling regulations on small banks and credit unions with reforms that expand access to capital so small businesses on Main Street can grow and create jobs,\u201d said Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.After a long markup section, the nearly 600-page bill passed, 34 to 26. The 19 amendments Democrats offered were rejected.They assailed the legislation as a giveaway to the banks. \u201cThe Wrong Choice Act is a deeply misguided measure that would bring harm to consumers, investors and our whole economy,\u201d said Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee. \u201cThe bill is rotten to the core and incredibly divisive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also dead on arrival in the Senate, and has no chance of becoming law.\u201dProgressive groups argued that the push to unravel Dodd-Frank was at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign message that the economy was rigged in favor of corporate interests.\u201cIt is an enormous package of gifts for Wall Street and the worst actors in finance,\u201d said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, who said the bill House Republicans passed would increase the likelihood of another financial crisis.The banking industry\u2019s top lobbyist, Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, cheered the committee\u2019s vote. \u201cThe thousands of pages of new regulations facing banks have become a tremendous driver of decisions to sell or merge,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the cost of complying with all the new rules, some community banks are having to choose between meeting those regulatory requirements and meeting the financial needs of their individual and business customers.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said at a Milken Institute conference in California this week that financial deregulation was one of his priorities. He assured the bankers in the audience that they would be pleased with his efforts.\u201cYou should all thank me for your bank stocks doing better,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Pay for Syngenta, ChemChina Looks to Beijing for Help", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe deal, China\u2019s largest foreign takeover ever, is nearing completion after more than 15 stressful months during which its success often looked in doubt. While ChemChina quickly amassed huge bridge loans so it could pay Syngenta stockholders, it was less obvious what the longer-term funding structure would look like. The deal-hungry buyer already had a stretched balance sheet, limiting its own ability to contribute equity.United States regulatory filings now provide a partial answer to that question \u2014 and an unconventional answer at that. The buyer is supplying $5 billion of equity, equating to roughly 11 percent of Syngenta\u2019s value. For a conventional Western private equity deal, that would be far too thin a sliver for lenders or regulators \u2014 but then, this deal is effectively backed by the People\u2019s Republic of China.As for the remainder, ChemChina will hold on to about $19.3 billion of existing debt for now, and borrow $2 billion through new notes via Morgan Stanley. The rest will be supplied by the Bank of China, the asset manager China Reform and Industrial Bank, which have bought perpetual bonds worth $10 billion, $7 billion and $1 billion respectively.Given their indefinite life span, these bonds look rather like equity; it is also not clear how likely they are to pay regular coupons.The cost of all this perpetual debt is not disclosed, but this may well be cheaper than actual equity for the borrower, and lets ChemChina keep control of Syngenta to boot. It is harder to see the appeal for the buyers. These are big exposures, even for large public sector institutions. Over all, it appears that the state, which is reportedly also contemplating a bigger tie-up between ChemChina and rival Sinochem, has prodded three of its wards into supporting a fourth to nail down a strategically important deal. No wonder, since China wants Syngenta\u2019s crop technology very badly. This is corporate finance with Chinese characteristics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Proponents of Carriage Horse Ban Say They Won\u2019t Try to Unseat de Blasio", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe group of animal rights activists that pushed most strongly for a horse-carriage ban in New York City \u2014 providing Bill de Blasio a crucial early boost in his bid to be mayor, only to be let down when he failed to deliver the ban \u2014 is gearing up to play a role in the election this year.But the leaders of the group, New Yorkers for Clean, Livable and Safe Streets, known as NYClass, said they did not intend to try to unseat Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, even though he had not fulfilled his campaign pledge.\u201cObviously we\u2019re very disappointed that the mayor\u2019s not done anything at this stage,\u201d Wendy Neu, a NYClass leader, said. \u201cWe have very loyal supporters that would like to go after the mayor and hold him accountable.\u201dWith Mr. de Blasio facing no serious primary challengers and a potential field of inexperienced Republican and independent hopefuls, Ms. Neu and Stephen W. Nislick, another leader of the group, said they believed the mayor was virtually assured re-election in November. So while the group will step up protests at his events to remind him of his unfulfilled promise, Ms. Neu said, its main focus will be on City Council races, in the hope of building a majority to support a ban.\u201cThey\u2019re certainly angry and rightly so,\u201d Ms. Neu said of her group\u2019s members. \u201cBut to do a Quinn on de Blasio would be self-defeating and not in the best interests of the horses.\u201dIn contrast to 2013, the mayor and other citywide officials all are incumbents widely viewed as being all but assured of re-election, few Council seats are up for grabs, and there is widespread fatigue among elected officials with the group\u2019s signature issue.He said NYClass needed to do the grunt work of building support. \u201cI think they have to go out and do the lobbying and networking with Council members to explain the situation,\u201d Mr. Dromm said.The group recently sent Council members a questionnaire asking for their stance on a variety of animal rights issues, including the horse carriage ban. This summer it plans to send the questionnaire to Council candidates who have registered to run in November.The group\u2019s focus will be on a small number of Council races where the incumbent cannot run because of term limits. It will also closely follow the jockeying to become the new Council speaker, who will be chosen in January and whose support will be essential to moving a carriage ban forward.The group would not say how much it expected to spend in advertising or on other activities in those races. In 2013, it spent $65,643 to support six Council candidates and the winning comptroller candidate, Scott M. Stringer, according to campaign finance records. But its greater influence came in the anti-Quinn effort, to which it gave $123,000.\u201cThe time for an end to horse carriages is now,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said during a candidate forum in May 2013, eliciting loud applause from an audience of animal rights activists. He received large contributions from prominent activists, including Ms. Neu; Mr. Nislick; the artist Peter Max and his wife, Mary; and their followers.The activists maintain that it is cruel to make horses occupy the same busy streets as cars and trucks, and they point to incidents when horses are injured. They say that the animals work in extremes of heat and cold and that the conditions in the stables where they are kept are inhumane \u2014 accusations that the carriage industry denies.But Day 1 came and went with no action, and almost a year passed before Mr. Dromm introduced his legislation to phase out the industry. That legislation died, however, amid protests by the drivers, polls showing a majority of New Yorkers wanted the carriages to remain and lukewarm support in the Council.A spokesman for the mayor\u2019s campaign, Dan Levitan, said in a written statement that \u201cno mayor has gone further to protect animals in New York City.\u201dHe cited several of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s initiatives, including building two new animal shelters, mandating sprinklers and smoke alarms in pet shops and veterinary clinics, and creating an animal cruelty investigation squad in the Police Department. He did not directly address the issue of carriage horses or the failed ban.The carriage issue eventually became tangled in a series of investigations into the mayor\u2019s fund-raising practices, with a focus on a nonprofit created to support his policies, called the Campaign for One New York. Ms. Neu and Mr. Nislick both contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the nonprofit, and they were subpoenaed and questioned by investigators.They said their lawyer had urged them to maintain a low profile while the investigation was underway, but he released them from that stricture after prosecutors said in March that the mayor would not be charged with any wrongdoing as a result of those investigations.That has cleared the way for their re-emergence as a political factor, the NYClass leaders said.\u201cBring it on,\u201d said Ian McKeever, a leader among the carriage owners and drivers. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried this before, and they can\u2019t get anywhere.\u201dMr. McKeever said that, contrary to the accusations of abuse from animal rights advocates, the drivers had shown that they treat the horses well.\u201cThe City Council doesn\u2019t want to go near anything that has to do with horses and carriages,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re sick of it.\u201dMs. Neu said Mr. de Blasio had promised to meet with the group, a meeting that she expects will take place within weeks. She said there were several measures that Mr. de Blasio could take immediately to improve conditions for the horses, which would not need City Council approval, including moving the location where the carriages wait for passengers from heavily trafficked Central Park South and banning the carriages from Times Square. Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, confirmed that a meeting would occur.Neither Ms. Neu nor Mr. Nislick has contributed to the mayor\u2019s re-election campaign, and they said Mr. de Blasio had not asked them to. \u201cHe\u2019s not calling us the way he was in 2013,\u201d Ms. Neu said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mattis Says Escalation Against ISIS Doesn\u2019t Imperil More Civilians", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States began accelerating and intensifying its campaign against the Islamic State in January, at President Trump\u2019s direction, but it was not putting civilians in war zones at greater risk, the defense secretary said Friday.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to delegate more authority to commanders had put greater pressure on militants in Syria, Yemen and Somalia. And he said a tactical shift to surround Islamic State strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, was devised not only to \u201cannihilate\u201d thousands of fighters hunkered down there, but also to prevent them from returning to their home nations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, possibly to commit mayhem in those places.\u201cI want to emphasize here there has been no change to our rules of engagement, and there has been no change to our continued extraordinary efforts to avoid innocent civilian casualties,\u201d Mr. Mattis told reporters.Amid a generally upbeat assessment of the campaign against the Islamic State \u2014 known internally now as \u201cD-ISIS\u201d for \u201cDefeat ISIS,\u201d using another name for the group \u2014 Mr. Mattis struck a sobering note, saying the fight \u201cis not going to be over soon.\u201dMr. Mattis was joined by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Brett McGurk, the United States special envoy to the coalition against the Islamic State.The timing of their comments, which represent the most comprehensive report on the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against the Islamic State, was not happenstance: It came as Mr. Trump headed out on a nine-day visit to Saudi Arabia and Europe, where he will not only seek to rally support for the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but also try to gain commitments from NATO for more troops in Afghanistan.Mr. Trump seemed pleased enough with his top generals on Friday to renominate General Dunford and Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, each to a second two-year term.At the Pentagon, General Dunford ticked off some of the campaign\u2019s accomplishments, including reclaiming 55 percent of the territory the Islamic State has seized in Syria and Iraq since 2014. He said the effort has also significantly reduced the group\u2019s ability to finance its terrorist operations and draw new recruits into Iraq and Syria, down to fewer than 100 a month from a peak of 1,500 a month.Other senior American officials, including Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, have offered a more measured analysis of the impact of the global fight. Mr. Rasmussen said this month that \u201cthe global reach of ISIS remains largely intact\u201d despite the group\u2019s territorial losses.American officials now believe that about 40,000 prospective fighters from more than 120 countries have traveled to, or tried to travel to, the war zones in Iraq and Syria since 2014.In explaining the Trump administration\u2019s strangle-the-stronghold strategy, Mr. Mattis underscored a looming menace: \u201cThe foreign fighters are the strategic threat should they return home to Tunis, to Kuala Lumpur, to Paris, to Detroit, wherever.\u201dBut it is not at all clear that the Obama administration\u2019s strategy, which General Dunford himself shaped and Mr. McGurk defended, was to let Islamic State fighters escape to fight another day. American military officers have also said it was the Iraqis\u2019 idea \u2014 not the Americans\u2019 \u2014 to send the Iraqi Army west of Mosul to cut off the city.The Pentagon officials on Friday cited examples of the accelerated fight against the Islamic State.American military commanders have long contended that arming the Y.P.G., a Kurdish militia fighting alongside Syrian Arab forces against the Islamic State, is the fastest way to seize Raqqa, the capital of the militants\u2019 self-proclaimed caliphate.General Dunford said Friday that the United States had already stockpiled weapons and equipment \u2014 which other officials said could include heavy machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons, armored cars and engineering equipment \u2014 and would begin distributing them soon to Kurdish and Arab fighters in the anti-Islamic State coalition.General Dunford highlighted the recent decision to allow American military advisers to accompany Iraqi troops down to the battalion level, particularly in operations in Mosul, although it is unclear how often that happens. The Americans\u2019 proximity to Iraqi forces in the complex urban terrain allows them to provide better support.Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers are also recommending sending 3,000 to 5,000 additional American troops to try to break a stalemate in the 15-year war in Afghanistan. That final decision, Mr. Mattis said, is still pending.American forces now have broader authorities to combat militants in parts of Somalia and Yemen. But General Dunford cited a recent mission in Syria as a less recognized illustration of the latitude the Trump administration has given its commanders to carry out operations without prolonged review in Washington: an effort to take control of the Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River near Lake Assad, the nearby town of Tabqa and a local airfield.That operation, which started in March, was the first time United States helicopters airlifted hundreds of Syrian fighters and their American advisers into battle behind enemy lines in the campaign against the Islamic State.With Mr. Mattis suggesting that the fight against the Islamic State would still take years, not months, to complete, he was asked what success would look like.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to drive them down to a point that police can handle it,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cPolice can\u2019t handle a force that\u2019s driving tanks and using artillery, or has thousands of fighters in mobile vehicles that allow them to range far and wide.\u201dMichael R.

{"Headline": "At Cannes, the Glam and the Grim Mix Uneasily", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 The Cannes Film Festival has always been a jarring clash of the glam and the grim, between often dark films and the stars who pose on the red carpet to promote them. This year, news and business developments were as much on the minds of festivalgoers as the movies and the paparazzi. Here are scenes from the first days of the festival:On Tuesday afternoon the festival honored victims of the terrorist attack in Manchester, England, with a moment of silence on the red carpet, where the festival director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, and his staff had gathered. Organizers also canceled a fireworks display planned for Tuesday evening, when it will hold a gala celebrating the festival\u2019s 70th edition.In a statement on Tuesday, festival organizers expressed \u201chorror, anger and immense sadness\u201d at the Manchester bombing, adding, \u201cThis is yet another attack on culture, youth and joyfulness, on our freedom, generosity and tolerance, all things that the festival and those who make it possible \u2014 the artists, professionals and spectators \u2014 hold dear.\u201dIn many respects, the festival is carrying on as always. At a party at a beach club for the Todd Haynes film \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d Michelle Williams greeted fans while her young co-star, Jaden Michael, danced like Michael Jackson. Another co-star, Millicent Simmonds, who is deaf, chatted in sign language with her interpreter. Meanwhile, a patrol boat filled with armed officers glided along the waters in the near distance beyond a dock with a billboard for \u201cThe Emoji Movie.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t the only time American politics invaded the Croisette. At the gala dinner after the ceremony, the jury, led by Pedro Almod\u00f3var, who wore sunglasses inside, chatted at a central table while news alerts lit up cellphones about developments surrounding Mr. Trump.People seemed hooked on the news, even at parties and between strolls on the red carpet. Ben Stiller, a co-star of Noah Baumbach\u2019s competition film \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d was constantly checking for updates. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed when I don\u2019t get a news alert,\u201d Mr. Stiller said, as fans came up to snap photos with him during a party hosted by Netflix at a rose-colored villa high above the hills of Cannes on Sunday night.\u201cNetflix is having a moment,\u201d said Eric d\u2019Arbeloff, the founder, with his husband, Howard Cohen, of Roadside Attractions, as they stood beside the pool at the Netflix party. \u201cThey\u2019re shaking up the Croisette.\u201dThe situation was all anyone could talk about in the garden, amid the lighted palm trees and flowing Champagne. Would Cannes add a section for works that would go straight to streaming services, Mr. Cohen speculated, the way the 1968 social uprisings in France led it to create the Directors\u2019 Fortnight to showcase more avant-garde works? It felt like a turning point.On Monday a group of European directors, including Michael Haneke (whose \u201cHappy End\u201d is in competition), Wim Wenders and Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, issued an appeal for \u201can ambitious cultural policy\u201d covering European cinema and how streaming services are changing viewing and financing models.\u201cLoveless\u201d is about parents in the midst of a divorce, neither of whom wants custody of their son. \u201cI didn\u2019t only want to show the politics,\u201d Mr. Zvyagintsev said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a metaphysical level.\u201dEach year, thousands of journalists from around the world attend the festival constantly on the hunt for a local angle. The news conferences can be surreal, and questions range from the news of the day to how motherhood has changed actresses. At one such gathering for the fantasy film \u201cOkja,\u201d a journalist from Chile asked the director, Bong Joon-ho, how he felt about the film\u2019s genetically modified pig being advertised as coming from Chile. He said he had really wanted to go to Chile but hadn\u2019t had the chance. \u201cSo at least I went in a cinematographic way.\u201dAt the news conference for \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d a journalist from Argentina said he shared a last name with Dustin Hoffman. \u201cCan you turn sideways? I just want to see your nose,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.But Mr. Stiller also got the laugh: \u201cIt was that press tour 25 years ago,\u201d he said.In the luxury hotels lining the Croisette, industry professionals broker deals. Outside the entrances, paparazzi linger, waiting to snap pictures of stars arriving in limousines.As Charlotte Gainsbourg, in a short silver-lam\u00e9 dress, left the opening-night dinner, she was greeted by calls of \u201cCharlotte! Charlotte!\u201d from fans and photographers. She graciously posed for the cameras.\u201cIt\u2019s just part of the game,\u201d she said in an interview later. She is a co-star in Arnaud Desplechin\u2019s \u201cIsmael\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d which opened the festival out of competition and was deemed very French by many American critics.\u201cI\u2019m not very good with all the promotion and that kind of life after a film,\u201d she added, then recalled something her father, the singer-songwriter, actor and director Serge Gainsbourg, told her. \u201cBecause I used to sulk a lot, he used to say, \u2018The day it all stops, then you\u2019ll see the pain.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Whistle-Blower Tells of Health Insurers Bilking Medicare", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byWhen Medicare was facing an impossible $13 trillion funding gap, Congress opted for a bold fix: It handed over part of the program to insurance companies, expecting them to provide better care at a lower cost. The new program was named Medicare Advantage.But now a whistle-blower, a former well-placed official at UnitedHealth Group, asserts that the big insurance companies have been systematically bilking Medicare Advantage for years, reaping billions of taxpayer dollars from the program by gaming the payment system.The Justice Department takes the whistle-blower\u2019s claims so seriously that it has said it intends to sue the whistle-blower\u2019s former employer, UnitedHealth Group, even as it investigates other Medicare Advantage participants. The agency has until the end of Tuesday to take action against UnitedHealth.In the first interview since his allegations were made public, the whistle-blower, Benjamin Poehling of Bloomington, Minn., described in detail how his company and others like it \u2014 in his view \u2014 gamed the system: Finance directors like him monitored projects that UnitedHealth had designed to make patients look sicker than they were, by scouring patients\u2019 health records electronically and finding ways to goose the diagnosis codes.The sicker the patient, the more UnitedHealth was paid by Medicare Advantage \u2014 and the bigger the bonuses people earned, including Mr. Poehling.\u201cThey\u2019ve set up a perfect scheme here,\u201d Mr. Poehling said in an interview. \u201cIt was rigged so there was no way they could lose.\u201dA spokesman for UnitedHealth, Matthew A. Burns, said the company rejected Mr. Poehling\u2019s allegations and would contest them vigorously.\u201cWe are confident our company and our employees complied with the government\u2019s Medicare Advantage program rules, and we have been transparent with C.M.S. about our approach under its murky policies,\u201d he said, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare Advantage.Mr. Burns also said Mr. Poehling\u2019s complaints and similar ones held UnitedHealth and other Medicare Advantage participants to higher standards than the ones used by the original Medicare program.Mr. Poehling\u2019s suit, filed under the False Claims Act, seeks to recover excess payments, and big penalties, for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. (Mr. Poehling would earn a percentage of any money recovered.) The amounts in question industrywide are mind-boggling: Some analysts estimate improper Medicare Advantage payments at $10 billion a year or more.At the heart of the dispute: The government pays insurers extra to enroll people with more serious medical problems, to discourage them from cherry-picking healthy people for their Medicare Advantage plans. The higher payments are determined by a complicated risk scoring system, which has nothing to do with the treatments people get from their doctors; rather, it is all about diagnoses.Diabetes, for example, can raise risk scores by varying amounts, depending on a patient\u2019s complications. So UnitedHealth gave people with diabetes intensive scrutiny, to see if they had any other conditions that the diabetes might have caused.As Mr. Poehling\u2019s lawyer, Mary Inman, described it, the government would pay UnitedHealth $9,580 a year for enrolling a 76-year-old woman with diabetes and kidney failure, for instance, but if the company claimed that her diabetes had actually caused her kidney failure, the payment rose to $12,902 \u2014 an additional $3,322. Ms. Inman is with the law firm of Constantine Cannon in San Francisco.Mr. Poehling said the data-mining projects that he had monitored could raise the government\u2019s payments to UnitedHealth by nearly $3,000 per new diagnosis found. The company, he said, did not bother looking for conditions like high blood pressure, which, though dangerous, do not raise risk scores.He included in his complaint an email message from Jerry J. Knutson, the chief financial officer of his division, in which Mr. Knutson urged Mr. Poehling\u2019s team \u201cto really go after the potential risk scoring you have consistently indicated is out there.\u201d\u201cYou mentioned vasculatory disease opportunities, screening opportunities, etc., with huge $ opportunities,\u201d Mr. Knutson wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s turn on the gas!\u201dThere were bonuses when Mr. Poehling and his team hit their revenue targets, Mr. Poehling said, but no bonuses for better health outcomes or for more accurate patients\u2019 charts.\u201cYou or I or the average person is probably appalled by this,\u201d Mr. Poehling said. \u201cBut the scheme here was not about delivering better care to members \u2014 the thing you would expect from a health care company. It was about increasing the bottom line.\u201dHe went to work for UnitedHealth in 2002, filed his lawsuit in 2011 and left the company at the end of 2012, while the case was still under seal.Mr. Poehling\u2019s allegations, if true, could help explain why insurers are staying in the Medicare Advantage program even as they pull out of the Affordable Care Act exchanges in some states: Medicare Advantage offers a way to get extra money from the federal government.When a whistle-blower succeeds in recovering money for the government, the False Claims Act calls for him or her to receive a percentage. Many whistle-blower cases fail to reach that point, but when the Justice Department joins a case, in general, the odds of a recovery go up.Already the Justice Department has declined to intervene in some smaller whistle-blower cases with similar allegations. But in March, it did say it would join a whistle-blower suit filed by James Swoben, a former data manager of SCAN Health Plan, accusing UnitedHealth and several other companies of cheating Medicare Advantage by looking improperly for ways to raise people\u2019s risk scores.That ruling did not decide Mr. Swoben\u2019s case, but merely sent it back to a district court to be adjudicated. His case and Mr. Poehling\u2019s case are both now being handled by the United States District Court in Los Angeles.Meanwhile, UnitedHealth has sued the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, seeking to vacate a 2014 rule that requires insurers to make sure the diagnoses they report to the government are borne out by what is in people\u2019s charts, and imposing penalties for overstatements. UnitedHealth argues that this rule unlawfully departs from the program\u2019s statutory mandates requiring \u201cactuarial equivalence\u201d with the traditional Medicare program.\u201cThat case could provide further clarity on the program rules,\u201d Mr. Burns of UnitedHealth said. He added that the government seemed to be trying to delay so that the two whistle-blower lawsuits could go first.The Justice Department has said it is investigating four other Medicare Advantage insurers: Aetna, Humana, Health Net and Cigna\u2019s Bravo Health. That suggests that there are more whistle-blowers in the wings, potentially snarling more insurers in litigation and ultimately forcing a rethinking of the entire program.\u201cC.M.S. could do a lot to change the rules so it\u2019s not so easy to get away with this stuff,\u201d said Timothy Layton, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who researches insurer behavior in health-insurance markets. He is not involved in Mr. Poehling\u2019s lawsuit.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge waste of money,\u201d Professor Layton said of the quest for higher risk scores. \u201cWhat the insurers are doing is not socially valuable at all.\u201dThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declined to comment for this article.Auditors and analysts have warned for at least a decade that Medicare Advantage has been vulnerable to cheating since risk scoring was phased in, from 2004 to 2008. The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, where the centers reside, audited a small sample of Medicare Advantage plans early on and found overpayments of up to $650 million in 2007. It predicted even more in 2008, but then came budget cuts and those audits stopped.\u201cI recall a feeling of frustration verging on outrage,\u201d said Ted Doolittle, the deputy director of the Medicare and Medicaid agency\u2019s Center for Program Integrity at that time.In 2014 the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit research group, analyzed the only available Medicare Advantage data and reported that insurers had reaped about $70 billion in overpayments from 2008 to 2013.\u201cThe difference between the assessment and the actual recovery is striking and demands an explanation,\u201d Mr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, wrote.As lawmakers and others try to get their arms around the issue, few insurance insiders have come forward with firsthand accounts. Mr. Poehling said he had done so reluctantly.\u201cI came to the point where I just couldn\u2019t participate in what they were asking me to do anymore,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Bad Debt Is Looking Better to Investors", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 In India, the vultures are circling.These vultures are investors looking for opportunities in distressed assets and bad debts. For years they had avoided investing in India, put off by a creakingly slow legal system and a labyrinthine bureaucracy.But a new bankruptcy law and a move this month to give India\u2019s central bank expansive powers to tackle bad debt have excited investors both here and abroad who think investing in India\u2019s distressed market could produce double-digit returns.\u201cThe new bankruptcy laws have been given teeth, which finally makes Indian credit markets attractive to foreign investors,\u201d said Saleem Siddiqi, founder of Musst Investments, a family office in London. Mr. Siddiqi is creating an Indian merchant bank to invest in middle-market corporate loans.A test of the new approach came this month, when a tribunal in New Delhi dismissed an appeal by a steel company, Innoventive Industries, which was arguing, among other claims, that a state law allowed it to suspend its liability temporarily. The tribunal ruled that the country\u2019s new bankruptcy law prevailed.\u201cNow the first case is resolved, you will see an onslaught of deals from the big guys,\u201d says Ravi Chachra, managing partner of the Mumbai-based asset manager Eight Capital.The new bankruptcy law is aimed at cleaning up the nation\u2019s mountain of debt, making it easier to dissolve a company and recover money. In India, where parties can drag out bankruptcies for years, the law has an important feature requiring a bankruptcy to be completed within 180 days in the event of default.Mr. Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner, made a fortune buying into Japanese banks nearly 20 years ago, but struggled with some of the investments he made during the financial crisis.In India, Mr. Flowers noted, \u201cyou have a credit market which doesn\u2019t function very well because creditors can\u2019t collect on their debt and credit ends up in the wrong places.\u201d\u201cBorrowing costs are high and banks don\u2019t make money,\u201d he said. \u201cBad debt clogs the system.\u201dOne of the challenges investors like Mr. Flowers face is that so far, banks have been reluctant to swallow the big discounts that investors are demanding to acquire bad assets. Little more than $3 billion in nonperforming assets were sold to asset reconstruction companies in the 2016 fiscal year, according to a report from Credit Suisse.Some widely reported deals haven\u2019t materialized. The San Francisco-based asset manager Farallon Capital is no longer expected to acquire a 24 percent stake in the struggling Essar Steel.India\u2019s robust growth slowed recently as a result of the government\u2019s unexpected move last year to ban 86 percent of the nation\u2019s currency in an effort to root out \u201cblack money,\u201d currency on which taxes haven\u2019t been paid. The move has produced widespread shortages of cash. Economic growth is expected to face challenges as long as banks here are saddled with enormous bad debts.Long term, some foreign investors think the bankruptcy law change could have far-reaching ramifications for India\u2019s capital markets, the jet fuel of a soaring economy. Indian companies have historically relied on selling stocks or lining up bank loans to finance their activities. Corporate bonds represent a tiny fraction of capital-raising.\u201cFor the corporate bond market to develop in India, you need to have jurisprudence, you need to have recourse, you need to have laws, you need to have transparency,\u201d said Mr. Siddiqi of Musst Investments. \u201cThe way India deals with nonperforming loans will be a litmus test of that.\u201dIn addition to J. C. Flowers, other foreign players have set plans to participate in India\u2019s distressed-debt market.ICICI Bank of India and an affiliate of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management have agreed to work together in resolving debts in India \u201cin an effort to revitalize and turn around overleveraged borrowers.\u201d And Bain Capital and Piramal Enterprises, a diversified Indian company, have signed an accord to create a strategic partnership to invest in Indian restructurings.Both of the American firms are following in the footsteps of the restructuring investor Wilbur L. Ross, now the United States commerce secretary. Nearly a decade ago, Mr. Ross invested in the struggling Indian airline SpiceJet, helping turn around the company by installing new leadership before selling at a profit. It was among a handful of investments in India for Mr. Ross.In contrast with their solo forays into private equity, this time big foreign firms entering the distressed arena are largely choosing to team up with Indian firms.The Edelweiss Group, a Mumbai brokerage firm, signed an agreement last fall with Canada\u2019s second-biggest pension fund, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec, for the Canadian fund to invest up to $700 million in distressed assets and private debt in India over four years. As part of the deal, Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t plans to take a 20 percent stake in Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, which has about $5.4 billion in assets.In March, a Carlyle Group fund, which owned an 8.2 percent stake in Mr. Ramaswamy\u2019s brokerage firm, Edelweiss, sold its holding for about $130 million.Many foreign firms have been waiting for the first big test of the bankruptcy legislation.In 2016, ICICI began an insolvency proceeding against Innoventive, the first move by a bank to recover assets under the new law. Innoventive fought back, arguing that a special act by the state of Maharashtra, where the company is based, had resulted in suspension of the company\u2019s liabilities for a year, thus nullifying ICICI Bank\u2019s claim at the time.After a hearing, the National Company Law Tribunal, the body adjudicating cases under the new bankruptcy law, moved to admit the case. Undeterred, Innoventive challenged the constitutional validity of the new law.The recent ruling upholding the law does not guarantee clear sailing ahead, however.\u201cThere will be some teething problems,\u201d says Srini Sriniwasan, managing director at Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd., a unit of the Indian bank Kotak Mahindra.Still, he is optimistic about the efficacy of the new bankruptcy law. \u201cThe speed at which the insolvency code was introduced and implemented is remarkable by Indian standards, \u201d he said.Kotak has enjoyed a ringside seat while watching India\u2019s distressed market swell.The glass-walled building Mr. Sriniwasan sits in, in Mumbai\u2019s Bandra Kurla complex, was built by a finance company. It had been allotted the land in an auction more than a decade ago.When the firm failed, Kotak started buying some of the debt underlying the property from other public-sector banks.An auction was set to sell off the property, but before it could proceed, Kotak had acquired all the nonperforming loans \u2014 and in doing so, secured ownership of the property.Advertisement"}

But she\u2019s no one\u2019s drudge. Having retired her debt by following the tough advice of a Suze Orman-like self-help guru, she delivers an upwardly mobile ultimatum to her boyfriend, Graham (Darren Pettie): \u201cI need to be with a guy who is either (a) already in the middle class or (b) wants to be there bad enough to work for it.\u201dGraham, a twice divorced 40-year-old who has been idling since his mother\u2019s death six months earlier, might seem to be the definition of what Tanya\u2019s guru calls a PWP: a partner without prospects. Still, he agrees to remodel and flip his mother\u2019s shabby beach house, and thus earn Tanya\u2019s hand in marriage.But then Miranda (Amber Tamblyn) enters, quickly hijacking the play. Unlike Tanya, Miranda long ago flew up from prole purgatory into elite heaven, complete with \u201critzy\u201d private schools, a Newport address and limitless credit cards. Her problem is that when the man who was financing all that lavishness \u2014 her mother\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 suddenly stopped paying, she didn\u2019t stop spending. At 28, she is $200,000 in debt, much of it for college and graduate school.Allergic to Tanya\u2019s Orman-esque axioms, Miranda seems headed for disaster, and not just financially. On the night the play takes place, the plot unconvincingly sets on a collision course two of the men she regularly soaks for cash. David, her regular sugar daddy, is an emotionally tone-deaf married man who has sex with her two days a week. To help finance the other five, she is also seeing Sateesh (Eshan Bay), a young Indian tech nerd who is drunk, angry about being strung along and (the play would have you believe) insanely volatile. He has a carful of knives.Like many of their 19th-century prototypes, Tanya and Miranda are not very likable. (The men, even flat-affect David, are much more so.) Tanya is pushy and grating, Miranda a drama queen. Both are dealing with issues like those raised by the 1864 Anthony Trollope novel from which Ms. Gionfriddo\u2019s play takes its title. In that tale, another pair of young women consider their options, of which there are generally only two: marry or don\u2019t. In the process they nearly lose everything. \u201cI am not sure,\u201d Trollope writes, \u201cthat marriage may not be pondered over too much.\u201dWell, a man would say that. (Some readers have jokingly called the novel, which is somewhat overpondered itself, \u201cCan You Finish It?\u201d) One of the things that interests Ms. Gionfriddo is the way 21st-century freedoms have complicated, perhaps even worsened, the odds a woman faces in approaching what Trollope called \u201cthe matrimonial dragon.\u201d Theoretically, she now has a more reasonable chance of slaying it. But in practice, if she wants male companionship, a woman without means still labors under restrictions that do not favor victory.Oddly, it\u2019s the arrival of David, the supposedly unfeeling sugar daddy, that finally jump-starts the action, two-thirds of the way through. (That\u2019s partly a result of the fine work of Frank Wood, suggesting a full inner life behind a mask of incomprehension.) Even so, \u201cCan You Forgive Her?\u201d does not, over the longish haul of its 95 minutes, make much drama out of its question mark.Despite its perceptiveness about women and marriage today, the play as a whole suffers from the same self-cancelling vagueness as its heroine.

But the future of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation is now more uncertain than at any point since it began in late July, and any fallout from the dismissal is unlikely to be contained at the bureau.In addition to a Justice Department investigation, there are several congressional inquiries into potential ties between President Trump\u2019s associates and Russia.Two separate congressional inquiries into Russian meddling are relying on evidence and intelligence being amassed by the F.B.I., and if the bureau\u2019s investigation falters, the congressional inquiries are likely to be hobbled. Perhaps for this reason, Mr. Comey\u2019s firing appears to have imbued the Senate Intelligence Committee with a renewed sense of urgency.The committee issued its first subpoena in the Russia investigation on Wednesday, ordering Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, to hand over records of any emails, phone calls, meetings and financial dealings with Russians.It was an aggressive new tack in what had been a slowly unfolding inquiry. A day earlier, the Senate panel began pressing a little-known government bureau that tracks money laundering and terrorism financing for leads in the Russian investigation.Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chairman, also invited Mr. Comey to testify in a closed session \u2014 a setting that would allow Mr. Comey to discuss classified information and any meetings he held with superiors at the Justice Department or with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey has not yet said whether he will attend.The Senate\u2019s rush to press forward with its investigation set up a potential showdown with the Trump administration over the future of the F.B.I. investigation. While it appears unlikely that the Justice Department or the White House would move to shutter the investigation outright, the president and other administration officials have called for it to end, sowing concerns at the F.B.I. and among some in Congress that it could be starved of needed resources.Still, the White House insists that Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal had nothing to do with the Russia investigations, and Sarah Isgur Flores, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said that \u201cthe idea that he asked for more funding\u201d for the Russia inquiry was \u201ctotally false.\u201d She did not elaborate.But Democrats were unconvinced, and Mr. Comey\u2019s firing was quickly taken up as Exhibit A in the case for the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case.\u201cI\u2019m told that as soon as Rosenstein arrived, there was a request for additional resources for the investigation, and that a few days afterward, he was sacked,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cI think the Comey operation was breathing down the neck of the Trump campaign and their operatives, and this was an effort to slow down the investigation.\u201dAccording to the congressional officials, the Senate Intelligence Committee learned of Mr. Comey\u2019s request on Monday when Senators Burr and Warner asked the F.B.I. director to meet with them. They wanted him to accelerate the bureau\u2019s investigation so they could press forward with theirs. Congressional investigators do not have the authority to collect intelligence that agencies like the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. possess.To a president who puts a premium on loyalty, Mr. Comey represented a fiercely independent official who wielded enormous power. But if the White House was hoping Mr. Comey\u2019s firing would provide relief from the pressure of the Russia investigations, the Senate Intelligence Committee appeared eager to fill any temporary void.Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in the presidential election are also likely to be a focus of the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s annual hearing on worldwide threats on Thursday, which is ordinarily a wider-ranging and policy-focused event.Also on Wednesday, Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner asked the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for financial information on Mr. Trump and some of his associates that was relevant to the Russia investigation.Reaction has ranged from support for the decision to calls for a special counsel.Both Mr. Warner and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon \u2014 the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee with jurisdiction over the Treasury Department and also a member of the Intelligence Committee \u2014 have said they will block the confirmation of Sigal Mandelker, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to be the top Treasury official for terrorism and financial crimes, until the network delivers the information.\u201cI have stated repeatedly that we have to follow the money if we are going to get to the bottom of how Russia has attacked our democracy,\u201d Mr. Wyden said on Wednesday. \u201cThat means thoroughly review any information that relates to financial connections between Russia and President Trump and his associates, whether direct or laundered through hidden or illicit transactions.\u201dThe little-known bureau, which operates out of a toilet bowl-shaped building in the suburbs of Washington, serves as the financial intelligence network of the United States, gathering and maintaining a vast collection of data on transactions and suspicious financial activity that can yield valuable leads and help expose hard-to-find networks.The financial crimes network would not confirm its participation in the inquiry, in line with its policy not to comment on investigations or even confirm that they exist, said Steve Hudak, a spokesman.But financial intelligence experts, including several former employees of the bureau, said its database, which contains more than 200 million records, can be a treasure trove of information about financial ties between individuals and companies for law enforcement agencies pursuing complex investigations.Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Insult to History", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byEditorialWith that line, it became clear that the United States is no longer the reliable partner her country and the rest of Europe have long depended on. Since World War II, the United States led the way in building a new international order rooted in NATO and the European Union as well as a belief in democracy and free markets. Britain, France and Germany were central to that effort, which for 70 years kept the peace and delivered prosperity to millions of people while standing firm against the Soviet threat, helping end the Bosnian War and combating extremism in Afghanistan.This trans-Atlantic partnership is still vital. But how, and how well, it will function as American leadership recedes is unclear. So far, no one is talking about dissolving NATO; Europe still depends for its security on America\u2019s nuclear and conventional arsenals. But Ms. Merkel\u2019s remarks underscored profound divisions between Europe and the United States that have one clear beneficiary, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who has longed for the alliance, Moscow\u2019s Cold War adversary, to unravel.Before Mr. Trump attended his first meetings of NATO and the Group of 7 last week, European leaders hoped they could bring him around on critical issues. That now seems like a pipe dream. Mr. Trump doubled-down on his most destructive campaign impulses by hectoring the other members at length for what he called their insufficient levels of military spending, and by refusing to reaffirm NATO\u2019s bedrock mutual defense commitment. He also broke with the allies on other issues. He offered a more conciliatory line on Russia and refused, despite their entreaties, to endorse the Paris agreement on climate change.When he returned home, Mr. Trump stoked the fires more, complaining in a tweet that Germany pays \u201cfar less than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change.\u201d His remarks showed no appreciation for how NATO works, how Ms. Merkel is in fact pushing her country to spend more on defense \u2014 and, more generally, how comments like this insult a trusted ally.These new stresses in the alliance come at a bad time. Europe has been battered by the Greek financial crisis; the rise of authoritarianism in Turkey, Hungary and Poland; Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union; and the flow of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa.Meanwhile, Mr. Putin, always eager to expand Russian influence, has exploited every weakness and crisis, along with instigating a few of his own. Russia invaded Ukraine and has interfered in electoral campaigns in the United States, France and Germany. Mr. Putin has meddled in the Baltic States, cultivated far-right-wing allies in Hungary and wooed President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on NATO\u2019s eastern flank. He is now courting Italy with a savvy ambassador to Rome and financing for anti-establishment parties.There are some bright spots. One is that Ms. Merkel seems committed to playing a lead role as the United States pulls back; another is France\u2019s election of President Emmanuel Macron, who has demonstrated a willingness to work in partnership with Ms. Merkel. The two won\u2019t always see eye-to-eye, but Germany needs France and Mr. Macron is a good fit.For now, it looks as if it is up to Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron to keep the alliance alive and relevant, at least until Mr. Trump wakes up to the need for American leadership or until another, wiser president replaces him.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Unmask Corruption in Ghana", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorAt Kwame Nkrumah Circle in central Accra, people form long lines each morning as they wait to pile into rickety minivans that take them to work. The minivans have been retrofitted to seat about 14 people, nearly double their original capacity. Crammed together like sardines in the 90-degree heat, the passengers angle for a breath of fresh air as they prepare for the long ride through Accra\u2019s congested streets.These uncomfortable journeys are typical for most of Accra\u2019s two million residents. So when the government announced that it would introduce a rapid bus transit system in 2015, Ghanaians were relieved. But it quickly became clear to us that what was billed as a measure to ease public discomfort was really a get-rich-quick scheme to reward the friends of John Mahama, the president at the time.Talk of the scandal dominated radio and TV stations for weeks. Frustrated by what looked like yet another instance of corruption, I and members of the CitizenGhana Movement, an advocacy group that focuses on accountability and good governance, sued the government for copies of the contract documents. In a landmark ruling, Justice Anthony Yeboah, a High Court judge, granted our request and established a precedent for the right to information.While this was an important victory, it only addressed the symptoms. The underlying problem is an opaque campaign finance system that allows anonymous donors to spend large sums on political parties, with the expectation that they will be rewarded if the party wins.In Ghana, the political costs of corruption are clear. Outrage at the bus-branding episode and other scandals contributed to the defeat of the National Democratic Congress during the 2016 elections. The newly elected president, Nana Akufo-Addo, ran on an anticorruption platform with the slogan \u201cArise for Change.\u201d But in the few months since his inauguration, it has become clear that in fact, not much has changed.It is only a matter of time until the cycle of corruption gets worse. One way to forestall this is to lift the lid on the financing of political parties. To identify whom the government is likely to repay, we need to know whom it owes.But the Electoral Commission of Ghana, which is tasked with collating and publishing these records, has repeatedly failed to enforce the law. In response, the CitizenGhana Movement, the Right to Information Coalition and I will file a lawsuit this week to compel the Electoral Commission to release those records.If we are successful, this will open the door to greater transparency. But it\u2019s only the first step toward reform. At present, ministers and the president are required to declare their assets. But these forms are not available to the public, which complicates efforts to prevent potential conflicts of interest. The government should publish an open and searchable register of political donations and politicians\u2019 assets. That would make it easier to follow the money and ensure that the government benefits all Ghanaians and not narrow special interests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Disgraced and Re-elected Connecticut Mayor Eyes the Statehouse", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byBut these days, Mr. Ganim is cheered as he steps onto the field during a Bridgeport Bluefish baseball game to throw the ceremonial first pitch. The cafe across the street from his office offers a \u201cJoe Ganim omelet\u201d (\u201clight and lean,\u201d with egg whites, spinach, turkey and low-fat mozzarella). And on a recent afternoon, he climbed into an excavator to claw through a brick wall, bringing attention to a development meant to serve as a visible sign of improvement in a long-struggling city.\u201cI have somewhat of a colorful past,\u201d Mr. Ganim, who is weighing a run for governor, said, \u201cwhich may or may not be acceptable to everybody all of the time.\u201dDespite all this, Mr. Ganim has been able to flourish, forging an undeniable connection with the city, where he maintained a deep reservoir of support, even after his conviction.A bid for statewide office, though, would be a far different story, forcing Mr. Ganim to step outside his comfort zone, to parts of Connecticut where voters may not be as forgiving.Connecticut is one of 13 states with some form of public financing for political campaigns, and Mr. Ganim has applied for funding despite a law barring financial support for candidates who have been convicted of felonies related to public office. On Wednesday, a state commission issued a preliminary decision denying Mr. Ganim\u2019s request, citing the rule excluding convicted felons from public funding.Mr. Ganim had said he was willing to wage a legal fight, calling the law unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s just blatantly unfair to the process \u2014 forget about the candidate,\u201d he said.Connecticut has become reliably Democratic and its politics tend to divide along demographic lines, between its wealthy, mostly white suburbs and its poorer cities with large minority populations. Hartford, the capital, is trying to stave off bankruptcy.Mr. Ganim has not been shy about aligning himself with the cities. He said he would urge the state to \u201cput our cities in a position to be the engines, to drive a better economy for all cities and towns for the state, or we\u2019re not going to get there.\u201dMr. Ganim, 57, was first elected mayor in 1991 as a 32-year-old newcomer to public office. His work to revitalize the city and help pull it back from the brink of bankruptcy attracted the attention of state Democratic Party leaders. In 1994, he mounted an unsuccessful campaign for governor.In 2015, he returned to the political stage with rallies blaring \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d and momentum fueled in part by the support of the city\u2019s police union and one of the F.B.I. agents involved in the investigation that sent him to prison. (The agent, Edward Adams, now works for the city.)Mr. Ganim has focused as mayor on trying to revive blighted or dormant spaces in the city. He operated the excavator at a development site in the city\u2019s East End that would contain a public library, housing and retail spaces, including a grocery store.Quality-of-life projects like this one have won over some in the city, including James Holloway, a city councilman who represents the area where the development is planned. He does not want Mr. Ganim to run for governor.\u201cWhen he first came in, he was dynamite,\u201d Mr. Holloway said. \u201cHe\u2019s only been here for a year and a half. If he stays a little longer, he will do better \u2014 I think so. If he wants to run, that\u2019s going to take away from him doing better for the city of Bridgeport.\u201dJohn Marshall Lee, an insurance agent and longtime Bridgeport resident who is active in community organizations, also voiced reservations about Mr. Ganim\u2019s bid for higher office, but for very different reasons. He contends that Mr. Ganim has fallen short on his pledges to make city government more transparent and accountable, and that the mayor lacks vision.\u201cThe man has no priorities,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf someone says they have priorities you can measure them on what they\u2019ve attempted to do. If they don\u2019t have priorities, how can you give them a report card?\u201dMr. Ganim has bolstered efforts aimed at helping formerly incarcerated people reintegrate into society, a pressing issue in the city but also one that political observers said he embraced reluctantly and out of political expedience. Last year, he announced the creation of an initiative to support the 1,000 men and women who return to Bridgeport each year from prison \u2014 joining about 10,000 others already in the city \u2014 in finding employment and gaining access to mental heath, education and housing services.Louis L. Reed, the program\u2019s director, said he believed Mr. Ganim\u2019s time in prison was a transformative experience.\u201cYou think about being in a 6-by-9 cell,\u201d said Mr. Reed, a Bridgeport native who said he spent 13 \u00bd years in prison. \u201cThink about what that\u2019s going to do to you spiritually. Think about what it\u2019s going to do to you mentally. It\u2019s going to fundamentally change you, for either the better or the worse.\u201d\u201cThat was his moment of clarity,\u201d Mr. Reed added, referring to the mayor. \u201cIt put him back on the road to redemption.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Rollbacks at Scott Pruitt\u2019s E.P.A. Are a Boon to Oil and Gas", "Date": "2017-05-20", "News": "Supported byTrump RulesFREMONT COUNTY, Wyo. \u2014 In a gas field here in Wyoming\u2019s struggling energy corridor, nearly 2,000 miles from Washington, the Trump administration\u2019s regulatory reversal is crowning an early champion.Devon\u2019s pushback, coming amid an effort to ease a broad array of federal environmental rules, is the first known example under the Trump administration of an accused polluter \u2014 which has admitted violating the law \u2014 backing away from a proposed environmental settlement. It is already being hailed by other independent energy companies as a template for the future.\u201cNot in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based association of independent oil and gas companies. \u201cWe were kind of used to getting punished.\u201dThe extraordinary about-face reflects the onset of an experiment in President Trump\u2019s Washington that is meant to fundamentally reorder the relationship between government and business. Across the federal government, lobbyists and lawyers who once battled regulations on behalf of business are now helping run the agencies they clashed with.Mr. Trump and his team believe that loosening the regulatory grip on business will help the economy, create jobs and allow Americans \u201cto share in the riches,\u201d as he said during the campaign. But in the energy field, environmentalists, Democrats and even some in the industry fear the efforts will backfire, harming health and safety without creating much economic benefit.The E.P.A. has not yet made a public response to Devon\u2019s new posture, and Mr. Pruitt declined to comment for this article. But the new approach follows a series of important victories for the energy industry in Washington that could reshape environmental policy on a national scale and undermine the Obama administration\u2019s campaign to combat climate change.In just the last three months, with Mr. Pruitt in charge, the E.P.A. postponed a long-planned rule requiring companies like Devon to retrofit drilling equipment to prevent leaks of methane gas \u2014 a major contributor to climate change \u2014 and to collect more data on how much of the gas is spewing into the air.The Interior Department, meanwhile, announced this month that it would reconsider a separate rule limiting the burning of unwanted methane gas from wells drilled on federal and Indian lands, a process called flaring. That announcement came the same day the Senate narrowly rejected industry calls to repeal the same rule.Interior officials have also announced their intention to repeal or revise a contentious rule requiring companies like Devon to take extra steps to prevent groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, a drilling technique in which chemicals and water are forced into rock formations.Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund are outraged by these moves, and have vowed to fight any rollbacks in court.\u201dDevon is doing to the oil and gas industry what Donald Trump did to the Republican Party, pushing the whole agenda into a world of extremes,\u201d said Mark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund.Devon and Mr. Pruitt, while he was still attorney general out West, teamed up to block new federal rules imposed by the Obama administration that required fossil fuel companies to more closely monitor oil and gas wells for leaks, and disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracking. Devon also poured millions of dollars a year into lobbying \u2014 and hundreds of thousands into campaign contributions to Mr. Pruitt and other Republicans \u2014 as it pushed regulators and lawmakers in Washington to do away with the restrictions.For Devon and its industry allies, the turnaround is as startling as it is long-sought.\u201cWe are so used to not being able to move an agenda forward that it has been very surprising how quickly things have changed,\u201d Ms. Sgamma said.In Riverton, Wyo., a frontier city of dusty roads and squat brick buildings a half-hour drive from where Devon operates its gas field, a fossil fuel revival could not come quickly enough.Well-paying jobs in oil and gas \u2014 drilling wells, managing roustabouts \u2014 are fast disappearing, as production in the state declines because of a slump in energy prices. Government agencies are bracing for cuts to basic services, including children\u2019s health programs and security at the county jail, because of declining tax revenues from fossil fuel companies.\u201cAt the end of the day, we all just want to make sure we can prosper and raise our families,\u201d said Holly Jibben, a local councilwoman, a former rig worker and a mother. \u201cWhen oil and gas profits, everybody profits.\u201dThe invitation to lunch at the towering new Devon Energy Center in downtown Oklahoma City came to Mr. Pruitt in June 2012 \u2014 18 months into his tenure as Oklahoma\u2019s top law enforcement official \u2014 from Larry Nichols, a co-founder of what had become the city\u2019s biggest independent oil and gas company.Mr. Nichols and his father, John, had created Devon in 1971, starting with four employees and a negative net worth of several million dollars, while sharing a receptionist at an office building not far from their new tower, an early company history says.Now, there was no denying Devon had reached extraordinary heights.That\u2019s where Mr. Pruitt came in.\u201cWe\u2019ll meet Scott in the lobby when he checks in at our concierge desk,\u201d William F. Whitsitt, then the head of Devon\u2019s fast-growing public relations and lobbying operations, wrote in an email to Mr. Pruitt\u2019s executive assistant.Mr. Pruitt, a folksy, deeply religious former state legislator and minor-league baseball team general partner who was largely unknown on the national political stage, had won an upset victory in 2010. He had vowed to challenge Washington\u2019s intervention in Oklahoma\u2019s affairs.\u201cThere\u2019s a mentality emanating from Washington today that says, \u2018We know best,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pruitt said during the campaign, which was supported by a donation from Mr. Nichols, as well as Devon\u2019s political action committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a one-size-fits-all strategy, a command-and-control kind of approach, and we\u2019ve got to make sure we know how to respond to that.\u201dDevon initially participated in a voluntary program to capture leaking methane, or close off leaks, but was so suspicious of the Obama administration\u2019s intentions that it dropped out.Devon, furious, turned to Mr. Pruitt for help in pushing back.\u201cJust a note to pass along the electronic version of the draft letter to Lisa Jackson at E.P.A.,\u201d said one early request for help in 2011 from Devon to Mr. Pruitt. Devon suggested that Mr. Pruitt follow up with Mr. Ferate, the company\u2019s Washington lobbyist and a fund-raiser for Republican causes, if he had questions.The interventions by Devon also targeted the Interior Department and its Bureau of Land Management, which controls 260 million acres of public land and leases out large chunks to oil and gas companies for drilling, including the land here in Fremont County.The bureau was pushing ahead with plans to require that Devon and other companies take extra steps to prevent chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from contaminating groundwater, including a demand that Devon disclose the ingredients in millions of gallons of chemical-laced water it pumped into the federally managed land.Devon has a total of about 1,500 wells on bureau-controlled land, representing about 15 percent of its oil and gas production.Devon and Mr. Pruitt called the rules redundant in letters to federal officials, including the secretary of the Interior and Mr. Obama, while they also worked to challenge them in court and in Congress.Each of the pieces of this campaign fell into place as planned. But Mr. Obama and his aides were hardly about to fold.\u201cEvery day this was not attended to was a day we got closer to the tipping point \u2014 when it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the kind of climate change damage we are worried about,\u201d said Janet McCabe, who led the air pollution enforcement division at the E.P.A. under Mr. Obama.Devon Energy, Ms. McCabe said, was among the most determined opponents of the agency\u2019s work, far more so, for example, than international giants like Shell.\u201cIn any regulated industry, there are companies that are more aggressive than others in pushing back at every turn and trying to stop the policy,\u201d she said. \u201cDevon was one of those.\u201dBut production from the area\u2019s wells had slowed over recent decades, and Devon, known for its emphasis on new technologies, had a solution: It would inject carbon dioxide into the ground, putting pressure on underground oil deposits and pushing them to the pump.The roaring minerals economy filled state coffers with billion-dollar annual surpluses and brought jobs that kept the unemployment rate for much of that decade below the national average.\u201cIt was gangbusters,\u201d said Mr. Baker, a former weed and pest control man, who points out the oil and gas rigs as fondly as he does the local flora and fauna, like the Indian paintbrush plant that was just starting to show its red flowers.Mr. Baker is not alone. In Riverton, a city of 11,000, the fading road signs \u2014 Gas Hills, Oil Field Road \u2014 underline the importance of fossil fuels. Local officials talk of companies like Devon as good corporate citizens.For the last six Thanksgivings, Devon has helped a local group give food baskets to the needy. For years, the company has also donated to youth educational programs at local state parks.But even as production was rising, tensions were brewing with Washington. The Obama administration had made cracking down on fugitive emissions from oil and gas sites a national priority.By 2014, Devon stood accused by the E.P.A. of releasing 80 more tons a year of the harmful gases from its Beaver Creek plant in Wyoming than its permit allowed. The extra emissions amounted to a fifth more than the company\u2019s stated emissions of 361 tons in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.This class of chemicals \u2014 known as volatile organic compounds \u2014 is extremely potent and is blamed for helping create blankets of smog. Several of the chemicals are known carcinogens.\u201cYou can smell it in the air,\u201d said John Fenton, a former Devon contract worker turned environmentalist who monitors oil and gas facilities scattered across Fremont County using an infrared camera.At Devon, Mr. Fenton repaired heating equipment and did general maintenance jobs. He later worked elsewhere in the gas fields welding pipes for as much as $50 an hour. But he stopped when wells started cropping up close to residential areas, including about 200 feet from his Fremont County ranch. His neighbors\u2019 water turned black. His wife, Catherine, complained of losing her senses of smell and taste.\u201cThese companies are emboldened by this remoteness to not do anything,\u201d he said.But Mr. Fenton\u2019s concerns have not gained wider traction. Residents fret mostly about the crackdown on energy companies under Mr. Obama, which coincided with a downturn in oil and gas production brought on largely by a glut in the market and lower energy prices. That has made his tough approach a scapegoat for the downturn, and it is difficult to overstate the animosity toward federal environmental agencies.\u201cThe E.P.A. is the evil empire here,\u201d said Steven R. Peck, publisher of The Ranger, Fremont County\u2019s daily newspaper. \u201cBut the regulatory game hasn\u2019t changed as much as the oil and gas industry itself,\u201d he said.\u201cPeople think, \u2018If we could just drill more wells a year,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut we also need clean energy and jobs.\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s gone down, down,\u201d said Frenchie Warren, 59, a member of the Arapaho tribe, who sat killing time one recent afternoon on a bench next to a Shell gas station.Mr. Warren lost his $23-an-hour job at the SST Energy Corporation earlier this year after he mangled his hand in a chain, he said. He is bitter toward Washington politicians, who he said were squeezing the life out of Riverton.\u201cThey aren\u2019t helping us,\u201d Mr. Warren said. \u201cIf I had a gun, I\u2019d shoot them.\u201dMr. Pruitt, who a few days earlier had been confirmed as the new E.P.A. administrator, stood on the stage and tried to calm the nerves of the agency\u2019s staff in the room, as well as thousands more watching remotely.\u201cYou don\u2019t know me very well,\u201d Mr. Pruitt said. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t know me hardly at all other than maybe what you\u2019ve read in the newspaper and seen on the news. \u2026 I look forward to sharing the rest of the story with you as we spend time together.\u201dBut it quickly became clear that a new day had arrived at the E.P.A. as Mr. Pruitt offered a hint of his priorities at the agency. \u201cI believe that we as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and -jobs, and pro-environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat we don\u2019t have to choose between the two.\u201dWithin weeks, the dismantling of the Obama-era rules was set in motion, first through broad proclamations from the White House as Mr. Trump signed executive orders, and later through specific administrative actions by Mr. Pruitt.In April, Mr. Pruitt notified the oil and gas industry that he was granting its wish to at least temporarily suspend the agency\u2019s new rule. \u201cAmerican businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,\u201d he said in a statement then.Devon Energy was poised to be a major beneficiary of the changes.Killing the methane rule would save Devon an estimated $430,000 a year in the four states where it operates wells, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund, although if industry estimates of the actual costs are accurate, the savings may be much higher.Devon has other allies on the Trump team.Devon Energy of Oklahoma City has long been one of the more aggressive opponents in the oil and gas sector of new federal environmental regulations, working since early in the Obama administration to challenge such rules. Now it is seeing the benefits of this effort, with Scott Pruitt's rise as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.Some Democrats in Congress have questioned whether Mr. Pruitt is taking actions explicitly to benefit Devon and other financial supporters.In a letter last month, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and three other Senate Democrats pressed Mr. Pruitt to explain why he canceled the data-collection effort on methane \u2014 suggesting it might be a favor to industry friends.Oil and gas companies are hoping that Mr. Pruitt\u2019s business-friendly approach will extended to enforcement issues. Devon was first targeted by the E.P.A. in 2014, after it was accused of illegally discharging 80 tons a year of volatile organic compounds into the Wyoming air. The company had been close to reaching a settlement with the federal government.But two days after that disclosure, Mr. Pruitt was confirmed as E.P.A. administrator, and by the next week, Devon was changing its tune.Instead of the proposed leak-detection system, the company was now planning to replace an older gas-fired compressor with an electrically powered unit, reducing volatile organic compound emissions by about 5 tons a year. Devon also says that, after revisiting aspects of the case, it now \u201cdoes not believe that a six-figure civil penalty is justified.\u201dTim Hartley, a Devon spokesman, acknowledged that the company had laid out a shift in its negotiating position. But he attributed the change to \u201csimple economics.\u201dThe plant, he said, was marginal and had been considered for shutdown, and adopting a sophisticated leak-detection program there was not economically feasible, especially at a difficult time for the oil and gas industry. Devon\u2019s stock surged after Mr. Trump won the election, but has since dipped as oil prices have remained depressed.The cost of the leak-detection program would amount to about 20 percent of the plant\u2019s annual operating budget, the company said in its letter.Mr. Hartley said that the violations stemmed from a misinterpretation of complicated regulations and that Devon had not intentionally circumvented the rules. He said that Devon had not contacted Mr. Pruitt about the case.The E.P.A. has not yet made public the investigation, or its decision on a settlement. Andrew Mutter, a spokesman for the agency\u2019s Colorado regional office, which covers Wyoming, said that talks on the matter remained active. The Justice Department attorney in charge of the case did not return requests for comment.Mr. Hartley declined to comment on the effects for Devon of the wider regulatory rollback, saying it would be \u201cpure speculation\u201d to consider how the company might benefit.But Ms. Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, which includes Devon, said that Devon is among several independent oil and gas companies now taking a tougher stand with the E.P.A.\u201cI am not going to settle with you now, when this new administration has such a different philosophy,\u201d she said, explaining the new approach. \u201cIt makes sense to do a wait-and-see.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified James Lankford as a senator of Utah. He is a senator of Oklahoma.Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Wyoming, and Eric Lipton from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Sees Big Potential for Fintech in Brazil", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil is experiencing a wave of growth in financial technology that will most likely eat into the market share of the country\u2019s huge and long untouchable banks, a new report from Goldman Sachs says.Entitled \u201cFintech Brazil\u2019s Moment,\u201d the 45-page research report estimates that the more than 200 financial technology companies in Brazil should generate a potential revenue pool of about $24 billion over the next 10 years. Payments, lending and personal finance are three promising segments, as is insurance, the report found.The report is a rare in-depth look at a sector that has received much attention and investment capital here but little serious analysis.The impact from fintech disruption is expected to be greater in Brazil than in many other countries because of its highly concentrated banking sector, the report says.\u201cWe believe the Brazilian financial system is particularly susceptible,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s authors, Carlos G. Macedo, Marcelo Cintra, Steven Goncalves and Nelson Catala.The Goldman Sachs economists cited what they called \u201can oligopolistic market structure\u201d in Brazil where the top five banks, excluding development banks, hold 84 percent of total loans. In retail branch banking, the top five banks have 90 percent of branches. That is up from 71 percent in 2007, the report said, observing that \u201cthe market has become more concentrated since the financial crisis\u201d of 2008.By contrast, in the United States, the top five banks hold just about 20 percent of all branches. In India, that figure is slightly over 30 percent, and in Turkey it is just under 30 percent. Mexico and Russia are also less concentrated than Brazil.In Brazil, fees and interest rates for loans are also among the highest in the world.\u201cWe believe this unique market structure positions fintechs to have a larger impact in Brazil than in other developed markets,\u201d the report said.The analysis is consistent with other recent market developments.Venture capital investments in fintech companies in Brazil have been increasing. Private equity firms are also taking note. In March, the American private equity firm Advent International acquired a minority stake in Easynvest.\u201cWe expect a lot more in the space to happen in the near future,\u201d Isaias Sznifer, managing director at the boutique advisory firm Greenhill & Company in Brazil, said in an interview.Brazilian banks are not expected to stay complacent as their upstart challengers gain ground, the Goldman Sachs economists said. That could mean copying some of their offerings or investing in them.The report also contends that the growth of financial technology companies in Brazil will lead to a decrease in loan spreads and bank fees.\u201cIn our view, the rise of fintechs is likely to spur incumbent banks to invest heavily in I.T., reducing costs and improving efficiency,\u201d the report said, adding that \u201cwe see their impact starting now.\u201dBecause of that, the economists said that while \u201cin 10 years we expect incumbent banks to lose market share,\u201d the effect should not be perilous. \u201cWe do not expect significant pressure on growth or profitability for large retail banks, despite market share loss and price pressure.\u201dThe Goldman Sachs report cited Banco Original, a digital bank, and Nubank as leaders in fintech in Brazil.Nubank, which provides a digital credit card, was formed in 2013 in S\u00e3o Paulo. Its initial financing came that year from the Silicon Valley stalwart Sequoia Capital and from Kaszek Ventures in Buenos Aires. It has since secured funding from investors including Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and the Russian firm DST Global, both firms\u2019 debut investments in Brazil.The report\u2019s authors see the case of Nubank setting an example, which spurred Banco Bradesco and Santander Brasil among others to push competing products.\u201cNubank\u2019s development followed a path that we believe may be replicated in several segments,\u201d the report said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Digital Insecurity Is the New Normal", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsThis \u201cback to analog\u201d moment isn\u2019t just a knee-jerk, stopgap reaction to a short-term problem. It\u2019s a rational response to our increasingly insecure internet, and we are going to see more of it ahead.The surprise is not that the frequency of such attacks is accelerating; it\u2019s that it took so long. There are at least three reasons for this acceleration. First, the internet has a fundamentally insecure infrastructure that was initially made for interoperability among a small number of trusted parties, but is now being used by billions who do not know and should not trust one another.The second reason is that increasingly inventive criminals have become today\u2019s most ambitious internet entrepreneurs. Their work has been made easier by the theft of powerful hacking tools created by and for state security agencies but now available for sale.Third is the commercial innovation imperative. Consumer demand for digital devices and services keeps pushing companies to the limits of what is technically possible, and then pressing them to go even a little bit further, where security often becomes nice to have but not a necessity.So what would it mean if we crossed the threshold to digital insecurity? One possibility is that some things we now take for granted \u2014 from banking online to electronic medical records \u2014 will shift from being seen as common sense to being viewed as scary, dangerous, even reckless.We know what it looks like when expectations of security in physical environments degrade: People put triple locks on their doors, retreat into gated communities, look over their shoulder as they walk down the street. In our scenario, we\u2019ve imagined the digital equivalent. Will you soon be asked to place your phone and laptop in a locker before you are allowed to enter an office building or a friend\u2019s home? Will you tell your colleagues to call you before they send you an email with an attachment?A society and economy that moves in this direction would be different from the one we have today, and very different from what Silicon Valley is looking to build. Security needs to be made a priority at least as great as innovation right now. We recognize that the consequences of prioritizing security are not all good, and the slowing or reversal of digitization will be a significant headwind for the United States economy even more than for other countries, at a time and in a political environment that really can\u2019t afford such a setback. But there is no other viable choice. You can\u2019t fix a broken foundation by simply building more stories atop the house that rests on it.The world spends a lot of time right now thinking and dreaming about how life will be digitized, mostly for the better. We don\u2019t yet have a word for even a partial \u201creturn to analog,\u201d but we will have to start looking for one at the same time as we work to create a much more secure internet.Steven Weber is a professor at the School of Information and faculty director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California, Berkeley, where Betsy Cooper is the executive director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Biden to Create a Political Action Committee, a Possible Signal for 2020", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is planning to create a political action committee, the most concrete sign yet that he intends to remain active in the Democratic Party and is considering a presidential bid in 2020.The \u201cAmerican Possibilities\u201d PAC, which Mr. Biden intends to unveil on Thursday, will offer the former vice president a platform he can use to nurture relationships with donors, travel on behalf of the party and contribute to candidates in the two governor\u2019s races in November and in next year\u2019s midterm elections.He has tapped a former aide in his vice-presidential office and a veteran of President Barack Obama\u2019s White House campaigns, Greg Schultz, to help lead it.By creating a political organization, Mr. Biden, 74, is also sending an unmistakable message to the many other Democrats eyeing the White House that he is not planning to quietly recede into retirement.\u201cBiden has a lot of support out there, and this gives him a way to grow that support while also helping Democrats win and build the party,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic strategist who was not privy to the planning of the PAC.The organization formalizes what has already been apparent from Mr. Biden\u2019s schedule: He very much wants to keep open the prospect of seeking the presidency for a third time. He has already spoken at a dinner fund-raiser on behalf of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Next month he will address Florida Democrats, and he has appeared at a handful of high-powered policy gatherings stocked with the sort of donors he would turn to should he seek the White House.In his public appearances, though, Mr. Biden has been careful to hedge when discussing his plans.Asked at a recent hedge fund conference in Las Vegas about his 2020 plans, he said: \u201cCould I? Yes. Would I? Probably not.\u201dDemocrats who have spoken to Mr. Biden say that he is genuinely anguished about the direction of the country under President Trump and that he remains deeply frustrated that Hillary Clinton lost last year in part because the working-class white voters that he prides himself on connecting with abandoned their ancestral party.At the gathering in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden was blunt in his assessment of Mrs. Clinton.\u201cI never thought she was a great candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I was a great candidate.\u201d (He did note that he thought \u201cHillary would have been a really good president.\u201d)Mr. Biden declined to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016 after an agonizing, monthslong deliberation in the aftermath of his eldest son\u2019s death. But the former vice president, who ran for president in 1988 and 2008, has not forsaken his long-running ambition. He retains a small coterie of advisers, and they are said to be divided over whether Mr. Biden should run once more.In a Medium post by Mr. Biden that is to publish on Thursday, he explains the name of the PAC.\u201cThinking big is stamped into the DNA of the American soul,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat\u2019s why the negativity, the pettiness, the small-mindedness of our politics today drives me crazy.\u201dIt is time, Mr. Biden adds, \u201cfor big dreams and American possibilities.\u201dMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We All Have Pre-existing Conditions", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Republican health care plan recently passed by the House would hollow out one of the most popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act: a prohibition on charging higher prices to people with pre-existing medical conditions. States, under the plan, could waive that rule, provided they offer publicly funded alternatives for coverage.The Republican plan raises questions, including about cost: Many experts believe the more than $100 billion earmarked for alternative programs, such as \u201chigh-risk pools,\u201d would be inadequate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, many patients with pre-existing conditions would be priced out of the market.But the Republican proposal also raises a more basic issue: Who will decide what constitutes a pre-existing condition?Before the Affordable Care Act, profit-taking insurers had lowered the bar for what was considered a pre-existing condition to include nearly every malady, making it difficult for many healthy patients to get affordable insurance.I have interviewed many such people. Ren\u00e9e Martin was thrown into an unaffordable high-risk pool because of an abnormal Pap smear. Lisa Solod got turned away by four insurers because she was on thyroid replacement, an asthma inhaler and hormones \u2014 a not uncommon trifecta for women in their 50s. Wanda Wickizer was priced out of having insurance because she had taken Lexapro for depression. Jesse Albert found that he and his family were uninsurable because he had once had a benign skin cancer and a bout of hepatitis C, even though his immune system had cleared the virus.\u201cInsurers each drew a line in the sand that was invisible for conditions they didn\u2019t want to cover,\u201d said Jean P. Hall, the director of the Institute for Health and Disability Policy Studies at the University of Kansas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know where that line was because it was considered proprietary information.\u201dTurning away people with just a hint of illness is a reasonable business strategy. But as so often occurs in the profit-oriented health system, what is best for business is not necessarily good for patients.The committee report found that the insurance companies turned down one out of every seven applicants with pre-existing conditions. Such denials had jumped by nearly 50 percent between 2007 and 2009, as the apparently successful financial strategy gained sway.In the pre-Affordable Care Act era, states that ran high-risk pools generally specified pre-existing conditions that automatically qualified patients for admittance \u2014 generally serious diseases like AIDS, diabetes or epilepsy. The determination was based on health, but patients who could show they had been turned down by insurers were also generally eligible. Insurers, with different motivations, draw very different boundaries. In interviews with Dr. Hall before the A.C.A., some Kansans said that merely having hay fever or being fat were enough to be placed in the pools.Indeed, if insurers make the call about who to exclude, almost anyone who needs insurance would seem vulnerable. I\u2019m by all measures really healthy but I, too, once had an abnormal Pap smear, have taken Lexapro for short periods of my adult life and very occasionally use an asthma inhaler before I exercise in winter. Since an orthopedist removed the cartilage in my right knee after a soccer injury in college (an operation that has since been deemed useless or harmful), odds are that I will someday need a knee replacement. Dr. Hall told me that surgery alone could throw me into a high-risk pool, by many insurers\u2019 standards.And what of the much vaunted benefits of cancer screening? With the possibility of a poorly financed high-risk pool looming, a rational person might avoid a colonoscopy. A polyp removal might prevent cancer but could mean paying higher insurance rates, because patients who get polyps are at risk for developing more polyps, which can be precursors to cancer.We all have \u2014 or will have \u2014 some kind of a problem in our medical history.Today, Mr. Albert, 52, is not happy with the price of his family\u2019s high-deductible Obamacare policy: $2,000 a month. Even so, he said: \u201cThe A.C.A. was a lifesaver for us. Everyone in my family has something that could be defined as a pre-existing condition. It\u2019s expensive but I don\u2019t have to worry about being excluded from insurance or about bankruptcy anymore.\u201dElisabeth Rosenthal, a former New York Times correspondent, is the editor in chief of Kaiser Health News and the author of \u201cAn American Sickness: How Healthcare Became Big Business and How You Can Take It Back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Fires Former Google Engineer at Heart of Self-Driving Dispute", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber said Tuesday that it had fired Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer brought in to lead the company\u2019s self-driving automobile efforts who was accused of stealing trade secrets when he left a job at Google.What Mr. Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for nearly $700 million last year, is the key question in a closely watched lawsuit that pits one of the world\u2019s most powerful companies against Uber, a richly financed up-and-comer.The stakes are enormous for both businesses. Google was a pioneer in autonomous car technology and has spent nearly a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars on its effort, which is now run through Waymo, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet. And Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, has said the future of his ride-hailing company, privately valued at nearly $70 billion, hinges on work being done to create cars that can drive themselves.The dismissal of one of Uber\u2019s most prized technical talents also points to the risks of the star engineering culture that has emerged in Silicon Valley in recent years, leading to giant paydays for a small group of employees.Uber agreed to pay $680 million \u2014 mostly in company equity \u2014 in exchange for the company\u2019s technology and a team of experienced self-driving technology engineers. Mr. Levandowski and his staff would also be entitled to a small percentage of any profits earned from an Uber-owned, self-driving trucking business developed under Mr. Levandowski\u2019s direction.But just months after the acquisition, Waymo sued Uber in civil court, claiming that Uber was using trade secrets stolen from Google to develop Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles \u2014 a plan Waymo alleges was aided by Mr. Levandowski.\u201cOver the last few months Uber has provided significant evidence to the court to demonstrate that our self-driving technology has been built independently,\u201d Angela L. Padilla, Uber\u2019s associate general counsel for employment and litigation, wrote in an email to employees. \u201cOver that same period, Uber has urged Anthony to fully cooperate in helping the court get to the facts and ultimately helping to prove our case.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe take our obligations under the court order very seriously, and so we have chosen to terminate his employment at Uber.\u201dJohnny Luu, a spokesman for Waymo, declined to comment.Uber had little choice but to cut ties with Mr. Levandowski, legal analysts said. The company risked being tarnished if it continued to stand by him, as if it were indirectly condoning his actions.\u201cI don\u2019t think this was an easy decision, but at the end of the day, Uber did what it had to do,\u201d said Elizabeth A. Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida\u2019s law school and an expert in trade secrets law.Firing Mr. Levandowski provides Uber \u201ca way to cut off liabilities potentially and highlights that they were not acting willfully,\u201d said Russell Beck, an intellectual property lawyer and founding partner at the Boston law firm Beck Reed Riden.But firing Mr. Levandowski could mean that he becomes a witness against Uber if he were to claim, for example, that Uber executives looked the other way while he used proprietary information from Waymo to advance Uber\u2019s self-driving car efforts. Uber has repeatedly said that it has developed its autonomous car technology on its own.\u201cIt makes it easier for Mr. Levandowski to cut a deal, because he\u2019s no longer associated with Uber,\u201d Ms. Rowe said.More grave for Mr. Levandowski are potential criminal charges. Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the Waymo versus Uber civil case, referred the matter to the United States attorney\u2019s office to look into possible theft of trade secrets. The action opened Mr. Levandowski \u2014 and perhaps Uber \u2014 to the possibility of criminal charges if the Justice Department decides to pursue the case.Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr. Levandowski, did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. Court transcripts show Mr. Levandowski\u2019s lawyers have advised him to assert his Fifth Amendment right.Engineers like Mr. Levandowski are part of a small pool in Silicon Valley with the specialized know-how to lead efforts on self-driving cars. Technology companies and traditional automakers alike are sometimes paying tens of millions of dollars per employee.There are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Mr. Levandowski, however, may not see his rich payday from Uber. He has been employed at Uber for less than a year and none of his shares have vested, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement, nor has he met certain project milestones determined at the time of acquisition. Typically, shares in Uber reach vested status over a multiyear period.Uber will also face hardship as a result of the dismissal. Mr. Levandowski, who has dedicated his entire professional life to the study and development of robotics and self-driving research, was integral to nearly every component of the company\u2019s autonomous operations.Eric Meyhofer, a former deputy of Mr. Levandowski, will lead the autonomous vehicle project, overseeing hundreds of engineers working in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and soon in Toronto.Uber has also experienced a string of executives departing, including Jeff Jones, president of the company\u2019s ride-sharing operations, and Amit Singhal, the senior vice president for engineering, who left after accusations of sexual harassment while working at Google were unearthed shortly after he started at Uber.This week, Josh Mohrer, a general manager at Uber who had been embroiled in controversy, left to join a venture firm. And the results of an investigation into Uber\u2019s companywide culture are expected to be delivered to the company\u2019s board of directors on Wednesday.Mike Isaac reported from San Francisco and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Pedro, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Effect on C.E.O. Pay", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byFair GameAfter the November election, the stock market experienced a Trump bump. The surge in share prices thrilled investors, but some corporate executives had even more reason to celebrate. That\u2019s because rising prices can fuel higher pay even if other corporate results are so-so, which seems to be the case for some companies right now.Total shareholder returns were explosive \u2014 up 14 percent for the median company. A close look at the numbers suggests that the levitating 2016 stock market was a powerful driver of C.E.O. pay last year, and the bull market seems to have made shareholders less likely to complain about the pay increases executives received. Yet there are serious questions concerning the ties between executive pay and a company\u2019s stock performance.But calibrating how much weight a stock price should have on C.E.O. pay is tricky: A company\u2019s stock price can be influenced by share buybacks and other financial engineering that does little to produce long-term value. Why reward a C.E.O. for that?Something similar may have happened after last year\u2019s presidential election. Call it the Trump effect on C.E.O. pay.By early November, many stocks were barely up on the year \u2014 the S.&P. 500 had eked out a mere 2 percent gain. But after the election, the overall market rallied on expectations of the incoming Trump administration\u2019s pro-business agenda. The S.&P. 500 wound up almost 10 percent higher for 2016.For an outsider, determining precisely how a company assesses a performance metric is difficult, of course. But the lift from the Trump effect seems to have been most pronounced among industries in which investors believed the administration\u2019s deregulatory fervor would be greatest and thus lead to lower costs and more profits.The financial arena is a prime example. Throughout most of 2016, the S.&P. Financial Select Sector Index bounced around a narrow range, essentially trading flat on the year. But it took off after the election, soaring to a 20 percent gain by year\u2019s end. Investor assumptions that the new administration would roll back the Dodd-Frank Act and generally reduce restrictions on financial activities powered this move.There are 31 finance executives on Equilar\u2019s highest-paid C.E.O. list for 2016. Over half of them \u2014 17 \u2014 got raises last year, and each of the 17 companies used shareholder returns as a metric in determining their pay. Ten of those C.E.O.s received double-digit increases.The highest-paid finance executive was Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. His total compensation was $27.2 million, nearly a 50 percent increase from the $18.2 million he received in 2015, according to Equilar.In the top 200 rankings, Equilar relied on standard compensation figures required in proxies by the Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan supplied those figures, but in another section of its proxy, it listed Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay as $28 million in 2016 and $27 million in 2015, so according to the financial firm, Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay increased by just $1 million, or nearly 4 percent.In detailing Mr. Dimon\u2019s pay, the proxy noted that the bank gained market share in most of its businesses and generated record net income and earnings per share. The fact that JPMorgan\u2019s total shareholder return was 35 percent for the year isn\u2019t lost on investors.Shareholders seem relatively content with Mr. Dimon\u2019s package. At the bank\u2019s annual meeting in mid-May, 92 percent of votes cast approved its pay practices, the same percentage as last year.Several executives in the top 10 are in the media or tech industries.Investors in most other financial companies did well \u2014 only five showed a decline in total shareholder returns for 2016.However, while 12 of the finance companies\u2019 shares outperformed the sector stock index, 19 did not. In spite of this underperformance, 10 of the 19 companies awarded their C.E.O.s higher pay, and some of the increases were significant.It looks like a very sweet game: Heads I win, tails you lose.One fortunate chief executive was Arthur M. Coppola, a co-founder of the Macerich Company, a real estate investment trust in Santa Monica, Calif. Although revenues at the company fell 19 percent in 2016 and its shares lost 9 percent, Mr. Coppola received $13.5 million, a 2.6 percent increase over last year.Thomas O\u2019Hern, Macerich\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bulk of Mr. Coppola\u2019s pay consisted of stock grants with three-year earn-out periods based on the company\u2019s performance against all public real estate investment trusts. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely he would end up earning that amount based on where we are today,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hern said.Shareholders are scheduled to vote on Macerich\u2019s pay practices on Thursday.Daniel H. Schulman at PayPal Holdings is another case in point. He received a compensation package valued at $19 million, a 31 percent increase over 2015. That pay raise far exceeded growth rates in the company\u2019s sales, which were up 17 percent, and earnings and shareholder returns, which both rose around 9 percent during the year.Amanda Coffee, a PayPal spokeswoman, said in a statement, \u201cThe majority of Dan Schulman\u2019s compensation is driven by performance; 2016 was an extraordinary year for PayPal as we delivered results that exceeded our targets and delivered double-digit growth across all key metrics.\u201dAt the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, 95 percent of the votes cast favored PayPal\u2019s compensation practices.To be sure, the Trump bump didn\u2019t push every company\u2019s shares higher in 2016. As the pay rankings show, though, even a falling tide lifts the boats of some C.E.O.s.A total of 44 companies on the list had the same C.E.O. in place in 2015 and 2016 and also had declining shareholder returns. Yet at 23 of these companies, chief executives received raises in 2016.Among the bigger winners in this group was Steve Ells, the chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill. Even as his company\u2019s revenues fell 13 percent and its shares declined by 21 percent, Mr. Ells snared a 13 percent increase in pay, receiving $15.7 million in 2016.Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said most of Mr. Ells\u2019s raise last year came in the form of stock grants. \u201cThe 2016 award will not vest and therefore will be completely without any realizable value,\u201d he said, \u201cunless our stock price reaches an average of $700 per share for a period of at least 60 consecutive trading days before February 2019.\u201dMr. Arnold added that a 2013 grant, originally worth $8 million, had no value when it expired in 2016.Then there\u2019s Kimberly-Clark\u2019s C.E.O., Thomas J. Falk. He, too, received a 13 percent increase in pay, even as sales at his consumer products company fell 2 percent and its stock lost 7.5 percent.A Kimberly-Clark official said that its board believes the most accurate way to measure longer-term performance is to use multiyear total shareholder returns. \u201cThe company\u2019s three-year return is 24.9 percent and its five-year return is 90.3 percent,\u201d the official said in a statement, \u201cwhich demonstrates the value that Kimberly-Clark has delivered to shareholders under C.E.O. Tom Falk\u2019s leadership.\u201dSure enough, Kimberly-Clark\u2019s shareholders seem content with Mr. Falk\u2019s pay. At the company\u2019s annual meeting in April, only 3.3 percent of the votes cast opposed its pay practices.It\u2019s hard for investors to think analytically when the market has been rising. That\u2019s precisely why skepticism about soaring pay is important right now.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio, Expanding an Education Program, Dismisses Past Approaches", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday used a news conference announcing the expansion of one of his signature education programs to defend his education policies as a whole and to sweepingly dismiss those of previous leaders of the school system.Mr. de Blasio, appearing at a school in Brooklyn, said that he would add 69 schools to the Community Schools Initiative, which provides services like counseling, dental care and vision screening in school buildings, bringing the total to 215. The program has decreased absenteeism in many schools but has not yet led to major academic gains.And then he took aim at previous administrations. \u201cI think we were all sold a bill of goods in the past \u2014 for generations \u2014 that there was a serious effort to create equity in our school system,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t understand it\u2019s transformative isn\u2019t looking very hard,\u201d he said.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and the schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, have said they would soon release a plan to decrease segregation in the city\u2019s schools. In answer to a question about segregation, the mayor suggested that there was not much he could do. \u201cWe cannot change the basic reality of housing in New York City,\u201d he said.The announcement about the Community Schools Initiative highlighted some of the challenges facing the mayor on education. Among his biggest departures from the approach of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, was his pledge to avoid widespread school closings, which are strongly opposed by the teachers\u2019 union. Instead, he created what he called the Renewal Schools program to turn around a group of 94 of the most troubled schools, through a combination of academic support and social services.Asked Thursday if the Renewal Schools presented a strong argument for expanding the community school model to still more schools, Mr. de Blasio said they did.\u201cI think the trend is clear among the Renewal Schools that we\u2019ve had improved attendance and improved outcomes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is in the toughest situations in our whole school system.\u201d\u201cIf you say, Are there some that we haven\u2019t seen what we wanted from, absolutely,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd have we said from the outset some of them are not going to make it? Yep.\u201dA number of cities across the country have adopted the community schools model, and it enjoys strong support from teachers\u2019 unions. In New York City, each school designated a community school is paired with a community-based organization that provides various kinds of support, including after-school programming, health services and attendance improvement strategies. Each of the 69 schools announced on Thursday will receive roughly $350,000 a year for up to five years to spend on extra services.The program itself is financed through a federal grant from the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, and only the first year of funding is guaranteed. President Trump proposed eliminating the program in the partial outline of his 2018 budget that he released in March. But the program has bipartisan support, and Congress increased outlays for the program in the federal spending bill passed last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuba\u2019s New Luxury Hotels Look to Lure Waves of U.S. Tourists", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetHAVANA \u2014 In Havana\u2019s Parque Central, shady stone benches and graceful palm trees beckon to mojito-sipping tourists and locals gathering to shoot the breeze.The gathering spot, in the center of town, is surrounded by horse-drawn carriages and long lines of colorful finned-and-chromed 1950s cars. But more utilitarian vehicles have recently begun circling the square: construction equipment transforming old buildings into luxury hotels.As Cuba\u2019s relationship with the United States grows warmer, real estate redevelopment is heating up, too.\u201cSo many old buildings sat vacant for years with signs saying they were soon to be converted into hotels,\u201d said Belmont Freeman, a Cuban-American architect based in New York. \u201cNow I actually see cranes on construction sites. Cuban bureaucracy is easing up, and foreign hotel developers are finally finding ways to move these projects forward.\u201dPresident Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s loosening restrictions on private enterprise, improving relations with the United States and financial necessity \u2014 Cuba\u2019s gross domestic product shrank in 2016, for the first time in over 20 years, according to official figures \u2014 have fueled rapid change in many areas.And several obstacles lie between the pent-up demand and a successful liftoff of Cuba\u2019s luxury hotels. Utilities are not always reliable, poverty is widespread and visible, and even getting ingredients for restaurant-quality meals can be dicey.But with Cuba suddenly an option for Americans exploring a culture kept off-limits for decades, the hospitality industry in particular has been supercharged. Over four million tourists visited in 2016, up 13 percent from the previous year, according to the Cuban Ministry of Tourism. Among those visitors were over 614,000 Americans, up 34 percent from the year before.The area around Parque Central has a front-row seat for the struggle, and the potential payoff.Leading the wave of new luxury hotels is the 246-room Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana, which stands in a restored European-style shopping arcade that stretches for a block. On the other side of Parque Central is the Hotel Inglaterra, which opened in 1875 and had Winston Churchill as one of its guests. Within shouting distance are several other luxury hotels managed by the French group Accor and Iberostar of Spain.Because United States regulations on visiting Cuba have not been completely relaxed, the full deluge of American visitors has not yet arrived. Instead of declaring themselves tourists, they must come under the auspices of one of 12 categories like \u201ceducational activities,\u201d which include interactions with Cuban people.But lengthy delays have tripped up many of the projects. Navigating shortages \u2014 Cuba imports 70 to 80 percent of its food, according to the World Food Program \u2014 frequent electricity and internet outages, and a decrepit water and sewage system are just some of the headaches for hotels trying to maintain standards. And the area near Parque Central and much of Havana has been overtaken by poverty since the Cuban Revolution in the 1950s, creating an uncomfortable juxtaposition between struggling locals and wealthy visitors.\u201cPeople are watching the Manzana closely,\u201d said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. \u201cThere is a tremendous amount of pressure to maintain the Kempinski experience, and that will be difficult in Cuba.\u201dLike many buildings in Havana, the Gran Hotel Manzana \u2014 originally the Manzana de G\u00f3mez \u2014 has a storied past. Built between 1890 and 1918, the shopping arcade housed high-end clothing boutiques, two theaters, restaurants, a skating rink and a shooting range. After the revolution, some stores remained on the first floor, while the other floors were taken over by the government for offices and schools. But in recent years, the building \u2014 like many others in Cuba \u2014 fell into disrepair.From the Constante\u2019s windows, guests can see El Floridita, one of Hemingway\u2019s local watering holes (and where the drink was created). Rooms range in size from 430 to 1,615 square feet and will cost from $370 to $660 per night, according to Alessandro Benedetti, a director of Kempinski\u2019s sales and marketing department.Five stories tall, the Manzana also has a rooftop terrace and swimming pool that offers views of the Great Theater of Havana Alicia Alonso, the National Museum\u2019s Palace of Fine Arts and the Capitolio, a national government building that resembles the Capitol in Washington, though its architect is said to have modeled it on the Panth\u00e9on in Paris.The top floor also has a fitness area and spa that cover over 10,000 square feet. From the windows in the massage room, drying clothes can also be seen hanging from the broken windows of crumbling buildings nearby. This region of the city has been nicknamed \u201clas s\u00e1banas blancas,\u201d or \u201cthe white sheets,\u201d for the laundry frequently seen fluttering in the breeze.Indeed, the building boom is also bringing into sharper relief the disparity between visitors and the average Cuban. Many Cubans work for the state and earn the equivalent of $25 to $30 a month. The ceiling on state employees\u2019 salaries has been a challenge when hiring hospitality staff for these new luxury hotels in Havana.While it remains to be seen how tightly it will control private enterprise, the Cuban government is betting that tourism will help solve its economic woes. In 2016, the government declared a goal of 10 million visitors by 2030.The government is looking for new growth as the Cuban economy shrank 0.9 percent in 2016, hurt by the oil crisis in Venezuela, a key trading partner.The challenge will be avoiding the \u201cCanc\u00fan-ification\u201d of Cuba, said the architect and urban planner Miguel Coyula, referring to the resort area in Mexico that is a particularly popular destination for students on spring break.\u201cWith its culture, history and architecture, Cuba has more than just beach and sun,\u201d Mr. Coyula said. \u201cHavana\u2019s infrastructure is under great pressure already. Millions of tourists looking for rumba and mojitos aren\u2019t going to help that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Netflix-Cannes Clash Couldn\u2019t Be Avoided", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 France is a paradise for moviegoers, with thriving cinemas and state subsidies for new productions. Netflix is a global streaming giant founded on the concept that movie theaters are a thing of the past. So it was perhaps inevitable that the two worlds would collide over the Cannes Film Festival, which begins here on Wednesday.At the heart of the Cannes-Netflix clash is what\u2019s known as the French cultural exception, a law that requires a percentage of all box office, DVD, video on demand, television and streaming revenues to be pooled to finance homegrown films and help finance foreign films. The law also mandates a 36-month delay between theatrical release and streaming date. Netflix has not wanted to participate in the French system, and that offended some in the film industry here.\u201cThey are the perfect representation of American cultural imperialism,\u201d said Christophe Tardieu, director of the National Cinema Center, known as the CNC, a state entity that coordinates public financing of films. It also underwrites more than half the budget of the Cannes Film Festival and has seats on its board, as do French movie theater owners. \u201cI deplore Netflix\u2019s attitude in this affair, which showed total intransigence and refusing to understand and accept how the French cultural exception works,\u201d Mr. Tardieu added.Representatives of Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. After the festival\u2019s decision last week, Reed Hastings, a co-founder of Netflix, posted on Facebook, \u201cThe establishment closing ranks against us. See \u2018Okja\u2019 on Netflix June 28th. Amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into Cannes film festival competition.\u201dIn contrast, another streaming company, Amazon Studios, says it aims for theatrical releases for its films. It has a film in competition at Cannes this year, Todd Haynes\u2019s \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which will be shown in theaters in France.\u201cCannes misjudged,\u201d said Thomas Sotinel, a film critic and journalist at Le Monde. Festival programmers thought \u201cthey could get away with showing Netflix movies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they found out Netflix wouldn\u2019t move, and at the same time they were reminded that on the board of Cannes sit people like the theater owners, who don\u2019t want to budge either. So they were caught between those two very immovable protagonists \u2014 or rather, antagonists.\u201dIn France, the CNC said the Netflix films did not qualify for limited releases under an exemption for less mainstream work. But if Netflix had agreed to a wide release, it would have meant a 36-month wait before the movies could be streamed. That delay is part of France\u2019s \u201cmedia chronology\u201d in the cultural exception law, which sets a strict time frame in which a film moves from theaters to video-on-demand after four months, to cable television after 10 months, to free television after 22 months and finally to a streaming service.Most of the entities in France\u2019s film industry, as well as viewers, agree the 36-month wait is far too long, but complex talks about altering the time frame broke down just days before Cannes announced its rule change.Any new chronology must be approved by cinema owners, producers, cable and free television broadcasters, on-demand operators and associations representing writers, among others. Cable television operators like Canal Plus, which help finance productions aimed for theatrical releases, eventually want those films to be shown on their channels before they move to free channels or to a service that is not contributing to the financing system.\u201cThe difficulty is that you have a system that\u2019s extremely regulated but that works,\u201d said Marc-Olivier Sebbag, the general delegate of the National Federation of French Cinemas.\u201cThere are idiotic rules that don\u2019t let Netflix films come out for 36 months; I understand it\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Pascal Rogard, director general of the authors\u2019 society. \u201cThe real open question that will be given to the next culture minister is, \u2018Can we create a modernized media chronology so a film doesn\u2019t have to wait three years to go to Netflix?\u2019\u201dMr. Rogard and others said that they hoped the new government of President Emmanuel Macron would dedicate some political will to helping the parties shorten the time frame. Mr. Macron is expected to name a new culture minister this week.Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the Cannes Film Festival director who oversees selecting films for competition, said he had no comment beyond the official statement last week.That statement said that the festival was \u201caware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in France,\u201d adding that it had \u201casked Netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of French movie theaters and not only its subscribers.\u201d As a result, it stated, \u201cthe festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.\u201dOn Monday, the festival announced that its opening and closing ceremonies would be broadcast to select French movie theaters \u2014 at the same time they\u2019re broadcast live on Canal Plus pay television.Advertisement"}

This is a battle between good and evil.\u201dThe president\u2019s measured tone here was a far cry from his incendiary language on the campaign trail last year, when he said that \u201cIslam hates us\u201d and called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslims entering the United States.Throughout his visit, a less volatile president emerged, disciplined and relentlessly on message in a way he is often not at home. He did not brag about his electoral victory and avoided tangents. With few exceptions, he stuck carefully to his teleprompter. His mood has been sober and careful.By refusing to hold news conferences or answer questions during brief photo opportunities, Mr. Trump orchestrated a sense of diplomatic calm that contrasted sharply with the chaos that usually surrounds him in Washington. He has not used Twitter as a cudgel against adversaries since his overseas trip began.In his speech on Sunday, he made no mention of the executive orders he signed after taking office barring visitors from several predominantly Muslim countries. Instead, he described Islam as \u201cone of the world\u2019s great faiths\u201d and called for \u201ctolerance and respect for each other.\u201dWhen that moment in the speech came, however, Mr. Trump went off script and used both words, Islamic and Islamist. \u201cThat means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds,\u201d he said. An aide said afterward that the president was \u201cjust an exhausted guy\u201d and had tripped over the term, rather than rejected the language suggested by his aides.But if the speech during the second day of a nine-day overseas trip was intended as a sort of reset from his campaign and early presidency, it was also meant to turn away from Mr. Obama\u2019s approach. Rather than preach about human rights or democracy, Mr. Trump said he wanted \u201cpartners, not perfection.\u201d And he said it was up to Muslim leaders to expunge extremists from their midst.\u201cDrive them out,\u201d he said. \u201cDrive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land. And drive them out of this earth.\u201dMr. Trump received a warm welcome in the room as Muslim leaders put behind them the messages of the campaign and the attempted travel ban, and he has gotten along well with fellow leaders, who have turned to flattery.\u201cI agree!\u201d Mr. Trump responded cheerily, as laughter rolled through the room.A few moments later, Mr. Trump returned the compliment, in a fashion. \u201cLove your shoes,\u201d he told Mr. Sisi. \u201cBoy, those shoes. Man!\u201dThe cities Mr. Trump will visit and what events are planned.But some activists back in the United States gave the president mixed reviews at the start of his trip.\u201cThis administration is committed to a 180-degree reversal of the Obama policy on Iran,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. \u201cThey see the Iranian threat as fundamentally linked to the nature and behavior of the regime and its revolutionary and expansionist ideology.\u201dMr. Trump toured the new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, which employs 350 technicians tracking online radicalism and monitoring 100 television channels in 11 languages. The Trump administration and Saudi Arabia also announced the creation of a joint Terrorist Financing Targeting Center to formalize longstanding cooperation and search for new ways to cut off sources of money for extremists.Mr. Trump made little mention of human rights in any of the meetings, and he promised in his speech not to do so publicly. \u201cWe are not here to lecture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership \u2014 based on shared interests and values \u2014 to pursue a better future for us all.\u201dThat approach drew bipartisan criticism back in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s in our national security interest to advocate for democracy and freedom and human rights,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d On the same program, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called it \u201ca terrible abdication of our global leadership.\u201dMichele Dunne, the director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the president had laid blame for terrorism on Muslim leaders who he says have not done enough. \u201cThere are elements of truth to Trump\u2019s narrative,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it ignores the deeper grievances, the political and economic injustices, that make young people in the region especially susceptible to extremist ideologies at this particular time.\u201dSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson told reporters, \u201cThe president clearly was extending a hand, and understanding that only together can we address this threat of terrorism.\u201dSome advisers who advocated stronger action and language about what they call the Islamic threat have either left the administration or faded in influence. Michael T. Flynn, General McMaster\u2019s predecessor as national security adviser, was fired for other reasons. Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, has lost sway.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Addiction to Debt Now Threatens Its Growth", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has gone on a spending spree, borrowing money to build cities, create manufacturing giants and nurture financial markets \u2014 money that has helped drive the economic powerhouse in recent years. But the debt-fueled binge now threatens to sap growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.China\u2019s addiction to debt traces back to the global financial crisis in 2008. As world growth faltered, China unleashed a wave of spending to build highways, airports and real estate developments \u2014 all of which kept the economic engine chugging.To finance the construction, local governments and state-run companies borrowed heavily. Even after the worst of the crisis passed, China continued to rely on debt to fund growth.But credit no longer packs the same punch for China. An aging work force, smaller productivity gains and the sheer math of diminishing returns mean that China has to borrow more money to achieve less growth.The country\u2019s debt has recently been increasing by an amount equal to about 15 percent of the country\u2019s output each year, which has kept the economy expanding between 6.5 percent and 7 percent. Debt, by the same measure, barely changed from 2001 to 2008, when the country achieved some of its fastest, double-digit growth rates.The borrowing binge of late has also been propelled by murky investments with potentially big risks. Foresea Life Insurance, for example, offered souped-up policies that looked more like high-octane investments than staid life insurance.The products promised interest rates more than double traditional bank accounts, attracting droves of ordinary investors. To churn out those gains, Foresea took increasingly speculative bets, pouring the money into real estate, corporate deals and China\u2019s turbulent bond market.China in recent months has stepped up a campaign to clean up the financial system, which is riddled with such products.For China, it is a matter of stability. At a meeting with top leaders last month, President Xi Jinping emphasized that the health of the financial system was an issue of national security.\u201cFinance is the core of a modern economy,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cWe must do a good job in the financial sector in order to ensure stable and healthy economic development.\u201dForesea has pointed to the potential for instability from its own mess. A memo reportedly from Foresea, sent anonymously last week to several Chinese media outlets and reviewed by The New York Times, warns of mass demonstrations, presumably by policyholders, if it cannot raise more money and shore up its finances.Chinese media said the memo appeared to be genuine \u2014 it carried the company\u2019s official seal and other identifying information. The company declined to comment, issuing a statement last week saying that its cash flow was fine.Chinese authorities are facing a complex, economic puzzle: how to squeeze debt-fueled speculation out of the system without choking off growth or drawing unhappy investors into the streets.The government\u2019s latest efforts to reduce risk have contributed to turbulence in the country\u2019s markets. Higher borrowing costs and unusual distortions in lending suggest that investors are skittish about growth. After a strong start to the year, China\u2019s economy is showing signs of cooling.Here lies Beijing\u2019s challenge. The country is reluctant to take strong measures to control overall credit growth, fearing a broad slowdown in lending could prevent the economy from reaching the Chinese leadership\u2019s growth targets. But without drastic action, the debt levels will keep rising, in potentially unsustainable ways.\u201cChina\u2019s recent economic growth trajectory has been accompanied by a buildup of imbalances and vulnerabilities that poses risks to its basic economic and financial stability,\u201d Andrew Fennell, the director of Asian sovereign debt ratings at Fitch Ratings, said.Foresea is an extreme example of the manic speculation that hangs over the entire system.The insurer collected just $40 million in premiums in its first year after it was started five years ago. Last year, the company collected $14.6 billion.Insurers, trusts, non-bank financial companies, small local banks and other semiregulated or unregulated businesses have all been trying to ride China\u2019s ever-expanding credit markets to quick profits. They have accounted for more than half the country\u2019s overall lending activity.Foresea started to run into problems late last year. Its founder and controlling shareholder, Yao Zhenhua, made a hostile bid for Vanke, one of the country\u2019s largest real estate buyers, with plans to fund the deal in large part with insurance premiums.Those types of highly leveraged deals are getting more scrutiny. And Chinese authorities have started to publicly warn about speculative, loosely regulated lending.\u201cThe continuing increasing leverage rate is not good for sustainable development of the economy, and some risks have accumulated,\u201d Yi Gang, a senior deputy governor of the central bank, said in March. \u201cWe should think first to stabilize leverage \u2014 that is, to stabilize the overall rate of leverage, or let it grow more slowly.\u201dZhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, said the same month: \u201cEvery enterprise, especially those with too high a rate of leverage, should be controlled.\u201dForesea was among the first to be pinched.The China Insurance Regulatory Commission in December banned Foresea from offering new products, contending that the company was essentially selling high-yield debt even though it had permission to issue relatively low-risk life insurance. Two months later, the regulator accused the company of misleading authorities.\u201cThe fact that Foresea Life made up and provided fake material is clear,\u201d the commission said. \u201cIt is a serious circumstance that should be punished according to the law.\u201dThe moves have spooked customers. Revenues from newly issued policies plummeted 99.8 percent in the first quarter from the same period last year, to just $11.4 million. Investors also became wary, demanding their money back.Foresea has insisted the business remains healthy.

{"Headline": "As Iran and U.S. Leaders Trade Barbs, Big Deals Proceed", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byNews Analysis\u201cUntil the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the meeting, \u201call nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism.\u201dIn what seemed to be a response to the arms deal, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that such purchases would lead to nothing.\u201cIn terms of whether I\u2019d ever pick the phone up, I\u2019ve never shut off the phone to anyone that wants to talk or have a productive conversation,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.The Trump administration appears to have grasped an important point about Iran: The very thing that the administration complains and worries about \u2014 Iran\u2019s expanding influence in the region \u2014 makes it imperative that the two countries maintain at least a working relationship.The United States will have a hard time solving problems in the Mideast without Tehran\u2019s cooperation: in Lebanon, where it backs the Shiite militant group Hezbollah; in Syria, where it is propping up the government of President Bashar al-Assad; in Iraq, where it supports the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and trains powerful Shiite militias; and in Yemen, where to some extent, it is backing the Houthi rebels against the government.That is why some analysts are saying there would be room for compromise if the two countries ever sat down to talk, with the United States trading its control over the Iranian economy for concessions in regional affairs from Iran.The Trump administration did impose a series of sanctions on individuals and companies after Iran conducted a missile test in February. But that was in line with policies set out by President Obama.Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 1979, after the hostage crisis at the United States Embassy. But they did speak directly during the negotiations over the nuclear agreement, which began in secret in 2013, even before Mr. Rouhani was first elected later that year.The Iranian president is under pressure from hard-liners in his country to shun direct talks with the United States. But he can point to tangible benefits that have resulted from face-to-face meetings with the West. The nuclear agreement would never have been reached without such dialogue, and the deal has helped ease the suffocating, worldwide sanctions that brought the Iranian economy to a standstill and Tehran to the bargaining table.\u201cThey took part in the negotiations; and at the table, they respectfully spoke to the representatives of the Iranian nation,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said of the American representatives to the nuclear negotiations. \u201cWe had a win-win outcome there, one which I believe was to the benefit of Iran, all P5+1 member states and the world,\u201d he said at the news conference, using the diplomatic name for the countries at the negotiating table with Iran: the United States, Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany.Mr. Rouhani needs such additional talks now to make good on his campaign promise to obtain relief from the unilateral United States sanctions that are still choking the Iranian economy. While many sanctions were lifted under the nuclear agreement, those remaining are still discouraging European banks from providing desperately needed financing for business deals and infrastructure projects in Iran.Mr. Rouhani said on Monday that if Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Mr. Khamenei, agreed, he would try to start the process to get those sanctions lifted. \u201cIt will be difficult, but possible,\u201d he said.On the American side, the private sector experience of many in the new administration in Washington may make them more amenable to the idea of negotiations, suggested Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a reformist analyst of Iranian politics. \u201cTrump, Tillerson, the others; this is an administration of businessmen. They solve problems by dealing, not fighting,\u201d he said.One official, an adviser to Mr. Zarif, the foreign minister, said he did not rule out direct negotiations, but added that the Iranians were still trying to read Mr. Trump. \u201cHe is a businessman,\u201d said the adviser, Hossein Sheikholeslam, \u201cbut even in business he acts impulsively and unpredictably.\u201dA news analysis article on Monday about American-Iranian diplomacy misidentified one country among a group of nations, known as the P5+1, involved in negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Besides Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, the group also included Germany, but not Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron\u2019s Disastrous Eurozone Plan", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byContributing Opinion WriterCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I can\u2019t remember a single European partner opening its wallet after 1989, when Germany faced its greatest economic challenge in postwar history. Somehow, without much support from its neighbors, this country managed to reunify a prosperous West with a post-Communist East whose factories and infrastructure had been worn down by 40 years of socialist mismanagement. Not only that, it incorporated 16 million East Germans into the Western social insurance and pension system they had never paid into.No one in Europe rushed to write checks, but they lined up to give donations of historical skepticism and political demands. In order to soothe French anxieties in particular, the German government agreed to give up its beloved, powerful Deutschmark, a currency President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of France had likened to a German \u201cnuclear force,\u201d in favor of the euro.So it\u2019s all a bit rich to hear, during the recent French elections, politicians from the left and the right malign Germany for France\u2019s enduring economic crisis, arguing that Germany\u2019s outsize economic strength has come at the expense of its Gallic neighbor. It would be funny if it weren\u2019t dangerous \u2014 the solution offered by the new, pro-Europe president, Emmanuel Macron, is to create a eurozone budget, with its own finance minister.I firmly believe that the wounded, Brexit-crippled European Union needs an infusion of new self-confidence and resolve. But Mr. Macron\u2019s proposal is a disaster in the making. It will only further alienate Europeans from one another and weaken the bloc economically.For years, the European Union has suffered from a crisis of underperformance, pushed low by two forms of convenient self-deception: first, the blatant egoism when it comes to international challenges like refugee management and foreign policy; and second, an all too lighthearted approach when it comes to national matters like economic reform.Brussels\u2019s money has often been Europe\u2019s curse. The Greek government, for instance, knew it could take for granted the support of the other euro members for its unsustainable budget after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany recklessly declared, \u201cIf the euro fails, Europe fails.\u201d Athens slowed down on reform, knowing Brussels would bail it out, and northern Europeans grew angry.In the worst case, Mr. Macron\u2019s plan could turn this disincentive into a characteristic feature of the European Union. Without political leverage, Brussels would end up holding the purse but not the purse strings.Mr. Macron hasn\u2019t specified exactly how this centralized budget would work \u2014 and more to the point what his administration expects from Brussels, now or in the future. Along with talk about a Brussels budget, there\u2019s also chatter in Paris about Eurobonds. Both measures would make certain euro members at least partially carry other members\u2019 deficits.That may explain a backhanded compliment by Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, after the French election. \u201cIf a French president has the courage to set a clear signal for Europe after his election, then Germany must have the courage to rethink its own deadlocked positions within the monetary union,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said.Translated, Mr. Gabriel is saying that if Mr. Macron pursues real reforms \u2014 the \u201cclear signal for Europe\u201d \u2014 then Germany might be willing to open its own coffers \u2014 those \u201cdeadlocked positions\u201d against bailouts as anything but a last resort. In other words, Mr. Gabriel is offering Mr. Macron a trade: real reform in France for real support from Germany \u2014 not just for France, but for the rest of the eurozone.This isn\u2019t nothing. Any attempt at reforming France by Mr. Macron will very likely be met with fierce resistance by the unions there. They, along with many supporters of the defeated nationalist contender Marine Le Pen, have long identified the new president and ex-banker as a coldhearted \u201cneoliberal\u201d who cares more about profits than about people.This always seemed strange to me. Mr. Macron\u2019s background aside, his reformist zeal is hardly unrealistic: He wants to cut the ratio of government spending to G.D.P. to 53 percent from 56 percent. If that makes him a malicious \u201cneoliberal,\u201d then what kind of monsters must be governing the euro states of neighboring Spain (42 percent) and Germany (44 percent)?If French workers oppose any and all reforms, if they insist on keeping their 35-hour workweek and their retirement age at 62, that\u2019s their choice. But they\u2019d better stop complaining about Germany\u2019s record trade surplus.Yes, the euro has a built-in problem: Its member states cannot devalue their currency in times of crisis. But members knew that going in, and there\u2019s no point repressing this now. Instead they can try working harder to catch up with the strongest.In a nod to another youthful president, Mr. Macron needs to put more of this to his people: Ask not what Germany can do for you. Ask what you can do for France.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

So much so that the France Unbowed movement of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the hard-left candidate who received 19.6 percent of the first-round vote, announced that its members were not inclined to turn out for Mr. Macron on Sunday.In an unscientific online survey of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s supporters conducted by his party, only 34.8 percent said they would vote for Mr. Macron against Ms. Le Pen. Nearly two-thirds of those who participated in the poll said they would abstain or cast a blank ballot in the final round.Though more than seven million people voted for Mr. M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, fewer than 250,000 people took part in the online straw poll. Voting for Ms. Le Pen was not one of the options.Ms. Le Pen may have an equally difficult time, no matter whose words she uses, persuading the supporters of her vanquished rivals to back her candidacy. Damien Abad, a former spokesman for Mr. Fillon, said that she was unlikely to persuade many of those who had voted for Mr. Fillon. \u201cFran\u00e7ois Fillon\u2019s voters aren\u2019t fooled,\u201d he told BFM-TV. \u201cThey won\u2019t be bought because one copies parts of their candidate\u2019s speech.\u201d\u201cIt is good (and significant) that Marine Le Pen and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, expressing themselves on France\u2019s universal calling, do so with the same terms,\u201d wrote Mr. Co\u00fbteaux, who founded but no longer presides over a small far-right organization close to the National Front called Sovereignty, Identity and Liberties.Still, he told the newspaper that he supported Ms. Le Pen and was not \u201cdispleased\u201d that the two candidates had used his words.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Health Policy Is Vital to Tax Reform Policy", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThere is strong bipartisan support in Congress for cutting the corporate tax rate to improve competitiveness. If done in a revenue-neutral manner, as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was, that simultaneously gets rid of inefficient tax loopholes that distort business decision making, this would be a good thing. But what is really holding back the international competitiveness of American businesses isn\u2019t so much the tax code as our health system.The United States is unique among major countries in that health insurance for the working population is provided almost entirely by employers. And until the Affordable Care Act, they weren\u2019t even required to do so; small businesses are still not required.No one ever sat down and thought up this system; it came about by accident during World War II. Because of wage and price controls, employers couldn\u2019t raise wages. But because so many young men were in the military and the large demand for war production, many businesses had an acute labor shortage.To provide additional compensation to get the workers they needed, some businesses started offering health insurance on top of cash wages. Before the war, health insurance was rarely provided.Although obviously a form of income to the worker, the Internal Revenue Service nevertheless ruled that it was not taxable, although businesses could still deduct the cost. This anomalous tax treatment was a fabulous tax loophole for both businesses and workers, especially at a time when tax rates were historically high.Eventually Congress codified the I.R.S. ruling and we have been stuck with an employer-based health insurance system ever since. Although from time to time, politicians have suggested getting rid of the exclusion for health insurance and using the revenue to create an individually based health insurance system, such efforts have been short-lived and unsuccessful.The problem for competitiveness is that businesses are saddled with a huge and rising cost that they cannot pass on to consumers because they must compete with foreign businesses that do not bear this cost. In most other countries, health insurance is provided by the government and financed with a value-added tax that is rebated at the border. (With a V.A.T., the tax applies at the border on imports and is rebated on exports so that exports are free of tax.) Thus, none of the cost of providing health insurance is borne by businesses or embedded in the cost of internationally traded goods.Consequently, foreign businesses have a huge competitive advantage over those in the United States that are forced to provide health insurance for their workers. Of course, such businesses are also at a disadvantage against companies that choose not to provide this benefit for their employees. This is a key reason employment in the American manufacturing sector has declined sharply over the past several decades. Manufacturers, such as those in the steel and auto industries, are among those most likely to provide good health insurance because of strong unions.Back when Congress considered the Affordable Care Act in 2009, one of the first decisions made was to take the exclusion for health insurance off the table. The House recently passed a Republican plan to replace the A.C.A. that also did not touch the exclusion or do anything to reduce the burden of health insurance on businesses.Of course, eliminating the exclusion for health insurance would increase the tax burden on employers and many would drop it. Obviously, Congress would have to come up with something to replace such coverage. But since an individually based health insurance system, which all Republicans favor, would necessarily require tax credits to allow the insurance to be afforded, tax reform is the perfect time to consider such a scheme.If the Republicans are serious about using tax reform to improve the competitiveness of American businesses, the best thing they can do is reform employer-based health insurance.Advertisement"}

The senators have introduced legislation to cut off American aid if the Palestinians refuse.\u201cThe president should raise this with Mahmoud Abbas and he should push for its passage,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a good test of Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership of how serious they are about wanting peace and not wanting terrorism.\u201dThe legislation underscored the complexity of the peace effort that Mr. Trump is embarking on as he seeks to negotiate a durable resolution to the generations-old dispute between Israelis and Palestinians that, so far, has eluded every American president. During the presidential campaign and transition, Mr. Trump positioned himself as an unwavering ally of Israel but has moderated some of his positions since taking office as he courts support from Arab leaders in the Middle East.Mr. Abbas\u2019s visit to the White House will present Mr. Trump with the Palestinian viewpoint more directly than he has ever heard it as president. But at 82, Mr. Abbas is a weakened political figure facing public discontent and divisions at home.His Palestinian Authority operates in the West Bank, while the more militant rival Hamas faction rules in Gaza. Despite an effort by Hamas this week to present a somewhat more moderate face to the world, the two factions remain at odds. Even if they did reconcile, Israel has refused to deal with any coalition that includes what it and the United States consider a terrorist organization.\u201cThe P.A. orchestrated one of the great diplomatic deceptions of the last 30 years,\u201d Mr. Gerber said. \u201cIt\u2019s only being exposed now. President Trump has the opportunity to let the world know that the sponsorship of terror is intolerable and will have consequences.\u201dPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel raised the issue on Tuesday, making clear it will be a point of contention in any talks. \u201cThe payment of money to terrorists by a sliding scale \u2014 the more you kill the more you get \u2014 that\u2019s the opposite of peace,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cIt sends exactly the wrong message to young Palestinians. We want them to move towards peace.\u201dPalestinian leaders defend the payments, saying they are meant to help widows and orphans of \u201cmartyrs,\u201d as they call suicide bombers and others killed in attacks, as well as destitute families of prisoners, not to promote terrorism. They say Israel effectively subsidizes violence by encouraging settlers in the occupied West Bank. \u201cI think the worst kind of terrorism is the occupation,\u201d Jibril Rajoub, a top Palestinian official, said in an interview during a recent trip to Washington.But Mr. Rajoub also signaled that Palestinian leaders would be willing to reconsider the payments as part of a broader negotiation. \u201cWe will discuss everything with an open mind,\u201d he said.Mr. Force, 28, was a combat veteran studying at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt when he joined other students on a March 2016 trip to Israel to learn about global entrepreneurship. He was stabbed by a Palestinian member of Hamas on a coastal promenade near Tel Aviv.

Massey Jr., according to the latest campaign finance records, which were disclosed on Monday.Mr. Massey, a former real estate sales executive who remains unknown to many New Yorkers, raised nearly $545,000. That figure, lower than his haul during the prior two-month fund-raising period, threatened to undermine the best case for his candidacy: that his fund-raising prowess could underwrite a strong challenge to the incumbent mayor.Mr. Massey\u2019s campaign also continued to spend money faster than it took it in, recording more than $1 million in spending in the latest filing, mostly on consultants and campaign staff. Mr. Massey, who has lent himself more than $2.7 million so far and has already paid some of it back, is not participating in the city\u2019s public campaign finance program, which offers a six-to-one match for the first $175 from each donor.\u201cI\u2019m very, very happy with the way our fund-raising is going,\u201d Mr. Massey told reporters on Monday before the numbers were disclosed. He was speaking at a news conference at City Hall with an erstwhile rival in the Republican race, the Rev. Michel J. Faulkner, who is now running for comptroller.\u201cThat\u2019s a great start,\u201d said E. O\u2019Brien Murray, a Republican political consultant not affiliated with any of the mayoral candidates. \u201cThe whisper number was that she had to get to six figures.\u201dMs. Malliotakis pointed out that she had attracted small donations from 584 individual contributors, most of them in New York City (the majority from Staten Island). Her donors included her family, her Assembly campaign and John A. Catsimatidis, the grocery magnate, and his wife, Margo.Ms. Malliotakis has yet to spend money, other than paying $17.50 to use her official state portrait for her campaign.Perhaps the oddest revelation in the filings came from Mr. Faulkner, who declared his run for city comptroller this month and was endorsed on Monday by Mr. Massey during their appearance at City Hall. Mr. Faulkner reported a charge of $188.85 to his campaign for e-Harmony, the dating service; the campaign also recorded a reimbursement for that charge.The payment to e-Harmony was the only one in the filing listed as being the result of \u201cdebit theft.\u201dA campaign spokesman, Ken Frydman, called the charge fraudulent and said it had been the result of the candidate\u2019s campaign card having been stolen or lost. \u201cThey canceled the card; it was his card,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman for e-Harmony said the company had been alerted to the fraudulent account and closed it on April 21, a day after it was created.Mr. Faulkner\u2019s filing indicated the struggles of his campaign for mayor, which he declared nearly two years ago and ended last week. His campaign has spent about $76,000 more than it has taken in, despite several loans. The incumbent comptroller, Scott M.

To emphasize the point, he wrote it out in Chinese in a notebook. \u201cWe are against using corruption to root out corruption.\u201dMr. Guo\u2019s most recent claims have reverberated across China and fed unease on Wall Street about doing business there. The assertions, if substantiated, could upend politics in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, possibly driving a wedge between President Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan, the anticorruption czar.Mr. Wang, the focus of Mr. Guo\u2019s allegations, has close ties to Wall Street, with enormous influence over China\u2019s financial sector. Mr. Guo\u2019s assertions come just months before a Communist Party meeting that will decide whether Mr. Wang, recently the focus of speculation that he may become China\u2019s next prime minister, will remain on the party\u2019s elite Politburo Standing Committee.Mr. Guo\u2019s Twitter broadsides have continued, and his ability to stare down the world\u2019s most powerful authoritarian nation has underscored the mystery, in China and abroad, about how he acquired his billions, what he knows and who, if anyone, is backing him.No one better represents the marriage of the party and money than Mr. Guo, known as Miles Kwok outside China, who parlayed relationships with some of China\u2019s most powerful officials to help build a global portfolio including hotels, office buildings and securities brokerage firms.\u201cThe allegations with regard to HNA simply aren\u2019t true,\u201d a spokesperson for HNA said.Over a decade ago, the Chinese Communist Party welcomed businessmen into its ranks. In turn, those tycoons helped make the sons and daughters of the revolution rich while helping the country show spectacular growth rates. Now, armed with information, one of them has strayed.\u201cThese people have power and influence and knowledge,\u201d said William C. Kirby, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cMany of them are easily controlled. But others go off the reservation.\u201dMr. Guo\u2019s presence in the United States poses a dilemma for the Trump administration, which is seeking China\u2019s cooperation to rein in North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. In recent years Mr. Guo provided Washington with insights into Chinese politics through his visits with embassy officials in Beijing, according to a former senior administration official.When the Times reporters visited Mr. Guo\u2019s apartment at the Sherry-Netherland hotel in late April, he stepped away to take a phone call in another room, with the speakerphone on. His assistant explained that a top aide to Mr. Xi was on the line. The implication was obvious: Despite his unprecedented public tirades against some top officials, Mr. Guo was communicating with the one who matters most.As with many of Mr. Guo\u2019s claims, it wasn\u2019t possible to verify who was on the other end of the call, but the episode was fully in keeping with Mr. Guo\u2019s showman personality. That flair for the dramatic is typical of him, said one longtime acquaintance who was present when he took calls from Mr. Ma, the former intelligence official.When the Chinese government eased up on its attacks against Mr. Guo, the about-face suggested that the Communist Party\u2019s top leadership may not agree on how to deal with him, according to Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies finance and politics in China.\u201cIf the party were unified in opposing Guo Wengui, his family would have had much harsher treatment,\u201d he said.Mr. Guo boasts of multiple residences around the world, including in Beijing, London, Tokyo, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. His oceanside home there, with sweeping views of Repulse Bay, sits on two lots that Mr. Guo\u2019s son bought for 880 million Hong Kong dollars ($113 million) in 2011, according to property records.His lakeside property in Beijing is modeled on a traditional one-story courtyard home but is far more elaborate, with multiple levels, a cavernous closet with hundreds of identical suits, and a pool, in a complex of more than 86,000 square feet. One real estate agent in Beijing estimated its value at about $230 million.At dinner, he pressed his case, all the while watching a Chinese soap opera on a tiny television screen. \u201cIt was, still to this day, the most bizarre evening I have ever spent in China,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. (Harvard did not take Mr. Guo up on his offer.)Mr. Guo says the motivation for his corruption allegations is simple: He claims the state shot one of his brothers in 1989 and he has been plotting his revenge ever since. The circumstances of the death are murky, though, like much of Mr. Guo\u2019s story.He says he was born in May 1970, one of 10 boys in a family with ties to the Chinese Army from a small town in eastern China\u2019s Shandong Province. (Legal documents say he was born in February 1967.) In prison, Mr. Guo, who has only a middle-school education, learned about Chinese history and other topics from educated inmates, he said.After his release in 1991, Mr. Guo met a prominent businesswoman who introduced him to wealthy investors. Soon after he built a hotel in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which became a meeting spot for government officials.Since then, he has lived abroad and his assets in China \u2014 he claims 120 billion renminbi ($17.4 billion) in all \u2014 have been frozen. Mr. Guo is facing financial pressures.One hedge fund in Hong Kong, the Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund, recently sued him in New York, saying that he owes $88 million, a sum that includes millions of dollars in interest in loans from 2008. The fund wants to seize his New York apartment.A representative for Mr. Blair did not address whether Mr. Blair had made introductions for Mr. Guo. Mr. Guo said the article was groundless.Mr. Wang did not respond to faxed questions sent to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Beijing.\u201cWang Qishan has been the model of clean and competent, and all but untouchable,\u201d said William Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cShould his star fall, business and government players should be concerned about their own safety.\u201dThere\u2019s no sign that Mr. Guo is letting up. Before the Communist Party meets this fall to pick a slate of top leaders, Mr. Guo plans his most dramatic assault of all: a live event, perhaps from Lincoln Center, that will focus on Chinese corruption.\u201cI want it to be carnival-style with a big screen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will sing. We will cry and we will talk about the world.\u201dChristopher Buckley and David Barboza contributed reporting. Kiki Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beauty Product\u2019s Ads Exclude the Black Women Who Use It", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLast week, the hair-care line SheaMoisture faced a powerful customer backlash. The offense was a series of online video clips that highlighted the versatility of the brand\u2019s shampoos, conditioners and styling aids.When the video was released on social media, SheaMoisture\u2019s black customers revolted. Social media users with huge followings, many of whom have provided years of free advertising for the brand, criticized it as marginalizing their loyal black buyers in an effort to attract white women.When black women bought SheaMoisture products, they were rejecting powerful stereotypes about black women\u2019s hair as inherently unattractive. Unwittingly or not, SheaMoisture was part of a political project for black women, helping us resist harmful biases about our natural hair that circumscribe our choices and well-being.To believe it is possible to diversify SheaMoisture beyond its black natural-hair customer base, one must believe that black beauty is desirable for non-black consumers. For that to be true, black women would have to be an ideal beauty type in the global market that Mr. Dennis was going after. Mr. Dennis had one problem: reality.The sociologist Margaret Hunter writes about a concept she calls the beauty queue: a hierarchy of desirable female characteristics. At the head of the queue are white women with pale skin, narrow features and straight (ideally blond) hair. Behind them are the rest of the world\u2019s women, in descending order from most to least white-looking, with black women at the end. This theory describes what black women in the United States have experienced for two centuries: lighter skin and \u201cAnglo\u201d features are a type of global capital that derives its value from the status of white people.These products are selling a very specific version of Korean beauty. Their advertisements do not reflect the full range of skin tones of Asian women. Instead, they feature remarkably pale women selling products whose primary selling point is how \u201cluminescent\u201d they will make skin appear. K-beauty is noted for its many \u201cwhitening\u201d products, from soaps to treatments. They have names like Missha Time Revolution White Cure Blanc Tone-Up Cream, Klavuu White Pearlsation Pearl Serum Mask, and Skinfood Yuja Water C Whitening Ampoule. Products like these reinforce white women\u2019s position at the head of the beauty queue. They are ultimately selling the idea summarized in a black Southern folk saying: \u201cWhite is all right; Brown get out of town; Black jump back.\u201dSheaMoisture could not sell a product meant to make black women look \u201cwhiter,\u201d such as a chemical treatment to straighten hair, without changing its entire product line. But it could concede to the demands of capital by marketing its existing products to non-black women. SheaMoisture eventually apologized, acknowledging the insult many black women felt. By prominently featuring white women in what had become a political project, the company had signaled to black women that we could never be enough.Beauty is never just about preference. It is about economics and power and exclusion. Brands like SheaMoisture rely on certain ideas of what is beautiful to make money. And too often, selling beauty means throwing black women under the bus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind China\u2019s $1 Trillion Plan to Shake Up the Economic Order", "Date": "2017-05-13", "News": "Supported byVANG VIENG, Laos \u2014 Along the jungle-covered mountains of Laos, squads of Chinese engineers are drilling hundreds of tunnels and bridges to support a 260-mile railway, a $6 billion project that will eventually connect eight Asian countries.Chinese money is building power plants in Pakistan to address chronic electricity shortages, part of an expected $46 billion worth of investment.Chinese planners are mapping out train lines from Budapest to Belgrade, Serbia, providing another artery for Chinese goods flowing into Europe through a Chinese-owned port in Greece.The massive infrastructure projects, along with hundreds of others across Asia, Africa and Europe, form the backbone of China\u2019s ambitious economic and geopolitical agenda. President Xi Jinping of China is literally and figuratively forging ties, creating new markets for the country\u2019s construction companies and exporting its model of state-led development in a quest to create deep economic connections and strong diplomatic relationships.The initiative, called \u201cOne Belt, One Road,\u201d looms on a scope and scale with little precedent in modern history, promising more than $1 trillion in infrastructure and spanning more than 60 countries. To celebrate China\u2019s new global influence, Mr. Xi is gathering dozens of state leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, in Beijing on Sunday.It is global commerce on China\u2019s terms.Mr. Xi is aiming to use China\u2019s wealth and industrial know-how to create a new kind of globalization that will dispense with the rules of the aging Western-dominated institutions. The goal is to refashion the global economic order, drawing countries and companies more tightly into China\u2019s orbit.The projects inherently serve China\u2019s economic interests. With growth slowing at home, China is producing more steel, cement and machinery than the country needs. So Mr. Xi is looking to the rest of the world, particularly developing countries, to keep its economic engine going.\u201cPresident Xi believes this is a long-term plan that will involve the current and future generations to propel Chinese and global economic growth,\u201d said Cao Wenlian, director general of the International Cooperation Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, a group dedicated to the initiative. \u201cThe plan is to lead the new globalization 2.0.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s plan stands in stark contrast to President Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra. The Trump administration walked away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the American-led trade pact that was envisioned as a buttress against China\u2019s growing influence.As head of the Communist Party, Mr. Xi is promoting global leadership in China\u2019s own image, emphasizing economic efficiency and government intervention. And China is corralling all manner of infrastructure projects under the plan\u2019s broad umbrella, without necessarily ponying up the funds.China is moving so fast and thinking so big that it is willing to make short-term missteps for what it calculates to be long-term gains. Even financially dubious projects in corruption-ridden countries like Pakistan and Kenya make sense for military and diplomatic reasons.The United States and many of its major European and Asian allies have taken a cautious approach to the project, leery of bending to China\u2019s strategic goals. Some, like Australia, have rebuffed Beijing\u2019s requests to sign up for the plan. Despite projects on its turf, India is uneasy because Chinese-built roads will run through disputed territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.But it is impossible for any foreign leader, multinational executive or international banker to ignore China\u2019s push to remake global trade.Germany\u2019s minister of economics and energy, Brigitte Zypries, plans to attend the meeting in Beijing. Western industrial giants like General Electric and Siemens are coming, as they look for lucrative contracts and try to stay in China\u2019s good graces.The Trump administration just upgraded its participation.As the sun beat down on Chinese workers driving bulldozers, four huge tractor-trailers rolled into a storage area here in Vang Vieng, a difficult three-hour drive over potholed roads from the capital, Vientiane. They each carried massive coils of steel wire.Half a mile away, a Chinese cement mixing plant with four bays glistened in the sun. Nearby, along a newly laid road, another Chinese factory was providing cement for tunnel construction.Nearly everything for the Laos project is made in China. Almost all the labor force is Chinese. At the peak of construction, there will be an estimated 100,000 Chinese workers.When Mr. Xi announced the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d plan in September 2013, it was clear that Beijing needed to do something for the industries that had succeeded in building China\u2019s new cities, railways and roads \u2014 state-led investment that turned it into an economic powerhouse. China did not have a lot left to build, and growth started to sputter.Each nation in Mr. Xi\u2019s plan brings its own strategic advantages.The power plants in Pakistan, as well as upgrades to a major highway and a $1 billion port expansion, are a political bulwark. By prompting growth in Pakistan, China wants to blunt the spread of Pakistan\u2019s terrorists across the border into the Xinjiang region, where a restive Muslim population of Uighurs resides. It has military benefits, providing China\u2019s navy future access to a remote port at Gwadar managed by a state-backed Chinese company with a 40-year contract.In Kenya, China is upgrading a railway from the port of Mombasa to Nairobi that will make it easier to get Chinese goods into the country. The Kenyan government had been unable to persuade others to do the job, whereas China has been transforming crumbling infrastructure in Africa for more than a decade.The rail line, which is set to start running next month, is the first to be built to Chinese standards outside China. The country will benefit for years from maintenance contracts.\u201cChina\u2019s Belt and Road initiative is starting to deliver useful infrastructure, bringing new trade routes and better connectivity to Asia and Europe,\u201d said Tom Miller, author of \u201cChina\u2019s Asian Dream: Empire Building Along the New Silk Road.\u201d \u201cBut Xi will struggle to persuade skeptical countries that the initiative is not a smokescreen for strategic control.\u201dIt is a fast start to a much-delayed program that may bring only limited benefits to the agrarian country.For years, Laos and China sparred over financing. With the cost running at nearly $6 billion, officials in Laos wondered how they would afford their share. The country\u2019s output is just $12 billion annually. A feasibility study by a Chinese company said the railway would lose money for the first 11 years.Such friction is characteristic.In Indonesia, construction of a high-speed railway between Jakarta and Bandung finally began last month after arguments over land acquisition. In Thailand, the government is demanding better terms for a vital railway.China\u2019s outlays for the plan so far have been modest: Only $50 billion has been spent, an \u201cextremely small\u201d amount relative to China\u2019s domestic investment program, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Even China\u2019s good friends so far are left wanting. Mr. Xi attended a groundbreaking ceremony in 2014 in Tajikistan for a gas pipeline, but the project stalled after Beijing\u2019s demand waned.Mr. Putin will be at the center of the Beijing conference. While two companies owned by one of his closest friends, Gennady Timchenko, have benefited from projects, there has not been much else for Russia.\u201cRussia\u2019s elites\u2019 high expectations regarding Belt and Road have gone through a severe reality check, and now oligarchs and officials are skeptical about practical results,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, senior associate at the Carnegie Center in Moscow.China is making calculations that the benefits will outweigh the risks.The investments could complicate Beijing\u2019s effort to stem the exodus of capital outflow that have been weighing on the economy. The cost could also come back to haunt China, whose banks are being pressed to lend to projects that they find less than desirable. By some estimates, over half the countries that have accepted Belt and Road projects have credit ratings below investment grade.\u201cA major constraint in investor enthusiasm,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, \u201cis that many countries in the Central Asian region, where the initial thrust of the initiative is focused, suffer from weak and unstable economies, poor public governance, political stability and corruption.\u201dLaos is one of the risky partners. The Communist government is a longstanding friend of China. But fearing China\u2019s domination, Laos is casting around for other friends as well, including China\u2019s regional rivals Japan and Vietnam.After five years of negotiations over the rail line, Laos finally got a better deal. Laos has an $800 million loan from China\u2019s Export-Import Bank and agreed to form a joint venture with China that will borrow much of the rest.Still, Laos faces a huge debt burden. The International Monetary Fund warned this year that the country\u2019s reserves stood at two months of prospective imports of goods and services. It also expressed concerns that public debt could rise to around 70 percent of the economy.As construction gathers steam, nearby communities are starting to rumble.Farmers are balking at giving up their land. Some members of the national assembly have raised questions about property rights.In the past, he said, the government had promised $10 for an acre of land worth about $100. \u201cBut then they never paid it,\u201d Mr. Sipaseuth added.Was the rail project good for Laos?\u201cWe need civilization. Laos is very poor, very underdeveloped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut how many Chinese will come here? Too many is not a good idea.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Winds Leave New Jersey Lawmaker Caught Between Party and Home", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byIt was the scribbled footnote that did it, rippling across social media networks from northern New Jersey to Washington, revealing a pugnacious side of a low-key lawmaker.In a fund-raising letter to a board member at a New Jersey bank, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey, said he wanted to combat well-organized opponents who had mobilized after the election of President Trump.\u201cP.S. \u2014 One of the ringleaders works in your bank!\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen, the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, wrote in blue ink. The person to whom he was referring, a senior vice president, resigned after being confronted with the letter by her boss.The episode has drawn an ethics complaint against Mr. Frelinghuysen, who worked behind the scenes in Washington for 22 years before rising to a key post that places him at the center of the battle over Mr. Trump\u2019s budget.\u201cThat was very disappointing and very much out of character for Congressman Frelinghuysen,\u201d said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers.The letter was also notable for what it revealed about the pressure that Mr. Frelinghuysen, 71, faces, after having won 12 elections in which he never received less than 58 percent of the vote.Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s victories have been so easy, his Democratic opposition so weak, that the filmmaker Michael Moore once ran a ficus tree against him.But singling out a lone constituent \u2014 and being caught doing so \u2014 suggests, perhaps, a feeling of disquiet.\u201cIt seemed a particularly meanspirited and vengeful thing for Congressman Frelinghuysen to do \u2014 a man who never had a reputation of being that kind of a bare-knuckles fighter,\u201d Professor Baker said. \u201cI think he senses that the ground is shifting from under him.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s election and the Republican hold on Congress are forcing Mr. Frelinghuysen to choose between the party\u2019s conservative leadership and moderate constituents back home.\u201cBecoming the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee \u2014 which, of course, in some ways is the crown jewel of any House member\u2019s career \u2014 has been a bit of a poisoned chalice,\u201d Professor Baker said.Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s response to Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposal has been lukewarm, and he opposed the first House Republican health plan. But, reportedly threatened with losing his chairmanship, he went along with conservatives and supported the House health plan\u2019s second version.Back home, Mr. Trump\u2019s election has given rise to NJ 11th for Change, a group that has held weekly protests at Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s office, jammed his phone lines and called on him to hold a town-hall meeting, which he has refused to do.He did recently hold a telephone call-in event, which allowed him to cut off callers when they disagreed. His frustration showed. \u201cFor people who have jammed our lines and made it difficult for us to meet our constituent needs, it would be nice for you to back off,\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen said at one point.Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s 11th Congressional District, which includes Morris County and parts of Essex, Passaic and Sussex Counties, is what New Jerseyans call Republican horse country. It is one of the richest and most highly educated districts in the country, and the estates in Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s hometown, Harding Township, make it one of the 25 richest ZIP codes in America, according to Forbes magazine.Mr. Frelinghuysen, the scion of a distinguished political family, is one of the wealthiest members of Congress, with an estimated worth of about $54 million, according to federal financial disclosures.\u201cA lot of people think of him \u2014 or at least those who don\u2019t know him think of him \u2014 as some kind of blue blood,\u2019\u2019 said William Westhoven, a veteran political reporter for The Daily Record newspaper. \u201cHe really, really does not present in public in that way in any way, shape or form. Rodney presents as a very, very regular guy \u2014 he dresses in simple suits, he drives a simple car. He shows up at event after event after event constantly.\u201dBut Mr. Frelinghuysen has run into problems, Mr. Westhoven said, after redistricting brought more Democrats into the district as he opted to follow the changing tide in the Republican Party. Mr. Trump eclipsed Hillary Clinton in Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s district by less than one percentage point.\u201cI think you started seeing him leaning more and more to the right as his party leaned more and more to the right,\u201d Mr. Westhoven said.Mr. Frelinghuysen once supported abortion rights but in recent years has voted to limit access to abortion. He also opposes gun control, gay marriage and regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know who he was for years,\u201d said Tom Hilliard, a leader of NJ 11th for Change who helped organize the group\u2019s response to Mr. Frelinghuysen\u2019s vote to replace the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAnd so maybe 20,000 people knew him as the kindly grandpa who shows up at your high school art fair. But now 100,000 people know him as the guy who sold out his constituents.\u201dMr. Frelinghuysen did not respond to a request for an interview.A former New Jersey governor, Thomas H. Kean, one of the most respected Republicans in the state, insists that Mr. Frelinghuysen, despite his voting record, is still a moderate.\u201cHe\u2019s one of the finest public officials I know,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Kean said. \u201cJust total integrity. And unlike almost anybody else who\u2019s had the success, he has he\u2019s never let ambition distort what he\u2019s trying to do.\u2019\u2019Mr. Frelinghuysen comes from a long line of leaders dating to the American Revolution.His father, Peter B. Frelinghuysen, served in the House of Representatives for 22 years, and three Frelinghuysens have been senators, including Frederick, a framer of New Jersey\u2019s first Constitution who fought in the American Revolution. There is a Frelinghuysen Township in northwestern New Jersey, a Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, a Frelinghuysen Middle School in Morristown, a Frelinghuysen building at Rutgers and a Frelinghuysen Arboretum, also in Morristown, on land donated by the family.He is the great-great-great grandson of Peter Ballantine, the founder of the Ballantine Brewery in Newark, which at its peak was the third-largest brewer in America. On his mother\u2019s side, Mr. Frelinghuysen is a great-great-grandson of William Procter, a founder of Procter & Gamble.Mr. Frelinghuysen has not held a town-hall meeting in four years and prefers small events at schools, community groups and veteran organizations.\u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it, but he will be at every pancake breakfast,\u2019\u2019 said Nicolas Platt, a neighbor who grew up near the Frelinghuysens and a former mayor of Harding Township. \u201cHe will be at every fireman rolling out a new fire truck.\u201dOn the other hand, Mr. Platt said he has watched every State of the Union speech since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s, \u201cand I have never seen Rodney Frelinghuysen on camera.\u201dMr. Kean, the former governor, says Mr. Frelinghuysen remains vital to New Jersey\u2019s fortunes because, among other things, he is crucial to securing financing for one of the region\u2019s most critical infrastructure projects: a new train tunnel under the Hudson River.An article on Tuesday about Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey, omitted part of the reporting credit.

{"Headline": "Hackers Came, but the French Were Prepared", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Everyone saw the hackers coming.The National Security Agency in Washington picked up the signs. So did Emmanuel Macron\u2019s bare-bones technology team. And mindful of what happened in the American presidential campaign, the team created dozens of false email accounts, complete with phony documents, to confuse the attackers.The Russians, for their part, were rushed and a bit sloppy, leaving a trail of evidence that was not enough to prove for certain they were working for the government of President Vladimir V. Putin but which strongly suggested they were part of his broader \u201cinformation warfare\u201d campaign.The story told by American officials, cyberexperts and Mr. Macron\u2019s own campaign aides of how a hacking attack intended to disrupt the most consequential election in France in decades ended up a dud was a useful reminder that as effective as cyberattacks can be in disabling Iranian nuclear plants, or Ukrainian power grids, they are no silver bullet. The kind of information warfare favored by Russia can be defeated by early warning and rapid exposure.But that outcome was hardly assured on Friday night, when what was described as a \u201cmassive\u201d hacking attack suddenly put Mr. Macron\u2019s electoral chances in jeopardy. To French and American officials, however, it was hardly a surprise.Testifying in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said American intelligence agencies had seen the attack unfolding, telling their French counterparts, \u201cLook, we\u2019re watching the Russians. We\u2019re seeing them penetrate some of your infrastructure. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. What can we do to try to assist?\u201dBut the staff at Mr. Macron\u2019s makeshift headquarters in the 15th Arrondissement at the edge of Paris didn\u2019t need the N.S.A. to tell them they were being targeted: In December, after the former investment banker and finance minister had emerged as easily the most anti-Russian, pro-NATO and pro-European Union candidate in the presidential race, they began receiving phishing emails.The phishing mails were \u201chigh quality,\u201d said Mr. Macron\u2019s digital director, Mounir Mahjoubi: They included the actual names of members of the campaign staff, and at first glance appeared to come from them. Typical was the very last one the campaign received, several days before the election on Sunday, which purported to have come from Mr. Mahjoubi himself.\u201cIt was almost like a joke, like giving us all the finger,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said in an interview on Tuesday. The final email enjoined recipients to download several files \u201cto protect yourself.\u201dEven before then, the Macron campaign had begun looking for ways to make life a little harder for the Russians, showing a level of skill and ingenuity that was missing in Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and at the Democratic National Committee, which had minimal security protections and for months ignored F.B.I. warnings that its computer system had been penetrated.\u201cWe went on a counteroffensive,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t guarantee 100 percent protection\u201d from the attacks, \u201cso we asked: what can we do?\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi opted for a classic \u201ccyber-blurring\u201d strategy, well known to banks and corporations, creating false email accounts and filled them with phony documents the way a bank teller keeps fake bills in the cash drawer in case of a robbery.\u201cWe created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,\u201d Mr. Mahjoubi said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we prevented them. We just slowed them down,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it made them lose one minute, we\u2019re happy,\u201d he said.Mr. Mahjoubi refused to reveal the nature of the false documents that were created, or to say whether, in the Friday document dump that was the result of the hacking campaign, there were false documents created by the Macron campaign.But he did note that in the mishmash that constituted the Friday dump, there were some authentic documents, some phony documents of the hackers\u2019 own manufacture, some stolen documents from various companies, and some false emails created by the campaign.\u201cDuring all their attacks we put in phony documents. And that forced them to waste time,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the quantity of the documents we put in,\u201d he added, \u201cand documents that might interest them.\u201dOddly, the Russians did a poor job of covering their tracks. That made it easier for private security firms, on alert after the efforts to manipulate the American election, to search for evidence.In mid-March, researchers with Trend Micro, the cybersecurity giant based in Tokyo, watched the same Russian intelligence unit behind some of the Democratic National Committee hacks start building the tools to hack Mr. Macron\u2019s campaign. They set up web domains mimicking those of Mr. Macron\u2019s En Marche! Party, and began dispatching emails with malicious links and fake login pages designed to bait campaign staffers into divulging their usernames and passwords, or to click on a link that would give the Russians a toehold onto the campaign\u2019s network.It was the classic Russian playbook, security researchers say, but this time the world was prepared. \u201cThe only good news is that this activity is now commonplace, and the general population is so used to the idea of a Russian hand behind this, that it backfired on them,\u201d said John Hultquist, the director of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye, the Silicon Valley security firm.Mr. Hultquist noted that the attack was characterized by haste, and a trail of digital mistakes. \u201cThere was a time when Russian hackers were characterized by their lack of sloppiness,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cWhen they made mistakes, they burned their entire operation and started anew. But since the invasion of Ukraine and Crimea,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen them carry out brazen, large scale attacks,\u201d perhaps because \u201cthere have been few consequences for their actions.\u201dThe hackers also made the mistake of releasing information that was, by any campaign standard, pretty boring. The nine gigabytes worth of purportedly stolen emails and files from the Macron campaign was spun as scandalous material, but turned out to be almost entirely the humdrum of campaign workers trying to conduct ordinary life in the midst of the election maelstrom.One of the leaked emails details a campaign staffer\u2019s struggle with a broken down car. Another documents how a campaign worker was reprimanded for failure to invoice a cup of coffee.That is when the hackers got sloppy. The metadata tied to a handful of documents \u2014 code that shows the origins of a document \u2014 show some passed through Russian computers and were edited by Russian users. Some Excel documents were modified using software unique to Russian versions of Microsoft Windows.Other leaked documents appear to have been forged, or faked. One purported to detail the purchase of the stimulant mephedrone, sometimes sold as \u201cbath salts,\u201d by a Macron campaign staffer who allegedly had the drugs shipped to the address of France\u2019s National Assembly. But Henk Van Ess, a member of the investigations team at Bellingcat, a British investigations organization, and others discovered that the transaction numbers in the receipt were not in the public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.\u201cIt\u2019s clear they were rushed,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said. \u201cIf this was APT28,\u201d he said, using the name for a Russian group believed to be linked to the GRU, a military intelligence agency, \u201cthey have been caught in the act, and it has backfired for them.\u201dNow, he said, the failure of the Macron hacks could just push Russian hackers to improve their methods.\u201cThey may have to change their playbook entirely,\u201d Mr. Hultquist said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a member of the investigations team at Bellingcat.

{"Headline": "To Spur Small Business, First Free the Banks", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSomewhere in the United States right now, an entrepreneur is having trouble getting a small-business loan for expansion. The reason? The bank is committed to keeping a large portion of its money in government debt instead.After the financial crisis, the government, in the form of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, imposed liquidity requirements that force American banks with assets over $50 billion to hold huge amounts of government debt as liquid assets.Those assets represent $4.3 trillion in government debt, or about one-quarter of all American banking assets. They include $1.75 trillion in bank deposits (called excess reserves) held at the Fed, $1.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (called government-sponsored-enterprise debt) and $560 billion in United States Treasuries.American banks are truly awash in government debt at five times pre-crisis levels. If President Trump wants to follow through on his promise to increase lending to small businesses, he should start by scaling back these requirements.Why do we have these rules? They are based on the idea that financial institutions need a cushion to protect them from runs on the bank. During a crisis, government debt can quickly be sold to meet withdrawals by panicking depositors and short-term creditors.But bank liquidity requirements come at a very high cost to the economy. Studies find that they reduce overall bank lending by 3 percent to 5 percent, and increase interest rates by 15 to 30 basis points. And indeed, small-business lending is down in the time since regulators imposed them.Ultimately, according to a survey of studies by the Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Research, liquidity requirements reduce economic growth by as much as three percentage points.These liquidity requirements will continue to tie banks\u2019 hands even if the Fed shrinks its balance sheet. When the Fed reduces its holdings of United States Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt, it must also reduce excess reserves that banks rely on to comply with liquidity requirements. As a result, American banks will have to buy more Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt and thus will not have increased spare capacity to lend privately to the small businesses and homeowners who need loans.Considering that the cost of bank liquidity requirements is clearly so high, they should provide commensurate stability to the financial system. Unfortunately, there is good reason for skepticism on this front.First, liquidity requirements cannot reduce the risk of a panic outside the commercial banking sector, like the panic in 2008 that included the otherwise solvent investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the affiliated broker-dealers of large banks and money market funds.Second, bank stores of government assets, while large, are still finite. Therefore, while those assets may reduce banks\u2019 need to hold a fire sale of harder-to-value assets, like small-business loans and mortgages, it does not eliminate the risk of a panic. Depositors and short-term creditors still have an incentive to run in a crisis.Worse still, bank liquidity requirements may worsen a crisis as banks are forced to hoard liquid assets and are thus unable to lend to one another. That\u2019s the worst medicine: In a crisis, you want banks to lend to other institutions that need money.Several prominent conservative economists and I have recently called for the Federal Reserve to establish a framework for any Fed lending during a financial crisis.A key contributor to the crisis in 2008 was that the Fed was simply not prepared, and therefore the market had no confidence that any financial institutions would be protected. Rather than relying on costly and untested liquidity requirements, what we need is for the Fed to have a plan for how it would value and lend against private collateral, including small-business loans and home mortgages, held by solvent financial institutions. Solvency determinations during a fast-moving crisis are too difficult. The Fed must plan ahead to protect the financial system by making loans immediately to solvent banks based on their balance sheets and avoid lending to insolvent institutions, such as A.I.G. in 2008.Liquidity requirements can\u2019t save us from the next crisis, and they can make that crisis worse. In the meantime, all the money stockpiled in banks would be better spent invested in companies to spur economic growth. It\u2019s time that small businesses across the country stopped paying for Wall Street\u2019s mistakes.Hal S.

{"Headline": "Education Dept. Keeps Obama Plan to Streamline Loan System", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byThe Education Department on Friday took up an Obama-era plan to streamline federal student loan servicing by moving to a new, single platform for managing the loans of 43 million borrowers.Choosing a single vendor to manage the loans also carries risk, as that entity would construct the most visible online government portal since the Affordable Care Act program website, HealthCare.gov.Many students rely on the Education Department, which administers $1.3 trillion in federal student loans, to finance their higher education. The work of servicing those loans \u2014 sending bills, collecting payments, guiding borrowers through their repayment options, and handling any problems that arise \u2014 is outsourced.Last month, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, rescinded key parts of the contract\u2019s bid solicitation documents. The move stripped away some consumer protections and suggested that the department might be reconsidering the project entirely.But on Friday, Ms. DeVos made another set of changes to the contract solicitation and affirmed her commitment to the one-platform approach.The biggest change that Ms. DeVos\u2019s department made on Friday was to eliminate a requirement that the new system \u2014 to be devised by a single vendor \u2014 support back-end subcontractors. That provision had been created to ensure that the myriad vendors currently servicing federal student loans would be able to bid for a piece of the new system\u2019s action.Instead, the new vendor will now be allowed to service all federal student loans itself, if it chooses.The Education Department said it would be able to more effectively monitor a single servicer.Other changes made Friday to the contract solicitation eliminate requirements that the Education Department cast as confusing, costly and unnecessary. The new loan website will no longer have to allow the user to view it in Spanish, and it will not have to include a prepayment calculator to help borrowers evaluate how making payments before they are due would reduce their loans\u2019 cost.In addition to Navient, two other bidders remain in the running for the lucrative contract: the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, which services loans under the names American Education Services and FedLoan Servicing; and two companies, Nelnet and Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, that submitted a joint proposal.A spokesman for Great Lakes declined to comment on the Education Department\u2019s changes, citing the open bidding process. Representatives of Navient, Nelnet and the P.H.E.A.A. did not respond to requests for comment.The Education Department did not say when it plans to award the contract.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Acrimony and Accusations in G.O.P. Debate for New Jersey Governor", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 Visibly angered by weeks of negative campaign fliers and a new television ad attacking him, Jack Ciattarelli repeatedly fought back against his opponent in the Republican primary for New Jersey governor Thursday night, criticizing Kim Guadagno\u2019s plans for auditing the state government and questioning her political tactics in a fiery debate defined by interruptions and accusations.Mr. Ciattarelli, a state assemblyman, challenged the Guadagno campaign\u2019s integrity, accusing his opponent, the lieutenant governor, of promoting falsehoods about his record and of lying about her own. Within the first five minutes of the debate, Mr. Ciattarelli denounced Ms. Guadagno\u2019s plan to reduce property taxes as disingenuous, claiming that \u201cquite frankly, there\u2019s a bit of a lie there.\u201dMs. Guadagno remained unruffled, sticking to her campaign\u2019s criticism of Mr. Ciattarelli, claiming his tax overhaul plan amounted to a $600 million tax increase, an allusion to his plan to raise income taxes on those making over $750,000 and $1 million annually. Mr. Ciattarelli says the increase would be offset by other tax changes.Mr. Ciattarelli\u2019s aggressive posture comes as he finds himself trailing Ms. Guadagno in fund-raising and early polling, though he has recently edged closer. The one-hour debate, held at NJTV\u2019s studio here, was the final time the two would meet on stage in a televised encounter before the June 6 primary.Mr. Ciattarelli said it would be impossible to rein in property taxes without addressing New Jersey\u2019s school financing formula, which consumes a large percentage of the state\u2019s taxes.Ms. Guadagno repeatedly returned to her central pledge, to audit the state government to identify waste, as a way not only to address the property tax crisis, but also to increase transportation financing and pay for repairs to the State House.It was a tactic that eventually exasperated Mr. Ciattarelli.\u201cThe lieutenant governor\u2019s answer to everything is audits,\u201d he said. \u201cAudits is the answer to everything.\u201dBut the evening\u2019s most passionate exchange involved the politician looming over the primary: Gov. Chris Christie.In response to a question from Michael Aron, the moderator and chief political correspondent at NJTV, about distancing herself from the governor, Ms. Guadagno said, \u201cI\u2019m running for governor, and he\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cI thought it was important for me to run on my record,\u201d she added, \u201csomething I haven\u2019t seen Jack talk about.\u201dMr. Ciattarelli cut her off, \u201cDo you want to talk about your record?\u201dMildly taken aback, Ms. Guadagno stammered a moment, before saying that she wanted to focus on the future and that \u201ccampaigns are about looking forward.\u201dBut Mr. Ciattarelli, who owns his own medical publishing company, was not done, calling her dishonest for taking credit for creating jobs, saying, \u201cpoliticians do not create jobs; I create jobs. Main Street creates jobs.\u201dHe kept hammering away, tying her to Mr. Christie\u2019s policies and his aggressive brand of politics.\u201cWe need to move beyond the Christie-Guadagno era,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we win in November is with a new message, a new messenger and a new direction. And I\u2019m not just talking about our policies, I\u2019m talking about our politics.\u201dMs. Guadagno parried Mr. Ciattarelli, condemning him when he suggested that she \u201chad an opportunity to veto the gas tax, acting as the governor.\u201d (Mr. Christie supported an increase in the gas tax; Ms. Guadagno did not.)\u201cLet me get this straight Jack,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want the lieutenant governor to tip down the hall, pull off the desk a document and veto it?\u201dMr. Ciattarelli shot back, \u201cAre you saying that you never vetoed a single bill?\u201d\u201cI have never walked down the hall and taken a piece of legislation off the governor\u2019s desk,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not what the Constitution intended, and I believe, when you start to talk like that, Jack, it really does cross the line.\u201dThe acrid nature of the debate reflected the current state of the Republican primary: Both candidates have intensified their negative campaigning.Amid the acrimony, there were moments of agreement. Both candidates supported some semblance of decriminalizing marijuana \u2014 reducing the criminal offense for possession of small amounts for recreational use, though they stopped short of endorsing full legalization, as in Colorado. Both candidates opposed the establishment of so-called sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants. And both candidates said that, if they won the primary, they would not pick the other as a running mate.The candidates also found a rare moment of accord around one of the most divisive figures in the country: President Trump.Asked if they would accept support from the president in the general election, both said they respected his office and would welcome his backing.\u201cI don\u2019t think we should argue about that,\u201d Ms. Guadagno said. \u201cI think we can agree on something there.\u201dOne New Jersey Republican, however, was actively avoiding the debate. Rather than sit and stew over criticism from his fellow Republicans, Mr. Christie said he was skipping the event.\u201cNope,\u201d he replied when asked if he would be tuning in after reporters spotted him leaving the building where the debate was held and where he also has an office. \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In South Korea, New President Faces a Tangle of Economic Problems", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The day after South Korea elected a new president, the mood on the campus of Yonsei University in Seoul was bleak.Many students, who might have been expected to celebrate the victory of a liberal, Moon Jae-in, to the presidency on Tuesday, instead spoke of fears about their prospects in a country plagued by corruption, household debt and other economic ills.\u201cUnfortunately, because we ourselves do not see the future of Korea as so rosy, I do not want to bring up children in this unpromising society,\u201d said Bang Seong-deok, 26, a civil engineering doctoral student taking a break with a friend outside a classroom block on Wednesday. \u201cI think that mentality is persistent among many of my peers.\u201dHe faces daunting obstacles as he tries to overhaul entrenched practices and deliver on ambitious campaign promises in a country that has yet to complete the tough transition from tiger economy to developed society.In the food court of a student lounge at Yonsei, Lee Ji-won, 23, a public administration major, said her friends often described the moribund state of their country as \u201cHell Chosun,\u201d a reference to the last dynasty of Korea, which lasted for five centuries.Ms. Lee, who aspires to be a lawyer, said she worried about eventually having to take care of her parents and grandparents. Although just over half of voters in their 20s and 30s cast their ballots for Mr. Moon, according to exit polls, Ms. Lee did not vote for him. She said she was not convinced that he would be able to pay for his economic policy prescriptions.Because the chaebol tend to guarantee lifetime employment to an elite group of employees, those who do not secure these jobs have grown disaffected. And since the chaebol effectively wield monopolistic powers over their suppliers, workers at smaller businesses that depend on the large companies for their revenue often suffer from depressed wages and tough working conditions.Those factors have exacerbated income inequality in South Korea, and young people in particular are affected as they scramble to compete for a small pool of prestigious jobs at the chaebol or accept lower-paid work at smaller companies. In many cases, they cannot find jobs at all. The youth unemployment rate here is nearly 10 percent.They are \u201cthe backs on which the middle-aged and elderly people are going to be eating, sleeping and surviving for the next few decades,\u201d she added.Some economists have also expressed skepticism about how Mr. Moon\u2019s administration will finance his plans, which include pledges to create 810,000 public sector jobs and subsidize living expenses for young people during job searches.Some measures could work in the short term, economists said, but would not be sustainable.Kim Sang-jo, a professor of economics at Hansung University in Seoul and an adviser to Mr. Moon, said creating government jobs and offering subsidies were just early steps.\u201cIt is the role of the government to stimulate the market in the first stage to fix the market that hasn\u2019t been running smoothly,\u201d Mr. Kim said in an interview shortly after the election. He said the \u201ctrickle down\u201d model of the chaebol was no longer working. But he added, \u201cOf course the government cannot solve all problems.\u201dMr. Moon\u2019s public job creation plan got mixed reviews even among students studying for the exams that are required to land jobs in the bureaucracy.In the Noryangjin neighborhood of Seoul, which is home to several cram schools dedicated to preparing for the exams, Yoon Bo-mi, 26, a nutrition major, said she was studying for the test because she did not think private corporations offered enough good opportunities.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think that young people all learning to become bureaucrats is so desirable for society,\u201d she said.Economists say that for South Korea to create many more private sector jobs, it needs to open up the market for entrepreneurs and prevent the chaebol from taking over start-ups before they have the chance to expand.For now, many entrepreneurs are concentrated in retail and dining. The fate of Reo Sushi Maguro, a cozy restaurant in the heart of Seoul, is a sobering illustration of the challenges facing Mr. Moon.Around the corner from several government office buildings, Reo Sushi, which specialized in premium tuna sashimi, enjoyed a bustling business as corporate executives treated civil servants to expensive meals.To cover costs as well as replace lost income, the owner, Oh Sung-min, 39, began borrowing money at high interest rates, until the debt spiraled to about $266,000.Mr. Oh\u2019s wife, Chung Sora, 35, a beauty salon owner who learned the extent of the debt only two weeks ago, blames the antigraft law.\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cThe politicians may have thought, \u2018We will try to regulate people\u2019s bad behavior,\u2019 but so many shops closed as a result.\u201dMr. Oh, who decided to close his sushi place after a government counselor agreed to help him develop a 10-year debt-repayment plan, is in a familiar situation. Economists say small-business owners have taken out a large portion of the country\u2019s about $1.19 trillion in household debt.Mr. Oh, the father of a toddler, will depend on Ms. Chung\u2019s beauty salon to support the family for now. Ms. Chung, who recently took on her own debt to expand the salon, said she was determined to pay off her husband\u2019s debt in a year.As Mr. Oh served final customers this past week, he said he had plans to start fresh with a new restaurant, this time offering chicken ribs and cheaper tuna dishes. Still, he was not quite as optimistic as his wife.\u201cOf course, it is most Korean people\u2019s wish to tell the president and the next administration to revive the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that is actually a very difficult task.\u201dSu-hyun Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is \u20183-K for All\u2019 Good for All? De Blasio\u2019s Preschool Plan Troubles Some", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byJames Matison runs five Brooklyn preschools for low-income children that get most of their money from New York City. But when he heard that Mayor Bill de Blasio was about to announce a plan to offer free preschool to every 3-year-old in the city, his response was not enthusiasm, but concern.For Mr. Matison, the executive director of the nonprofit Brooklyn Kindergarten Society, the issue is teachers.Since the mayor created 13,000 seats for 4-year-olds in public schools and city-run prekindergarten centers, Mr. Matison has seen more than half of his lead teachers leave. The city\u2019s Education Department offers higher salaries than he can, in some cases tens of thousands of dollars more, and summers off, while his program operates year-round.Mr. de Blasio said his new initiative would build off the success of his universal prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds, which has enrolled almost 70,000 children. He also said it would require hiring 4,500 more teachers, leaving Mr. Matison worried that he could lose even more staff members.\u201cIt is really a frightening prospect,\u201d he said.In addition to hiring staff, the expansion to 3-year-olds would require hundreds of classrooms, including some in the most crowded \u2014 and expensive \u2014 parts of the city.Most critical, to actually make the program universal, Mr. de Blasio needs to secure $700 million in state and federal funding. On its own, the administration has said, the city can fund the program in only eight of its 32 school districts. It is starting with a pilot program this fall in just two districts, in the South Bronx and the Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn.Some state legislators have said that they are not prepared to pay for preschool for 3-year-olds in New York City until there is free prekindergarten for all 4-year-olds in the rest of the state. Currently, according to the State Education Department, roughly a third of New York\u2019s 4-year-olds do not have access to public prekindergarten.\u201cI respect the mayor and his plan, but I would say that we have a lot of work to do statewide first,\u201d State Assemblyman Kenneth P. Zebrowski, a Democrat from Rockland County, said in an interview. He noted that Rockland County had enough prekindergarten seats to serve only about half of its 4-year-olds.Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, said that while there were hurdles, \u201cThe science is clear that the earlier we reach our youngest children, the better chance they have to succeed later in life.\u201dShe added that there were \u201cstill important program development discussions to be had, but the mayor refuses to wait.\u201dNew York City\u2019s publicly financed early education system is complex and fragmented. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s universal prekindergarten program is free and serves all 4-year-olds, regardless of family income, in schools and community-based organizations. These programs run six hours and 20 minutes daily and operate only when school is in session.Then there are early education centers that specifically serve low-income families through the city\u2019s EarlyLearn program. They mostly take children between the ages of 2 and 4, and, because they are intended to provide child care to working parents, are open eight to 10 hours a day and don\u2019t close during school holidays. The program is free to the poorest families; others pay sliding-scale rates based on their incomes. Mr. Matison\u2019s organization, the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society, is an EarlyLearn provider.Prekindergarten teachers in city schools or in centers directly run by the Education Department belong to the United Federation of Teachers union. They earn salaries that start at $54,000 and max out, after 22 years, at $113,372.Those who teach in EarlyLearn programs belong to a different union, District Council 1707. These teachers went without a raise for nine years, until a new contract was signed last fall. Under the new contract, the salaries of certified teachers in EarlyLearn programs start at $40,456 and top out at $51,700.David Nocenti, the executive director of Union Settlement, which serves roughly 400 children through EarlyLearn in seven centers in East Harlem, said that of 29 classrooms, he currently had five vacancies for certified teachers as well as one vacancy for a center director. He said that the previous center director had left to earn a higher salary teaching in the Education Department, as had most of the teachers he was looking to replace.\u201cUnless the mayor\u2019s proposal includes funding to eliminate the disparate treatment of nonprofit teaching staff, all of us will lose the teachers that we currently have,\u201d Mr. Nocenti said, \u201cand the entire structure\u2019s going to collapse, period.\u201dShariffa Martinez, 40, went to work for the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society in 2011 teaching 2-year-olds and then 4-year-olds. She said she loved it. Still, three years later, when Ms. Martinez had an opportunity to teach kindergarten in a city school, she jumped at it. It was partly the salary difference, which she said was close to $30,000. But it was also the opportunity to spend summer and other school vacations with her son, now 5.\u201cI worked all year-round with just 15 days of vacation,\u201d Ms. Martinez said of her job at the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go back to where I have less time with my personal family.\u201dAna Aguirre, the executive director of United Community Centers, which runs a center serving 114 children in East New York, Brooklyn, said that having such frequent vacancies inevitably took a toll on her program\u2019s quality.\u201cYour energy is constantly in replacing certified teachers,\u201d she said.Some early childhood center directors were also upset that they had not been consulted about the program, or even notified that its announcement was coming before the morning of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s news conference.Josh Wallack, a deputy chancellor for strategy and policy at the city\u2019s Education Department, said that the department had helped early childhood centers with recruitment and professional development and would continue to do so.\u201cWe recognize that there are challenges with an implementation like this, but we\u2019ve done it before with pre-K, and we are going to collaborate with all the providers to get this done,\u201d Mr. Wallack said. \u201cThey\u2019re essential partners here.\u201dSome early childhood education advocates who support the mayor\u2019s \u201c3-K for All\u201d initiative agreed that the salary gap was a serious issue, but said they expected that the expansion would create pressure to resolve it.\u201cIn my view,\u201d said Jennifer March, the executive director of the nonprofit Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York, \u201cit\u2019s a real opportunity to tackle all those challenging problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But his overseas trip keeps him at a distance physically, if not politically.As detailed in a preview on Monday by Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, the budget is a naked appeal to far-right Republicans aiming for a partisan rallying cry, even as a legislative victory most likely remains out of reach.Of 13 major initiatives in the budget, nine are drastic spending cuts, mostly aimed at low-income Americans. The biggest of those, by far, is an $866 billion reduction over 10 years in health care spending, mostly from Medicaid. That would be achieved if the Senate approves the House bill to undo President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.

It would deprive an estimated 10 million low-income Americans, many of them nursing home residents, of Medicaid benefits; it would also defund Planned Parenthood, reducing or ending health services to 2.5 million people, mainly women.The budget also calls for slashing food stamps ($192 billion over 10 years) and disability benefits ($72 billion over 10 years), including a big chunk from the Social Security disability insurance program. The rationale is that the cuts would force Americans back to work. But some 60 percent of food stamp recipients already work and an estimated 15 percent more work most of the time, availing themselves of food stamps only when they are between jobs or when their hours are reduced. The remainder are disabled and elderly. They will not go back to work if their food stamps are reduced. They will go hungry.The cuts to Social Security disability benefits would be similarly cruel. The budget assumes the cutbacks would prod disabled people back to work. That assumption ignores how severely disabled most benefit recipients are. The cuts also ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge not to cut Social Security. Mr. Mulvaney walked back that pledge on Monday, saying the promise pertained only to retirement benefits.The budget also continues the practice outlined in Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cskinny\u201d budget preview from March of immense defense increases coupled with deep cuts in non-defense discretionary spending, the catchall category that includes all of the federal programs that are annually appropriated by Congress. By the end of the 10-year budget period, such spending \u2014 for law enforcement, diplomacy, environmental protection, scientific research, justice, arts and humanities, tax collection and entire executive branch departments \u2014 would be lower as a share of the economy than in records dating back more than 50 years.The budget leaves Medicare spending untouched. It also promises to help finance $1 trillion in infrastructure investments, which is likely to mean subsidizing private investors in roads, bridges and other public works in exchange for a share of what used to be thought of as public property. It lists a $19 billion paid family leave program that appears to be supported by funds intended for unemployment benefits.What it lacks is any meaningful discussion of taxes. The budget asserts that any cuts would be offset by revenue from huge economic growth, unspecified loophole closings or additional spending cuts.The truth is that trillion-dollar tax cuts, most of which would flow to the wealthy, would hurt millions of other Americans. The nation will not prosper by cutting aid to sick, hungry, disabled and low-income Americans, or by boosting military spending while devastating domestic spending, or by privatizing infrastructure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Some States, Donating to Private Schools Can Earn You a Profit", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byThe Wood Acres School, 25 minutes north of Whitefield, advertises that donors can \u201cprofit up to 29 percent\u201d on their donation.The superintendents warned that the tax credits could go national as the Trump administration pushes a federal voucher program for private schools.The report is a shot across the bow from public educators to the White House as the president and Congress tackle twin legislative efforts with broad ramifications for education: a federally financed school choice program aimed at promoting private and parochial options for public school students, and a rewrite of the tax code ostensibly to lower tax rates and close loopholes.The superintendents\u2019 association ardently opposes school vouchers, saying they take taxpayer resources from public education to finance unaccountable private schools. The report adds a new wrinkle: Funding for those vouchers is helping the rich get richer.\u201cWhat we found was really shocking,\u201d said Sasha Pudelski, assistant director of policy and advocacy at AASA, who was an author of the report. \u201cThe net result is less money flowing into public schools.\u201dAASA and the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy examined programs in 17 states that send more than $1 billion a year to private schools via tuition tax credits, and concluded that private schools were benefiting from a \u201cfederally sanctioned voucher tax shelter\u201d for wealthy taxpayers.The study called it a \u201cget-rich scheme for shrewd taxpayers.\u201dThe report focuses on tuition tax credit programs used by some states to help low-income students afford private schools. In these states, individuals and corporations donate to nonprofit \u201cscholarship-granting organizations,\u201d which then distribute the funds to parents. The amount of the contribution can be subtracted dollar-for-dollar from the donor\u2019s state tax bill.The state-level programs began in 1997, and in 2011, the Internal Revenue Service allowed taxpayers to deduct the contributions from their federally taxable income as well \u2014 a benefit that has largely been kept within the circles of wealth advisers and private school communities.Donors in some states, such as Georgia, Arizona and Florida, have recouped their entire donation in tax cuts, meaning taxpayers can make a contribution to private schools at no cost.In nine states, the combination of state credits and federal tax deductions is so lucrative that donors can even make a profit, the report found. Those states are Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Virginia.In South Carolina, if taxpayers make a $20,000 donation to a scholarship organization, they not only get a $20,000 state tax credit, but a federal tax deduction valued up to $7,000. The donor could pay $27,000 less in taxes based on a $20,000 donation.\u201cIt\u2019s turned the whole idea of charitable giving on its head,\u201d said Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, who was an author of the report. He added: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have an attachment to a particular private school, you\u2019d be better off finding one. That\u2019s how big the incentive is here.\u201dSchool choice supporters say the report mischaracterizes the donations and ignores the overall goal of tax credit programs.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if we just funded kids to go wherever works for them,\u201d said Robert Enlow, the president of EdChoice, a group that supports private school choice. \u201cThis is just trying to keep a basic power structure that doesn\u2019t work best for them.\u201dTuition tax credits have been championed by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who strongly supports private schools and voucher programs.As secretary, Ms. DeVos has praised tax credit programs in Arizona and Florida. School choice advocates said that a federal program could prevent issues like \u201cdouble dipping.\u201dThe administration has yet to unveil details of a $1.4 billion school choice plan it vowed to fund in the fiscal year that begins in October.A longstanding bill pending in Congress would create tax credits of up to $4,500 a year for individuals and $100,000 for corporations. Those donors would also be eligible for state tax credits if they live in states that offer them.But school choice advocates said that any federal policy could mitigate unintended loopholes.\u201cDouble dipping is an easy issue to prevent,\u201d said Tommy Schultz, a spokesman for the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group that Ms. DeVos led before becoming education secretary. \u201cWell-designed laws like Florida\u2019s specifically eliminate the possibility. Any federal program could, with just a sentence or two, prevent it from happening. We would expect that language to be included in any federal tax credit proposal.\u201dThe report also noted the wide range for how much in state taxpayer donations can go toward scholarship programs. Oklahoma\u2019s program is capped at $3.4 million, and Florida\u2019s at $700 million. Contribution caps also vary, from $150 per individual in Montana to an unlimited amount from individual donors in Louisiana.The programs are proving popular. Last year, Georgians snatched up all the tuition tax credits in one day. In Arizona, the credits were gone within hours. Pay It Forward Scholarships is urging taxpayers to reserve their 2018 credits as soon as possible.Jason Bedrick, the director of policy at EdChoice, said that receiving federal and state tax benefits was not \u201cdouble dipping\u201d because states had no control over federal tax rules, and reducing tax liability was not the same as making a profit.He said that states like Arizona reserved 100 percent tax credits for donations to nonprofits that provide low-income families with food, shelter and medical care.\u201cThese programs are intended, at the state level, to give a tax incentive to donors that help low-income families,\u201d Mr. Bedrick said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible the lengths rhetorically that opponents can go to disparage programs that help low-income families choose schools of their choice.\u201dPublic school advocates argue that public schools are held more accountable for the achievement of the wide range of students they serve.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can ensure economic competitiveness and opportunities for kids if we continue to defund our public schools and divert public funds to schools that can choose who they want to educate and can choose how accountable they want to be to the public,\u201d Ms. Pudelski said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Willing to Cook for Strangers, but Guests Are Harder to Find", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byIn a penthouse apartment in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown on a recent Monday night, Lisa Larsson chopped shiitake mushrooms and looked rather relaxed for someone about to host a 14-person dinner.She had arranged the party through the app AirDine, which lets users pay to eat at strangers\u2019 houses, rating the experience afterward. The app started in Sweden last year, and expanded to the United States and elsewhere in March. Ms. Larsson, 26, a painter originally from Sweden, was hosting the first party in the United States.The guests \u2014 half friends and half strangers \u2014 arrived. Mostly millennials, they displayed a dinner-party-appropriate gravitas: pocket squares, bottles of wine for Ms. Larsson. There was only a whiff of cynicism when Noor Shams, who works in microfinance, said the doorman downstairs did not recognize Ms. Larsson\u2019s name and \u201cfor a second, I was, like, this is a scam!\u201dThe challenge is not finding hosts willing to invite strangers over. It\u2019s finding guests willing to show up.But all try to make money in the same way: The companies take a percentage of what hosts charge guests to attend, usually 15 to 20 percent. Hosts can set whatever price they like for guests; Ms. Larsson charged $10 a head, while lots of EatWith and Feastly meals run $80 and up. The companies generally do not charge guests or hosts to join the platforms.Christienne Dobson, a designer in Harlem and an EatWith host, said she saw cooking as a hobby rather than an income stream. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m not spending money to host people \u2014 it pays for itself, which is really nice, so I can source better ingredients, source different types of food,\u201d she said.Many of the social-dining sites and apps began around 2012, spurred by other companies that promote the sharing model, like Airbnb.He said he understood why hosts might embrace the idea, while potential guests remain wary. \u201cThe host has a sense of control,\u201d Mr. Rothman said, including turning down potential guests. \u201cThe idea of, I\u2019m going to go to someone\u2019s house I don\u2019t know, it feels slightly different.\u201dMany hurdles to the business are also cultural. Sagiv Ofek, who brought HomeDine, his social-dining website and app, to the United States from Tel Aviv in 2013, said that it was typical in Israel for people to open the door and invite others over. But \u201cwhat I discovered in the U.S. is, people are more territorial and more personal about their own personal space,\u201d he said.\u201cWe found people all over in terms of hosting \u2014 we had no problem with that,\u201d Mr. Ofek said. \u201cOur main problem was to acquire new users.\u201dMitch Monsen, the founder of Kitchen.ly, a social-dining app that he shuttered in 2013, said diners were particularly concerned about sanitary issues and hosts\u2019 personal-cleanliness standards.The feedback was, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure that the meal I\u2019m going to be eating is safe,\u201d he said.The apps must also be prepared for regulatory challenges, said Seth B. Weinberg, a lawyer who teaches food law and policy at Columbia Law School. \u201cOnce you start charging people, you cease to be a hobbyist, and you start becoming a commercial enterprise, even a small one,\u201d he said. Regulators could also potentially require liquor licenses and food-safety standards for meals arranged this way, he added.To attract more users, some sites and apps are now tinkering with their strategy.EatWith has begun analyzing guests\u2019 ratings to see what works best at dinners, and sharing that information with hosts. The company has found that 12-person parties work, as do pairs of hosts where one cooks and one socializes.EatWith also began requiring that hosts cook a demo meal with real guests giving ratings before allowing the host on the site; it accepts only 4 percent of applicants as hosts. The company also plans to expand to South America, Ms. Kim said.Feastly, which used to accept a range of hosts, also now focuses on professionals like private chefs or restaurant chefs. It has added about 100 venue spaces where the cooks can host dinner, said a founder, Noah Karesh, and is planning an expansion across the United States and into Europe.As for AirDine, Charlie Hedstrom, its chief executive, said he thought that its more laid-back approach \u2014 it does not screen hosts and lets the ratings provide feedback \u2014 works well and that it will get a boost with more marketing.Back at Ms. Larsson\u2019s apartment, the guests took their seats along a candlelit table to eat the first course of salmon sashimi. But there was a wrinkle: While Ms. Larsson had dashed out earlier to get enough plates, she was short on water glasses.\u201cIf you like alcohol, stick to that,\u201d Ms. Larsson advised, as conversations started between guests discussing Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister of Italy, versus President Trump, among other topics.The second course was filet mignon and cucumber-pea salad. One guest, Alex Sommer, gave the night an early rave, especially compared with a meal he had attended through a competing app, where the table was crammed against the host\u2019s bed.Third course: Lamb with shiitake-cream sauce and berries saut\u00e9ed in Hennessy.\u201cCan we have another toast to the chef?\u201d someone shouted. \u201cI love her!\u201d yelled another.As the dessert of passion fruit sorbet arrived, guests, short on spoons, plunged forks in. A candle petered out; the music got louder; someone knocked over a glass; and the guests theorized about love as the clock ticked on.Soon after, Ms. Larsson\u2019s AirDine ratings came in: five stars from each of her guests. A few weeks later, several United States hosts had arranged AirDine dinners; almost all still had seats available.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senior Discounts Aren\u2019t Just for Seniors Anymore", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byRetiringMaybe they are embarrassed about their age. Or unaware of the many discount programs for seniors. Or simply thinking about something else.All are reasons that seniors may not ask for or receive the discounts they qualify for at myriad retailers. After all, a Walgreens cashier can\u2019t be expected to automatically deduct the 20 percent senior discount the chain offers on certain Tuesdays. And many shoppers \u2014 particularly those who are just in their 50s, for whom there are fewer offers \u2014 aren\u2019t in the habit of asking if a discount is an option.The Senior List, for instance, lists dozens of restaurants where older people can qualify for discounts of 10 percent or more, including such major chains as Applebee\u2019s, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Burger King and Chili\u2019s.Retired Brains offers more categories of discounts, like apparel, travel, groceries and entertainment. Who knew that baby boomers and others over 62 could get 10 percent off clothing at Banana Republic and 5 percent off at Greyhound? Or that a 55th birthday qualifies purchasers for 10 percent off Best Western hotels and Midas auto services? (Discounts and deals may vary by the individual store or franchise.)The goal, said Steve Mitchener, who developed Sciddy as a website in 2011 and turned it into an app last year, is to eliminate the \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d nature of senior discounts.Although there is significant overlap among all the senior discount lists \u2014 Sciddy, too, lists Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Banana Republic and others already mentioned here \u2014 the difference is the automatic reminder.For example, \u201cIf you go to Applebee\u2019s, it\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Hey, don\u2019t forget to ask for your senior discount,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mitchener said. Phones not on mute get a ka-ching! notification in addition to a visual cue.Mr. Mitchener, who is 59 and lives in St. Louis, said that he chose the name Sciddy because it is catchy, but that some of his customers have made up their own acronyms. \u201cThe best one yet is \u2018Senior Citizen Instant Daily Discount for You,\u2019\u201d he said.He has six children and seven grandchildren, so he grew accustomed to looking for \u201ckids eat free\u201d signs. Then he realized that, even though he hasn\u2019t considered retiring and won\u2019t for several years, he is old enough to rack up considerable savings when he picks up the check for his large brood, whether at restaurants or the department stores where he and his wife take their grandchildren back-to-school shopping.\u201cSometimes people say to themselves, \u2018Big deal, it\u2019s a 10 percent discount,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mitchener said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re walking down the aisle at the grocery store and your phone pings you and says, \u2018When you get up to the cash register, ask for your discount,\u2019 you\u2019re going to do it.\u201dMost users pay off the cost of the app through savings within the first month, he said.The app\u2019s nine categories for savings include travel (hotels and rental car companies), entertainment (movie theaters, golf courses and concert halls) and pets. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know you can be 55 and save money at the vet\u2019s office,\u201d Mr. Mitchener said.Sciddy has identified 260,000 senior discounts, and Mr. Mitchener thinks as many as a million may be available nationwide, including individual stores within franchises. For example, some Dairy Queens offer senior discounts, but others don\u2019t.His team scours the country daily for establishments to add, including those individual franchises. Some Sciddy enthusiasts help by way of a forum where they post new finds and also exchange notes about their experiences with how well, or how poorly, a business honored a discount. A frequent topic is carding, or the need to prove one\u2019s age to get a discount: \u201cIt hardly ever happens,\u201d Mr. Mitchener said.As it is, the age-discount playing field may be becoming more level, as the various programs expand by going after people in middle age. AARP has been sending 49-year-olds invitations to join its organization and reap the rewards of membership on their 50th birthdays. In 1984, it lowered the minimum membership age to 50 from 55.Many of the newly eligible \u201cdefinitely are not aware that they qualify for discounts,\u201d Ms. Chatzky said.At the Senior List, which draws 100,000 visitors a month, Amie Clark, a founder, said her discount lists are one of the top two attractions. The other is reviews of medical alert systems.\u201cWomen 55 and up are our most frequent visitors,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cI think a lot of them come on looking for medical alert systems for their parents, and then they find they can save some money for themselves through the discount lists.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Is That True?", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cNATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations, for 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they\u2019re supposed to be paying for their defense,\u201d he said.Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Trump was putting it in layman\u2019s terms and \u201cdoesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s technically accurate.\u201dBut Mr. Schmitt identified two problems: \u201cOne, because it\u2019s not technically correct, it is too easily dismissed by the very folks he wants to put pressure on. Two, and more important, it tends to bury the point that we\u2019re invested in European security for our own strategic reasons.\u201dOne way Mr. Trump is different is that he has made this a far more consistent and far more intense theme of nearly every discussion he has about NATO. He may have better luck than his predecessors at badgering allies into increasing their spending simply because he has made it the essential condition of America\u2019s relationship with the alliance.Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said last month that the number of alliance members that would meet the 2 percent target next year would rise to eight.\u201cMany of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years,\u201d Mr. Trump said.No. This is not a matter of members failing to pay dues. The allies arguably may have less capable militaries than they should have, but none of them owe anyone anything. \u201cEurope may owe itself; it certainly owes nothing to the U.S.,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO under Mr. Obama.\u201cIf all NATO members had spent just 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense last year, we would have had another $119 billion for our collective defense and for the financing of additional NATO reserves,\u201d the president said.He is offering an estimate of what NATO would have spent had all of its members abided by the 2 percent guideline, but there is no way to recover that money after the fact. \u201cCiting the amount not spent over the years is fine,\u201d said Alexander R. Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO, \u201cbut demanding back taxes is not justified and only alienates allies.\u201d\u201cThis is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Debatable. American experts have argued for years that Europeans can afford to have broader social programs that produce comfortable lives for their citizens partly because they spend so much less on militaries knowing they live under the security blanket of the United States. Overall, American military spending is 72 percent of the total spent by all 28 allies.Moreover, Mr. Trump has not argued that he wants to reduce American military spending. He has just proposed a 10 percent increase in the base defense budget.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Hackett, Ford\u2019s New C.E.O., Has a History of Turnaround Stories", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Jim Hackett made his career by turning Steelcase, an office-furniture maker in Michigan, into one of America\u2019s most admired companies. More recently, he rejuvenated one of the country\u2019s most storied college athletic programs, at the University of Michigan, and hired its high-profile football coach, Jim Harbaugh.Now he is embarking on an even more prominent fix-it job in Michigan: Ford Motor.On Monday, Ford announced Mr. Hackett, 62, as its chief executive, saying he would be able to reshape the company to compete in the next generation of automobiles.Mr. Hackett replaces Mark Fields, who had led the company for three years. Mr. Fields had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and Ford\u2019s sagging stock price, as well as concerns about whether Ford was falling behind on self-driving cars.In Mr. Hackett, Ford is taking on a chief executive with a track record of refocusing a manufacturing company through several downturns and sharp shifts in its industry. But the scale of Ford, the nation\u2019s No. 2 automaker behind General Motors, dwarfs that of Steelcase, the furniture maker he ran. Last year, Steelcase had revenue of $3.1 billion; Ford had revenue of $151 billion.There is no doubt that Ford is changing up the personality at the top of its ranks. Mr. Fields was known as a polished salesman and marketer. Mr. Hackett is known for his blunt talk about performance. Friends and colleagues described Mr. Hackett as a direct manager who calls out those who fall short.\u201cHe\u2019s a visionary,\u201d William C. Ford Jr., the company\u2019s chairman, said at a news conference on Monday. \u201cBut he\u2019s not just a futurist. He\u2019s a very good operating executive.\u201dMr. Hackett has said those qualities stem from his days as an offensive lineman on Michigan football teams in the 1970s and the influence of the team\u2019s renowned coach, Bo Schembechler.At Steelcase, based in Grand Rapids, Mr. Hackett often recommended that managers read \u201cBo\u2019s Lasting Lessons,\u201d a book by the coach on leadership. A regular email to Steelcase employees was called \u201cHackett\u2019s Huddle.\u201d He often told colleagues, \u201cYou either get better or get worse\u201d \u2014 and attributed the quotation to Mr. Schembechler.\u201cHe had a lot of respect for Bo, and a lot of people in Michigan connected to that,\u201d said James P. Keane, who worked with Mr. Hackett for 17 years at Steelcase and succeeded him as chief executive.Mr. Hackett was hardly a star player on the football team. He was a third-string center whose main job was to face off in practice against the starting defensive unit, a punishing and thankless task.Once, when Mr. Hackett grew frustrated, Mr. Schembechler gave it to him straight: He was too slow and too small to be a starting center. But the coach said Mr. Hackett was making a big contribution by pushing the defense and other offensive linemen to work harder. Mr. Hackett soldiered on with pride.\u201cHe was a tough, hard-nosed guy,\u201d said John Wangler, a quarterback during Mr. Hackett\u2019s senior year. \u201cA guy you want in a foxhole with you.\u201dMr. Hackett was born in London, Ohio, 30 miles west of Columbus. His father and his brother played football at nearby Ohio State, Michigan\u2019s top rival. But Mr. Hackett was not good enough to get a roster spot and went to Michigan, graduating in 1977 with a degree in finance.He joined Steelcase in 1980, rose through the sales and marketing ranks and showed a feel for future trends. Long before it became the norm in American offices, he had his managers cluster their workstations together without walls or dividers to facilitate teamwork.When Steelcase slumped in 1994, he was named chief executive, at age 39. He tried to get the company\u2019s executives and designers to think more about furniture\u2019s full role in a working environment, bringing in sociologists and anthropologists to help designers understand how people work, Mr. Keane said.Under his leadership, Steelcase introduced new lines designed for open-plan offices, video screens and work teams. Along the way, Mr. Hackett built up a network of contacts in the companies using new work environments, especially in the technology industry, relationships that would come in handy later at Ford.He and Mr. Ford met while working on state tax issues. Both are informal Midwesterners, and they clicked. They also shared an interest in football: Mr. Ford\u2019s family owns the Detroit Lions.Mr. Hackett joined Ford\u2019s board in 2013 and retired as Steelcase\u2019s chief executive a year later. At the same time, he took a turn as a football hero at Michigan.With the football team floundering and the athletic department in disarray, he stepped in as interim director of athletics and set his sights on hiring Mr. Harbaugh, a former Michigan Wolverine. Mr. Harbaugh was by then a star N.F.L. coach who could command a lofty salary, and he had turned down Michigan in the past.But Mr. Hackett persisted, calling the coach weekly, and he eventually landed his man, delighting fans and alumni.\u201cWithout Jim Hackett, there\u2019s no Jim Harbaugh,\u201d said John U. Bacon, author of best-selling books on Michigan football.In February 2016, Ford directors visited several Silicon Valley companies, and Mr. Ford was impressed by how many executives knew Mr. Hackett well.\u201cEvery one of them gave Jim a hug,\u201d Mr. Ford recalled on Monday. \u201cA number of them said: \u2018My gosh, he\u2019s one of the real, original thinkers. You guys are really lucky to have him on your board.\u2019\u201dA month later, Mr. Hackett left the University of Michigan and was hired to run Ford\u2019s future-oriented \u201cmobility services\u201d division.Mr. Ford said the board of directors had had discussions for some time about the company\u2019s leadership, and the pressure for change increased after profit dropped in the first quarter. After a board meeting on Friday, he and Mr. Fields met, and they \u201cdecided that it was the right time for him to resign,\u201d Mr. Ford said.The board then asked Mr. Hackett to take the helm. \u201cThe board was very excited by the prospect of Jim potentially becoming our leader,\u201d Mr. Ford said.Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit and Daniel Victor contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Senior moments, when you can\u2019t remember a name or phrase, or misremember where it came from, happen to many of us. But that Economist interview was basically one long senior moment \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t very different from other recent interviews with the commander in chief of the world\u2019s most powerful military.Second, we\u2019re talking about some really bad economics here. There are times when temporary deficit spending can help the economy. In the first few years after the 2008 financial crisis, for example, unemployment was very high, and the Federal Reserve \u2014 normally our first line of defense against recessions \u2014 had limited ability to act, because the interest rates it controls were already very close to zero. That was a time for serious pump-priming; unfortunately, we never got enough of it, thanks to scorched-earth Republican opposition.America may not be all the way back to full employment \u2014 there\u2019s a lively debate among economists over that issue. But the economic engine no longer needs a fiscal jump-start. This is exactly the wrong time to be talking about the desirability of bigger budget deficits.But that\u2019s not what Trump is talking about. He\u2019s calling for exploding the deficit so he can cut taxes on the wealthy. And that makes no economic sense at all.Then again, he may not understand his own proposals; he may be living in an economic and political fantasy world. If so, he\u2019s not alone. Which brings me to my third point: Trump\u2019s fiscal delusions are arguably no worse than those of many, perhaps most professional observers of the Washington political scene.If you\u2019re a heavy news consumer, think about how many articles you\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks with headlines along the lines of \u201cTrump\u2019s budget may create conflict with G.O.P. fiscal conservatives.\u201d The premise of all such articles is that there is a powerful faction among Republican members of Congress who worry deeply about budget deficits and will oppose proposals that create lots of red ink.But there is no such faction, and never was.There were and are poseurs like Paul Ryan, who claim to be big deficit hawks. But there\u2019s a simple way to test such people\u2019s sincerity: when they propose sacrifices in the name of fiscal responsibility, do those sacrifices ever involve their own political priorities? And they never do. That is, when you see a politician claim that deficit concerns require that we slash Medicaid, privatize Medicare, and/or raise the retirement age \u2014 but somehow never require raising taxes on the wealthy, which in fact they propose to cut \u2014 you know that it\u2019s just an act.Yet somehow much of the news media keeps believing, or pretending to believe, that those imaginary deficit hawks are real, which is a delusion of truly Trumpian proportions.So I\u2019m worried. Trump may be not just ignorant but deeply out of it, and his economic proposals are terrible and irresponsible, but they may get implemented all the same.But maybe I worry too much; maybe the only thing to fear is fear itself. Do you like that line? I just came up with it the other day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John Paulson\u2019s Fall From Hedge Fund Stardom", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "The hedge fund Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011.Supported byJohn A. Paulson is one of the best-known names in the hedge fund industry. But these days, Mr. Paulson is having more success in the political realm than he is managing his business.Mr. Paulson, 61, was one of the first people on Wall Street to back Donald J. Trump\u2019s bid for the presidency. He counseled Mr. Trump on economic matters during the campaign. He gave $250,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. And he recently visited President Trump at the White House for a \u201cC.E.O. Town Hall.\u201dBut his investors are unlikely to be impressed by his political access. His firm, Paulson & Company, has recorded nearly double-digit losses in several of its larger funds as of the end of March.Mr. Paulson\u2019s struggles come after a gut-wrenching 2016, when he recorded even steeper losses in those funds, partly because of several wrong-footed bets on drug makers, including the troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals. That followed a painful 2015, when investors first balked and began pulling their money from his firm.A representative of Mr. Paulson declined a request for an interview with him. His funds are said to have performed better in April, said a person with knowledge of the firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cIt is clear that Paulson has dug in with both heels and committed to steering the firm through this period,\u201d said David Black, founder of Quadra Advisors, a recruiting firm for hedge funds and other investment firms.Nonetheless, his assets under management continue shrinking. Paulson & Company manages just under $10 billion today, down from $36 billion in 2011. Nearly two years ago, some Wall Street banks began to recommend that investors redeem some of their money from the firm.And while Mr. Paulson is not the only hedge fund manager to see large investors pull their money in recent years, he has become a symbol of what some pension funds have taken issue with for the industry at large: big fees for little reward and little originality.Mr. Paulson has remained upbeat with investors, according to two people who have seen recent investor letters but spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cWhile we are disappointed in performance in 2016, we believe we have a path to a recovery,\u201d Mr. Paulson told investors in one letter.But it has not been smooth sailing. In another letter to investors of a merger arbitrage fund that declined by 49 percent last year, Mr. Paulson called 2016 \u201cthe most challenging year since inception.\u201d In May, Mr. Paulson will address his investors at a meeting at Claridge\u2019s Hotel in London.Mr. Paulson\u2019s fall from stock-trading stardom underscores a common disclaimer in industry parlance: Past performance is no guarantee of future returns.In early 2007, Mr. Paulson, who started his firm in 1994, was still a relatively unknown hedge fund manager. A former Bear Stearns investment banker, he had a reputation for running a solid if boring hedge fund that made bets on the outcomes of various mergers and acquisitions.But as the housing market began to show signs of overheating, Mr. Paulson had a hunch that home loans to borrowers with spotty credit histories \u2014 which were ballooning at the time \u2014 were about to go sour. He positioned his firm to benefit in the event of a huge failure of the subprime mortgage market.It was a bet that few were willing to take, but one that resulted in a major payday for him and his firm, and was later referred to as \u201cThe Greatest Trade Ever,\u201d in a book by the reporter Gregory Zuckerman.After the financial crisis, investors flocked to Mr. Paulson\u2019s firm, which is in Midtown Manhattan, a stone\u2019s throw from Rockefeller Center.For several years, Paulson & Company continued to make money for some of his investors, but the performance increasingly grew bumpy. This was particularly true for the firm\u2019s flagship Advantage fund. It lost 36 percent in 2011 and plunged another 14 percent in 2012, but rallied to post a 26 percent gain in 2013, according to an HSBC industry report and people with knowledge of the firm\u2019s performance. The losses were amplified in Advantage Plus, a version of the fund that uses leverage to enhance returns.Over the last three years, Advantage has consecutively recorded double-digit losses. Some of Mr. Paulson\u2019s merger funds, credit funds and gold funds have posted positive returns, but the overall picture has not been pretty.Health care bets, in particular those on pharmaceutical companies, have proved especially punishing for Mr. Paulson and his investors. Losing wagers on economic recoveries in Greece and Puerto Rico haven\u2019t helped.Some of Mr. Paulson\u2019s top talent have moved on. Putnam Coes, his former chief operating officer, left the firm in September. Soon after, John Reade, a senior vice president who was based in London, left.Despite his losses, Mr. Paulson is still making new and speculative investments. In November, Paulson made an investment in Didi Chuxing, a fast-growing Chinese ride-hailing firm that signed a deal to acquire Uber Technologies\u2019 operations in China.One bright spot could be a bet on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has pledged to return the mortgage finance giants to free-standing publicly traded companies, a development that could make Mr. Paulson\u2019s funds big profits. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, once worked together to pull OneWest Bank out of the wreckage of IndyMac, a lender that the federal government seized in 2008.Several new funds the firm has started are posting positive returns, too.\u201cWe remain confident in the long-term relationship we have with Paulson,\u201d said Christopher Zook of CAZ Investments, a Texas wealth management firm that recently rotated out of the poorly performing Paulson Special Situations fund into a newer Paulson fund.And Mr. Paulson and other hedge fund managers stand to be big beneficiaries of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to slash taxes.Yet 2017 is shaping up as another rough one for Mr. Paulson. The Advantage fund was down 9.7 percent as of the end of March and the Partners Enhanced fund continues to sink \u2014 falling just over 8 percent after last year\u2019s 49 percent plunge.But, as the financial magazine recently noted, he is now $2 billion poorer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Group of Breakaway Democrats in New York, It Pays to Be No. 2", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byMs. Savino and Mr. Peralta belong to the Independent Democratic Conference, a coalition of eight Democratic senators who collaborate with Republicans to share leadership in the chamber. By doing so, members of the I.D.C. reap perks and power that they would not normally receive had they remained with the mainline Democrats.Those perks include extra pay for chairmanships of committees. But the stipends that Ms. Savino and Mr. Peralta received, as well as two payments to another I.D.C. senator, appear to fall into a gray area in state law.Stipends are specifically earmarked for Senate committee chairmen. But in three recent instances, the payment for the committee leader has been paid to the second-in-command, giving the I.D.C. members thousands of dollars in payments not explicitly outlined in state law. And in each case, state payroll records show that the I.D.C. members were paid as the leaders of their committees.There are no payments laid out in the law for Senate committee vice-chairmen. But the I.D.C. argues that such payments are justified by the law\u2019s preamble, which says that lawmakers serving in a special capacity in the Senate \u2014 or \u201cdirectly connected therewith\u201d \u2014 shall be paid an allowance, and then lays out a specific schedule of payments with no mention of vice-chairmen.\u201cThose three words are the legal authority for the chairman or anyone connected therewith to receive the allowance set in the schedule,\u201d Candice Giove, a spokeswoman for the I.D.C., said.Ms. Giove added that the I.D.C. believed that case law backed its argument, and that the law itself \u201csupports allowances for vice-chairs who are \u2018directly connected therewith\u2019 to committees in our house.\u201d Senate Republicans similarly maintain that everything was done in accordance with the law.But good-government watchdogs said that such a justification circumvented the intention of the law, which was meant to reward chairmen for extra work.\u201cThey\u2019re doing an end run around the system,\u201d said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be getting extra compensation for additional work. And if that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening, they\u2019re completely undermining that argument.\u201dThe arrangement appears to have been signed off on by Senate Republicans: The Senate leadership is responsible for providing and entering the information on chairmanships into the state payroll system, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office.The money is an important perk. Lawmakers receive a base salary of $79,500 a year. The Legislature has not had a pay raise since 1999; their attempts to be paid more have been bogged down in disputes over banning outside income and other ethics-related changes.Two Republican senators \u2014 Andrew J. Lanza of Staten Island and Joseph A. Griffo of Rome \u2014 serve as the chairmen of the Codes and Energy and Telecommunications committees. They also serve in higher-paying Senate leadership positions for which they are paid. And earlier this year, their committee chairmanship stipends were instead paid to Ms. Savino and Mr. Peralta, according to records from the state comptroller\u2019s office.Their arrangements were predated by one that benefited Senator David J. Valesky of Syracuse, another member of the I.D.C. In 2015 and 2016, he received $15,000 per year as vice-chairman of the Health Committee, taking the stipend that was prescribed for the chairman, Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Long Island. But Mr. Hannon chose to receive a larger stipend \u2014 $25,000 \u2014 for his role as assistant majority leader on conference operations.Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic Conference, called the idea of vice-chairmen taking chairmanship stipends \u201cdisturbing.\u201dThe financial bonus for becoming a chairman is evident: Mr. Hamilton, for example, had previously been a member of the mainline Democrats, led by Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and was the ranking member of the Banking Committee, earning a stipend of $9,500 a year.Conner Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Avella, said the senator did not accept stipends for ethical reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of principle,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Filthy Metaphor of Rome", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 This city tells an ancient story.It also tells a modern one.Behold the Colosseum. The other day I did, and I was blown away, not by its link to the past but by its luster in the present. On previous trips to Rome and during the two years I lived here, I knew it as a gray and grimy relic. Now it\u2019s stripped of soot and the color of ivory, thanks to an elaborate cleanup.But a few hundred yards away, in a hilltop park, there\u2019s badly cracked pavement, wildly unkempt grass and oodles of trash, because there\u2019s trash almost everywhere in Rome, whose officials keep promising \u2014 and failing \u2014 to get the problem under control. That\u2019s the first thing that Romans mention if you ask them about their city these days. It\u2019s also the second and third.\u201cA tragic situation,\u201d Massimiliano Tonelli told me. \u201cNo other country in Europe has a capital in this condition.\u201dOn top of which, there\u2019s the shocking, mocking contrast of monuments that gleam for tourists while everyday Rome reeks for its residents. The contradiction constantly reminds Italians that \u201cthe public sector is inefficient and totally disorganized while the private sector functions better,\u201d Tonelli said.And that\u2019s happy news, for the most part. An Italian government strapped for money is smartly tapping private philanthropy to protect its cultural heritage, which is a vital engine of its economy. And it hasn\u2019t let these companies stamp their names or logos prominently on centuries-old travertine.But this new reliance on corporate munificence could set up a dynamic by which only the most famous landmarks get face-lifts, because they generate the publicity that donors want. Income inequality: the monumental version.\u201cPeople who have a stake in these things are really frustrated,\u201d he told me.It\u2019s not just the trash. It\u2019s the profusion of unlicensed street vendors. The riot of untamed weeds. The erratic public transportation. The obstacle course of cars parked where they shouldn\u2019t be. The treacherous bulges and dips of unrepaired streets.I did notice the birds but even more so the butts: cigarettes cast away and never swept up. I counted them to distract myself as I ran beside the bilious water of the Tiber, slaloming around broken glass and swatting away mosquitoes, which seem to be enjoying a boom of their own.Later I climbed the Spanish Steps, freshly gleaming. From the top I could see the glory of Rome. I could also see how so many Italians \u2014 and plenty of other Westerners \u2014 feel that they live in some perverse shadow of affluence, and how anger and cynicism flower. There\u2019s a perch from which all is magnificent. There\u2019s another that\u2019s for the birds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nine Plays, One Truth: Mfoniso Udofia on Her Immigrant Experience, and Ours", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported by\u201cI wasn\u2019t right because somebody else had a different image in their head of what an African woman is supposed to look like, or be,\u201d Ms. Udofia, 33, said, adding that this image was tied to someone \u201cskinnier.\u201d\u201cI was hoping people would read and take interest,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it just felt important to know that somewhere in the world, this thing existed.\u201dThe reception has been positive. In The New York Times, Jesse Green called the two plays \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cstunningly acted.\u201d Taken together, he wrote, they \u201coffer a moving and powerful corrective to the notion that what immigrants leave behind is always awful, and that what they find is always worth the trip.\u201d\u201cSojourners\u201d takes place in 1978 and is about a young Nigerian couple, Abasiama and her husband, Ukpong, who immigrate to Houston to attend college. \u201cHer Portmanteau\u201d is set more than 30 years later, and sees Abasiama now with two daughters: Adiagha, raised in America, and Iniabasi, raised in Nigeria. It\u2019s a sprawling series, moving between the United States and Nigeria, and also across time and space.The plays\u2019 director, Ed Sylvanus Iskandar, describes them as \u201cIbsen cross-pollinated with the Marvel cinematic universe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same level of demand \u2014 every prop onstage has a story that will pay off as a part of the plot,\u201d Mr. Iskandar said. \u201cEvery incidental action in the play has a way to pay off.\u201dMs. Udofia didn\u2019t plan to be a playwright. Her parents immigrated to Houston in the 1970s. Like the characters in \u201cSojourners,\u201d Ms. Udofia\u2019s mother was a microbiologist and her father was a scholar of West African studies. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a few of the Nigerians that I know, they were coming here to explicitly study and leave,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd quite a few decided to stay.\u201d Ms. Udofia\u2019s parents eventually had three children and settled in Southbridge, Mass.At Wellesley College, Ms. Udofia pursued a political science degree and had planned to be a lawyer. But she dabbled in the arts; she had attended Broadway shows and played trombone in high school. In college, she was classically trained in opera and performed in plays put on by Ethos, the black student union at Wellesley. \u201cThat\u2019s when I bumped that career, that was kind of given to me, against myself, and I made a different choice,\u201d she said.When she began auditioning for roles in New York, Ms. Udofia noticed that Americans spoke about Africa as if it were a monolith. \u201cAfrica is not a country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a continent. In Nigeria alone, there\u2019s 500 different languages. There\u2019s so many people, and that one impression you had of Africa does not fit all of those people.\u201d\u201cWhen I tell people I\u2019m Nigerian, they ask: \u2018Oh my god, what is it like over there? Is it all dust, mud, and sadness?\u2019\u201d Ms. Ogbuagu said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, we used to go swimming in my uncle\u2019s country club!\u2019\u201dMs. Ogbuagu emphasized the importance of audiences\u2019 being able to witness \u201cthis narrative of an immigrant that has a house, and is coming from a place that they love, just going somewhere else for another sort of opportunity, and not escaping something horrible.\u201dWhile writing the \u201cUfot\u201d plays, Ms. Udofia borrowed from her family\u2019s history. But she maintains that the works are not autobiographical. \u201cThere are bits and pieces that are extraordinarily, personally close,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there are huge bits and pieces that I make up.\u201d For example, similarly to Adiagha in \u201cHer Portmanteau,\u201d Ms. Udofia has a half sister who lives in Nigeria, though they are not estranged the way the characters in the play are (\u201cIn my heart, she is my sister\u201d).\u201cThat is also a classic immigrant story,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere you come here to create and live, and what you had to do to survive sometimes splits and divides a family.\u201dEven though the plays are specifically about Nigerian immigrants, with unsubtitled Ibibio dialogue, the themes are universal. To James Nicola, the artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, the plays are a reminder that most Americans share a common origin story.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times, working on these plays over the last year or so, where I heard echoes of things that my immigrant grandparents, either on the Irish side or Italian side, expressed or mentioned in some ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe endless questions of leaving the culture that you\u2019re familiar with, and arriving in a very different one that you don\u2019t know much about. And how much do you try to fit in and how much do you try to preserve who you are, and how much you pass along for your children and grandchildren.\u201dTo Ms. Udofia, the themes within her plays are especially crucial now, as immigration becomes a contentious issue around the world and immigrants are vilified by some politicians. \u201cImmigrants built America,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone, once they\u2019ve come in, has had a hand in building this place, no matter how they came in. So what is the amnesia that makes us forget that?\u201dWhile building empathy is important to Ms. Udofia, as she continues to work on the rest of the \u201cUfot\u201d plays, she is also unapologetic about the fact that she isn\u2019t writing the cycle for a traditional theater audience. She has written five of the nine plays, and three of them have been produced. (\u201cRunboyrun\u201d was mounted at San Francisco\u2019s Magic Theater last year, and a reading of another, \u201cIn Old Age,\u201d is planned in July in Portland, Ore.) But if the plays result in a wider appeal, then all the better.\u201cI\u2019m writing them for myself,\u201d Ms. Udofia said. \u201cI\u2019m writing them for my immediate family. I am writing them for my extended family. I am writing them for the Ibibio community.\u201d In short, she added, \u201cI\u2019m writing us so we can see us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When a Political Movement Is Populist, or Isn\u2019t", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterThe two movements that culminated in this week\u2019s presidential elections could hardly seem, from the outside, more different.One movement is solidly right-wing, skeptical of institutions from the European Union to the news media and soaked in the politics of division. The other is left-wing but less categorically so, embraces institutions like those that oversaw Ms. Park, and seeks to bridge social divides.Yet the movements share a common architecture of grievance. In both, supporters felt shut out by an unresponsive political establishment. Both accused the incumbent president of selling out the people to corrupt, moneyed interests. Both saw their only choice as rising up to disrupt the status quo and force change.Their divergence reveals both the common traits in anti-establishment backlashes globally and the range between extremes those movements can fall within. And they hint at the fuzzy nature of populism, a label applied more readily to France than to South Korea.For several weeks this fall, every Saturday, as thousands of South Koreans gathered in city centers to call for the impeachment of Ms. Park, they would often sing the first article of their country\u2019s Constitution.Protest movements often use such national symbols to guard against accusations of disloyalty. But the line also sends a message nearly universal to anti-establishment protests. It conveys that political power rightfully belongs to the people, not to the state, and pledges to restore the rightful order.Tunisian protesters, in 2011, chanted, \u201cThe people want the downfall of the regime,\u201d a slogan that echoed across the Arab Spring. President Trump, in his inaugural address, said, \u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\u201dMarine Le Pen, the National Front leader, positioned herself as a champion of the people against the European Union rather than the French government.John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, said the protests in the city, though often upbeat, carried \u201ca clear edge of: \u2018We\u2019re in control here, not you. The people are taking the government back.\u2019\u201dProtest movements often start when democratically elected governments become so unmoored from popular opinion that people see them as undemocratic. Championing \u201cthe people\u201d is a way to accuse the government of having sold out to foreign or moneyed interests \u2014 an accusation powerful enough to justify drastic change.In France, the state was accused of selling out to the European Union, to global finance and, in the National Front\u2019s not-so-distant past, to Jews.Though the movements express different grievances \u2014 social and economic change in France, corruption in South Korea \u2014 they share a belief that the state has sidelined the people it is supposed to serve.This sentiment can arise when political systems are dominated by a small circle of elites seen as in cahoots, often because of corruption scandals like those in Brazil and South Korea.Or it can arise when establishment parties rally around a policy that not all voters accept.When French mainstream parties found consensus on supporting the European Union, for instance, anti-Union voters interpreted this as a conspiracy to shut them out. The establishment came to seem not just unresponsive, but undemocratic.In both South Korea and France, the movements arose because they saw the state as ignoring the needs of the people.In South Korea, the spark was corruption, an issue that affects everyone and so could bring people together. And it led protesters to support institutions, like the courts and law enforcement, rather than seek to smash them.But in France, the anti-establishment sentiment arose over issues that concern a subset of people, and that those people see as pitting them against others in society. Only a minority wishes to leave the European Union. Restricting immigration or religious clothing would serve some people by hurting others.This reveals something important: The French and South Korean movements differ significantly in how they define \u201cthe people.\u201dFor many of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s supporters, \u201cthe people\u201d refers to white ethnic French whose culture and traditions are said to be under threat by immigrants and Muslims.\u201cFrance isn\u2019t burkinis on the beach,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d this spring. \u201cFrance is Brigitte Bardot. That\u2019s France.\u201dSouth Korea\u2019s protests did often lean left, and drew pro-Park counterprotesters. But the movement, Mr. Delury said, strove to cross social lines and often succeeded.Ms. Park\u2019s low popularity \u2014 she polled in single digits \u2014 aided this mission. So did recent memory of South Korea\u2019s popular uprising to install democracy, a history that makes protest feel like a healthy check on the system rather than a disruption \u2014 and a collective rather than a divisive activity.\u201cThe baby stroller per capita numbers were staggering,\u201d Mr. Delury said, explaining how the protest movement reached the urban middle classes, which tend to favor pluralism, stability and rule of law. This agenda points toward upholding institutions rather than tearing them down.Eventually, leftist movements like labor, initially central to the protests, were joined by apolitical civic organizations whose presence made real the message of representing the people.While South Korea\u2019s protesters sought to cross social lines, Western populists have relished in drawing them.In Britain, the movement to leave the European Union did not just criticize Brussels, but also rallied against immigration. Mr. Trump ascended, in part, on a promise to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.Championing \u201cthe people,\u201d for such movements, becomes a way not only of declaring the state unresponsive, but of defining who does and does not belong.Those two messages can blur, confounding those who seek to classify Western populism as driven by political grievances or social animus but not both.That combination is key to populism as scholars tend to define it, and it is why Mr. Delury says the label does not apply to South Korea\u2019s protests.Scholarly definitions seem to back him up.Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist, has written that populism divides the world \u201cinto two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the pure people\u2019 versus \u2018the corrupt elite.\u2019\u201d The people are unified, in this view, by common values and traits, sometimes including race.The political scientists Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart defined populism as distrustful of all elites and institutions, from scientists to the news media. It views \u201cordinary people,\u201d they wrote, as \u201chomogeneous and inherently \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018decent.\u2019\u201d Diversity, in this view, compromises that purity.While these tenets feel democratic to proponents, they form a vision of democracy that is majoritarian rather than pluralistic. That majority \u2014 \u201cthe people\u201d \u2014 can be defined by race or religion or class, but there is always someone left out.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Singapore, a Rising Home for Quiet Money, Comes Under Pressure", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported bySINGAPORE \u2014 Last year, American law enforcement officials pressed the Swiss bank UBS about Henry Hsiaw, a Taiwan-born American whom they accused of failing to file tax returns.Still, UBS balked at handing over information about Mr. Hsiaw\u2019s account with the bank in Singapore. That information, it said, was protected under the Asian city-state\u2019s bank secrecy laws.That courthouse dispute illustrates the growing pressures on Singapore, an increasingly popular destination for money that wants to stay under the radar. Tight bank secrecy laws have helped draw $1.1 trillion in foreign funds to the city, according to an estimate from Boston Consulting Group, a consulting firm. Singapore is now growing faster than Switzerland and is set to become the largest cross-border financial center in the world by 2028, the firm forecasts.Singapore\u2019s position illustrates the new scrutiny global authorities are giving to quiet money. The Financial Action Task Force, a multicountry advisory group set up to combat money laundering, said last year that Singapore\u2019s financial firms had \u201ca less developed understanding of the risk of illicit flows into and out of Singapore.\u201d\u201cSince the U.S. Department of Justice went after Swiss banks for hiding tax dodgers years ago, Singapore has filled the role,\u201d he said.The Monetary Authority of Singapore, its top financial regulator, disputed that allegation. \u201cThere is no doubt some increased risk of illicit fund flows associated with the rapid growth of private banking flows into Singapore,\u201d a spokeswoman said in a written statement. Nevertheless, she said, Singapore \u201cwill not tolerate its financial system being used as a refuge or conduit for illicit fund flows.\u201dSingapore has positioned itself as a one-stop shop for Asia\u2019s rich. It encouraged private wealth managers to use the city as a regional base in the 1990s just as China\u2019s rise created a new generation of wealthy.A lawyer representing Mr. Leissner did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs said it was cooperating.Customs officials in Singapore say they have \u201crobust regulatory measures\u201d to prevent illicit activities. Lincoln Ng, the chief executive of Le Freeport and a former Singapore police officer, said local regulators \u201care aware of the activities through stringent checks and audits.\u201dLe Freeport, which is controlled by Yves Bouvier, a Swiss art dealer who is also a resident of Singapore, rents the space to firms that park merchandise there on behalf of clients. Tenants include Mr. Bouvier\u2019s own art transportation and storage firm, Natural le Coultre, which says it conducts due diligence on its clients and goods.\u201cIn short, we know what we have on hand and with whom we are dealing,\u201d says Christian Pauli, general manager of fine art logistics at Natural le Coultre.The facility combines European chic with the sort of security one might see in a James Bond movie. Private vaults lie behind an 11-ton steel door flanked by concrete walls that are more than 15 inches thick. Three different people are required to unlock the door. Some tenants, like companies handling precious metals, install extra cameras, facial recognition technology or iris readers.The United States dismissed its charges after UBS produced some information on Mr. Hsiaw\u2019s Singapore accounts. Mr. Hsiaw, a former telecommunications executive who relocated to China in 2007, could not be reached for comment.UBS said it had complied with all applicable laws, but did not elaborate.. Singapore\u2019s monetary authority said Singapore officials \u201ccan render assistance so long as there are legitimate grounds.\u201dLawyers say the case, the first of its kind in the United States to target Singapore accounts, amounted to a warning shot.He added, \u201cthe ultimate death knell for secrecy in any jurisdiction would be a bank getting served one of these subpoenas and choosing to litigate, then losing in court.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a corporate advisory and investigations firm co-founded by Chris Leahy.

{"Headline": "How North Korea Managed to Defy Years of Sanctions", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byDANDONG, China \u2014 As the end of the fashion season approached, and the suits and dresses arrived in her company\u2019s warehouses here in the Chinese border town of Dandong, the accountant crammed about $100,000 into a backpack, then boarded a rickety train with several co-workers.After a six-hour journey, she recalled, they arrived at a factory where hundreds of women using high-end European machines sewed clothes with \u201cMade in China\u201d labels. Her boss handed the money to the North Korean manager, all of it in American bills as required.Fraudulent labeling helps support its garment industry, which generated more than $500 million for the isolated nation last year, according to Chinese trade data.But China has a long record of shielding North Korea from more painful sanctions, because it is afraid of a regime collapse that could send refugees streaming across the border and leave it with a more hostile neighbor.Foreign trade, primarily with China, has surged, too, more than doubling since 2000, though it has slipped in the past three years.In theory, North Korea\u2019s greater openness to trade makes it more vulnerable to sanctions, with new potential targets and pressure points. But it also highlights the limits of an approach to sanctions \u2014 defined largely by China at the United Nations \u2014 that aims to punish North Korea\u2019s military and ruling elite while sparing its people. As trade expands, the lines have blurred.Positioned near the mouth of the Yalu River, Dandong is China\u2019s largest border town, and much of North Korea\u2019s trade with the world flows across its old bridges or through its deepwater port.Ms. Lang, 33, moved here more than a decade ago to study environmental protection. She ended up like many with ambition in this city of more than three million: doing business with North Korea.She wears exquisite makeup and carries a Louis Vuitton handbag, and she said her role in the garment trade was straightforward: Orders come in from Japan, Europe and other parts of China, and she gets the clothes made.For those with quick deadlines or detailed specifications, she turns to Chinese factories in Dandong, where quality control is better. Yet even these factories employ North Korean laborers, she said.For decades, North Korea has been accused of sending workers abroad and confiscating most of their wages, an arrangement that activists liken to slave labor. Researchers say the practice has expanded since Mr. Kim took power, with more than 50,000 workers now toiling in up to 40 countries.In Dandong, the local government boasts that 10,000 North Koreans are employed in its apparel factories, working 12- to 14-hour shifts, with just two to four days off each month and a monthly wage of no more than $260.Ms. Lang sends more-flexible orders to North Korea, where costs are lower but it is impossible to guarantee delivery dates because of power failures and a shortage of trucks.Her company ships fabric, buttons and zippers to factories there, she said, because the North lacks the materials, and they put \u201cMade in China\u201d labels in garments to make them easier to sell overseas. That would most likely be considered fraud and a violation of place-of-origin rules in countries that import the clothes, experts said.Paul Tjia, managing director of GPI Consultancy, a Dutch company that offers advice on doing business in North Korea, said that some European clients had ordered hundreds of thousands of garments and that \u201cMade in China\u201d labels could be justified by additional work put into the clothes inside China.But he added: \u201cI\u2019m not a garment manufacturer. I just make the introductions.\u201dChina has kept North Korea\u2019s garment sector off the list of industries targeted by United Nations sanctions, arguing that punishing it would hurt ordinary people and not military programs. It has protected North Korea\u2019s seafood industry using the same argument.But it is difficult to say who benefits from this trade, in part because even private enterprise in North Korea is overseen by state officials who extract taxes and bribes.\u201cWhether the proceeds from the textile industry support the nuclear program is an open question,\u201d said Joseph M. DeThomas, a professor at Pennsylvania State University and a former American ambassador involved in sanctions policy. \u201cMoney is fungible.\u201dAnd South Korean officials say the millions paid by Chinese companies to fish in North Korean waters go primarily to firms controlled by the North\u2019s military.Sanctions also do not cover the organized export of labor. The United States has urged countries to eject North Korean workers, saying their remittances benefit the military, not their families. But China, Russia and other nations continue to hire them.The United Nations Security Council did not impose sanctions until July 2006, when, after a series of missile tests, it banned countries from selling material for missiles or weapons of mass destruction to North Korea.The North detonated its first nuclear device months later, followed by additional tests in 2009 and 2013, and two in 2016. The Security Council tightened sanctions after each test, as well as after a satellite launch in 2013. It targeted military supplies and luxury goods, shut Pyongyang out of the international financial system and, most recently, banned a range of mineral exports.\u201cHow much cooperation will the international community get from Cuba, Russia, Iran or even Pakistan, Bangladesh or Laos?\u201d asked Stephan Haggard, an expert on the North Korean economy at the University of California, San Diego.The United States has also urged a boycott of Air Koryo, the North Korean airline, but it still flies to China and Russia. Chinese tourism to North Korea is booming, said Cha Yong Hyok, whose company, Indprk, takes groups by train to Pyongyang and will soon use new flights from Dandong.The North often circumvents banking sanctions using front companies and agents overseas, and North Koreans routinely send and receive payments using Chinese intermediaries who take a commission, despite the ban on \u201cbulk cash\u201d transfers.\u201cWe can and should go after these targets, but turning this into a game of financial cat-and-mouse will never achieve the level of pressure needed,\u201d said Daniel L. Glaser, a former Treasury Department official involved in sanctions enforcement.Ultimately, he argued, that pressure will come only if China makes a strategic decision to truly squeeze the North. \u201cThough China has taken helpful steps at times,\u201d he said, \u201cit has never been willing to go all in.\u201dMany of China\u2019s best-known companies have done business with North Korea even as they have sought customers and investors in the United States or relied on American-made parts and materials. ZTE, the mobile phone and electronics manufacturer, for example, shipped about $15 million of goods to the North in 2015, according to Chinese customs records viewed via the global trade database company Panjiva.But many Chinese companies sell products to North Korea without such problems. The electric car and battery maker BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns a 10 percent stake, has shipped $14 million in goods to North Korea since 2012, including rubber products in January and vehicles in December, customs records show. BYD and Berkshire Hathaway didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Just about every big Chinese appliance maker does business with North Korea, too, shipping refrigerators, air-conditioners, televisions and other electronics. The major Chinese automakers sell vehicles to the North as well.Even Tsingtao Brewery shows up in customs records, delivering $20,000 worth of beer in the summer of 2014.United Nations sanctions prohibit the sale of luxury goods to North Korea, but countries are generally left to define what that means. The resolutions list jewelry, luxury automobiles, sports equipment and snowmobiles but make no mention of televisions, consumer electronics or home appliances.In some cases, Chinese companies with access to advanced technology are doing business with North Korea. Subsidiaries of the defense manufacturer Norinco made seven shipments, mostly of electronic and optical goods, worth a total of $1.5 million, in the second half of last year, records say. Norinco did not respond to a request for comment.Matthew Brazil, a security consultant and former diplomat for the United States who investigated Chinese trade controls in the 1990s, said it was often impossible to get China to follow up on leads suggesting Chinese firms were violating restrictions. \u201cThree months later, if you\u2019re lucky, the visit is scheduled, and many times, visits weren\u2019t scheduled at all,\u201d he said.Mr. Brazil said the problem had persisted, and \u201cany level of control of American electronics has completely collapsed because this technology can be so easily shipped from China to North Korea.\u201dOn AliExpress, an e-commerce platform run by the Chinese internet giant Alibaba, six of the nine shipping services list North Korea as a potential destination. Alibaba declined to comment.The manager of a shipping firm in Dandong who asked to be identified only by her surname, Li, because of the nature of her work said shipping a package of electronics to North Korea was straightforward \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t have obvious labels\u201d and meets weight requirements.In fact, a delivery is more likely to run into problems on the North Korean side of the border than with customs inspectors in China. \u201cThe key,\u201d she said, \u201cis to make sure everything is fine with the people on the other side.\u201dJane Perlez and Yufan Huang reported from Dandong, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Why Texas Democrats Are Betting on Beto O\u2019Rourke", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 It\u2019s happening again. The stirring of the heart. The quickening of the pulse. The desire to abandon reality, even if you suspect there\u2019s a world of hurt to come. Love, thy name is Beto.If you haven\u2019t heard, our junior senator from Texas, a.k.a. Darth Vader, a.k.a. Voldemort, a.k.a. Ted Cruz, has a challenger for 2018, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman from El Paso by the name of Beto O\u2019Rourke. Mr. O\u2019Rourke may still be unknown to many, even in the state, but for those searching for a savior of the Turn Texas Blue variety, the crush is blossoming. Among statewide Democratic insiders, Beto is already a member of the First Name Club, with Madonna and Cher.She didn\u2019t. Our right-wing governor crushed her by about 20 points. Yes, there were some dumb campaign choices, and not even the truest believers could blame sexism entirely for the loss, but the bottom line was that the Republican Party was still running Texas.Two years later, Hillary Clinton thought she had a chance to carry the state in the presidential election. There was some evidence she might: Texas\u2019 biggest cities are resoundingly blue, and respectable pollsters were predicting the time had come.It hadn\u2019t. Donald Trump trounced her by 52 percent to 43 percent.Cockeyed optimists in the Democratic Party claimed that Mrs. Clinton lost by less than anticipated, but the basic math between the parties here remains unchanged, as does the conventional wisdom. The best advice for a Democrat running in Texas? Invite the press to watch you set your campaign funds on fire.But then Mr. O\u2019Rourke showed up. This time will be different, or so his proponents say. He is liberal and progressive, but also technologically and economically literate in a way that should appeal to business. He speaks fluent Spanish. He has served his district well, especially by touting the charms and economic opportunities (as opposed to the crime) on the El Paso-Juarez border.Older Democrats like to compare him to the Kennedys, in his politics and looks. (He is handsome and toothy, with a thatch of shimmering brown hair.) Millennials like him because he once played in a punk band called Foss, because he started a software company, and because he has a few things in common with Bernie Sanders. Like him, Beto promises to go it alone, without support from consultants and political action committees.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also knows how to brawl. He pulled off two upsets, the first to become a city councilman, and the second and more important in his 2012 congressional victory against Silvestre Reyes, a 16-year incumbent who is Mexican-American.Then there is the spread of so-called anti-Trump sentiment \u2014 the same one that Democrats in Kansas and Georgia and Montana are also pinning their hopes on. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has shown that he, too, can hold a rally. The crowds that greeted him in Houston, San Antonio and even Midland, once home to the Bush cabal, have been like Elvis concerts.Subsequently, Mr. Castro decided the time wasn\u2019t right \u2014 see Texas Democrats, above \u2014 and never declared his candidacy. Unless someone else decides to run in the Republican or Democratic primaries, that leaves Mr. O\u2019Rourke alone, slingshot in hand, against Mr. Cruz.So that\u2019s the good news, the stuff Democratic dreams are made of.Here\u2019s the bad news: Thus far, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has a $400,000 war chest compared with Mr. Cruz\u2019s $4.2 million, a big deficit to make up when the cost of running a statewide campaign in Texas starts at $1 million a week. There\u2019s the power of incumbency, too. Mr. Cruz may be bruised, but he\u2019s hardly bloodied. He even has 2.6 million Twitter followers to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 25,000, proving once again that social media is not just for hipsters.Some believe that a Democratic primary race, however divisive, would have prepped the victor to withstand Mr. Cruz\u2019s ruthless campaign tactics. (Mr. O\u2019Rourke had two arrests in the 1990s, one for D.U.I. and another for breaking and entering. Though both incidents have been explained away as youthful indiscretions, Mr. Cruz will be sure to turn them into high crimes and misdemeanors.)Finally, there\u2019s the biggest problem of all: Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide race in Texas since 1994. John Cornyn, the senior Texas senator, has described Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s run as \u201ca suicide mission.\u201dMaybe. Probably. But this is Texas: If you can\u2019t dream big, why bother?Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Theresa May Doesn\u2019t Crack and Jeremy Corbyn Keeps His Cool in U.K. Debate", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byDuring 90 minutes of questions put separately to Mrs. May and to the leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, the prime minister appeared less comfortable under hard questioning, but she did not crack.Mr. Corbyn did well, keeping his cool and sense of humor, but had difficulty explaining away his past sympathies for groups like Hamas and Sinn Fein while trying to paint a picture of a better future with more money for nearly every social service coming from higher taxes on corporations and those earning more than 80,000 pounds a year, or about $103,000.But neither politician emerged as a clear victor. And while the opinion polls are narrowing, Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party still seems to hold a significant \u2014 though single-digit \u2014 lead over Labour for the election on June 8.Mrs. May had refused to take part in a head-to-head debate with Mr. Corbyn, so both politicians appeared separately on a program in which they took questions first from voters, then from a journalist, Jeremy Paxman.Mr. Corbyn, while outperforming relatively low expectations, appeared vulnerable when questioned about his willingness to authorize military force, his past opposition to the Falklands war in the early 1980s, and his expressions of regret that Osama bin Laden had been killed, rather than arrested and tried.Television debates rarely affect the outcome of British elections, according to analysts, but this event gave Mrs. May a chance to reboot her lackluster campaign after the Manchester bombing last week, which prompted the suspension of electioneering for several days.The attack itself was barely mentioned on the program, though Mr. Corbyn was challenged over his comments that the war on terrorism was not working, while Mrs. May was called out over cuts in the police ranks, even as she argued that spending on counterterrorism had increased.Mrs. May\u2019s shaky campaign and the tightening polls have undercut assumptions that she will win a resounding victory, but she is still expected to increase her narrow majority in Parliament.Her campaign stumbled when she was forced to revisit a plan to put a hard cap on the assets that residents who receive long-term care at home may own.The proposal, widely derided as a \u201cdementia tax,\u201d raised sufficient enough protests that Mrs. May beat a hasty retreat, even as she insisted that nothing had changed in her thinking. During Monday night\u2019s debate, Mrs. May said there would be an absolute limit on the amount people would have to pay, but did not specify what it would be.The furor over long-term care and her obvious change of heart over Brexit, which she had originally opposed, have dented her claims that only she can provide the \u201cstrong and stable\u201d leadership Britain needs as it faces very difficult negotiations over how to extract itself from the European Union.But Mr. Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda has proved more popular than some had expected, despite questions about how it would be financed. He has also benefited from rules that, during election campaigns, oblige Britain\u2019s broadcasters to balance the airtime given to the different parties, something that normally increases the visibility of the opposition.Mr. Paxman provoked laughter from the studio audience, and a fierce stare from Mrs. May, when he suggested that during the Brexit negotiations, her European interlocutors would conclude that she was a \u201cblowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire.\u201dShe repeated her insistence that no Brexit deal with the European Union would be better than a bad deal. Mr. Corbyn argued that he would reach an accord allowing tariff-free trade with the European Union to continue despite his promise for \u201cmanaged migration.\u201d He said that he expected that immigration \u201cwould probably come down\u201d but gave no estimates on numbers.Despite her recent difficulties, Mrs. May also has some solid reasons to be content. The Liberal Democrats, the most pro-European of the parties, have so far failed to convince the millions of voters who opposed Brexit that they offer a viable alternative.And the right-wing, populist U.K. Independence Party appears to be in its death throes \u2014 with its main policies of quitting the European Union and curbing immigration now appropriated by the Conservatives.That leaves Mrs. May in a straight fight with Mr. Corbyn, which most analysts still expect her to win.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even as Wind Power Rises, It Falls Under a Political Cloud", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "As utility operations increasingly avail themselves of wind, the Trump administration looks at whether conventional sources have been placed at a disadvantage.Supported byWind farms, with their rapid geographic spread and technological advances, are reshaping the electric system, defying skepticism that they are steady or reliable enough to displace conventional power plants.\u201cThe fuel of choice right now, certainly for us, is wind,\u201d said Ben Fowke, the chief executive of Xcel Energy, which shut down a large natural-gas plant in Colorado for two days in January and let wind fill, on average, half of its customer demand.Now politics, not skepticism, may be wind power\u2019s biggest barrier. Under new leadership with ties to conventional energy interests, the Energy Department is scrambling to complete an internal study in the next month that could lead to an upending of the policies that fostered the rapid spread of solar and wind.In ordering the study, Energy Secretary Rick Perry directed his department to determine whether federal subsidies that encourage wind and solar energy \u2014 and the way wholesale markets value different energy sources \u2014 are putting conventional power plants at a disadvantage and threatening the stability of the grid.The study has been praised by trade groups representing the nuclear and coal industries. But it is being conducted without including many of those potentially affected. And clean-energy executives and advocates, as well as some lawmakers, have expressed concern that it will be grounded more in ideology than in evidence.A group of trade organizations representing clean-energy interests delivered analyses to the department in mid-May arguing that renewables do not threaten grid reliability and that subsidies are not to blame for the economic troubles of coal and nuclear plants.Representative Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat from upstate New York who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, raised concerns at a recent meeting of utility industry executives that the new study would not be objective. \u201cIt appears to me to be a bottom line that\u2019s written and now looking for a study to substantiate it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s an attempt to hold on to the past.\u201dAmong the subsidies the department is examining is a production tax credit that allows most wind farms to shave pennies off the price of each kilowatt-hour they send to the grid. Though flattening demand for electricity and cheap natural gas are the main forces depressing wholesale energy prices, the credit means that wind producers can often offer their power to the market at the lowest price. Sometimes, when energy demand is low and wind is strong, the credit can drive the effective price below zero.Mr. Perry has raised the possibility of federal intervention in energy markets to protect coal and nuclear plants against lower-priced wind and natural-gas supplies. While he backed state control of market policies as Texas governor, he said at a conference in April that \u201cthe boot\u2019s on the other foot now.\u201dEnergy experts say that without the credit and other favorable subsidies, mandates and market policies in place, wind development and production will be threatened. When the credit has periodically expired, installations nearly ground to a halt \u2014 dropping by roughly 76 to 93 percent, according to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists \u2014 only to resume again with its renewal. Congressional estimates put the cost of the credit at $3.1 billion last year, and the figure is expected to reach $4 billion this year.\u201cThere\u2019s no question: if the P.T.C. goes away, that\u2019s a big number,\u201d said Robert F. Shapiro, a lawyer at Chadbourne & Parke in Washington, who focuses on project finance and energy. \u201cNew plants would have to meet a tougher test, a market-price test, that can\u2019t be masked in part by that subsidy.\u201dThough some energy analysts and executives say it is unlikely that the Trump administration will seek to undo the federal tax credit \u2014 which is set to phase out by 2020 \u2014 high-ranking Energy Department officials involved in the study have taken part in efforts to diminish support for renewables. Those include Mr. Perry\u2019s chief of staff, Brian McCormack, whom Mr. Perry directed to initiate the study, and another appointee, Travis Fisher, who is overseeing it, according to a former Energy Department official who is one of its advisers.Mr. Perry has relationships with executives in the oil, gas and nuclear waste industries. But the Energy Department said its review was simply meant to ensure a balanced and secure energy supply, and noted the surge in wind development during his time as governor, making Texas the leading wind energy-producing state by far.\u201cSecretary Perry\u2019s proven record as a champion for an all-of-the-above energy policy speaks for itself,\u201d said Shaylyn Hynes, a department spokeswoman. \u201cHe understands that a reliable, resilient and affordable electric system \u2014 using all of our domestic resources, including renewables \u2014 is essential.\u201dThe department would not comment on how Mr. McCormack and Mr. Fisher would influence the study.Parts of the study aim to determine the extent to which current regulations and incentives are forcing coal and nuclear plants to close, and whether the increased use of renewable sources is adding to the cost of operating the system.But many energy experts and executives say the study appears to take an outmoded view of how grid operators and some utilities are looking to meet their base loads, and have criticized the fast deadline and lack of outreach to those who oversee the electric system. The Energy Department is working with researchers at several national laboratories and the Energy Information Administration, but not grid operators or state and federal regulators, because of time constraints, according to internal study memos obtained by The New York Times.Although wind energy on its own cannot fill all the functions of traditional power plants, it is increasingly serving some of them; utility executives are beginning to call it the new base-load source. In several regions, especially at night when demand is lower, grid operators will signal coal and nuclear plants to reduce production and let wind displace their output.Mr. Fowke, the chief executive, said that he planned to replace aging coal plants mainly with wind and use natural gas as the backup, and that he hoped the production tax credit would stay in place as currently planned.\u201cThe P.T.C. is one piece of the puzzle and allows us to offer wind at a price that is below virtually any other alternative,\u201d he said, adding that as renewables continued to come down in price they would be able to expand even as the subsidies phase out. \u201cIt\u2019s working for us \u2014 you can have a cleaner product and it can be affordable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Real Estate\u2019s New Normal: Homeowners Staying Put", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byFor much of last year, Greg Rubin was looking to buy a bigger house. He has been in the same two-bedroom home for 17 years and hoped to upgrade to a place with a guest room, a home office and a workshop for his guitars, radio-controlled planes and gardening equipment.This year, Mr. Rubin has a new plan. He stopped looking and embarked on an ambitious renovation project that will begin with a new kitchen and end with a workshop for all the man toys.\u201cMy girlfriend would like to get a larger house, but right now, I\u2019m staying put,\u201d said Mr. Rubin, who lives in Escondido, Calif., and owns a landscaping firm called California\u2019s Own Native Landscape Design.Mr. Rubin is the face of what appears to be a new normal in the real estate business: Homeowners are moving less, creating a drag on the economy, fewer commissions for real estate brokers and a brutally competitive market for first-time home shoppers who cannot find much for sale and are likely to be disappointed during real estate\u2019s spring selling season.For many homeowners, the desire to stay put began out of caution or necessity. Mr. Rubin\u2019s business lost more than half of its revenue in the years after the Great Recession, so until recently, he had no money or desire to upgrade. Millions of other homeowners lost their jobs or were stuck in homes worth less than they owed the bank \u2014 two big reasons that the median homeownership tenure rose to about eight and a half years last year, up from about three and a half in 2008, according to data from Moody\u2019s Analytics and First American Financial Corporation.

That is because the better economy has come with a steady rise in interest rates.Like tens of millions of others, Mr. Rubin refinanced when mortgage rates were near a historic low. He has a 3.25 percent interest rate on his home loan, so even if he could find a similar home for the same price, his payment would go up considerably. For a 30-year fixed-rate $500,000 mortgage, an interest-rate rise to 5.5 percent would increase the monthly payment roughly $700 to $3,600, including estimated taxes and fees, according to Zillow, the real estate data service.\u201cOnce mortgage rates climb to 5 or 5.5 percent, we are going to start to see the lock-in effect really take hold,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.In any case, the increase in homeownership tenure is yet another example of how the economy is still feeling the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the Federal Reserve\u2019s extraordinary policy measures to address it. It also highlights just how far the housing market remains from its pre-recession form.We created a set of charts for several metropolitan areas that look at school quality, home price and commute. There are deals to be had.\u201cWe are coming out of a deep, dark hole called the housing bust, but we are a long way from normal, and we may never get back to normal, if normal was the average person stayed in their home for four or five years,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cWe\u2019re at eight-plus now, and even under the best of circumstances, maybe we get to six.\u201dStill, the impact will be felt throughout the economy. Whether in broker commissions, new furniture or junk hauling, moving costs a lot of money, so longer home tenures are likely to weigh on consumer spending.It could also hurt the economy in more subtle ways, by making people less mobile. For instance, some people might find a better job in another city but decide not to take it because the pay would not make up for the increase in mortgage costs.Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a national real estate brokerage firm, sees this in the form of a persistent inventory shortage. More people are buying tear-downs. The bidding wars that have come to characterize hot job markets like San Francisco and Seattle are spreading to less-expensive cities.Mr. Kelman said those who would normally sell their home to get the down payment for a new one were increasingly becoming landlords because their low-interest loans meant extra profit in rent \u2014 translating into less business for him.\u201cPeople who buy a home and sell their home are the meat and drink of the real estate business, but increasingly, we\u2019re only getting half the sales from them,\u201d he said.The Olsons live in Chicago in a two-bedroom apartment with views of Wrigley Field. For the last few years, when winter turned to spring, they embarked on a weekend-to-weekend journey in search of their first home.When they started, it was just the two of them, and they limited their search to two nearby neighborhoods. But with inventory scarce, competition high and a newborn who arrived in January, they now go to open houses with their son in a baby carrier and have expanded their search to encompass most of the city\u2019s North Side and a few nearby suburbs.\u201cThere is no inventory \u2014 we\u2019re talking four or five houses in our price range a week,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who works in information technology at a bank. \u201cSome of those are houses with holes in the floor, holes in the roof \u2014 and even those are flying off the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Passes Measure to Repeal and Replace the Affordable Care Act", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday narrowly approved legislation to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans recovered from their earlier failures and moved a step closer to delivering on their promise to reshape American health care without mandated insurance coverage.The vote, 217 to 213, held on President Trump\u2019s 105th day in office, is a significant step on what could be a long legislative road. Twenty Republicans bolted from their leadership to vote no. But the win keeps alive the party\u2019s dream of unwinding President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.The House measure faces profound uncertainty in the Senate, where a handful of Republican senators immediately rejected it, signaling that they would start work on a new version of the bill virtually from scratch.\u201cTo the extent that the House solves problems, we might borrow ideas,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee. \u201cWe can go to conference with the House, or they can pass our bill.\u201dEven before the vote, some Republican senators had expressed deep reservations about one of the most important provisions of the House bill, which would roll back the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.But a softening of the House bill, which could help it get through the Senate, would present new problems. For any repeal measure to become law, the House and the Senate would have to agree on the language, a formidable challenge.The House voted in May 2017 on a  health care bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.Just before the House vote, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday to a $1.1 trillion spending bill that will finance the government through September, and unlike the health care legislation, the spending bill had broad bipartisan support.After weeks of negotiations and false starts, Mr. Trump and House Republicans were not about to dwell on the tough road ahead. Passage of the health care bill completed a remarkable act of political resuscitation, six weeks after House leaders failed to muster the votes to pass an earlier version of the measure, a blow to Mr. Trump and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\u201cYes, premiums will be coming down; yes, deductibles will be coming down, but very importantly, it\u2019s a great plan,\u201d Mr. Trump boasted on Thursday at the kind of White House Rose Garden victory ceremony typically reserved for legislation that is being signed into law, not for a controversial bill that passed just one chamber.\u201cWe want to brag about the plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said, after asking those assembled how he was doing in his debut as a politician. \u201cHey, I\u2019m president!\u201dMr. Trump quickly turned his attention to pressuring the Senate to act, calling the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, to talk about the way forward for the health plan.Democrats, who voted unanimously against the bill, vowed to make Republicans pay a political price for pushing such unpopular legislation. As Republicans reached the threshold for passage, Democrats serenaded them with, \u201cNa na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!\u201d\u201cI have never seen political suicide in my life like I\u2019m seeing today,\u201d Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said on the House floor before the vote.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, warned moderate Republicans who supported the measure: \u201cYou have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one.\u201dThe House bill would eliminate tax penalties for people who go without health insurance. It would roll back state-by-state expansions of Medicaid, which covered millions of low-income Americans. And in place of government-subsidized insurance policies offered exclusively on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces, the bill would offer tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending on age.A family could receive up to $14,000 a year in credits. The credits would be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 a year and families making over $150,000.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the first version of the bill would trim the federal budget deficit considerably but would also leave 24 million more Americans without health insurance after a decade. Average insurance premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher in 2018 and 2019, but after that, they would be lower than projected under current law.Mr. Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said Thursday that Republicans had been quietly working for several months on their own bill and would take the House measure under consideration for ideas and components.Senate Republicans will face some of the same dynamics that stymied the House for weeks. Moderate senators will demand significant concessions, which in turn could alienate three hard-liners: Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah.Republican senators are certain to face pressure from governors worried about constituents on Medicaid losing their coverage. Republican leaders changed the House bill to woo hard-line conservatives, allowing state governments to roll back required coverage for essential services like maternity and emergency care. States could also seek waivers that would let insurers charge higher premiums for some people with pre-existing medical conditions.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe cannot pull the rug out from under states like Nevada that expanded Medicaid, and we need assurances that people with pre-existing conditions will be protected,\u201d said Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, who is up for re-election next year.Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said he wanted to ensure that the final repeal bill \u201cfulfills President Trump\u2019s promises to lower premiums, maintain coverage and protect those with pre-existing conditions.\u201dDemocrats are confident that some provisions of the House bill will be found to violate special budget rules that Republicans must follow in order to skirt a Senate filibuster.\u201cThis bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate,\u201d the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said. He said his Republican colleagues \u201cshould refuse to follow their House colleagues over a cliff, reject repeal, and work with Democrats to improve our health care system in a bipartisan way.\u201dRepublicans have promised for seven years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, under which around 20 million Americans gained health coverage. But they had no consensus on how much of the law should be repealed and had great difficulty devising a comprehensive replacement. Their doubts were reinforced by constituents who said the health law had saved their lives.Doctors, hospitals and other health care providers joined patient advocacy groups like the American Cancer Society and AARP in opposing the repeal bill.But House Republicans said that insurance markets in many states were already melting down, and they pointed to Iowa, where the last major insurer under the Affordable Care Act has threatened to pull out.There may be \u201cnobody to write insurance for people that are in the Obamacare exchanges\u201d in 94 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties, said the House Republican whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana.The House vote on Thursday occurred before the Congressional Budget Office had released a new analysis of the revised bill with its cost and impact. Democrats angrily questioned how Republicans could vote on a bill that would affect millions of people and a large slice of the American economy without knowing the ramifications.The Republican bill, the American Health Care Act, would make profound changes to Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, ending its status as an open-ended entitlement. States would receive an allotment of federal money for each beneficiary, or, as an alternative, they could take the money in a lump sum as a block grant, with fewer federal requirements. The bill would also repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act on high-income people, insurers and drug companies, among others. And it would cut off federal funds from Planned Parenthood for one year.Many defenders of the bill focused less on its details than on what they saw as shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cObamacare has hijacked the free market and has taken some Americans\u2019 liberties with it,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said on the floor, adding that the health law \u201creplaced our doctors with bureaucrats, because that\u2019s what socialized medicine does.\u201dDemocrats worked to link House Republicans\u2019 actions to an unpopular president. \u201cThe Pied Piper of Trump Tower is playing a tune today, and they must dance,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas.Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Republicans: \u201cYou are taking away essential health care protections. You are allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dIn truth, Republicans argued, with so many problems afflicting the Affordable Care Act, the status quo is unsustainable, regardless of what Congress does. Hours before the vote, Mr. Trump pointed to Aetna\u2019s announcement this week that it would no longer offer policies on Virginia\u2019s Affordable Care Act exchange.\u201cDeath spiral!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter.Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Alan Rappeport and Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Questions Surround Ukraine\u2019s Bailouts as Banking Chief Steps Down", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byIn the years since Ukraine\u2019s revolution ushered in a pro-Western government, the United States, the International Monetary Fund and other donors loosened the purse strings to offer Kiev foreign aid.But at the same time, anticorruption groups have been raising questions over where those billions of dollars have gone, concerns that have been amplified after Ukraine\u2019s central bank chief resigned amid an investigation into a bailout of the country\u2019s largest bank, a lender once owned by a pro-government oligarch.The stakes are high, with Ukraine heavily dependent on foreign financial help as it grapples with the loss of about 12 percent of its territory and nearly a fifth of its gross domestic product as a result of its war with Russia.But her resignation comes after the authorities opened an inquiry in March into the central bank\u2019s operations. The government in December spent $5.6 billion on a recapitalization of PrivatBank, which is owned by Ihor V. Kolomoisky \u2014 the pro-Kiev commander of a battle-hardened militia and the governor of a crucial region that is on the front line of the Russian conflict.Ms. Gontareva, who took the post in 2014, closed half of Ukraine\u2019s private banks. That was part of efforts to carry out a \u201ctotal revamp of the Ukrainian banking system,\u201d she said in a recent interview.Not everyone was pleased with her efforts. At one point during her tenure, she found a coffin dumped outside her home.Among the moves she oversaw were deals offering PrivatBank central bank refinancing to strengthen the lender\u2019s balance sheet. But at least $1.8 billion of that money quickly vanished into bad loans, according to the Anti-Corruption Action Center, an independent organization tracking fraud in Ukraine that is financed in part by United States government grants. By December, PrivatBank faced a huge capital shortfall.\u201cWhen I opened their books as governor of the central bank, I was shocked,\u201d Ms. Gontareva said. \u201cInstead of real assets, they have just shells.\u201dPrivatBank, with nearly a third of Ukraine\u2019s individual bank deposits, was too big to fail, particularly in a country destabilized by war. The government in Kiev soon stepped in with the $5.6 billion bailout, nationalizing the lender.Through it all, Mr. Kolomoisky was financing a major anti-Russian militia in the war in eastern Ukraine. The militia, called Dnepro-1, remains well regarded by Ukrainian soldiers and was crucial in holding parts of the front line before the regular army could be transformed into a battle-ready state.That support for the militia insulated his business activity from aggressive oversight by the government he was defending militarily, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kiev School of Economics. \u201cPeople respect him for helping to save Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Mylovanov said.Instead, the I.M.F. mandated the creation of an independent anticorruption watchdog. On March 29, agents from that body searched the central bank\u2019s headquarters as part of a half dozen criminal inquiries into \u201cmisuses or misappropriation,\u201d of central bank funds, including one looking specifically at possible wrongdoing by central bank employees, according to a spokeswoman.Independent anticorruption groups say the March raid was related to accusations of impropriety over refinancing deals with failing, oligarch-controlled lenders, like PrivatBank.Ms. Gontareva has protested her innocence and said bank closings during her tenure had in fact put an end to refinancing fraud in Ukraine. She said that the central bank had forwarded recommendations for criminal prosecutions for loan fraud to the authorities but that with the judicial system still largely unreformed, few cases had made it to court.\u201cSad to say, some of these loans were extended with the full knowledge that they would never be paid back,\u201d said Frank Gill, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s. \u201cThat is how things worked in the past, and Governor Gontareva had the unenviable task of cleaning that up.\u201dThe former central bank chief blamed criticism of her work in the Ukrainian media, and the death threats, on disgruntled businessmen unhappy with her efforts to close banks. She described the corruption investigation as \u201cnothing special\u201d and said it was one of several audits and reviews of the central bank.She said she had carried out tough reforms, reducing the bloated size of the central bank\u2019s staff, which at one point numbered 12,000; slashed inflation to single digits from 43 percent in 2015; and moved the country to a more flexible foreign exchange system.Ms. Gontareva said she was planning to take some time off and re-enter the private sector \u2014 she previously worked for a brokerage firm in Ukraine \u2014 adding that she hoped never to be a bureaucrat again.A former spokesman for Mr. Kolomoisky, Borys Braginsky, said in a telephone interview that he had no means of contacting the businessman. He added that Mr. Kolomoisky had not retained a new spokesman and could not be reached for comment.With so much money at stake, political pressure is mounting on the Ukrainian anticorruption watchdog, which is investigating the central bank and which last summer revealed secret payments in Ukraine to President Trump\u2019s then campaign manager, Paul J. Manafort. Rival factions in Parliament have clashed over the appointment of an outside auditor to the organization.The I.M.F. has now tightened its conditions for lending.In February, it listed the creation of an anticorruption court, free from political interference, as a benchmark for future disbursements. It said in written replies to questions that it was considering elevating some requirements from benchmarks to \u201cprior action\u201d demands, or conditions that a country must meet before the fund\u2019s board will even convene to consider releasing a new tranche of funding.There is little dispute that the central bank had to close several shaky banks in Ukraine, said Daria M. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center. But the hefty cost to Ukrainian taxpayers and Western donors, including the United States, was most likely too high because the failing banks \u2014 most disastrously PrivatBank \u2014 were refinanced shortly before they collapsed.The eventual loss from PrivatBank, Ms. Kaleniuk said, should have been obvious to the central bank before it cost donors and taxpayers billions.\u201cThis scheme could have been noticed by the central bank and by Gontareva,\u201d Ms. Kaleniuk said. \u201cThe problem is, nobody has been punished yet for such a huge fraud.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Powerful Family Business Ties Could Be Tough to Cut", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byForget Machiavelli, or \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d When it comes to staying in power, South Korea\u2019s richest business clans have the game plan down.There is the charity maneuver, in which family members park their stakes in their business empires in philanthropic nonprofits, letting them keep control without paying heavy taxes.There is the new company maneuver, in which they create new firms that strike lucrative and friendly business deals with the others they control.And then there is old-fashioned corporate engineering, in which they merge arms of their empires together to consolidate power, even as other shareholders complain.\u201cChaebol family control as we know it could end with this generation,\u201d said Kim Woochan, a professor of finance at Korea University Business School in Seoul, the South Korean capital, pointing to an intensifying backlash against inherited wealth. \u201cAn opportunity as good as this one is unprecedented.\u201dBut that could be easier said than done, South Korean officials and experts say. While the public blames the chaebol for an embarrassing series of political and business scandals and for holding back the country\u2019s once-surging economy, they continue to hold considerable political power. Their controlling families have also proved adept at finding ways to keep control, even as they face increasing challenges from inheritance taxes, unhappy outside investors and their own family squabbling.\u201cLeaders, markets, they don\u2019t change overnight,\u201d said Rhyu Sang-young, a professor of political economy at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cEvery culture has a strong legacy, inertia. It takes time.\u201dThe front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s election, Moon Jae-in, has vowed to stop families from using nonprofit foundations, complicated shareholding plans and other methods to keep control of businesses. One of his main advisers is Kim Sang-jo, an economist known for hawkish views on the chaebol.But the Democratic Party, led by Mr. Moon, holds only 119 seats in the 300-member legislature, the National Assembly. The Democrats would find it hard to get support from rival parties in passing chaebol reform bills through a fractured legislature, where a pro-business lobby also remains strong. Passing a bill will take many months of wrangling.Mr. Moon has also promised to make prosecutors more independent and to make it more difficult for a president to abuse the power of the office, limiting the ability of chaebol to collude with the authorities and escape justice. But such reforms would likely require a revision of the Constitution, which would be very difficult to pull off given the nation\u2019s fractious politics.But frustration with the chaebol has been building for years. Critics blame the conglomerates for a number of social ills, including corruption, inequality and the crowding out of smaller and potentially more innovative businesses. Shares in the chaebol trade at lower prices than they otherwise would \u2014 the so-called Korea discount \u2014 because outside investors fear founding families will shortchange them.Family shenanigans have not helped perceptions.They face other challenges \u2014 in particular, taxes. Perhaps surprisingly in a country where dynasties have persisted, inheritance taxes in South Korea are high \u2014 for the wealthy, 50 percent or more.That is where the power-preservation playbook comes in.One solution has been to transfer stakes in chaebol companies to family-controlled charities. Four foundations controlled by the Lee family hold billions of dollars worth of shares in key Samsung subsidiaries, including the smartphone maker.Another option is to ensure that chaebol heirs get rich before their parents die. That can be accomplished by setting up small companies under an heir\u2019s control, then making them bigger using the family\u2019s business connections.Critics say that is what happened at Hyundai Motor, where Chung Eui-sun, the son of the carmaker\u2019s chairman, invested in a small logistics company in 2001. The company, now called Hyundai Glovis, quickly secured lucrative contracts with Hyundai affiliates. Within a few years Hyundai Glovis and Mr. Chung were worth billions. A Hyundai spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrangement.Mr. Lee of Samsung, who is technically vice chairman but leads the conglomerate on behalf of his ill father, also benefited from maneuvers designed to preserve family power. Starting in 1996, when Mr. Lee was just 28, Samsung companies began issuing him cut-price bonds that he was later able to convert into stock, allowing him to accumulate valuable ownership stakes at a fraction of the market cost. Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, was ultimately convicted of breach of trust in connection with the deals \u2014 though he was later pardoned, and the younger Mr. Lee was allowed to keep his shares.Another maneuver is at the heart of the charges against him. The merger of two Samsung companies in 2015 made Mr. Lee the dominant shareholder in a crucial part of the Samsung empire. Mr. Lee earlier this year was accused of bribing President Park and others to push another major shareholder, the government\u2019s pension system, to approve the deal. Mr. Lee denies the charges and says he was a victim of extortion.\u201cSouth Korea has to promote the role of the institutional investor,\u201d said Professor Rhyu of Yonsei University, adding that the pension service lacked a culture of independence. \u201cThe problem is corporate governance.\u201dIn the National Assembly, political parties have sponsored several bills that would make chaebol corporate governance more transparent and make it harder for their chairmen to help enrich their children through dubious business transactions. One idea pushed by Mr. Moon is to introduce so-called cumulative voting to make it easier for candidates supported by minority shareholders to get a board seat.But any campaign to overhaul the chaebol would be vulnerable to overall economics. If the economy slows, politicians may fear that constraining the chaebol would hurt business activity.\u201cThere are people who recognize the problem, but also a lot who don\u2019t,\u201d said Professor Kim of Korea University Business School. \u201cThere are plenty of people who think, yes, there has to be an owner family involved.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Samsung Foundation of Culture\u2019s stake in Samsung Electronics. The foundation\u2019s stake is 0.03 percent, not close to 8 percent.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Jeyup S. Kwaak and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Stake in France\u2019s Election: What It Means to Be French", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPARIS \u2014 On April 23, France\u2019s voters avoided the most dangerous of traps: a red-brown runoff between two authoritarian demagogues \u2014 Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the far left and Marine Le Pen on the far right. Both offered similarly reckless policies: Exit the European Union and NATO. Adopt economic protectionism. Get cozy with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia.Ms. Le Pen \u2014 a political goddaughter, if ever there was one, to Donald Trump \u2014 remains in the running for president. But instead of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, on Sunday she must face Emmanuel Macron, a young pro-Europe centrist who is given a good chance to defeat her.He\u2019s not elected yet, but his first-place showing two weeks ago clarified the choices in France\u2019s severe crisis of identity. About half of those who voted chose Ms. Le Pen, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon or some other extreme populist. Is the strength of demagogy just another example of the populist winds blowing throughout the West? Or is France uniquely cursed \u2014 the sick man of Europe?The story behind the answer begins in 1940: France never got over its collapse after Nazi Germany\u2019s blitzkrieg and the collaboration that ensued. To be sure, Charles de Gaulle and the Resistance formed a heroic minority around which could be woven a comforting myth of greatness. In 1945, that was enough for France to be counted as one of the war\u2019s winners. It also allowed France to repress the humiliation of surrender and, after the war, to embark on ill-timed military exploits to restore its self-confidence as a global power. In Indochina and Algeria, it defended its empire, and with Britain at Suez it sought to maintain its Middle Eastern influence. But those efforts failed. By 1962, France had lost most of its overseas possessions \u2014 most notably Algeria, since 1830 the jewel in France\u2019s crown.The Algerian debacle was also repressed \u2014 again by de Gaulle. He spun a new myth of France\u2019s global importance and prepared France\u2019s economy for modernization. He and his successors gave the French atomic bombs, supermarkets, Ariane rockets and high-speed trains. Through the Cold War, they promised new frontiers for influence in Western Europe that could make up for the painful loss of empire and the trauma of 1940 \u2014 in short, a Gallocentric Europe.German reunification put an end to such illusions. With the European Union incorporating Central European countries, Germany again became the continent\u2019s epicenter. And because Germany focused on making its economy more efficient, it distanced itself from its neighbor, ensuring that Europe would never be a Grande France. Indeed, the 1990s and 2000s brought Europe a new paradigm driven increasingly by Anglo-American ideals: the market society, multicultural and neo-liberal.Here the French held their ground, clinging to their own vision of a secular, centralized welfare state. No longer the center of the world, France now swam against the current of history. An aging diva whose charms had long masked her narcissism no longer embodied modernity.And so, today\u2019s conundrum: What does it mean to be French? What is France\u2019s calling in a globalized world? No one, least of all the political elite, has had an answer. As the French mourn their past (or imagined) grandeur, the resentful among them have turned their backs on Europe and shut themselves off from the world.This identity crisis conceals yet another, now erupting to sow fear and rare violence. The place of Islam in France, a fallout from the Algerian era, has became a national neurosis. From 1954 to 1962, France waged a terrible colonial war: eight years long, fought by more than two million draftees, leaving 300,000 to 400,000 dead on the Algerian side and 25,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians among the French.The repercussions in France have been unique: A million \u201cpieds noirs\u201d returned to French cities and their European origins when hostilities ended. Hundreds of thousands of Algerians and other North Africans joined them to work in France\u2019s thriving factories. But unemployment skyrocketed during the 1970s oil crisis, just as their families gained permission to follow the workmen; this completed the reunion of all the participants in the Algerian tragedy but with little or no inclination to reconcile.Instead, memories and guilty consciences too long in the shadows re-emerged to plague all sides. Old prejudices and stereotypes \u2014 Arab, colonist, white man, noble savage \u2014 clashed. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a former paratrooper in Algeria and the father of Marine, founded the xenophobic National Front. Identity conflict arose among many of the grandchildren of 1960s and \u201970s immigrants, driving some to political Islamism.Today, most French people see their Islamist compatriots as separatists. The jihadists who attacked in 2015 and 2016 were not foreign; they were French citizens killing other French citizens.In the face of all this, France needed brave, visionary leaders; it got, as its last two presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 mediocre politicians who flaunted big words without risking ambitious reform. Mr. Sarkozy spoke of change \u2014 a shift to neo-liberalism and a reinforcement of law and order; instead, he kept the socialist 35-hour workweek and cut 10,000 employees from the police force. Mr. Hollande swore to wage \u201cwar on finance gone wild,\u201d but taxed the middle class instead.Thus, France let a decade go to waste. Unemployment and debt remain high; competitiveness and purchasing power decline. In the right-wing primaries for this election, Mr. Sarkozy was eliminated in the first round. On the left, Mr. Hollande didn\u2019t dare run.On the right, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon set out to be the white knight. A former prime minister, he made speeches with Churchillian overtones, asking sacrifices to save the land. A Catholic father of five, he vowed to be a model president. He is now suspected of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds to pay his wife for a no-show parliamentary job. For a generation or more, the motto of the French political class might have been, \u201cI serve the state so I can use the state to my own convenience.\u201dSo, on April 23, the French decided to wipe out Mr. Fillon and his Socialist rival, Beno\u00eet Hamon, the candidates of the two parties that had dominated French political life for nearly 60 years.The death of that system on April 23 left the runoff this weekend a referendum on Ms. Le Pen. Perhaps it is fortunate that her National Front is strongly nationalist and xenophobic, with a fascist past that recalls the shame of Vichy France. That may spare the French another 1940 \u2014 one more debacle.But even if it does, Mr. Macron would inherit a fractured, ungovernable France, recalling Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic. Its red and brown extremes would keep spinning their webs, refuse to help him, and wait for the Republic\u2019s final collapse. For that reason, Mr. Macron would have to quickly and decisively build a new, myth-free vision of France and its identity in Europe, working on the home front and with whoever is Germany\u2019s chancellor, as he promised to do during his campaign.That kind of cleareyed partnership could finally offer a new horizon to the bewildered French. There\u2019s still time to resolve their conundrum \u2014 by guaranteeing France a central role in a European counter-model to Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s Turkey and Mr. Trump\u2019s America.Olivier Guez, a French essayist and a scriptwriter for the film \u201cThe People vs. Fritz Bauer,\u201d is the author of a forthcoming novel about Josef Mengele.

{"Headline": "In Praise of Splatter-Painted Floors", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byBy DesignThe first time I saw splatter-painted floor was inside a simple shingled house atop a windswept dune on Nantucket. We lived there as a family only briefly, but my memory of the design is vivid. The wooden planks in the old-fashioned kitchen with its swinging door to the backyard were wide and knotty; they had been lacquered a stormy gray and dribbled with specks of turquoise, pale yellow and poppy red. Standing on those floors, we grilled blueberry muffins with butter in a cast-iron pan in the mornings; on our knees, we raced lobsters before they were tossed into a pot in the evenings. I ran the bottoms of my sunburned feet along the raised pattern of the splatter, imagining the aftermath of a rainbow-colored rainstorm or the detritus of a birthday pi\u00f1ata. It seemed as magical as the scallop shells I painted with glitter nail polish each day after the beach.I\u2019ve encountered very few splatter jobs since, always in no-nonsense summer bungalows in Massachusetts. Often referred to as \u201cspatter-dashing,\u201d the style appears to have originated in, and largely remained confined to, the rugged, unforgiving coast of Cape Cod. And to that almost-extinct, supremely special variety of summer cottage that remains unchanged from one season to the next, reassuring in its humble mustiness, impervious to trends and, most magically, time.John Derian, the artist and Manhattan boutique owner who has an encyclopedic knowledge and eye for American crafts, purchased an 18th-century captain\u2019s house in Provincetown, Mass., 10 years ago, which came with splattered floors. There is lapis blue dusted with white, black and red in a sitting room and cozy guest bedroom, and violet covered in a blizzard of green, blue, red and white dots in another parlor. \u201cWhen I first saw the floors there was no question of whether I would keep them,\u201d says the Boston-born Derian, who unearthed a 1932 book about the local architecture that has a page on the spatter-dash of Cape Cod.As an unusually whimsical artifact of Yankee heritage, the technique is a geeky aficionado\u2019s dream, complete with its own fabled beginnings that still remain a bit of a mystery. The technique was preceded by the 18th- and 19th-century practice of floor stenciling, a craft that emerged among settlers longing for carpets like those in Europe. In the early 1800s, in New England particularly, traveling stencil artisans went from village to village, using oiled paper cutouts of primitive stars, pineapples and even trompe l\u2019oeil rug designs, applying them with linseed oil or milk-based pigment paint in colors like Prussian blue, lead chromite yellow and ocher brown.That decorative urge took a wild turn around 1850. Instead of hewing to the geometric formalism of stencils, randomness began to reign, perhaps inspired by enamel kitchen \u201cspeckleware\u201d \u2014 first sold in the 1870s and still found on lobster pots and clam steamers \u2014 or the new vogue for spotted linoleum, invented in England around the same time. Or maybe splatter was simply borne out of necessity: It\u2019s a great camouflage for the pesky grains of sand that adhere to any seaside shack worth its salt.The floor patterns ran rampant on the Cape during the Colonial Revival period in the early 20th century, at the same time that the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, financed by John D. Rockefeller, captivated the nation, and tastes shifted away from fussy Victoriana. To achieve a proper splatter, \u201cThe Complete Book of Interior Decorating,\u201d a popular everywoman\u2019s guide first published in 1948, provides an illustrated how-to. After letting the base color dry fully, whack a paintbrush, dipped in the pigment of one\u2019s choice, against an iron pipe. For small dots, strike a foot away from the floor. For larger ones, add more paint and bring your brush a bit closer to the ground.You are forgiven comparisons to the methods of Jackson Pollock. He, too, worked with house paint, which he splashed and squirted \u2014 using everything from hardened brushes to basting syringes \u2014 over canvases he placed on the floor of his Long Island studio (which to this day bears his accidental splatters). Like other \u201caction painters,\u201d including de Kooning and Franz Kline, he placed value on how the work was created, not merely on the finished product. The wind-whipped New England women, who pioneered floors as vibrant and unbridled as their lives were spare and orderly, seemed to know the innate value of such a gesture. And therein, perhaps, lies the spirit of the untamed, anarchic beauty underfoot.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Czech Leader, in Power Struggle With Rival, Offers Resignation", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byPRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister offered his resignation on Tuesday, saying he could no longer work with his finance minister and political rival, a populist billionaire whose party is favored in elections set for October.The prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka, said he would meet President Milos Zeman this week to formally submit his resignation and that of the cabinet. It was not immediately clear if Mr. Zeman would accept the resignations.Mr. Babis, one of the country\u2019s wealthiest people, started a fertilizer company after the fall of Communism and, over the years, turned it into the Agrofert conglomerate, which now employs 33,000 people across a host of companies, including two newspapers, a radio station and a music channel on television.In 2011, Mr. Babis founded his own political party, ANO (the name means \u201cYes\u201d in Czech), and in the 2013 parliamentary elections, the party placed second, behind Mr. Sobotka\u2019s Social Democratic Party. The parties formed an uneasy coalition, and Mr. Babis was named finance minister.In January, the Czech establishment teamed up against Mr. Babis, enacting a law that would bar cabinet ministers from owning media companies or more than one-quarter of any company seeking government contracts or European Union subsidies.Mr. Babis responded by declaring that he would place his business holdings in a trust.The controversy involves corporate bonds that Agrofert issued in 2012 under a program that allowed buyers of the bonds to enjoy a tax exemption on the interest. Mr. Babis bought some of the bonds himself. The authorities are looking into how he obtained the money to buy the bonds, and whether he benefited improperly from the transaction.Mr. Sobotka said that Mr. Babis had set a bad example.\u201cIt is unacceptable for the finance minister not to be able to prove the origins of his property, especially since he is a member of a government that has built its program on a fight against tax evasion,\u201d Mr. Sobotka said at the news conference. \u201cIt is impossible for the government to chase small entrepreneurs when a billionaire is evading taxes.\u201dMr. Sobotka said it was a difficult decision.\u201cIf I ask the finance minister to resign, I might turn him into a martyr in the upcoming months,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cHe has been preparing for that role for the past few days already. I chose the only possible decision.\u201dPetr Fiala, the head of the center-right opposition Civic Democratic Party, ridiculed Mr. Sobotka\u2019s logic, calling it an example of \u201ccluelessness.\u201d He predicted that Mr. Sobotka would not be able to form a governing coalition without Mr. Babis\u2019s support.\u201cThe prime minister\u2019s decision is a continuation of an absurd political theater that we have been witnessing for a few months now,\u201d Mr. Fiala said in an interview. \u201cOne has to wonder how the prime minister plans to negotiate with the current coalition parties \u2014 that is with Andrej Babis, as well \u2014 about a new government without Andrej Babis.\u201dMr. Babis, for his part, said he was stunned by the decision.\u201cThe prime minister just destroyed one of the most successful governments since the Velvet Revolution,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to the nonviolent demonstrations in 1989 that eventually toppled one-party Communist rule in what was then Czechoslovakia.Mr. Babis said he had sent a letter to Mr. Sobotka explaining that he had complied with all tax laws.\u201cMr. Sobotka has never run any business of his own, so I understand it is difficult for him to comprehend the letter I sent,\u201d Mr. Babis said.Analysts said that Mr. Sobotka might have made a shrewd decision by distancing himself from Mr. Babis.Mr. Zeman, who said through a spokesman that he had no immediate comment, could reject the resignations and insist that the current cabinet stay on until the elections. Or he could ask someone other than Mr. Sobotka to try to form a caretaker government.

{"Headline": "Should Students Get \u2018Grades 13 and 14\u2019 Free of Charge?", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyFree college is a lovely, sensible notion \u2014 but countries seem capable of embracing it only when enough of their top earners pay 50 percent or more of their income in taxes. In the United States, New York is the sole state to have taken the step of offering to cover tuition at all its public colleges and universities. And even this new benefit, the Excelsior Scholarship, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law last month, helps only a small fraction of the state\u2019s residents \u2014 households earning less than $125,000 that are not already covered by financial aid \u2014 and their grants convert into loans unless graduates both live and work in the state for as many years as they benefited from the program. It also does not cover living costs.Sara Goldrick-Rab, a self-described \u201cscholar-activist\u201d who teaches higher education policy at Temple University, has a more expansive idea: Make the first two years free for everyone who attends a community college (all of which are public) or four-year state school. Directing more resources to the first two years of college would help people from lower-income families overcome the biggest barrier to their success, which is the living costs associated with housing, food, transportation and books while they attend school.\u201cWhen students are able to focus on college, and not work, they graduate,\u201d Goldrick-Rab told me recently. The federal government currently gives tens of billions of dollars in grants and subsidies each year to private colleges and for-profit trade schools in the United States, despite the fact that public colleges educate three-quarters of the students pursuing a postsecondary degree. \u201cI say let the privates and for-profits fend for themselves,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says, and put that money instead toward what she sometimes calls Grades 13 and 14.Finishing high school might once have provided enough education to find employment that pays well. But globalization and automation are decimating those jobs. Even manufacturing work that remains in (or returns) to America requires knowing how to operate the computers that run today\u2019s factory floors, at least if you expect to earn anything close to a living wage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do almost any job now without a 13th or 14th year of schooling,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says. The establishment of universal high school in the early 20th century helped the United States economy surge past those of countries in Europe and elsewhere that lacked a similar educational standard. Making 14th grade the new 12th grade might be essential if the United States is to maintain its status as an economic powerhouse.In 2015, someone in the United States who had no more than a high-school diploma earned about $35,600 on average. By comparison, an associate degree from a two-year college translated into $44,000. A graduate from a four-year college averaged just under $65,500. Is it any wonder that the children of the working poor take on frightening amounts of debt in pursuit of post-secondary-school degrees?Low-income students used to be able to go to college for close to free. In the early 1970s, the federal Pell grant \u2014 created to help those of modest means continue their education beyond high school \u2014 covered more than the entire cost of community college and about 90 percent of what it took to attend a four-year state school, including room, board and books. Nowadays, a full Pell grant, worth $5,815 this academic year, pays for less than one-third of the annual cost of a four-year public institution. Even after grants and scholarships, the typical family making less than $30,000 needs to pay 77 percent of its income to cover the costs of a four-year public college, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit advocacy group.Goldrick-Rab, a sociologist by training, started thinking about fixes for the price of higher education around 2008, when she started following 3,000 Pell recipients who entered a community college or publicly financed four-year program in Wisconsin. Six years into her project, only half of them had completed their studies. The subjects whom Goldrick-Rab featured in her book \u201cPaying the Price\u201d last year worked so many hours just to cover their bills that most of them never had a chance. \u201cCommunity college is where the working class gets stuck,\u201d Goldrick-Rab says. \u201cIt\u2019s where the lower middle class gets stuck.\u201dBarack Obama understood the importance of community colleges, which teach one-quarter of the country\u2019s undergraduates, when he floated the idea in 2015 of making them free. So did the Republican governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, when he signed a bill in 2014 that made community college tuition-free for recent high school graduates. (This month, the Legislature approved his plan to expand the benefit to those 24 and older.) If nothing else, the Great Recession underscored the importance of all those job-specific associate degrees and certificates \u2014 typically granted for programs that can be completed in less than two years \u2014 offered by community colleges. An astonishing 99 percent of the jobs created during the recovery, according to a 2016 report by Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, \u201chave gone to workers with at least some college education.\u201d Anthony P. Carnevale, the center\u2019s director, says as an example that available jobs in the health care support field have meant that those studying to be an occupational therapy assistant or radiology technician often earn more on average than those with a bachelor\u2019s degree. The same holds true, he adds, for a recent graduate who earned a certificate in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. \u201cWe found 30 million jobs in the economy that begin at $35,000 a year and offer a career pathway but don\u2019t require a B.A.,\u201d Carnevale says.Goldrick-Rab first laid out her free-college idea in a 2014 paper she wrote with Nancy Kendall, who teaches education policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIf you complete a high-school degree,\u201d the authors proposed, \u201cyou can obtain a 13th and 14th year of education for free in exchange for a modest amount of work while attending school.\u201d They identified large pools of federal dollars allocated to higher education that could be tapped to pay for their plan. This money includes the $5 billion in Pell grants that ended up in the coffers of for-profit colleges during the 2015-16 academic year and another $5 billion that went to private colleges and universities, which Goldrick-Rab argues can use their endowments and other scholarship funds to offset lost federal dollars.Under Goldrick-Rab and Kendall\u2019s plan, municipalities and states are responsible for covering living expenses \u201cequivalent to 15 hours of work a week paid at the living wage in the region\u201d \u2014 more than $10,000 a year in places like New York with a high cost of living. That\u2019s probably a pie-in-the-sky prescription, but Goldrick-Rab points to the possibility of public-private partnerships. The National School Lunch Program already helps feed kids through the 12th grade. Why not expand it to cover students in their first two years of college? Goldrick-Rab and Kendall also call for a significant scaling up of the Federal Work-Study program to help students cover their expenses.One reason is that treating the first two years of college as an extension of high school would probably generate wider support than a plan meant only for the needy. Offering a benefit to everyone proved to be crucial a few years ago when New York\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, sold the notion of universal prekindergarten, or \u201cPre-K for All,\u201d on the basis of its availability to rich and poor alike. Bipartisan support for two free years of college might be more likely if presented as a universal benefit \u2014 and one critical to the country\u2019s economic competitiveness, internationally speaking.Two years of free college is not a panacea. Not everyone is cut out for it, and the barriers to success often go beyond the time needed to study. Yet making the 13th and 14th years of schooling more accessible, as Goldrick-Rab and Kendall propose, would give more people hope, at least, in an economy that now pretty much requires skills well beyond the ones taught in high school.Gary Rivlin is a former Times reporter and an Investigative Fund fellow at the Nation Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Replacement for Obamacare Is Medicaid", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorIn defending their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Republican leaders in Congress argue that the insurance marketplaces created by the law are failing. They aren\u2019t completely wrong.The Republican plan to replace Obamacare would do little to stabilize the exchanges. But there is a better way to provide insurance to the 11 million beneficiaries of Obamacare plans: Allow them to buy into the Medicaid system. For President Trump, \u201cMedicaid for more\u201d would be both good policy and good politics.Let\u2019s start with a political puzzle. Why has Medicaid become the nation\u2019s largest health insurance program, with over 70 million enrollees, even though both conservatives and liberals criticize it? First, it has surprisingly strong support from hospitals and nursing homes, insurers and states, which receive federal funds to help finance care. Second, since Medicaid is administered in different ways by different states, it cannot be labeled a monolithic national program. Third, its cost is shared among federal, state and local governments. Finally, Medicaid works: It provides access to good-quality care for low-wage Americans and more secure funding for the medical safety net.So why does Medicaid have a bad reputation in both parties? The answer is that both conservatives and liberals buy into a series of Medicaid myths.Another myth is that states need more freedom to develop innovative Medicaid policies. But states already have flexibility to shape their programs, and the Trump administration could give them even more without changing the law. Indeed, nearly every state is experimenting with novel approaches to the delivery of care, benefits packages and provider payments. This means New York can pay immigrant-aid organizations to provide health screenings, while Indiana experiments with high-deductible plans and health savings accounts.The notion that Medicaid is a \u201cbig government\u201d program is yet another myth. More than 60 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in private managed-care plans now. Medicaid is actually a successful public-private partnership.Some liberals have proposed using Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly and disabled, as the basis for providing universal health insurance. But Medicaid is the better fit. It has a more generous benefits package, is less costly and is developing more innovative care-management strategies. Moreover, the integration of the Obamacare exchanges into Medicaid would be relatively seamless: Many health plans are already in both markets.Of course Medicaid is not perfect. Doctors and hospitals complain about low reimbursements, beneficiaries often have trouble finding high-quality care, and the stigma of the program as being a form of welfare persists. In reality, however, the program is much more than that, providing care to children, seniors, the working poor and welfare recipients.President Trump has consistently argued that he will ensure decent coverage for all. He even praised the Australian system of universal coverage on the same day the House voted to replace the Affordable Care Act with a program that would cut Medicaid by $880 billion over a decade and end the law\u2019s extension of Medicaid coverage to more people.Moderates in both parties recognize that the chance of success for an insurance marketplace that serves only the self-employed, part-time workers and small businesses, as Obamacare does now, is small. So why not eliminate the insurance exchanges \u2014 enabling Mr. Trump to claim he \u201crepealed\u201d Obamacare \u2014 while allowing exchange beneficiaries to buy into Medicaid, using tax credits to pay the premiums. Recent surveys showing that Medicaid beneficiaries are generally satisfied with their coverage, more so than their exchange counterparts, makes the case even more persuasive.The conservative House Freedom Caucus would surely object if President Trump endorsed \u201cMedicaid for more,\u201d but moderates on both sides of the aisle might join him. The result would be better health coverage for more Americans and a clear path toward an American version of affordable coverage for all.Michael S.

{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan Will Not Bolster Growth, Economists Say", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says the perfect medicine for the economy\u2019s sluggish growth is a big tax cut.Mr. Trump and his advisers say that leaving more money in the hands of businesses and consumers will lead to more spending and investment, lifting economic growth, which has been stuck in a 2-percent-a-year rut.Indeed, the Trump administration insists its tax plan will be so good for growth that the federal government won\u2019t even lose any revenue. The government will simply get a smaller share of a much larger pie.But a range of economists, both conservative and liberal, are highly skeptical that a tax cut is the cure for what ails the economy. They say Mr. Trump has little opportunity to increase economic growth in the next few years because the economy is already growing about as fast as it can. The government\u2019s focus, they say, should be on raising the economy\u2019s speed limit, for example, by encouraging investments that increase productivity.Indeed, by some estimates, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could reduce economic growth \u2014 although such estimates necessarily involve a large dollop of guesswork because the administration has provided few details.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of this should be thought of as increasing short-term growth,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. He said he remained hopeful, however, that congressional Republicans would push for a different set of changes that could improve the nation\u2019s long-term economic prospects.But the benefits are likely to be limited, in part because the nation\u2019s economic circumstances are different now than in the early 1980s or the early 2000s. The recession that began in 2007 was long and deep, but it has been followed by one of the longest periods of uninterrupted growth in American history.When the economy is struggling, cutting taxes can increase spending by leaving consumers and businesses with more money to spend. That increased demand is valuable when unemployment is high; it puts people back to work.But during periods of low unemployment, tax cuts can actually be damaging to the economy. If companies find it difficult to respond to the additional demand for goods and services by hiring workers and increasing output, the result is likely to be higher prices rather than faster economic growth.The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in April, a low level that most economists regard as the normal churn of people moving among jobs. Some economists argue that stronger growth could persuade more people to start looking for work. But that debate is academic because the Federal Reserve is in the first camp. Fed officials have said that if fiscal policy makers step on the gas by cutting taxes, the Fed is likely to step on the brakes by raising interest rates more quickly.\u201cI think well-designed tax reform could add to economic growth\u201d in the long term, said Jason Furman, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who served as chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cBut poorly designed, deficit-increasing tax reforms are as likely to reduce growth as they are to add to growth.\u201dEconomists see little short-term benefit in a tax cut, but they think the government could strengthen long-term growth by focusing on the right problem: productivity.The speed limit on economic growth depends how much more every American worker produces. The Fed estimates the economy can expand at a sustainable pace of around 1.8 percent a year \u2014 close to the actual pace since 2010.\u201cIt means that right up front the business is seeing a payoff in sticking money into something that will make it bigger and more productive in the future,\u201d Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.Even the rosiest estimates of the potential benefits of such changes fall well short of creating the economic growth necessary to offset the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.Mr. Furman said he thought he could write a tax code that would increase annual economic growth by about 0.3 percent. Over a decade, that\u2019s enough to add about $1,500 to the average family\u2019s income.Others are slightly more optimistic. The Tax Foundation thinks 0.4 percent is a reasonable estimate of the best case. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that he regarded 0.5 percent as an upper bound on the potential benefits.But that is still only about half the growth required by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan. And that is as good as it gets. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone remotely sane or credible that would put a number higher than that,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC, Fighting Market Forces, Extends Production Cuts", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe earlier announcement helped lift prices from a low of $46. But on Thursday, prices slipped nearly 4 percent, to around $53.The markets followed a similar path in September, when OPEC, with Russia and other nations, initially outlined plans for reductions. When the euphoria faded, prices slumped.\u201cOPEC is being caught in a pincer movement of technology and policy that will, over time, erode oil use,\u201d said Bill Farren-Price, chief executive of Petroleum Policy Intelligence, an advisory firm for hedge funds and other investors. \u201cThis meeting is more about forestalling an oil price collapse than driving prices higher.\u201dHere are some factors muting the impact of the cuts to output.Oil prices that topped $100 a barrel as recently as 2014 may have helped plant the seeds that are now weakening OPEC.But fracking has required substantial investment. When oil prices plummeted in 2015 and 2016, output from shale in the United States fell about 900,000 barrels a day, equivalent to almost 1 percent of the global supply.The American shale industry today, however, is far more efficient. And unlike in previous years, it has an array of sources of capital to finance the drilling of new wells, including advance sales of oil, bank and private loans, and high-yield bonds.When prices are down, that money dries up. But when prices tick up around $52 a barrel, activity ramps up quickly, according to Roger Diwan, a vice president at IHS Financial Services, which advises investors.Khalid A. al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said on Thursday that he foresaw a healthy comeback for American shale production, but he played down its effect on OPEC\u2019s efforts.Still, the bloc\u2019s biggest worry is such a revival, presenting it with a thorny problem as it considers its own market moves.\u201cThe higher the price goes, the more shale operators accelerate production, and the more OPEC has to cut,\u201d said Mr. Diwan, who forecast that United States shale operators would increase their output by about 900,000 barrels a day this year, soaking up much of OPEC\u2019s production cuts.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.A few years ago, high energy prices were sustained by a belief that the supply of oil was reaching a peak, but demand \u2014 driven by fast-growing economies like China and India \u2014 would keep rising.The trends are shifting, and fast. Not only does there seem to be a major new source of oil from shale, but growth in demand is slowing.In particular, the increasing number of electric vehicles is playing a role in limiting demand for oil. Their impact may grow with the development of cars run by computers.Mr. Helm, the author of a new book, \u201cBurn Out,\u201d on the decline of fossil fuels, argues that, given oil\u2019s uncertain future, $50 a barrel could turn out to be a \u201cvery high\u201d price.Even some big oil companies are accepting the view that demand for fossil fuels may soon decline.OPEC seems finally to be paying attention, too. Mr. Falih said on Thursday that the bloc needed to better understand the impact the 2015 Paris deal on climate change would have on oil demand.In decades past, an OPEC decision to curb or increase production had wide consequences and would move markets.That is no longer the case.\u201cOPEC has used Band-Aids to get through crises of the moment,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at the research firm IHS Energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear they are willing or able to address the larger issues of the global market.\u201dWith that in mind, Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, brought in Russia and other producers outside the cartel to lend clout to the recent production cuts. Riyadh has also suggested changes to OPEC\u2019s internal management, pushing the organization to better cooperate with other producers. OPEC, Mr. Falih said, \u201cneeds to evolve\u201d and needs to \u201cbe part of the debate, rather than simply reacting to what is going on.\u201dOn Thursday, the bloc announced that Equatorial Guinea, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers, had joined OPEC, becoming its 14th member.But presenting a united front with such a variety of players has proved complex.Disunity already has occurred within the bloc. Member countries like Iraq and Iran contend they are entitled to higher production because of years of revenue lost to conflict and sanctions, and will probably press for increases to their output allocations.A disconnect exists between the announced level of the cuts and the actual reductions.Knowing that cuts were on the horizon, OPEC members increased production before they were made, which meant they were starting from an artificially high base. Several members have also been selling from their stockpiles of crude, blunting the impact of the reductions.IHS Markit, for instance, estimates that OPEC countries trimmed output by 1.1 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2017, but exports fell by only 900,000 barrels a day.Signs suggest that the oil glut is easing, but its persistence has undermined OPEC\u2019s ability to affect the markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Tuition? Tennessee Could Tutor New York", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported bySMYRNA, Tenn. \u2014 A high school assembly changed Nicole-Lynn Riel\u2019s life.In the fall of 2014, as Ms. Riel, a senior, was applying for jobs at Red Lobster, J. C. Penney and Target, a speaker came to her school to talk about a new state program, Tennessee Promise, that would pay the tuition for all students at the state\u2019s community colleges.When the speaker said school would be free for everyone, Ms. Riel said, she \u201cperked up and said, \u2018What?\u2019\u201dThis month, Ms. Riel graduated from Motlow State Community College here, and she will soon start working toward her bachelor\u2019s degree at a four-year school.Her journey is an increasingly familiar one in Tennessee, and one that a growing number of states are trying to replicate with programs that pay tuition, usually at the community college level, for a broad number of students.In Tennessee, where Ms. Riel and other members of Tennessee\u2019s first cohort of scholarship recipients graduate this spring, community college enrollment numbers are up by a third, while the amount that students are having to borrow from the federal government is down, though it is unclear what effect the money is having on on-time graduation, a key goal of the New York plan.And at least some of the state\u2019s four-year colleges have faced declining enrollment, as more students use community college as a steppingstone to a four-year degree. That experience may offer valuable lessons and caveats to New York and other places.\u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged by the early results,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, a Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t know I would say, \u2018Andrew, you should have done it this way,\u2019 but I would salute him for trying to find a solution that works for New York.\u201dUnder Mr. Haslam\u2019s immediate predecessor, Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, the state changed its higher-education funding formula to reward colleges for, among other goals, successfully shepherding more students toward graduation.Enrollment at community and technology colleges for first-time freshmen has climbed by 30 percent. And a majority of Tennessee Promise students who began at a community college in the fall of 2015 were still in school this year, compared with fewer than half of those who were not Promise recipients, according to the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s a good model in terms of how much work you have to do in terms of implementation to get this to work,\u201d said William Doyle, an associate professor of public policy and higher education at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. \u201cThe messaging, the branding, the community outreach.\u201dAt Antioch High School in south Nashville, where roughly three-quarters of the mostly minority population qualifies for free or reduced-price lunches, signs urging students to sign up for the program are ubiquitous, and college acceptance letters are taped to the wall in the hallways.Previously, \u201cthe mind-set of the building was, \u2018Our kids don\u2019t go to college \u2014 they go to work,\u2019\u201d said Stephanie Ridley, a Spanish teacher. \u201cBut if you tell kids they can go to college, they will.\u201dMany Antioch students said they saw the program as a way to save money by going to community college for two years free before transferring to a four-year university.Other students appear to feel likewise. Across the state, freshman enrollment at four-year institutions has been flat, or down, since the advent of the Promise program.\u201cNo longer can we be complacent that students will arrive because they always have,\u201d said Brian Noland, the president of East Tennessee State University, where freshman enrollment declined by 3 percent in the first year of the Promise program. \u201cIt\u2019s really forced universities to think about here\u2019s what differentiates a university degree from other experiences.\u201dUnder the program, students must enroll full time for the fall semester after graduating from high school. Once they qualify, scholarship recipients must complete eight hours of community service per semester and maintain a 2.0 grade point average or better.Recipients are also obligated to stay in New York for as many years as they received the awards, or risk having the grant be converted into a loan \u2014 a requirement that Tennessee officials and educators worried could be counterproductive.\u201cI\u2019m not sure that isn\u2019t a solution in search of a problem,\u201d said Mike Krause, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission. \u201cFine print is the enemy, and having the fine print say that your grant could become a loan could erode trust.\u201dIn both states, some believe that programs would be more effective if they helped low-income students cover books and other expenses instead of just tuition, which often can be paid by other aid.Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, said more money should be set aside for merit-based aid such as the state\u2019s Hope Scholarships.\u201cThe Promise plan is just the opposite of what a scholarship should be: It gives the most money to the least qualified and the least meritorious,\u201d he said.\u201cNew York is on track to offer tuition-free college to all middle-class students starting this fall, and with the largest and most inclusive free college program in the country, we are encouraged by Tennessee\u2019s achievement and look forward to seeing the Excelsior program succeed,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo.One recent graduate, Italia Joseph, 20, said she had originally been skeptical about college because her father had railed against student debt.\u201cHe was always talking about money, money, money, and it seemed like only rich kids went to school,\u201d she said.But the Promise money and a Pell grant covered the annual bill of more than $4,000 for tuition and mandatory fees. She studied criminal justice, and hopes to work as a crime scene investigator.Ms. Riel \u2014 who first learned about the program at her high school assembly \u2014 is also looking ahead. She plans to enroll at Middle Tennessee State University in the fall, and wants to become an elementary school teacher.Her mother, Jacqueline Willison, speaking before the weekend\u2019s graduation ceremony, said her daughter was the first member of the family to earn a postsecondary degree.\u201cIt was such a great blessing,\u201d she said, choking up. \u201cFinally, a glimmer of hope. I\u2019m very proud of her.\u201d At graduation, she went on, \u201cI\u2019m going to need a box of Kleenex.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the elective office held by Steve Cohen.

{"Headline": "With Italy No Longer in U.S. Focus, Russia Swoops to Fill the Void", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 President Trump made the most of his short time in Italy. He was treated to a private audience with the pope, met with both the country\u2019s president and its prime minister in Rome, flew to Sicily for a summit meeting of world leaders and visited with American troops at a nearby naval air station.But as the sudden burst of diplomatic activity subsided with his departure, European and American officials fear a return to the new normal of American inattention as the administration struggles with political turmoil and Russia-related scandals back home.All the while, Russia is assiduously courting Italy, a country that once had the largest Communist party outside the Soviet bloc and that many analysts consider the soft underbelly of the European Union.In Rome, Mr. Trump left behind an embassy without an ambassador, and forfeited a geopolitical playing field that Moscow\u2019s ambassador in Rome, Sergey Razov, is exploiting.A deliberate, gray-haired career diplomat, Mr. Razov has been plugging away at building relationships with Italian politicians, organizing concerts for Italy\u2019s earthquake survivors and visiting Italian regional officials who lament the \u201cunfair\u201d sanctions on Russia \u2014 which Moscow dearly wants lifted.Next month, Mr. Razov will offer a sumptuous buffet when he hosts the annual Russia Day celebration amid the dripping chandeliers, coffered ceilings and gilded interiors of his Villa Abamelek residence.Like Mr. Razov\u2019s energetic diplomacy, much of Russia\u2019s relationship building is being done in plain sight, as when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia hosted Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni this month in Sochi, and President Sergio Mattarella a few weeks before that in Moscow.But there is a fear among Italian, European and American officials that Russia is also using the same kind of behind-the-scenes influence and news media obfuscation it has employed in the United States and elsewhere, creating a tilt in Italy toward Moscow.Russia \u201chas invested a lot in influencing public opinion in this country,\u201d said Celia Kuningas-Saagpakk, the Estonian ambassador to Italy. She previously worked in her country\u2019s Foreign Ministry, where she covered Russia and monitored its strategies and propaganda tactics in Ukraine and elsewhere.The effects of Russian attempts to influence Italy can already be seen. Long shaky, Italian politicians across the spectrum, ever mindful of business ties and energy deals, are wobbling more than ever on the hard line the European Union has taken toward Moscow since its land grab in Ukraine in 2014.The enforcer of that tough-minded approach has been Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has acted as Europe\u2019s main liaison with Russia. But the erosion of her relationship with Mr. Putin over Russia\u2019s meddling in Ukraine has created a breach that many in Italy hope their country will step into.The Five Star Movement has called for a referendum on Italy\u2019s inclusion in the eurozone, an end to sanctions on Russia and a de facto geopolitical shift away from the United States and toward Russia.At a recent unveiling of their foreign policy platform in Parliament, Five Star Movement leaders depicted Russia as a strategic partner that had been unfairly punished, and the United States as an abusive ally whose 70-year relationship with Italy had run its course.\u201cThere\u2019s a limit,\u201d Manlio Di Stefano, the head of the Five Star Movement\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said about Italy\u2019s post-World War II alliance with the United States.Mr. Di Stefano said he had met Ambassador Razov, who declined an interview for this article.On the Five Star Movement\u2019s popular blog, Mr. Di Stefano wrote in a recent post that NATO was secretly preparing a \u201cfinal assault\u201d on Russia.In an interview, he argued that his party had opposed the sanctions on Russia to alleviate the suffering of Italian businesses and lamented that the once-promising Mr. Trump had proved to be a disappointing pawn of the military-industrial complex.\u201cHe said he wanted to improve relations with Russia and stabilize the Mediterranean,\u201d Mr. Di Stefano said. \u201cThen he started bombing\u201d Syria, which is an ally of Russia.Soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Beppe Grillo, a co-founder and leader of the Five Star Movement, and many members of the party celebrated his victory as a finger in the establishment\u2019s eye, and party leaders expressed approval of Mr. Trump\u2019s kind words about Mr. Putin.But as Mr. Trump\u2019s position on Russia has become more ambiguous and tense, a latent anti-American sentiment in the Five Star Movement has surfaced.Many of the movement\u2019s leaders attended a conference organized last month by Davide Casaleggio \u2014 a major, if quiet, power in the Five Star Movement, whose internet firm spread the Sputnik Italia content. Mr. Grillo sat with the mayor of Rome and other leading party members, applauding speakers who have promoted conspiracy theories about the C.I.A. as they cheered the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the stage.On the sideline, Alessandro Di Battista, a party leader, said the era of Italian subservience to the United States was over. His party, he said, would seek to move Italy away from the United States and toward Russia \u201cto a more equidistant point\u201d once it came to power.In 2014, the Five Star Movement went from criticizing Mr. Putin for his human rights abuses to championing his leadership.That about-face raised suspicion among government officials in the United States and Europe that the party had received Russian financial assistance (\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d Mr. Di Battista said) or electoral assistance through fake news and propaganda through Sputnik. (\u201cRAI does a lot more fake news than Sputnik in this moment,\u201d Mr. Di Stefano said, referring to the Italian state broadcaster.)No evidence of the Five Star Movement\u2019s receiving funds from Russia has surfaced.Still, some American and European officials see Mr. Putin\u2019s invisible hand in the shifting allegiances.\u201cWe are aware that Putin is trying to weaken the E.U. and the institutions,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, a Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s done the same thing in Italy and other places.\u201dThe Trump administration, which is considering Lew Eisenberg, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman, for the ambassadorship in Rome, declined to comment about Italy\u2019s place in its worldview or the notion that inattention risked giving an edge to Russia.But the American absence has been noted. During a recent visit to the Vatican, Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia, met with Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the foreign minister of the Holy See, which declined to comment about the meeting.\u201cGallagher was very interested in talking about Russia,\u201d Mr. Kaine said in an interview. He recalled that he had brought up and discussed with the archbishop doubts that European allies had about relying on assistance from the United States since America had not protected itself from Russian influence.\u201cIf the U.S. is leaving a vacuum,\u201d Mr. Kaine recalled Archbishop Gallagher saying generally about Europe and beyond, \u201cthat\u2019s going to be filled by somebody, and a lot of that somebody these days is Russia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian Voter\u2019s Plea: Stop Saying \u2018Death to America\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 As a college student studying mechanics, Hamidreza Faraji had expected after graduation to land a steady job with a fixed salary, a pension plan and the occasional bonus. He envisioned coming home at 6 p.m. to his family and vacationing at a resort on the Caspian Sea.But Mr. Faraji, 34, has long since given up on all that. These days, he said, the only people who lead such predictable lives are government employees. Their jobs are well paid and offer security, but are hard to get in part because older employees stay on well past retirement age, limiting opportunities for the next generation.So millions of Iranians, particularly younger ones, find themselves caught like Mr. Faraji in a vicious cycle of hidden poverty, an exhausting hustle to stay afloat, working multiple jobs and running moneymaking schemes just to keep up. The youth unemployment rate is 30 percent.\u201cSeeking opportunities, and trying to make the best of them,\u201d Mr. Faraji said when asked about how he supported himself and his wife. A baby is on the way \u2014 \u201cthat just happened\u201d \u2014 but they have no idea how they are going to pay for the additional costs with the money he makes as a small-time trader.To many in the outside world, Iran seems to be riding high, its coffers replenished with billions of dollars it received after reaching a nuclear agreement with foreign powers. International businesses have been swarming into the country, seemingly eager to clinch deals.The government is throwing its weight around regionally as well, lending political and military support to Shiite groups and governments in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and extending its influence eastward into Afghanistan. In fiery speeches, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, boasts of Iran\u2019s far-reaching impact.The Trump administration has expressed deep concerns about Iran\u2019s expanding power, with the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, saying recently, \u201cEverywhere you look if there is trouble in the region, you find Iran.\u201dBut with a presidential election coming Friday, many middle-class Iranians see things in a different way. Disillusioned and cynical, they are frustrated by years of high unemployment, inflation that eats relentlessly into living standards and widespread corruption.And they are frustrated with a state widely regarded as ossified and out of touch, a mixture of a quasi-socialist economy dominated by the military and clergy, and elective institutions supervised by conservative clerical bodies that have the final say on legislation and candidates for political office.Veterans of the 1979 revolution, like Ayatollah Khamenei, are still in charge, reinforcing a rigid revolutionary ideology and doing their best to resist pressures for change. With no obvious younger generation of leaders, the country also faces a looming succession crisis.While foreign investors often are said to be intent on doing deals, it is unclear whether they will help start an economic boom. With few exceptions, they are signing memorandums of understanding, not actual contracts.Many are concerned that the Trump administration could penalize big international banks that choose to do business in Iran, if they are deemed to violate nonnuclear American sanctions still in force against the country.Only big banks can provide the large-scale financing needed for the major, job-creating infrastructure projects that Iran desperately needs.He accomplished the nuclear pact, but the economic benefits have been meager at best. Instead, Iranians, many of them college graduates, are working longer and harder just to make ends meet.For Mr. Faraji, that means selling honey and saffron to supermarkets and running a cosmetics shop. To survive in a brutally competitive marketplace, he has to keep an eye out for the police while he buys smuggled products, pays bribes, intimidates delinquent bill payers and devises schemes to dupe store owners into buying his products.He counts himself lucky, in some respects. He says he has avoided doing any smuggling himself, or resorting to other illegal activities like selling alcohol or organizing mixed weddings, where men and women dance with one another \u2014 all common in Iran\u2019s underground economy.Some afternoons his wife joins him at his shop. Otherwise, they would never see each other. \u201cI go to sleep at 1 a.m. and leave the house at 6 a.m.,\u201d Mr. Faraji said.Most of the time, he tries not to think about why his life has become such a struggle, he said. But in his heart he knows: \u201cEverything has ground to a halt. We\u2019re moving back, rather than forward.\u201dStill, he explained, he would be voting for Mr. Rouhani, saying he would choose \u201cthe least-bad candidate to prevent an even worse situation.\u201dMr. Faraji\u2019s workday begins around 6:30, when he feeds his two caged songbirds, settles behind his desk in a run-down house and starts working the phones, pressing for unpaid bills and checking with his field representatives.In the struggle to move the honey and saffron, Mr. Faraji has resorted to an age-old scheme, sending his team into supermarkets across the city asking for the brands he has amassed, hoping to build a market for them. The next day, he sends his employees out again, each to a different store, offering to sell the products they had asked for the day before.But as they gathered around Mr. Faraji\u2019s desk on a recent morning, it was clear that business was not going well.\u201cThe supermarkets aren\u2019t buying anything,\u201d said Hassan Seyedi, 29, who moved from the western city of Kermanshah to Tehran, the capital, a year ago in search of work.Across from him sat Mehdi Khanzadeh, 27. Mr. Khanzadeh was lucky, the others said, in that he worked two days a week for Iranian state television, a position he had secured through a family contact.\u201cI studied architecture, but there are no jobs,\u201d he said, adding that like many Iranians in their 20s and 30s, he still lives with his parents. He said he often fell short of the $750 a month he needed to scrape by, but \u201cat least I have some steady income.\u201dThe young men laid out how they saw the facts. Business was bad, and if the shopkeepers ordered anything, it was in small quantities and they refused to pay in advance.\u201cGive them a reasonable bribe, if necessary, so that they take our honey,\u201d Mr. Faraji advised. \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about payment later.\u201dAlso in the room was a bulky man with a mustache: Mr. Faraji\u2019s debt collector. There is rarely a need to rough people up, the man said, because \u201cusually they pay when I come over.\u201dIran\u2019s Ministry of Labor counts every Iranian who works at least one hour a week as employed. There is no welfare for the long-term unemployed, but laid-off workers get some unemployment insurance. By the official figures, which economists say understate the problem, eight million Iranians are jobless, and only half of Iran\u2019s educated women ever find a job.At the same time, the government, seeking to provide some sort of safety net in hard economic times, is running fat: It employs around 8.5 million people, out of a national population of just 80 million. But those highly sought-after jobs are difficult for younger Iranians to even hope for.For Mr. Faraji, the day was barely half-done when at 11 a.m. he shared a taxi to the shopping center where he had recently rented a tiny space to sell perfumes and cosmetics. Most of his merchandise is smuggled into the country, often by powerful groups related to security organizations, he said. While technically illegal, it is a common practice, the only way to avoid a hefty official import tax.In the mostly empty mall, the only sound was the odd crackle of an escalator.Whether it\u2019s honey or perfumes, Mr. Faraji concluded, prices are too high and no one is buying. Like many Iranians, he blamed politicians and an ideology that has left roughly 80 percent of the economy under state ownership.\u201cOur leaders need money, so they raise the prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to spend money in Syria, in Yemen and Iraq to defend their ideology. We are paying.\u201dThe ideology, a mix of anti-Western socialism and a rigid interpretation of Islam, is widely regarded as outdated. Mr. Faraji is not alone in calling it a drag on the economy or in throwing up his hands in frustration.\u201cStop saying, \u2018Death to America,\u2019 make amends with the world and foreign investors and jobs will come,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be realistic: That will not happen.\u201dNot everyone is so jaded. Many in Iran\u2019s moderate and reformist faction are guardedly optimistic that the country is changing, albeit in fits and starts, and always subject to reversals by hard-liners.One of those optimists, Mahmoud Sadeghi, a former cleric and son of a famous ayatollah, now wears a suit as a member of Parliament and takes to Twitter as he probes corruption among the ruling elite.In the parliamentary elections of 2016, reformists and moderates gained a small majority, which they have used to attack problems like corruption that discourage economic initiatives.Mr. Sadeghi and other reformists note that, largely under the radar, Iran has changed a great deal over the years, in some ways resembling many Western societies. After roughly 20 years of the internet, satellite television and affordable foreign travel, Iranians have grown more sophisticated, educated and moderate, and less pious.Iran\u2019s aging leaders have been forced to give ground, tolerating changes they can no longer prevent. Gone are the days when police officers would raid rooftops to remove illegal satellite dishes. Most Iranians can now watch more than 150 foreign-based Persian language channels, while state television, heavily salted with lectures by conservative clerics, is increasingly ignored.\u201cWe are successful in bringing change, as otherwise I would not be sitting in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Sadeghi said, referring to his status as a corruption fighter.In November, Mr. Sadeghi gave a speech in Parliament accusing the head of the judiciary, Sadegh Amoli-Larijani, of maintaining a secret bank account to collect diverted public funds. After the speech, representatives of the judiciary tried to arrest him, but were stopped when dozens of people gathered in front of his house to protect him.Nevertheless, change for Mr. Sadeghi and many within Iran\u2019s establishment means altering existing law, not overhauling Iran\u2019s political system and establishment.And that change is halting. For instance, in 2016, Parliament passed a measure that would have made women eligible for top political positions, only to have it blocked by the 12-member Guardian Council \u2014 now led by a 90-year-old hard-liner, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati \u2014 which reviews all new laws to ensure they are properly \u201cIslamic.\u201dParliament\u2019s attempts to make it easier for women to obtain a divorce and more difficult for men to take a second wife were similarly rejected by the council, which also vets candidates for elections.This, too, has consequences for the economy, as obscure laws enacted after the revolution in 1979 remain on the books, often used by ideologues or unscrupulous officials to undermine business ventures that in most other countries would be brilliant successes.Take, for example, Sohrab Mostaghim, 28, and some of his friends, all graduates of Tehran\u2019s best universities, who designed a treasure hunt set in the city\u2019s most popular park. Soon, hundreds of people were happily paying the equivalent of $11 each to play the game, based on riddles and questions embedded in an app on their mobile phones.But when they told a manager of the park what was going on, they were blindsided by his reaction.\u201cInstead of welcoming the extra visitors and this fun game, he pressured us, claiming our promotional video was against Islam, since at the end the brother and sister hug,\u201d Mr. Mostaghim said. Physical contact between men and women in public is officially forbidden in Iran, but the rules are widely flouted in the larger cities.Ultimately, the partners felt they had to shut the game down, whereupon the manager changed his tune.\u201cNow, he is asking us for bribes to allow us to use the park,\u201d Mr. Mostaghim said. \u201cWe are not even sure if he will really allow us if we pay.\u201dThe whole idea of a start-up is to embrace freedom to think and create, he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have that here.\u201dEven established businesses that suffered during the years of sanctions are finding it difficult to recapture lost customers. For Bahram Shahriyari, 58, the prospect of lifting international sanctions after the nuclear deal was a faint light at the end of what had become a dark tunnel.Until the sanctions were imposed, he had owned a business providing parts and components for new and used vehicles made by Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn of France, one of the most prominent foreign brands in the country. At its peak just four years ago, his company had 400 employees and even exported parts to France.\u201cBut the sanctions and mismanagement of our leaders was neck-breaking,\u201d Mr. Shahriyari said. His principal customer, an Iranian state-owned automotive company, Iran Khodro, stopped placing orders because it was having trouble selling cars. Before long, his checks started bouncing, he said, and he told employees that he could no longer pay their wages.\u201cA contact, an ambassador for Iran, once told me, \u2018You have to pay the price for the nuclear advancement of our country,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, I did.\u201dAn article on Monday about disillusionment in Iran over the approaching presidential election misstated the timing of a parliamentary election in which reformists and moderates won a small majority. It was in 2016, not 2015.Advertisement"}

Meltzer, an influential conservative economist who strongly opposed government bailouts and was credited with coining the anti-bailout slogan, \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without sin,\u201d died on Monday in Pittsburgh. He was 89.Marvin Goodfriend, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and a colleague of Dr. Meltzer\u2019s there, confirmed the death, at Shadyside Hospital. Dr. Meltzer taught at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon and, at his death, held a professorship there in political economy that was named for him.Throughout his career Dr. Meltzer was a consultant to congressional committees, the Federal Reserve System, the Treasury Department, foreign governments and central banks, advocating a hands-off approach to economic affairs, even in the face of fiscal failures.\u201cThe reason he was one of the greatest economists in the 20th century is because he played a leading role in persuading the Federal Reserve to end the great inflation with disciplined monetary policy,\u201d Dr. Goodfriend said, referring to the late 1960s to the early 1980s.In 1999 and 2000 he was chairman of a congressional commission \u2014 informally called the Meltzer Commission \u2014 that examined how the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had responded to the 1997-98 financial crisis, in which a sharp devaluation of Southeast Asian currencies beginning in July 1997 rippled across the global economy, affecting markets in the United States, Europe and Latin America.His economic philosophy has found renewed favor in the Trump administration. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Adam Lerrick, who helped Dr. Meltzer with his I.M.F. and World Bank report, has been nominated as deputy under secretary for international finance in the Treasury Department.In coining the slogan \u201cCapitalism without failure is like religion without sin,\u201d he added another maxim: \u201cBankruptcies and losses concentrate the mind on prudent behavior.\u201dAllan Harold Meltzer was born on Feb. 6, 1928, in Boston to George Meltzer and the former Minerva Simon. His mother died when he was 6, and his father later remarried.Allan attended the Boys\u2019 Latin School and Brookline High School in Massachusetts. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics from Duke University in 1948 and received master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles.In 1957 he became an assistant professor at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later named the Tepper School of Business.Dr. Meltzer\u2019s economic influence stretched decades. In 1973, he helped found the private Shadow Open Market Committee with Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester. The panel offered policy recommendations to the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.He received many awards for his work, including the Harry Truman Medal for Public Policy and the Truman Medal for Economic Policy.Dr. Meltzer wrote more than 10 books, including the comprehensive multivolume \u201cA History of the Federal Reserve.\u201dHe is survived by his wife, the former Marilyn Ginsburg; two sons, Bruce and Eric; a daughter, Beth MacIsaac; a half sister from his father\u2019s second marriage, Maxine Smith; and eight grandchildren.In recent years Mr. Meltzer found a new interest in law and regulation.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Matter With Europe?", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byOn Sunday France will hold its presidential runoff. Most observers expect Emmanuel Macron, a centrist, to defeat Marine Le Pen, the white nationalist \u2014 please, let\u2019s stop dignifying this stuff by calling it \u201cpopulism.\u201d And I\u2019m pretty sure that Times rules allow me to state directly that I very much hope the conventional wisdom is right. A Le Pen victory would be a disaster for Europe and the world.Yet I also think it\u2019s fair to ask a couple of questions about what\u2019s going on. First, how did things get to this point? Second, would a Le Pen defeat be anything more than a temporary reprieve from the ongoing European crisis?Some background: Like everyone on this side of the Atlantic, I can\u2019t help seeing France in part through Trump-colored glasses. But it\u2019s important to realize that the parallels between French and American politics exist despite big differences in underlying economic and social trends.They\u2019re also just about equally productive. It\u2019s true that the French over all produce about a quarter less per person then we do \u2014 but that\u2019s mainly because they take more vacations and retire younger, which are not obviously terrible things.In short, France is hardly a utopia, but by most standards it is offering its citizens a fairly decent life. So why are so many willing to vote for \u2014 again, let\u2019s not use euphemisms \u2014 a racist extremist?There are, no doubt, multiple reasons, especially cultural anxiety over Islamic immigrants. But it seems clear that votes for Le Pen will in part be votes of protest against what are perceived as the highhanded, out-of-touch officials running the European Union. And that perception unfortunately has an element of truth.Those of us who watched European institutions deal with the debt crisis that began in Greece and spread across much of Europe were shocked at the combination of callousness and arrogance that prevailed throughout.Politically, Eurocrats got away with this behavior because small nations were easy to bully, too terrified of being cut off from euro financing to stand up to unreasonable demands. But Europe\u2019s elite will be making a terrible mistake if it believes it can behave the same way to bigger players.Indeed, there are already intimations of disaster in the negotiations now taking place between the European Union and Britain.Which brings me back to the French election. We should be terrified at the possibility of a Le Pen victory. But we should also be worried that a Macron victory will be taken by Brussels and Berlin to mean that Brexit was an aberration, that European voters can always be intimidated into going along with what their betters say is necessary.So let\u2019s be clear: Even if the worst is avoided this Sunday, all the European elite will get is a time-limited chance to mend its ways.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "UnitedHealth Overbilled Medicare by Billions, U.S. Says in Suit", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byThe Justice Department has sued UnitedHealth Group, saying that senior executives knew the company was overbilling Medicare by hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and halted a repayment plan in 2014 so the money could be used to meet Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations.Under the government\u2019s popular old-age health program, Medicare Advantage, reporting unhealthier customers led to bigger payments from the federal government \u2014 $3 billion worth to UnitedHealth from 2010 to 2015 alone, according to the complaint. The Justice Department said misrepresenting people\u2019s health was a civil fraud and sued for triple damages and other penalties.A spokesman for UnitedHealth, Matthew Burns, said the lawsuit showed that the Justice Department \u201cfundamentally misunderstands, or is deliberately ignoring, how the Medicare Advantage program works.\u201dHe said that reviewing patients\u2019 charts and correcting errors was \u201can appropriate and expected part of the Medicare Advantage program,\u201d and that questions about such activities \u201creflect at most a policy disagreement.\u201d\u201cWe are confident our company and its employees complied with the government\u2019s Medicare Advantage program rules,\u201d he said.Both lawsuits seek to recover money for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., the federal agency that administers Medicare, the program that provides health coverage to people over 65. If the litigation succeeds, Mr. Poehling would get a percentage of the recovery.The litigation revolves around Medicare Advantage, a 14-year-old program that allows Medicare beneficiaries to get their health coverage from private insurers, rather than from the government. When Congress established Medicare Advantage, the lawmakers expected insurers to use managed-care principles to reinvigorate the 52-year-old Medicare program, giving rise to better health care at a lower cost to taxpayers.One of the biggest changes was the payment system: The government pays insurers a predetermined amount for each person they enroll in Medicare Advantage, rather than paying doctors and hospitals a fee for every service provided. And to keep the insurers from enrolling only healthy people, the government agreed to pay them more for unhealthy enrollees. How much more depends on a complex \u201crisk scoring\u201d system, established by Medicare.That\u2019s the problem, the Justice Department lawsuit argues. \u201cThis payment model creates powerful incentives\u201d for the insurers \u201cto exaggerate the expected health care costs for their enrollees,\u201d it says.The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, contending that senior executives knew the company was overbilling Medicare by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The department is joining a whistle-blower suit filed earlier by a former UnitedHealth finance director, Benjamin Poehling.Mr. Poehling\u2019s complaint said UnitedHealth and other insurers used sophisticated data-mining programs to look for people whose risk scores could be raised by adding new diagnosis codes. As a finance director in UnitedHealth\u2019s Medicare & Retirement unit, he was expected to monitor the revenue increases that resulted.He said these initiatives did little or nothing to find errors in the system that worked in the other direction: inaccurate diagnosis codes that, if corrected, would lower the payments.\u201cUnitedHealth\u2019s chart-review program gave it all the information it needed to identify and delete hundreds of thousands of false claims it had previously submitted,\u201d said Tim McCormack, a lawyer with the firm of Constantine Cannon who is representing Mr. Poehling. \u201cUnited broke the law by ignoring that information and keeping the money.\u201dThe Justice Department\u2019s complaint said much the same thing.One unnamed patient was described to Medicare as having metastatic cancer, acute leukemia and unspecified stroke, for example, even though those diagnoses were not borne out by the patient\u2019s charts. That one invalid claim cost the government $24,380 in 2011, and there were hundreds of thousands more, the complaint said.The Justice Department said Medicare Advantage insurers are required to make good-faith efforts to submit accurate and complete data to Medicare, and if they corrected only errors in their own favor, they were out of compliance.Mr. Burns disagreed with that. He said Medicare first proposed the \u201clook both ways\u201d rule in 2014 but withdrew it.\u201cYet the Department of Justice claims the rule existed all along,\u201d he said. \u201cThis makes no sense.\u201dThe errors compiled by the Justice Department were not corrected, according to the complaint, because they were found as part of a short-lived quality-control program at UnitedHealth. It got off the ground in 2011, with a reserve set up to hold the money that might one day be returned to Medicare: $208 million for overpayments for 2012, and up to $180 million for 2013 and $175 million for 2014.Delay followed delay, and there was still money in the reserve in April 2014, when senior executives at the insurer realized that the company\u2019s second-quarter revenues were falling $500 million short of the budgeted amount. Detailed slides from an internal presentation showed that top executives saw the liability accrual reserve as a place to get $250 million, to cut the revenue gap in half, according to the complaint.But the company executives were concerned about the legal consequences of taking back money earmarked for repaying Medicare, especially because the agency had recently proposed a rule requiring insurers to \u201clook both ways\u201d when checking the accuracy of their diagnosis codes.In the end, UnitedHealth shut down the quality-control program anyway, according to the complaint. It did not correct the invalid diagnoses, and it shifted the reserve money back into revenues.Top executives, including UnitedHealth\u2019s chief executive, Stephen J. Hemsley, wanted the money to cut the revenue gap, the Justice Department said.\u201cThis was important to all of them, because they wanted to represent to investors that UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement\u2019s actual revenues were on target,\u201d the complaint said. It cited an internal document stating that the company\u2019s reported results in 2014 benefited from a one-time policy change, \u201cwhich investors are unaware of.\u201dMr. Burns, the spokesman, said the episode was \u201centirely irrelevant to what this matter is actually about, and that is unclear C.M.S. policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Defends Strategy at Cannes: \u2018The Culture Is Changing\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byCANNES, France \u2014 As controversy continued to swirl here over the presence of two Netflix titles that are playing in the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s main competition but won\u2019t appear in any French theaters, the streaming giant finally broke its silence with a message that could be summed up as: The culture is changing and we listen to our 100 million customers.\u201cWe\u2019re living amid a generation that has seen every great movie ever made on a phone, so I think we all have to come to grips with where technology takes us,\u201d Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, said in a 90-minute interview here Friday with several news media outlets.The company\u2019s offerings here include \u201cOkja,\u201d Bong Joon-ho\u2019s fantasy film about a genetically modified pig, and when the Netflix credit appeared onscreen Friday at the first media screening, loud boos arose from the audience, followed by some cheers. The divided house captured the moment at Cannes at this year, where Netflix has dominated conversations. (Even more boos broke out when the film\u2019s framing was off for the first few minutes. It was started again from the beginning and the festival issued a statement apologizing for the technical problem.)\u201cYou must be feel small and humble in front of the image,\u201d he added.Mr. Sarandos called that view \u201cbeautifully romantic.\u201d\u201cWhy would we want to hold back a movie for an enormous number of people to enjoy throughout the entire country that a few hundred, maybe a few thousand people could see the film in Paris?\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. \u201cIt seemed to me like the right thing to do was to give the people, our subscribers, who pay to make these movies, access to them immediately all over the world,\u201d he added.Asked if the festival organizers were aware that Netflix wasn\u2019t seeking a wide theatrical release in France, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cThey were fully aware of our release strategy.\u201dNot everyone here was critical of Netflix. A Cannes juror, Will Smith, defended it at the news conference with Mr. Almod\u00f3var. \u201cIn my home it\u2019s done nothing but broaden my children\u2019s cinematic global comprehension,\u201d he said. Mr. Smith stars in \u201cBright,\u201d a thriller that will debut on Netflix this year.Another actor said that he was drawn to a Netflix project because of the company\u2019s large viewership. At a news conference for \u201cOkja\u201d here on Friday, Jake Gyllenhaal, a co-star, said he had wanted the movie \u2014 with its strong environmentalist message, and critique of capitalism and genetically modified food \u2014 to connect with a wide audience.\u201cThe platform of a film, how far it can reach, how many people it can get to reach a message, is extraordinarily important,\u201d Mr. Gyllenhaal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a true blessing when any art can reach one person if not hundreds of thousands if not millions of people.\u201dThe other Netflix-produced film at the festival is \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories,\u201d directed by Noah Baumbach.Netflix has local content in 23 languages and is currently filming in 19 countries. This year it will distribute 50 feature films, not including documentaries. Mr. Sarandos wouldn\u2019t reveal how many subscribers Netflix has in France or elsewhere, saying only that half of its 100 million subscribers are in the United States and the rest are in 189 other countries. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive marketplace,\u201d he said, declining to break down the numbers any further.He said that about 30 percent of the content Netflix subscribers watch in any country on an average day was local, although that can vary, and that Netflix had invested 1.75 billion euros (about $1.9 billion) in European content since 2012.It was at a previous Cannes Film Festival that Mr. Sarandos made a connection with Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, the festival\u2019s director. They went to a screening of a newly restored \u201cThe Lady From Shanghai\u201d by Orson Welles. \u201cThat\u2019s when we bonded and he saw I really do love movies,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: A Game Effort at Polishing Up \u2018The Golden Apple\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byTo make a cult, it takes a failure. On that count, \u201cThe Golden Apple,\u201d a musical retelling of \u201cThe Iliad\u201d and \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d set in Washington State around 1900, certainly qualifies. Though it opened to positive reviews at the Phoenix Theater in 1954, and was the first Off Broadway musical ever to transfer to Broadway, it flopped almost as soon as it arrived.But failure alone does not suffice. A cult musical must also plummet directly into obscurity; if too many people know about it, how can it be the exclusive delight of connoisseurs? Then, too, there must be something of great quality that justifies the delight, and also something that doesn\u2019t. The best such musicals are a bit outr\u00e9, a bit funky, a bit too fey or fine to survive in their own time, and maybe even in ours.That case does not depend much on the story, which moves the mythic figures to a rural village called Angel\u2019s Roost and a slick nearby city called Rhododendron. Those names should give you a feel for the level of satire involved, although it is fascinating, and a bit depressing, to realize that in 1954 the show\u2019s creators \u2014 the composer Jerome Moross and the librettist John Latouche \u2014 could count on an audience\u2019s familiarity with ancient epics to make the jokes pay off. Helen is the local easy gal; Paris a slick traveling salesman who arrives by balloon. Ulysses has just returned to Penelope from the Spanish-American War full of big-stick enthusiasm: \u201cOh Theodore Oh Theodore,\u201d he and his hearty mates sing, \u201cthe Roosevelt that we adore.\u201d (Latouche\u2019s lyrics are nothing if not assertively rhymed.) The beauty contest that foments the crisis is, here, a bake-off.Among other highlights, a duet for Penelope and Ulysses (\u201cIt\u2019s the Going Home Together\u201d) and a solo for Penelope (\u201cWindflowers\u201d) extend well beyond musical-theater formulas to the realm of art song. Hearing them beautifully rendered by Ryan Silverman (as Ulysses) and the newcomer Mikaela Bennett (as Penelope) feels like getting out from under the clouds on a night flight over water.In its hasty fidelity, the production, directed by Michael Berresse, emphasizes those ersatz upbeat traits. Though the simple setting by Allen Moyer comes complete with a just-right backdrop in the style of Grandma Moses, the overall tone is, as in many Encores! productions, generically cheerful and cute. There is way too much mimed jollity. And because \u201cThe Golden Apple\u201d is such a large undertaking, with a cast of 40 and lots of choreography (by Joshua Bergasse), there is also, in this case, a winded feeling, not surprising after just 10 days of rehearsal. Six weeks would not have been too many for such a complicated undertaking.There\u2019s nothing Encores! can do about that under its current financing, and there are some compensatory charms in the production\u2019s make-do spirit. But those raggedy charms are shown up by the high professional gloss of its music, which is delivered by a luxurious orchestra of 31, much larger than the original. The orchestrations, by Mr. Moross and Hershy Kay, are among the best ever heard in the series, and are given their full due. The singing, under Rob Berman\u2019s musical direction, is stellar.All of which raises the Encores! paradox. Since the series began in 1994, staged concerts have gradually given way to very full productions. Rarely nowadays do you see an actor carrying, let alone consulting, a script. A dancer as stylish as the Lar Lubovitch alumnus Barton Cowperthwaite, as Paris, can expect real bravura opportunities. But the nature of musicals is such that high-caliber performances of sung material can be achieved much more quickly than satisfying stagings, and as the productions have grown more ambitious, the achievement has sometimes felt shallower.I offer no solution, and am not even sure this is a problem. I, too, am a cultist and want the full cult experience. If that includes a bit of funk in the ambrosia, as it does in \u201cThe Golden Apple,\u201d so be it.A theater review on Friday about the musical \u201cThe Golden Apple\u201d misidentified the character who sings \u201cWindflowers.\u201d It is Penelope, not Helen.Advertisement"}

But he stands in stark isolation.\u201dThe leaders of Germany and France expressed disappointment. \u201cThe whole discussion about climate was very difficult, not to say unsatisfactory,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said. \u201cThere\u2019s a situation where it\u2019s six \u2014 if you count the European Union, seven \u2014 against one.\u201dPresident Emmanuel Macron of France said he had told Mr. Trump it was \u201cindispensable for the reputation of the United States and for the Americans themselves that the Americans remain committed\u201d to the climate agreement.The G-7 statement provides the United States more time to resolve internal White House debates about whether to pull out of the pact. It says the United States is \u201cin the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.\u201dThe president did not mention the impasse in his only public remarks after the summit meeting, to American troops at Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily. But he repeated his complaints about trade and the financing of NATO, even as he pronounced the trip a rousing success.\u201cWe hit a home run no matter where we are,\u201d he said.For Mr. Trump, however, the lack of a decision on the climate accord put an uncertain ending on an ambitious first presidential trip abroad that began as a respite from the surfeit of scandal at home.In the document addressing the climate pact and other topics, six nations reaffirmed their commitment to cutting planet-warming emissions.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on Jared,\u201d an exasperated Mr. Cohn said.In some ways, it was not one trip, but two, each with very different themes.In Europe, however, the pugnacious side of Mr. Trump reasserted itself. In addition to offering a harangue of NATO members over budgetary matters, he declined to explicitly reaffirm America\u2019s commitment to Article 5, which requires the United States to come to the defense of allies in the event of an attack.\u201cHis advisers tried to make him understand that there are some allies that are really nervous and needed reassurance,\u201d said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. \u201cHe managed to do it with the Saudis and the Israelis.\u201d But in Europe, he said, \u201che does take us for granted.\u201dBrian McKeon, a senior policy official in the Pentagon during the Obama administration, said: \u201cThe in-your-face thing at the NATO headquarters was pretty undiplomatic. He succeeded at busting norms, but not building good will.\u201dThe American national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in the ceremony was an implicit endorsement of Article 5. \u201cHe did not make a decision not to say it,\u201d General McMaster said.On climate, Mr. Trump has long railed against what he says are the economic dangers of a global climate pact. He has demanded more flexibility in setting standards on emissions, saying other countries are getting a better deal and that the agreement could be costly for American businesses.There is an intense debate inside the West Wing over whether to withdraw from the accord or to try to renegotiate its terms, pitting hard-line nationalists, like Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, against more mainstream advisers like Mr. Cohn.On Thursday, Mr. Cohn told reporters that Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking on the subject was \u201cevolving.\u201d But other senior officials said that even if the United States remained in the agreement, it could effectively gut its principles.The exit of the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, would not immediately dissolve the pact, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama and legally ratified last year. But it would profoundly weaken the strength of the deal and pave the way for other countries to withdraw from it.Some climate diplomats said the rest of the world was growing weary of America\u2019s back-and-forth on climate change policy. In 1997, the United States joined the world\u2019s first climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, but later withdrew during the Bush administration.\u201cAt some juncture, other countries are going to get sick of us joining in, pulling out, joining in and pulling out and say, \u2018Are we really going to work with the U.S. on this anymore?\u2019\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, particularly coal-state Republicans, are eager for him to withdraw from the Paris accord, and see such a move as a fulfillment of a signature campaign promise. Speaking to a crowd of oil-rig workers last May, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the agreement.Coal miners and coal executives in states like Kentucky and West Virginia have pushed hard for Mr. Trump to reverse all of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, which are ultimately aimed at reducing the widespread burning of coal.In a recent letter to Mr. Trump from 10 state attorneys general, West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, wrote, \u201cWithdrawing from the Paris Agreement is an important and necessary step toward reversing the harmful energy policies and unlawful overreach of the Obama era.\u201dOn trade, Mr. Trump pushed his demand that any agreements negotiated by the United States must be fair. The Trump administration has taken particular aim at Germany, accusing it of depressing the value of the euro to make its exports more competitive and to undercut American goods.In a meeting with leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Thursday, Mr. Trump complained about imports of German cars, threatening to stop them and calling Germany \u201cvery bad\u201d on trade.German officials point out that its two leading luxury automakers, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have huge assembly plants in the United States. They are also frustrated that Trump officials repeatedly raise the prospect of negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Germany, something that the country, as a member of the European Union, cannot do.Coral Davenport and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, Alissa Rubin from Paris, and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Subway Riders Fume, City and State Leaders Are Mostly Mum", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byThrough this list of recent woes, the person most responsible for ensuring that the trains run on time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, has remained mostly silent as subway service gets worse by the day.\u201cGovernor Cuomo shows up to open the Second Avenue subway, but he\u2019s missing in action for the day-to-day disaster that transit riders are experiencing,\u201d John Raskin, the executive director of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, said after the last major disruption.\u201cI never know if I am going to get to anything on time,\u201d said Frank Leone, 31, who lives in Queens. Worsening subway service has made him rethink living in New York City. \u201cI give myself an hour to get to work everyday, even though it only takes 35 minutes,\u201d he said, \u201cand I still show up late to work.\u201dYet Mr. Cuomo often gets a pass: Many riders \u2014 even some who work in city government \u2014 mistakenly direct their anger at Mayor Bill de Blasio, believing the city\u2019s leader would naturally be in charge of its subway. Mr. de Blasio, also a Democrat, has been quick to disabuse them whenever the subject comes up and has also had little to say about the constant drumbeat of subway meltdowns.\u201cThe M.T.A. is run by the State of New York, not the City of New York,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked directly about subway delays in a radio interview Thursday. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do all we can to push the state to invest in the subway system.\u201dChronic problems with the state-run transit system have prompted some elected officials to wonder whether nearly six million daily riders would, in fact, be better off if the mayor took over.\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to have a move to put it under the mayor\u2019s control,\u201d said Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president who has fumed over the subway chaos. \u201cBecause it is in the city, we should have someone who is directly responsible.\u201dFrustrated commuters are left to wonder why Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio are not addressing their pain. It offers a stark contrast to how they respond when the news is good. In the days before the opening of the Second Avenue subway, Mr. Cuomo sent out a blizzard of news releases and regularly appeared before cameras to herald the line as an example of the big things government can do.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Mr. Cuomo had helped to secure the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s largest capital improvement plan after years of underinvestment. (The de Blasio administration also pointed to its $2.5 billion commitment to the capital plan.)\u201cStill, the constant service disruptions are entirely unacceptable, so in the short term, he has tasked the M.T.A. with developing a plan to address the root causes of the subway delays plaguing its customers,\u201d Ms. Lever said in a statement.On Monday, the authority announced a $20 million plan to target frequent causes of delays, including overcrowding and signal problems. The first phase, which focuses on the Eighth Avenue lines in Manhattan, includes directing riders to painted zones at less busy locations on platforms and responding to incidents on the tracks more quickly.The authority\u2019s interim executive director, Veronique Hakim, said in an interview that the agency was committed to improving subway service.\u201cWe feel it,\u201d she said of the growing frustration. \u201cWe know it. We understand it.\u201dMr. de Blasio has been wary of publicly delving into the subway\u2019s current woes, City Hall officials said, to avoid provoking Mr. Cuomo and endangering transportation issues that the city and state are working on together, such as select bus service and preparations for the temporary closure of the L train.\u201cNew Yorkers deserve a subway system that works, not more talk,\u201d said Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor.Yet, with subway service so dire, many agree it is time for Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo to step up, put aside their long-running animosity and work together.\u201cThey\u2019re letting this disagreement, this feud, have a deleterious effect on the state and the city, and that\u2019s scary,\u201d said David R. Jones, a member of the authority\u2019s board nominated by Mr. de Blasio. \u201cI don\u2019t mean this should be a kumbaya moment, but they should really get together and come up with a common approach about improving the M.T.A.\u201dThat is what happened in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Mayor Edward I. Koch famously rode the subways to ask \u201cHow\u2019m I doin\u2019?\u201d and waged a public campaign against subway graffiti. But Mr. Koch had a friend in Gov. Hugh L. Carey during the first part of his mayoralty; the two men served together in Congress and, before that, in Europe during World War II.Richard Ravitch, the former M.T.A. chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s, said Mr. Koch helped him improve the system. Though Mr. Koch let Mr. Ravitch take the blame for fare increases, the mayor worked behind the scenes to gain support for the subway, he said.\u201cEd Koch did whatever I asked him to do,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said in an interview.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also worked with the state to merge the transit police \u2014 a separate state agency \u2014 with the New York Police Department, whose officers now patrol the subways. \u201cIt required the mayor to work with the governor who he didn\u2019t endorse,\u201d said Joseph J. Lhota, a deputy mayor at the time and, later, the chairman of the transportation authority.Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio declined requests for interviews. The governor\u2019s office would not say the last time he rode the subway, though Ms. Lever noted that Mr. Cuomo does not live in New York City; Mr. de Blasio\u2019s office said he last rode it a little over three weeks ago, after a news conference near Grand Central Terminal. Both are facing re-election \u2014 Mr. de Blasio in November; Mr. Cuomo next year \u2014 without serious challengers on the horizon.The politics behind the transportation authority, which controls the city\u2019s subway, buses and commuter railroads, are also complicated. Mr. Cuomo appoints its chief executive and board chairman, and he has taken an increasingly hands-on role at the agency. The mayor nominated three of the 19 members on the current board.\u201cHe\u2019s turned his attention to some cosmetic changes, which don\u2019t impact the day-to-day commute,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said, \u201cand don\u2019t relieve a lot of the day-to-day frustration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Umbrellas and Basketballs Join the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 China may be oversharing.Today, Chinese start-ups want to share umbrellas, concrete mixers and mobile phone power banks. One wants to share basketballs.As Chinese entrepreneurs and investors pile in, some skeptical industry insiders are wondering: Has China reached \u201cpeak sharing?\u201d\u201cAfter all these years, China is finally embracing its communist roots,\u201d said Andy Tian, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing. \u201cThat\u2019s the essence of communism: communal sharing.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s a bubble,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may have roots in something valuable, but can you really share everything?\u201dChinese entrepreneurs like Xu Min think that, quite possibly, you can. In March, the 30-year-old serial entrepreneur from Jiaxing, a town in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, came up with the idea of a basketball-sharing service after he heard some friends complain about the inconvenience of carrying a ball around.Just four days later, Mr. Xu set up Zhulegeqiu, which in Chinese is a pun that roughly means \u201cRent a Ball.\u201d It lets users rent basketballs from custom-designed automated lockers at basketball courts around the country. To rent a ball, users scan a code on the locker with their smartphone camera, unlocking a compartment holding a basketball.Zhulegeqiu charges users about one renminbi, or about 15 cents, per hour for rental. A deposit of about $10 is required unless the user has a high rating on Sesame Credit, the social credit scoring system developed by China\u2019s Ant Financial, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.\u201cIn the long run, it may be more cost-effective to buy rather than rent a ball,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cBut we think Chinese users are willing to pay a little more for convenience.\u201dEarlier this month, Zhulegeqiu received around $1.4 million in venture investment from Modern Capital, a Shanghai-based venture capital firm.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of money bouncing around,\u201d said Zhou Wei, chief executive of XNode, a start-up accelerator and co-working space in Shanghai, \u201cand foolish investments being made.\u201dIn its latest iteration, the sharing economy in China has evolved into something like an internet-enabled rental business. Unlike Airbnb and Uber, which provide a platform that connects users to existing resources, the latest sharing companies in China own the product and rent it out to users.\u201cIn China, average incomes are still very low and the market in many ways is still very price-conscious,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo if the technology is there to support it and there\u2019s a viable business model, there are all sorts of sharing economy or pseudo-sharing economy businesses that can potentially do very well.\u201dThe Chinese government sees promise in sharing. It estimates sharing last year accounted for $500 billion in transactions, and projected it would account for 10 percent of China\u2019s economic output by 2020.All that drives ideas that may seem puzzling to others \u2014 including Shen Weiwei\u2019s umbrella-sharing business.Mr. Shen, an entrepreneur, acknowledges that it may be difficult for his start-up, a shared umbrella service called Molisan, to turn a profit. Molisan, which means \u201cMagic Umbrella,\u201d will reap only small profit margins charging one renminbi (15 cents) to rent an umbrella for 12 hours from one of Molisan\u2019s custom-designed kiosks, and customers could end up stealing them.But Mr. Shen said he was confident that others would see the public and environmental benefits of having an umbrella-sharing service. So far, Molisan has already reached agreements with both the Guangzhou and Fuzhou city subway companies to place kiosks there. The goal, he said, is to have an umbrella kiosk within a 100-meter range at all times.\u201cEveryone at home has a lot of umbrellas, but we never have them when we really need them,\u201d said Mr. Shen. \u201cIf we are successful, then users will no longer have to buy umbrellas.\u201dMany remain skeptical. \u201cSharing basketballs, sharing umbrellas \u2014 these are all bad ideas,\u201d said Allen Zhu, Shanghai-based managing director at GSR Ventures, which was an early investor in Didi Chuxing, the popular bike-sharing company Ofo and Xiaodian. \u201cThey\u2019re both very tied to a particular location, which makes it difficult for the company to expand.\u201dEntrepreneurs like Mr. Xu, of Zhulegeqiu, disagree, though they acknowledge challenges.For one, the company does not appear to have found a sustainable way to recover stolen balls. During initial testing, Mr. Xu said, one competitor stole a basketball to analyze it more closely. Zhulegeqiu had the thief\u2019s contact information and recovered it through an old-fashioned strategy: incessant telephone calls.\u201cWe thought about putting GPS trackers on the balls,\u201d said Xu Jie, chief executive of Modern Capital, the venture capital firm backing Zhulegeqiu, and no relation to its founder. \u201cBut we did the math and we discovered that hiring a few people to physically track them down was cheaper.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Election Wars at the Supreme Court", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byWhile it\u2019s been obvious for years that election law \u2014 the rules by which votes are counted, district lines are drawn and campaigns are paid for \u2014 represents a front in the culture wars, we don\u2019t usually think of it that way.That\u2019s because the term culture war signifies the politicization of competing belief systems \u2014 over abortion, for example, or religion or the appropriate social roles for men and women. (I use the word \u201cbelief\u201d advisedly, recognizing that an anti-abortion position is purely opportunistic for a fair number of the Republican politicians who embrace it, including but not limited to President Trump.)There was something delicious about the warning in the dissenting opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. about the danger that \u201cthe federal courts will be transformed into weapons of political warfare\u201d if they remain open to deciding such cases. He said that by being too casually receptive to complaints like those brought by African-American voters in this case, courts \u201cwill invite the losers in the redistricting process to seek to obtain in court what they could not achieve in the political arena.\u201dIronies abound in the North Carolina decision. Not so many years ago, it was Republicans, in states that had not sent an African-American to Congress since Reconstruction, who were complaining that the Voting Rights Act was being misused by a heavy-handed federal government to create majority-black districts where state legislatures had not seen fit to create any. Now that Republicans have control of Southern state legislatures, they seek cover from the Voting Rights Act, claiming that it gives them no choice but to pack ever-greater black majorities into those very districts \u2014 which just happens to make the surrounding districts ever more white and safely Republican. It\u2019s not race, it\u2019s politics, the states say.Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s majority opinion \u2014 her most important since joining the Supreme Court seven years ago \u2014 pulled the fig leaf off that position. (Justice Clarence Thomas provided Justice Kagan with a necessary fifth vote.) Justice Kagan acknowledged that race and partisan identification are highly correlated and that it isn\u2019t always easy to disentangle the two. But in affirming the lower court\u2019s conclusion that race, not partisanship, was the North Carolina Legislature\u2019s predominant consideration when it added tens of thousands of black voters into districts that had been sending African-Americans to Congress by comfortable margins for years, the majority focused not on the state\u2019s claims but on the evidence presented at trial.In one of the districts, District 1, the state effectively conceded the predominance of race, and the Supreme Court voted 8 to 0 to affirm the lower court\u2019s finding of unconstitutionality. (Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was not on the court when the case was argued in December, didn\u2019t have a vote.) The fight was over District 12, represented in Congress for 20 years by a Democrat, Representative Mel Watt, an African-American who attracted votes from many whites and who won re-election repeatedly by wide margins although the district was only about 44 percent black. In the redistricting that followed the 2010 census, the legislature nonetheless added 35,000 African-Americans of voting age to the district, while removing 50,000 whites, turning District 12 into a majority-black district.It was a classic case of what in election law is known as \u201cpacking.\u201d Justice Kagan was polite \u2014 and just a bit sly \u2014 in suggesting what a motive might be for such an action. Legislators may simply misunderstand the Voting Rights Act, she said, or they may be seeking \u201cto advance their partisan interests.\u201d Then she added: \u201cOr, finally \u2014 though we hope less commonly \u2014 they may simply seek to suppress the electoral power of minority voters.\u201dThat\u2019s essentially what a federal appeals court found last summer when it struck down North Carolina\u2019s stringent voter ID requirement, described by that court as an effort to \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision\u201d by requiring forms of identification that they disproportionately lacked. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of that ruling. Seemingly, because no one noted a dissent, all nine justices agreed with that outcome.Sometimes, as in that example, Supreme Court justices can say a lot while seeming to say very little. It hasn\u2019t taken long for Justice Gorsuch to figure that out. At issue on Monday of this week was a case challenging the constitutionality of restrictions on the use by state and local political parties of soft money, contributions outside federal limits from corporations and individuals. The Republican National Committee has long fought against this provision of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law passed by Congress in 2002. The Supreme Court has twice rejected such challenges. The case this time was brought by the Republican Party of Louisiana. In November, a special three-judge Federal District Court in Washington rejected the challenge, and the Trump administration urged the justices either to dismiss the appeal or affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis case is governed by precedent that this Court has declined to overrule,\u201d Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting United States solicitor general, told the Supreme Court.Noting a dissent from a summary affirmance of this sort is not common. It is, in fact, gratuitous, because it provides no explanation and offers no legal path forward. It\u2019s simply like raising a hand: \u201cI\u2019m here. Come talk to me sometime.\u201d It\u2019s a signal that the election wars, far from over, are ready to be reignited, with a new player in town eager to light the match.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Woo Chinese Investors: With Visa Offers and the Trump Name", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 For Chinese citizens, American green cards can be notoriously difficult to obtain. But a Beijing immigration company called Qiaowai tells visa applicants of a secret weapon: It is working on behalf of a real estate firm owned by the family of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.\u201cThey said the president would make sure it came through,\u201d said Lu Ling, a technology executive in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. \u201cThey said there was no chance it could fail.\u201dThey have helped find Chinese investors for many developers\u2019 giant projects, including numerous luxury high-rises in Manhattan, a sprawling complex of apartment buildings in Brooklyn and a golf course in Boca Raton, Fla. Last year, they brought Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City\u2019s onetime mayor, to Beijing to speak to potential investors.Both firms have faced questions about their tactics.Qiaowai, with more than 400 employees at its headquarters on the 32nd floor of a high-rise, has trumpeted its political connections and played down the program\u2019s financial risks. On the Kushner project, Qiaowai promised safe investments and \u201cguaranteed\u201d green cards, according to emails and text messages sent to clients and reviewed by The New York Times.U.S. Immigration Fund, based in Jupiter, Fla., has been accused by a former top executive of improperly using investor visa funds, and its chief executive has had legal troubles. The firm is a leading lobbying force in Washington, spending $820,000 since early 2015 to block changes to the EB-5 program\u2019s rules.\u201cNo one at Kushner Companies was aware of any statement or guarantee,\u201d Risa Heller, a company spokeswoman, said in response to questions about Qiaowai. \u201cThey did not and would not authorize that kind of language.\u201d She declined to answer any questions about U.S. Immigration Fund.Both immigration firms this week removed from their websites descriptions of Kushner projects. \u201cThese are reports for investors and they are still up on the company\u2019s password-protected investor portal,\u201d said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration Fund.But the family\u2019s Chinese representatives have repeatedly invoked Mr. Trump\u2019s name as a selling point.Qiaowai, which has worked with the Kushners since 2013, describes itself in ads as the company Mr. Trump uses to \u201cdig for gold.\u201d Its leader, a former banker named Ding Ying, has tried to project an image of proximity to the president, chronicling on the company\u2019s website her visit to Washington in January to attend his inauguration. She said she \u201cexchanged a few words\u201d with Mr. Trump.Connecting Qiaowai with the Kushner family is Nicholas A. Mastroianni II, the chief executive of U.S. Immigration Fund. A prodigious fund-raiser, he claims to have collected more than $1.7 billion in EB-5 money since 2010.He travels frequently to China, reassuring Chinese investors worried about moving abroad, including helping their children adjust and throwing dinners. He also regularly goes to New York City, via private jet, where he has helped finance megaprojects for some of the city\u2019s biggest real estate developers.The Kushner family has turned to Mr. Mastroianni at least twice to finance its ambitions. In 2013, it raised $50 million from 100 investors for a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment building in Jersey City, which opened last year. This spring, it announced it would seek the $150 million in EB-5 money for the latest Jersey City project, known as One Journal Square.The litigation was settled, and both sides declined to comment.In China, Mr. Mastroianni found a ready partner in Ms. Ding of Qiaowai, who built an empire on sending Chinese families abroad.Qiaowai, founded in 1999, has flourished as the ranks of wealthy Chinese have surged. Such firms often charge more than $50,000 as a finder\u2019s fee, commissions that can add up to tens of millions of dollars on large development projects.Ms. Ding had a motto \u2014 \u201conly genuine and safe investments\u201d \u2014 and a vision of becoming a one-stop destination for wealthy families, helping them find schools, pay taxes and obtain insurance. When speaking at a fund-raising event in early May at the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing, with Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister in attendance, Qiaowai representatives said that citizenship and getting money back were \u201chighly guaranteed.\u201dMs. Ding\u2019s close relationship with Mr. Mastroianni ensured an advantage in the Chinese market. Mr. Mastroianni routinely brought celebrities, including the golfer Jack Nicklaus, and former American government officials to China, helping burnish the credibility of Qiaowai.One such guest, Mr. Giuliani, promoted another developer\u2019s Times Square project to potential investors at an event in Beijing last year. In a news release at the time, Qiaowai referred to itself and its Florida partner as the \u201ctwo most powerful giants in the Sino-U.S. immigration industry.\u201dMr. Giuliani factored prominently in Qiaowai\u2019s advertising; the company described him to Chinese audiences as America\u2019s likely next secretary of state. His law firm, Greenberg Traurig, is the main lobbyist for a trade group fighting changes to the rules of the EB-5 program.Mr. Giuliani and his firm did not respond to requests for comment.Prominent former politicians are a staple for U.S. Immigration Fund and other EB-5 promoters. Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York spoke alongside Mr. Mastroianni at an industry panel in Shanghai, and the former New York State economic development official Charles A. Gargano is the firm\u2019s executive director.Mr. Mastroianni\u2019s firm was at the forefront of efforts to stop an overhaul of the EB-5 program in 2015 and 2016, lobbying records show. The firm hired former Representative Ron Klein of Florida, now a lobbyist at Holland & Knight, to make its case on Capitol Hill and court investors in China.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Foreign Policy", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byEditorialWhile Mr. Trump pushes an America First agenda of isolationism and protectionism and embroils himself in controversies that raise doubts about his competence, President Xi Jinping of China exudes purpose and confidence as he tries to remake the global economic and political order and lure nations into Beijing\u2019s orbit.Mr. Xi held the Beijing forum to showcase his One Belt, One Road initiative, which is aimed at creating a modern version of the Silk Road, a network of trading routes from China to Africa and Europe. Dozens of world leaders, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, attended. Many of them praised Mr. Xi\u2019s vision, which he first voiced in 2013, and were enthusiastic about locating projects in their countries, financing them, building them or managing them. The plan offers many ways countries can participate; Britain and Singapore, for instance, seem eager to handle private financing.China\u2019s leader has advantages in promoting his agenda. He\u2019s in control. (It\u2019s worth remembering that he is hardly a democrat.) His government has lots of money to invest. His propaganda machine is disciplined and relentless. And Mr. Xi himself is a Barnum-like salesman. \u201cDevelopment holds the master key to solving all problems,\u201d he said at the forum, as if One Belt, One Road were the ultimate cure-all.No less important, many countries are desperate for infrastructure investment and jobs. China itself is eager to open new markets to nourish its own growth and to absorb an overproduction of steel, cement and machinery. Completing just a small fraction of the projects could help lift millions of people out of poverty and stabilize poor nations.Still, there are reasons to wonder how much of this grand plan can be achieved. There will be security risks in regions torn by sectarian and political warfare; legal obstacles in nations with different laws; and bureaucratic hurdles in countries with inept governments and corrupt officials.So far, investments have been focused on Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other countries that are geopolitical priorities for China but have weak economies. Conference delegates expressed concern that such countries would find it hard to pay back loans from Chinese companies and banks and emphasized that more projects must be \u201chigh quality\u201d and commercially viable.China clearly aims to dominate the international system. If it succeeds \u2014 shaping how vast sums are spent and where, and which laws are followed or not \u2014 it could upend a system established by Washington and its allies after World War II. And there are military concerns: For instance, many Burmese and foreign experts worry that China could use the Kyaukphyu ports for military purposes.Mr. Trump has already ceded ground to Beijing by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Barack Obama negotiated to ensure that the United States and its allies set the rules for Asian trade. This has led many Asian countries to question America\u2019s commitment to the region and to look more seriously to China.Whatever obstacles lie ahead for One Belt, One Road, it is no exaggeration to say that if the United States and its Western allies turn inward, Mr. Xi could prevail by default.Advertisement"}

The analysis, which was based on a review of millions of Twitter messages related to the election since last summer, showed that more than one-third of posts linked to certain political hashtags originated from the United States, although few went viral in France.Their efforts have fallen flat in France, with memes often written in English and extremist photos and images that do not resonate with the French electorate. American-style fake news and other digital misinformation have also failed to gain traction in France, where its own domestic issues and ways of campaigning still dominate.The muted response in France could portend a similar response by voters in Britain and Germany when they head to the polls later this year in their own national elections.While international activists have found it difficult to break into the French political discourse, local campaigners, often from the country\u2019s own far right, have had more success.While muted, American-style fake news has also made an appearance.Still, for many in France, such outright fake news stories have been met merely with Gallic shrugs. And the digital tactics of international campaigners have been even less effective.In part, that is because alt-right activists from the United States and beyond have copied the movement\u2019s American extremist images and language without tweaking them to entice the French electorate.In the last two weeks, far-right activists have created multiple memes attacking Mr. Macron \u2014 complete with captions and hashtags written in English.

Murphy, a Democrat, has consumed a hefty part of his campaign\u2019s considerable war chest, spending more than $18 million, $16.6 million more than his nearest competitor, according to financial disclosure reports released on Wednesday.Mr. Murphy\u2019s latest report cemented his status as the fund-raising leader in the race. He took in more than $7.7 million in the first reporting period of 2017, which ended May 5, most of it in the form of $5.5 million he lent his campaign. In all, his campaign has raised more than $19 million, but he enters the final weeks before the June 6 primaries with less than $1 million left.Among Republicans, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno raised $2.2 million in the period for her campaign, which began in January, and had $1.5 million on hand. Her main challenger, Assemblyman Jack M. Ciattarelli, raised nearly $1.3 million and had $461,051 left.New Jersey offers a matching funds program for candidates who initially raise more than $450,000 and commit to spending at least $430,000. Those who qualify receive $2 in public financing for each dollar raised from private sources, with a limit of $6.4 million in expenditures for primary races, and $13.8 million for the general election.Mr. Murphy is the only candidate who has opted not to participate in the program, so his fund-raising figures reflected only what he received in donations or lent to his campaign. The other candidates reported a combination of donations and matching funds.Jim Johnson, a Democrat who surprised some by becoming the first candidate to qualify for matching funds, raised $1.9 million in the first period, bringing his campaign\u2019s total to $2.3 million.Donations from outside New Jersey accounted for a large portion the money raised by Mr. Johnson, a former Treasury undersecretary in the Clinton administration. Excluding matching funds, Mr. Johnson raised about $153,000 in New Jersey, and about $626,000 from out of state, $437,000 of it from New York, including $1,000 from Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York.Among the other Democrats in the race, Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski raised $1.1 million, and State Senator Ray Lesniak, raised just over $500,000, with slightly more than half of it coming from Mr. Lesniak himself.For his part, Mr. Murphy received contributions from 5,030 donors during the filing period. His campaign said that 55 percent of those donors had pledged $100 or less to the campaign, but the majority of Mr. Murphy\u2019s contributions have come from larger donors, including the candidate himself. Of the roughly $19 million his campaign has raised, only about $455,000 has come from donations of $300 or less.Mr. Murphy, who announced his candidacy last May, has had a long time to fill his coffers, which has given him a significant advantage but has also forced him to spend much more than his rivals.Nonetheless, Mr. Corzine and his wife each gave Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign $4,300.Mr. Murphy\u2019s rivals have cited his using his personal wealth for his campaign as evidence that he was behaving like Mr. Corzine. In the first televised primary debate on Tuesday, Mr. Wisniewski derided the primary process as an \u201cauction.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one candidate who keeps bidding up the price,\u201d Mr. Wisniewski said, alluding to Mr. Murphy.Mr. Murphy has invested a total of $20 million into his political efforts, $15 million directly into his primary campaign and $5 million on two nonprofit groups he started. But that sum is still well below the amount that Mr. Corzine spent in 2005, when he poured more than $43 million of his money into his campaign, according to the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, a state agency.Ms. Guadagno\u2019s campaign, in a statement announcing its fund-raising figures, also criticized Mr. Murphy\u2019s war chest and called for a spending cap for the general election.\u201cWe challenge Phil Murphy or whoever wins their primary to agree to a spending cap so the race is focused on the issues New Jerseyans care about most like affordability and lower taxes,\u201d Dave Huguenel, Ms. Guadagno\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement.New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states with governors\u2019 races this year. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, is in his second term and is prohibited from running again.Given Mr. Christie\u2019s unpopularity, the Democratic registration edge in the state and a history of swings in political power at the statehouse, many have looked to whoever wins the Democratic primary as an early favorite to win the general election on Nov. 7.Advertisement"}

Farley Post Office Building. Mr. Cuomo has proposed creating a new hall for Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road in the post office building, which is across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station.\u201cWhile this is not a hurricane or flood, it will affect as many people and businesses with dire consequences,\u201d Mr. Cuomo wrote of conditions at Penn Station.Lindsay E.

{"Headline": "The Ghosts of Turin", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byTURIN AT A GLANCE is a grid. The fourth largest city in Italy, it\u2019s distinguished from the others (baroque Rome, wild Naples) by the rigidity of its plan, an inheritance from its origins as a Roman military camp. It\u2019s difficult to get lost here, but also hard to appreciate the particularity of any one area, given its impressively refined sameness. Once the seat of the country\u2019s aristocracy, the Savoys, the city still bears the impress of the family\u2019s stiff, uncompromising dignity. An almost suffocating elegance suffuses it, every orthogonal street a sheer face of mute, balconied 18th-century facades, each wonderfully preserved in a kind of aristocratic amber.In the 20th century, aristocratic restraint became middle-class self-abnegation. Turin would come to be known as an industrial city, above all the home of Fiat, symbol of the Italian economic \u201cmiracle\u201d of the 1950s and 1960s; the factory of Mirafiori toward the south of the city eventually became the largest automobile factory in Europe. Italian radio and television is encapsulated here in the Modernist slab that houses the Turinese home of Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) \u2014 the Italian state station \u2014 in the city center. Turin\u2019s atmosphere of cool detachment and class division received its most perceptive treatment in \u201cLe amiche\u201d (\u201cThe Girlfriends\u201d), the 1955 film by Michelangelo Antonioni, which takes full advantage of the city\u2019s hyperreal polish. A rich woman flirts with an architect\u2019s assistant, but can\u2019t commit to him because of his low-class background. \u201cWe would just fight about furniture,\u201d she admits.The idea of an artistic destination shrouded by a royal and manufacturing city was in accord with one of Turin\u2019s other notable features: its weird association with magic, madness and the occult. Here was where a troubling number of artists and philosophers had suffered crippling depressions or existential crises, or had gone crazy: the epic poet Torquato Tasso; the young Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the novelist Primo Levi. It was on or near the wide, trolley-crossed thoroughfare Via Po where Nietzsche famously saw a horse being maltreated, rushed to embrace it and then collapsed, suffering a fit of madness from which he would never recover.During my visit, more than a few people asked if I knew that Turin was the only city to occupy the geographic intersection of the black magic and white magic triangles, and is therefore caught in an eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil.THE FIRST TIME THIS question was posed to me, I was standing in the apartment of Carlo Mollino, a renowned architect \u2014 also a daredevil and private pornographer \u2014 who died in 1973. This was his last residence, which he never lived in, because Mollino planned it to be a project confronting death, symbolic of his own posthumous journey, as the pyramids were to the Egyptian pharaohs. My questioner, the small museum\u2019s eccentric caretaker, Fulvio Ferrari \u2014 wearing an extraordinary dark vest patterned with giraffe motifs \u2014 had been showing me around the apartment, demonstrating its myriad varieties of occult significance. Before the entrance to the balcony were two giant clamshells, signaling the birth of erotic love (Ferrari helpfully pointed me to a photocopied image of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus\u201d), and oval mirrors signifying eggs and wombs.In a study, there were drawers filled with Polaroids of nude women, taken by Mollino. They wore clothes he had collected over decades, adopting comically lascivious poses. The one in the wedding dress, Ferrari told me, was intended to symbolize the bride that Mollino never had, but would enjoy in the afterlife. The ones in black lingerie, he added, opening another drawer, were representations of courtesans. Here, too, Mollino was following the tradition of the pharaohs.SOMEWHERE between occult Turin and stuffy bourgeois Turin \u2014 though not unconnected with either \u2014 is artistic Turin. And the artistic version is linked, in space and time, with the working class. During the 1950s and 1960s, the city became the site of one of the largest mass migrations in Italian history, as thousands moved from the country\u2019s hardscrabble south to find work in the industrializing north, above all in the factories of Fiat. The history is manifest in the wide expanse of the city\u2019s peripheries, where outsize warehouses, many of them apparently unused and empty, are interspersed among the crush of apartments.Rama, a friend and neighbor to Mollino, is said to have had her first exhibition of drawings, in 1945, shut down by the police for its sexually aggressive imagery (such as men practicing bestiality). Later works were installations drawing on the products of the city, and her personal connection to them. Several used flattened bicycle tire tubes, flayed and hung, referencing her father\u2019s factory, which had gone bankrupt. Collected by admirers and renowned among fellow artists, she nonetheless stood apart from artistic fashions in the city, even as she anticipated others. \u201cDear Franco,\u201d she wrote in a note presenting her friend, the art publisher Franco Masoero, with a drawing, \u201cwe are geniuses. The rest can go to hell.\u201dIn the late 1960s, the political convulsions in Italy made their most lasting artistic contribution through a hallowed series of exhibitions of mostly Turinese artists. There was a long pot filled with beeswax, melting under the weight of a neon sign with the phrase \u201cChe Fare?\u201d \u2014 \u201cWhat Is to Be Done?\u201d (a reference to Lenin). There were bowls filled with salt; a braided steel-wool bridge. Organic materials were mixed effortlessly and surprisingly with industrial ones. Seeing these installations, the critic Germano Celant coined a phrase for a movement that would emerge as Italy\u2019s most important in the 20th century: \u201cpoor art,\u201d or \u201carte povera.\u201dThe Arte Povera artists \u2014 among them Giulio Paolini, Mario Merz, Marisa Merz, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Jannis Kounellis, Gilberto Zorio, Giovanni Anselmo and Alighiero Boetti \u2014 differed widely in their aims and styles, but they appeared united in their attempt to create art out of a wider variety of media \u2014 temporal in nature, and concerned with tactile and olfactory possibilities \u2014 than their Conceptual and Minimalist coevals.Favaretto complained to me that \u201ceveryone is still doing \u2018Arte Povera.\u2019\u2009\u201d Her work plays with disintegration over time. \u201cThe Man Who Fell to Earth,\u201d 2016, consists of two cubes of bright confetti, purple and red, which gradually fall apart \u2014 the confetti encircling the work like dust.The dwindling industrial heritage along with the burgeoning arts scene are only the latest version of the city\u2019s Janus-faced character. In 2006, Turin and its region played host to the Winter Olympics, providing an excuse to clean streets and revamp the city\u2019s image. Over aperitivo and snacks at a bar in one of the city\u2019s porticoes, Carlo Capello, an anthropologist at the University of Turin studying unemployment in former Fiat neighborhoods, told me that, since the Olympics, a general discourse of a \u201cchanging city\u201d had come into being, centered around the arts. This language had settled in, despite the persistence of real poverty: Twelve percent of the city\u2019s residents and 40 percent of its youth were unemployed, the highest level in northern Italy. \u201cThe center of the city has seen a lot of investment,\u201d Capello said. \u201cIt\u2019s insulated from the periphery.\u201dIn 2016, the peripheries had their revenge in the form of a political earthquake: The ruling center-left Democratic Party was defeated by Chiara Appendino, a young candidate from the populist Five Star Movement. She had run a campaign emphasizing a city \u201cdivided in two,\u201d as she noted in an advertisement. \u201cOn one side are the lines in front of the museums,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other, the lines in front of soup kitchens.\u201dThe growing divide between the art-focused and industry-focused cities may be irreconcilable. But in the gap, new institutions have emerged that take advantage of both. Cripta747, which is located in the immigrant and working-class Barriera di Milano, once occupied the basement of Franco Noero\u2019s nearby gallery, before finding a space of its own in 2015 in a warehouse. I spoke to Troiano and her co-founder, Renato Leotta, outside of the nondescript building, as they prepared for a panel discussion they were hosting on the new philosophical current of \u201cspeculative realism.\u201d When I asked them about the possibility of their contributing to the gentrification of the depressed neighborhood, Leotta bristled. \u201cI\u2019m quite critical of the idea, we\u2019re not interested in that,\u201d he told me. Instead, they found more value in the actually open-ended artist residencies, where the artists benefit from the local manufacturing expertise. Around us, in active warehouses, workers were moving around on forklifts.That had always been the hope of the arts in Turin: its uneasy and never stable amalgam of aristocratic connoisseurship, bourgeois finance and working-class know-how. The question is whether, under its current conditions, it might be resurrected, on a more egalitarian basis. I chatted with Cripta747\u2019s two current artists in residence, Sebastiano Impellizzeri and Corinna Gosmaro, both of whom were attracted to the city\u2019s cheapness and the sheer number of artists. It allowed for a \u201cstimulating exchange with others,\u201d Gosmaro said. Impellizzeri, a painter who had moved from Sicily, waved a cigarette in the darkening air, and lauded the beautiful light of the place, which gave it \u201ca real atmosphere for painting,\u201d he said. As he spoke, I had to dodge a forklift that was trundling toward me. I thought of Nietzsche\u2019s line \u2014 \u201cI would have never thought that the light could make a city so beautiful\u201d \u2014 which he wrote only some weeks before losing his mind. Did the painter know, I wanted to ask, about the white triangle and the black triangle?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former Dewey & LeBoeuf Executive Convicted in Split Verdict", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byNearly five years after the collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf, and roughly 20 months after a mistrial in an earlier criminal proceeding, prosecutors got a split decision on Monday in an accounting fraud case against two former executives of the once-mighty New York law firm.A jury in Manhattan convicted Joel Sanders, the law firm\u2019s former chief financial officer, on three criminal counts arising from what prosecutors said was a scheme to hide the firm\u2019s failing finances from financial backers.But another former executive on trial, Stephen DiCarmine, was acquitted of the same charges.The verdict came after five full days of deliberation by the jury in State Supreme Court in Lower Manhattan following a trial that began in January.The mixed emotions from the split verdict, announced late Monday afternoon, were on display in the courtroom.After the verdicts were read, Mr. DiCarmine was hugged by his lawyer, and the trial judge told him he was free to leave. Supporters of Mr. Sanders cried as his verdicts were read.As Mr. DiCarmine left the courtroom, his thoughts were on his co-defendant and former colleague. \u201cJoel is innocent,\u201d he said.The second trial took place with much less attention than the first, which was closely followed by New York lawyers given the spectacular nature of Dewey\u2019s collapse into bankruptcy in May 2012. Two years after the firm\u2019s fall, criminal charges were filed against some of its most senior executives.Andrew Frisch, a lawyer for Mr. Sanders, said his client would appeal.Dewey & LeBoeuf \u2014 which was created a decade ago from the merger of two storied law firms, Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae \u2014 once employed more than 1,300 lawyers. But the new firm quickly ran into trouble during the financial crisis that erupted soon after the merger.Manhattan prosecutors said that Mr. DiCarmine, 60, the firm\u2019s former executive director, and Mr. Sanders, 59, were part of a plot to manipulate the firm\u2019s financial records to defraud bank lenders and insurance companies that invested in a bond offering.The jury convicted Mr. Sanders, who could be sentenced to as many as four years in prison, on charges of securities fraud, scheme to defraud and conspiracy.In his charge to the jury on May 1, Justice Robert M. Stolz said Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders were on trial not for the financial collapse of Dewey but on charges that they sought to conceal the severity of its financial situation.Dewey represents one of the most significant white-collar cases Cyrus R. Vance Jr. has filed as Manhattan district attorney. The initial indictment had more than 100 charges. In bringing the case, Mr. Vance also announced his office had secured guilty pleas \u2014 most of them for misdemeanors \u2014 from seven low-level employees at the firm.But in the first proceeding, Justice Stolz declared a mistrial after the jury had deliberated for 21 days. That was something of an embarrassment for Mr. Vance given all the resources his office had invested in the case and the fanfare with which he had announced the indictments in March 2014.The split decision in the retrial gives Mr. Vance and his office some degree of vindication.In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance said he was \u201ccommitted to prosecuting financial criminals at all levels of an organization, whether it is a small business, a major corporation or a prestigious law firm.\u201dThe spokeswoman added that prosecutors were disappointed in the acquittal of Mr. DiCarmine \u201cbut respect the jury\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was insufficient\u201d to convict him.Mr. Frisch declined to speculate on why the jury found his client guilty but acquitted Mr. DiCarmine.One juror, Darryl Downing, a producer for the New Heritage Theatre Group in Harlem, said prosecutors did not make their case with Mr. DiCarmine but \u201cdid a much better job with Sanders.\u201d A fellow juror who did not give her name noted that Mr. DiCarmine did not appear on any incriminating emails introduced by prosecutors.Several jurors interviewed after the first trial said they had wrestled more with the evidence presented against Mr. Sanders.The second trial, while almost as long as the first one, was different in some important ways.A few months after the first trial, prosecutors whittled down the case by dismissing dozens of charges and entered into a five-year deferred-prosecution agreement with one of the defendants: Steven H. Davis, the firm\u2019s former chairman. Justice Stolz later tossed out the most serious larceny charges that Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders faced.A fourth man, Zachary Warren, had criminal charges against him dismissed in January under the terms of a deferred-prosecution agreement. Mr. Warren, who was a low-level employee at Dewey, is now a lawyer at Williams & Connolly in Washington.Prosecutors went to trial in the second proceeding with a slimmed-down case \u2014 just three charges against each man. But in other ways, this trial largely followed a similar script.The prosecution called more than 30 witnesses, including its star witness, Francis Canellas, Dewey\u2019s former finance director. Just as at the first trial, the defense did not call any witnesses, relying on the strength of its cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses to make its case.And a jury of eight women and four men \u2014 just as in the first trial \u2014 decided the fates of Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders. One juror was a lawyer at a large New York law firm.The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders that is pending.Mr. DiCarmine\u2019s lawyer, Rita Glavin of Seward & Kissel, said in the hallway outside the courtroom afterward that her client never did anything wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute joyous day for Stephen DiCarmine,\u201d she said.\u201cThis has gone on too long,\u201d she said. But then she added, \u201cThe fight continues for Mr. Sanders.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified who said that Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, was \u201ccommitted to prosecuting financial criminals at all levels of an organization\u201d and that prosecutors were disappointed in the acquittal of Mr. DiCarmine. It was a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, not Mr. Vance himself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foot Soldiers in a Shadowy Battle Between Russia and the West", "Date": "2017-05-28", "News": "Supported byMELNIK, Czech Republic \u2014 Working at his computer, as he does most weekends, on an anti-Western diatribe for a Czech website, Ladislav Kasuka was not sure what to make of the messages that began popping up on his Facebook page, offering him money to organize street protests.\u201cDo you need help?\u201d read the first message, written in Russian, from a person he did not know. This was followed, in a mix of Russian and garbled Czech, by gushing encouragement for street demonstrations and increasingly specific offers of cash.An initial payment of 300 euros ($368) was offered for Mr. Kasuka, a penniless Czech Stalinist, to buy flags and other paraphernalia for a protest rally in Prague, the Czech capital, against the NATO alliance and the pro-Western government in Ukraine. Later, he was offered \u20ac500 ($558) to buy a video camera, film the action and post the video online. Other small sums were also proposed.\u201cIt was all a bit unusual, so I was surprised,\u201d Mr. Kasuka recalled in a recent interview at a shopping mall north of Prague where he works on security and maintenance.He decided the cash \u201cwas for a good cause\u201d \u2014 halting the spread of NATO and capitalist Western ways into the formerly communist lands of Eastern Europe \u2014 so he accepted.The strange relationship that followed, consisting of passionate social media exchanges about politics and a total of \u20ac1,500 in cash transfers, was one of many forged across Eastern and Central Europe in summer 2014. They were part of a frenetic, though often clumsy, influence campaign financed from Moscow and directed by Alexander Usovsky, a Belarus-born writer, Russian-nationalist agitator and ideological hired gun in a shadowy battle for hearts and minds between Russia and the West.Compared with Russia\u2019s supposed meddling in the recent presidential elections in France and the United States, the activities of Mr. Kasuka and those like him are of little consequence. He belongs firmly to the fringe of Czech politics, and has never aspired to any higher office than local councilor in Melnik, the town north of Prague where he lives with his girlfriend in a graffiti-smeared housing block.Mr. Usovsky\u2019s focus was on marginal political players in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, and his efforts mostly fell flat. The protests organized by Mr. Kasuka and others attracted only handfuls of people. Pro-Russian websites that Mr. Usovsky helped to set up all fizzled. A Polish politician he was in touch with, Mateusz Piskorski, was arrested last year on suspicion of spying for Russia.None of that seemed to deter Mr. Usovsky, who was still pitching wild plans and detailed budgets to potential backers in Moscow early this year.After Mr. Usovsky managed to orchestrate only a few tiny demonstrations in Prague, Warsaw and other cities, an assistant to Mr. Malofeev demanded in October 2014 that Mr. Usovsky produce \u201ca clear, concrete and realistic plan for the coming to power of pro-Russian forces.\u201dMr. Malofeev declined to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman, Nadezhda Novoselova, said the billionaire and his staff had nothing to do with Mr. Usovsky.Mr. Malofeev has acquired a reputation as the Kremlin\u2019s version of George Soros, the Hungarian-American billionaire whom pro-Western forces across Eastern Europe often turn to for money. Unlike Mr. Soros, though, the wealthy Russians who support activists abroad generally try to keep their roles and spending secret. That allows the Kremlin to keep its distance as well.Mr. Malofeev has in the past insisted he supported only humanitarian work, not political trouble-making.Reports that Russia used cyberattacks and disinformation to meddle in the American election have persuaded many that Moscow runs a sophisticated influence machine. But interviews with several of Mr. Usovsky\u2019s collaborators, and the contents of his hacked computer, suggest that it was at times a more shambolic affair, hampered by money squabbles, intramural rivalries and absurdly distorted views of how politics works outside Russia.Jakub Janda, deputy director of European Values, a Western-financed research group in Prague that has tracked Russian influence campaigns, said that Mr. Usovsky seemed so far out of touch with reality that he might even be \u201ca decoy\u201d meant to make people say, \u201cLook, this whole Russia threat thing is just not serious.\u201dOthers, though, see Mr. Usovsky as evidence of Russia\u2019s mastery of plausible deniability and its willingness to bet on opportunists, no matter how slim their chances of success.Mr. Usovsky \u201cis a good case study in Russian methods,\u201d said Daniel Milo, a former official of the Slovakian Interior Ministry who is now an expert on extremism at Globsec, a research group in Bratislava, the Slovak capital. \u201cHe is a small cog in a big industry,\u201d Mr. Milo said. \u201cThere may be dozens more.\u201dMr. Usovsky declined to be interviewed for this article without being paid. But in response to emailed questions, he confirmed that his computer had been hacked, and he did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked messages.A resident of Vitebsk, near the Russian border with Belarus, Mr. Usovsky started his operation in 2014, riding a wave of nationalist fervor in Moscow after the annexation of Crimea and the widespread belief among Russia\u2019s political and business elite that united European backing for sanctions against Russia could be quickly dissolved.He set up a network of websites in various languages to promote Slavic unity, rented an office in Bratislava and established a sham foundation nominally dedicated to promoting culture.Asked by email how much money he had received from sponsors in Moscow, Mr. Usovsky initially denied receiving any. Then, when he was sent a copy of a message he had written in October 2014 detailing \u20ac100,000 he received to finance the \u201cpreparatory stage\u201d of his work in Eastern Europe, he stopped responding to inquiries.Other messages taken from his computer by hackers suggest that the money came from Mr. Malofeev. Mr. Usovsky badgered Mr. Malofeev\u2019s assistant for hundreds of thousands more euros in late 2014 and 2015, to finance pro-Russian candidates in Polish elections.Though he never even came close to bringing any pro-Russian groups to power, Mr. Usovsky was able to identify partners in Eastern and Central Europe ready to accept his help. He also showed a grasp of the internet\u2019s power to amplify fringe voices and make thinly attended demonstrations seem like major dramas. He worked closely with state-controlled Russian news outlets to ensure that the activities of his Czech, Slovak and Polish collaborators received extensive coverage.\u201cIt is totally crazy,\u201d said Roman Maca, an analyst based in Prague. \u201cPerviy Kanal presents as serious news a protest by 10 or so people who are mostly ready for the psychological hospital.\u201d He said Mr. Kasuka had become \u201cone of the best known Czechs in Russia, after our hockey players.\u201dOne person Mr. Usovsky did not want in the limelight, however, was himself. When a Slovak group, Peaceful Warrior, wanted to thank him publicly at a rally for his financial support, he swiftly vetoed the idea.After Mr. Malofeev, his main backer, cooled on his ambitious but unrealistic political plans, Mr. Usovsky grew increasingly desperate for money. He told Mr. Malofeev\u2019s assistant in March 2015 that his \u201cPolish friends\u201d needed \u20ac292,700 ($327,000) to win seats in Parliament. He also asked for \u20ac10,000 ($11,175) for Jobbik, a far-right Hungarian party, and \u20ac3,000 more for a neo-fascist paramilitary group called the Hungarian Guard.Apparently rebuffed by Mr. Malofeev, he peppered other prospective Russian donors with detailed plans for a \u201cpro-Russian fifth column,\u201d claiming that he could destroy \u201cEurope\u2019s anti-Russian front\u201d by channeling money to politicians who opposed NATO and the European Union. Among them were the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, headed by a former intelligence officer, and Konstantin Zatulin, a hard-line member of the Russian Parliament.Short of funds, Mr. Usovsky looked to Mr. Kasuka, the Czech Stalinist, as a low-cost project that could keep him in the game. Unlike Mr. Usovsky\u2019s Polish partners, Mr. Kasuka was not constantly asking for money, and had even turned some down when he ran for a seat on the Melnik town council in 2014.But Mr. Kasuka lost interest in street politics. Though he is still in touch with Mr. Usovsky on social media, he says he now concentrates on his writings about the risk of war, Stalin\u2019s achievements and the misery caused by capitalist exploitation.\u201cIt does not matter to me whether money comes from the Kremlin or from America, so long as it helps the cause,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is the idea.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Monday about Russian proxy support for fringe political figures in Central and Eastern Europe referred incorrectly to requests made to the office of a Russian billionaire for money to finance pro-Russian politicians in Polish elections. The requests came directly from Alexander Usovsky, a Belarus-born writer and agitator, not from an assistant.An article on Monday about Russian proxy support for fringe political figures in Central and Eastern Europe misstated the surname of an analyst who criticized extensive Russian media coverage of a small pro-Russia demonstration in Prague. He is Roman Maca, not Mica.Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow, Hana de Goeij from Prague, and Miroslava Germanova from Bratislava, Slovakia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Risks of U.S. Inaction on Climate Change", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Climate change is not an us-versus-them issue; it affects all of us, and it is the most critical issue that the world faces. While President Trump shows his ignorance on these matters, glaciers will continue to melt, ocean levels will rise and erratic weather patterns will worsen. With other contentious issues, such as health care, a wrong move might hurt many Americans for a few years but can be corrected by future administrations. But lack of action on climate change causes damage that is cumulative and largely irreversible within our life spans.The United States, as the second largest polluter in the world, after China, must reassert its leadership. Putting the coal industry on life support is not the way to achieve this.Kudos to California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, who is prepared to forcefully stand up to Washington and keep California on the right track. Encouraging innovation and building on the success of renewable energy is the way to a better future with many high-quality jobs that the Chinese would otherwise capture. A time will come \u2014 soon, I hope \u2014 when the truth about climate change will be undeniable, even to the president.To the Editor:As a California environmentalist, I am proud of the efforts of our state to address our most significant environmental and social justice issue \u2014 climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s meeting with China next month is good news because China and California will lead the technological and manufacturing pioneering needed to transition from fossil fuels in time to avoid bigger problems.But we need the rest of the country, made up of states with much smaller economies, to be engaged and supporting this effort, if for no other reason than to share in the millions of new jobs and businesses that will be created to meet the challenges ahead. It seems so illogical for the G.O.P., the party of business, and the president who wants to create jobs to ignore these realities. We need to put a national price on fossil fuels and return the proceeds to households.To the Editor:You rightly note that China and India are fast scaling up cleaner sources of electricity, particularly wind and solar power, raising questions about the United States\u2019 role. But your contention that \u201cChina and India are finding that doing right by the planet need not carry a big economic cost\u201d misses an important point. These two countries \u2014 like the United States \u2014 have been economically inefficient in many of the key policies and financial tools they have used to scale up renewable energy. The result: Renewable energy has cost more than it should.The writers are, respectively, the scholar-in-residence and executive director at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, Stanford University.To the Editor:I\u2019m ashamed, but not at all surprised, that the United States is among the few countries defending the fossil fuel industry and rejecting a common-sense conflict-of-interest policy at the global climate talks. After all, President Trump nominated \u2014 and the Senate confirmed \u2014 the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil to lead the State Department.In fact, your article highlights a need for action that extends far beyond the climate negotiations. Here in the United States, corporations pull the strings in nearly every area of our lives, shaping the food we eat, the air we breathe and the medicines we can afford. In the Trump era, many members of our government operate with immense conflicts between their loyalty to the private sector and the public-sector roles they now find themselves in.We would do well to follow the lead of countries like Uganda, whose delegation is calling for a \u201cstronger rule book\u201d to rein in corporate power at the climate talks. We have never needed that rule book more than today.RICHARD A. DAYNARD, BOSTONThe writer is a professor of law at Northeastern University.To the Editor:We find ourselves at an extraordinary moment in history. Climate change threatens to destabilize our planet and is predicted to force millions of people to flee their homes and their ways of life. And yet for too long, governments have not championed the systemwide solutions we so desperately need.One of the reasons policy makers in the global north have been so slow to act on the science of climate change is the stranglehold fossil fuel companies have over policy making. It is clear that the same companies that profit from oil, gas and hydraulic fracturing should not be allowed to write the rule book when it comes to global climate policy.As someone who has worked with many institutional investors divesting and protecting their assets from fossil fuels, I can say with certainty that change will not happen in time if we continue business as usual. We need policy makers operating in service of the global public good. For that reason, I applaud the governments that are calling for common-sense limits to the fossil fuel industry\u2019s access to the United Nations talks. We need their leadership now more than ever.ELLEN DORSEY, WASHINGTONThe writer is executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, a private family foundation that works on environmental, human rights and democracy issues.To the Editor:The evolution of Devon Energy into a major fossil fuel industry force with alarming influence over public health and environmental standards didn\u2019t start with Scott Pruitt\u2019s fox-guarding-the-henhouse takeover of the Environmental Protection Agency.It began decades ago, with wave after wave of deregulation and consolidation in the energy industry steadily building to the pro-polluter reality we see in Washington today.Peer-reviewed science now definitively shows that even tighter regulations on fossil fuel extraction and burning, like those proposed under the Obama administration, wouldn\u2019t be enough to stave off the worst effects of impending climate chaos.The next 10 years are critical for rapidly moving the country off polluting oil and gas, and on to a clean energy future. A logical place to spur this transition would be on federal lands, where fossil fuel extraction should be immediately curtailed, beginning with an outright ban on fracking.The writer, executive director of Food and Water Watch, is the author of \u201cFrackopoly: The Battle for the Future of Energy and the Environment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "NASA Denies Trump\u2019s Request to Send Astronauts Past the Moon on New Rocket", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byWhen NASA launches its new big rocket for the first time \u2014 more than a year and a half from now, at the earliest \u2014 there will be no astronauts along for the ride.On Friday, the space agency announced it would not. During a conference call with reporters, Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator, said the change was technically feasible, but that the additional cost, time and risks outweighed the benefits. \u201cIt really reaffirmed the baseline plan we have in place is the best way to go,\u201d he said.Even without that additional work, Mr. Lightfoot announced that the launch date has slipped again, to 2019 from the previous target of November 2018, because of various technical challenges and some bad luck. In February, a tornado struck the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana, where pieces of the rocket are being built, damaging the roof and equipment.\u201cThat really set us back in a big way,\u201d said William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for the human exploration and operations directorate at NASA.This month, a big dome-shaped piece at Michoud was badly damaged while being moved; it was to become the bottom of a liquid oxygen tank that will be used for testing. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not repairable,\u201d Mr. Gerstenmaier said. But there are additional domes, and Mr. Gerstenmaier said he did not expect that to add much to the delay.The construction of the European Space Agency\u2019s contribution to the rocket \u2014 a service module that will provide propulsion, power and supplies for the Orion capsule \u2014 is also behind schedule.NASA will now follow its original plan. For the first flight, Orion is to fly thousands of miles beyond the moon during a three-week trip. Mr. Gerstenmaier said one advantage of a crewless mission is that it will allow more thorough testing, closer to the edge of the capabilities of the spacecraft. \u201cWe will push as hard as we can,\u201d he said.The second flight, the first with astronauts, will come about three years later. It is scheduled for August 2021, but will also likely be delayed.The delays will add to the skepticism of those who think the Space Launch System and Orion will be obsolete by the time they get to the launchpad.SpaceX, the rocket company started by Elon Musk, is planning to finally launch this summer its long-delayed Falcon Heavy rocket. The Falcon Heavy is not as powerful as the Space Launch System, but with a $90 million price tag, far cheaper. The Space Launch System, which would launch only about once every two years, is estimated to cost $1 billion per mission.Blue Origin, a rocket company started by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is also developing a large rocket called New Glenn, which may begin launching as soon as 2020.The Trump administration\u2019s preliminary budget proposal for 2018 keeps NASA\u2019s financing level almost unchanged, while it includes deep cuts to many other agencies. The administration has not offered many details of its plans for NASA in the coming years.At a symposium in Washington this month about efforts to speed the development of much cheaper, fully reusable rockets, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has advised President Trump on various issues including space, described the Space Launch System as less capable than the Saturn 5 rocket that took astronauts to the moon in 1969, yet far more expensive.\u201cThe handwriting is on the wall,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cThose kinds of programs are going to look stupid.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jared Kushner\u2019s Sister Highlights Family Ties in Pitch to Chinese Investors", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 Jared Kushner has said that he has stepped away from the day-to-day business of his family\u2019s real estate company while he serves as a senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Trump.But Mr. Kushner\u2019s relatives are working feverishly to solicit overseas money for projects in the United States, and they are highlighting their ties to Mr. Kushner as they court investors.On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister Nicole Meyer made a pitch to attract $150 million in financing for a Jersey City housing development, known as One Journal Square, to more than 100 Chinese investors gathered at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing.The money would be provided through a much-criticized government program known as EB-5 that awards foreign investors a path to citizenship in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects.Speaking in a ballroom, Ms. Meyer said the project \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family.\u201d She mentioned her brother\u2019s service as chief executive of Kushner Companies, the family business from which he resigned in January, saying he had left to serve in the Trump administration.Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, declined to comment.Even as Mr. Kushner seeks to keep a distance from the family business in his new role, his persistent ties to the company have come under scrutiny.Mr. Kushner\u2019s government ethics disclosure form shows he was a manager or president at six entities associated with the Jersey City project until January. He divested his stake in one of them, K One Journal Square LLC, in January. It is unclear what happened with the other entities.\u201cMr. Kushner divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he is not a beneficiary of, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics,\u201d said Blake Roberts, an attorney at WilmerHale advising Mr. Kushner on ethics issues. \u201cAs previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program.\u201dHis relatives\u2019 embrace of the EB-5 program may also pose complications for Mr. Kushner. The program has been labeled \u201cU.S. citizenship for sale,\u201d and it has come under scrutiny after a series of fraud and abuse scandals. Watchdogs have noted the program\u2019s lax safeguards against illicit sources of money.Government ethics experts have criticized Mr. Kushner for retaining an interest in the business, given his broad White House portfolio, which could affect his financial position. The company has declined to make public a complete list of its partners and lenders.Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group, said the sales pitch by Kushner Companies in China was \u201chighly problematic\u201d and could be interpreted as selling access to Mr. Kushner. He called on Mr. Kushner to recuse himself from any decisions related to the EB-5 program.The program provides a cheap source of financing to developers, since investors are generally not looking for high returns, only a green card. Mr. Kushner raised about $50 million from Chinese investors for a different project in Jersey City, a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in November.Kushner Companies has declined to identify the investors it found through the program.On Saturday, Ms. Meyer talked about how family values had shaped Kushner Companies. She spoke of her grandparents, who survived the Holocaust, and about her father, Charles Kushner, who founded the company in 1985. He later spent time in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering.\u201cAs children we would spend our Sundays visiting properties with my father and staying up late through the night, by his side, when closing an acquisition,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cOur father taught us about respect for our partners, hard work, dedication and most importantly, perseverance.\u201dAs Ms. Meyer spoke, journalists for The New York Times and The Washington Post were removed from the ballroom and told by organizers it was a \u201cprivate event,\u201d even though it had been publicly advertised. It was hosted by Qiaowai, a Chinese immigration agency that helps Chinese families move abroad. Ms. Meyer is scheduled to appear in other Chinese cities in the coming days.Ms. Meyer was asked after the event whether she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother, but she did not respond. A man accompanying her, growing angry, shouted, \u201cPlease leave us alone!\u201dJavier C. Hern\u00e1ndez and Cao Li reported from Beijing, and Jesse Drucker from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Warning to Comey Prompts Questions on \u2018Tapes\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byThe suggestion that the president may be surreptitiously recording his meetings or telephone calls added a twist at the end of a week that roiled Washington. The president and his spokesman later refused to say whether he tapes his visitors, something Mr. Trump was suspected of doing when he was in business in New York.Mr. Trump denied the account, but it was not clear whether he was genuinely revealing the existence of clandestine recordings or simply making a rhetorical point that Mr. Comey\u2019s version of events was false.The Trump administration has offered conflicting answers about how and why the F.B.I. director, James Comey, was fired.Mr. Trump chose not to clarify when asked later in the day by Fox News if there were tapes of conversations. \u201cThat I can\u2019t talk about. I won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I want is for Comey to be honest.\u201dNo president in the past 40 years has been known to regularly tape his phone calls or meetings because, among other reasons, the recordings could be subpoenaed by investigators as they were during the Watergate investigation that ultimately forced President Richard M. Nixon to resign. Phone calls with foreign leaders are typically transcribed with the knowledge of other participants.Democrats were incredulous. \u201cFor a president who baselessly accused his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him, that Mr. Trump would suggest that he, himself, may have engaged in such conduct is staggering,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Representatives John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrats on the judiciary and oversight committees, sent a letter to the White House demanding copies of any recordings if they exist. The letter noted that \u201cit is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony.\u201dAsked if the president records his conversations, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, would not say. \u201cThe president has nothing further to add on that,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, repeating the answer or some variation of it several times as reporters pressed.He denied that the president was threatening Mr. Comey. \u201cThat\u2019s not a threat,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cHe simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself. I\u2019m moving on.\u201dMr. Comey made no comment, but later in the day he declined a request to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. According to a close associate of Mr. Comey, he is willing to testify, but wants it to be in public.The matter arose in a series of early-morning Twitter messages in which Mr. Trump appeared agitated over news reports on contradictory accounts of his decision to fire Mr. Comey, which came at the same time the F.B.I. is investigating ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia. Among other things, he threatened to cancel future White House briefings.Implicitly acknowledging that misinformation had been given out, Mr. Trump said Friday that no one should expect his White House to give completely accurate information.President Trump fired F.B.I. Director James B. Comey after asking him to announce that he was not personally under investigation. The president later told Russian officials that firing Mr. Comey had taken the pressure off.The threat may have been just a jab \u2014 Friday\u2019s briefing went forward as scheduled \u2014 but Mr. Trump later told Fox that he was thinking about it. \u201cUnless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don\u2019t have them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201dJeff Mason, a White House correspondent for Reuters and the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, objected. \u201cDoing away with briefings would reduce accountability, transparency and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the U.S. system, no political figure is above being questioned,\u201d he said.There is precedent for shutting down news briefings during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. The State Department for decades held daily briefings with only rare and brief interruptions, but such briefings have largely ended during the Trump administration.Allies and former employees of Mr. Trump have long said that he taped some of his own phone calls, as well as meetings in Trump Tower. During the campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides told reporters that they feared their offices were bugged and that they were careful about what they said.But the implicit threat to Mr. Comey was ripped from a familiar playbook that Mr. Trump relied on during the campaign to silence critics or dissent.\u201cIf this were an actual criminal investigation \u2014 in other words, if there were a prosecutor and a defense lawyer in the picture \u2014 this would draw a severe phone call to counsel warning that the defendant is at serious risk of indictment if he continues to speak to witnesses,\u201d Mr. Buell said. \u201cThus, this is also definitive evidence that Trump is not listening to counsel and perhaps not even talking to counsel. Unprecedented in the modern presidency.\u201dThe difference, according to Luke A. Nichter, a historian at Texas A&M University who has specialized in the tapes, is that \u201cNixon\u2019s rantings were done in private,\u201d and he did not cancel news briefings. \u201cThe reason I have a hard time with the label Nixonian is that we\u2019ve surpassed it,\u201d Mr. Nichter said. \u201cTo be Trumpian is something of a greater magnitude than simply being Nixonian.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s defenders have said that Watergate comparisons are overwrought and that there is no evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia during last year\u2019s election. The president has called the suspicions \u201cfake news\u201d concocted by sore-loser Democrats looking to explain a defeat.Reporting was contributed by Michael S.

{"Headline": "Housing Advocates Vow Sustained Protest of de Blasio Aide", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byFor months, protesters hounded Mayor Bill de Blasio at town hall-style meetings and fund-raisers from Manhattan to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., demanding that he shut down New York City\u2019s main jail complex on Rikers Island.Some advocates who have long complained that Mr. de Blasio\u2019s administration has not built enough low-income housing are now looking to follow a similar model with a campaign targeting their b\u00eate noire: the deputy mayor in charge of housing and economic development, Alicia K. Glen.The goal is to force Mr. de Blasio to shift course on his 10-year housing plan, which is on pace to create 200,000 units of new housing for low- to moderate-income residents across New York. Instead, advocates want the city to redirect funds toward building new homes for only the poorest New Yorkers, to stave off gentrification and, they hope, to help reduce homelessness.But no election-year incumbent wants a story line muddled by angry bands of roving protesters. That applies even to Mr. de Blasio, who enjoys a wide lead in polls against his likely opponents.\u201cThe mayor is going to be re-elected; let\u2019s be real here,\u201d said Bertha Lewis, a former supporter of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s who has become one of his most vocal critics. \u201cSo our job is to push as hard to challenge him, not just go along to get along.\u201dIn addition to protests, Mr. Martin said, his group engaged in \u201cpower mapping\u201d the mayor \u2014 identifying roughly 1,500 people most important to him and targeting them with digital messages \u2014 so that Mr. de Blasio would feel surrounded by its campaign. \u201cWe logged 20,000 tweets to the mayor in one day alone,\u201d Mr. Martin said.The housing advocates \u2014 a coalition of groups under the banner Real Affordability for All \u2014 are looking to emulate the approach favored by the anti-Rikers protesters. \u201cThe mayor would not have changed course without that campaign,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of New York Communities for Change. \u201cThe housing stuff and the criminal justice stuff are the two weak spots for the mayor.\u201dSo far, Mr. de Blasio has not shown enough political weakness for a prominent challenger to emerge from the left. Most of his rivals, both in his own party and among Republicans, have opted for more centrist campaigns to unseat him; the only one to challenge from the left is a police reform advocate, Robert Gangi, 73, a Democrat who has never before held public office or run a political campaign.Melissa Grace, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the targeted protests had not affected the administration\u2019s policies in any way. \u201cThis has been their strategy for more than two years \u2014 and it has had zero impact,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating and protecting more affordable housing, including more homes for the lowest-income New Yorkers, than at any time since Mayor Koch.\u201dMs. Grace added, \u201cResorting to personal attacks means you\u2019ve run out of honest arguments.\u201dThe new effort does go further in attacking Ms. Glen, accusing her of bringing a Goldman Sachs model of development to City Hall. To buttress the argument, activists compiled a report looking at projects created by three developers \u2014 L&M Development Partners, BRP Development Corporation and BFC Partners \u2014 that worked with Ms. Glen both before and after she joined the de Blasio administration.The projects, the report argues, fuel gentrification and do not provide enough housing for residents who already live in places like East Harlem and Flatbush, Brooklyn.The companies disputed the notion that they received special treatment during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure or that they ignored community demands. \u201cWe work on the ground with communities to build what they tell us is appropriate,\u201d Ron Moelis, the chief executive of L&M, said in a statement. \u201cOur city needs affordable homes across a wide economic spectrum, and we do our best to respond.\u201dThe city has said the market-rate units in the armory project are necessary to offset the cost of the recreational center. And officials disagreed with the idea that affordable housing projects exacerbate gentrification.\u201cThere\u2019s no real evidence or research to back that up,\u201d said James Patchett, president of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation and Ms. Glen\u2019s former chief of staff, who also worked at Goldman Sachs. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that a 50 percent affordable project is ever bad. I fundamentally reject that.\u201dThose pushing the protest strategy say that it has already been effective for them \u2014 a notion that the city disputes.The mayor announced in February that he would add $1.9 billion more in city subsidies to include 10,000 more affordable units for New Yorkers earning less than $40,000 a year, bringing the total number of such units in the plan to 50,000 \u2014 one quarter of the 200,000 total. The city is now set to spend about $10 billion in subsidies on the overall housing plan, city officials said.Yet not all advocates of more affordable housing are on board with personalizing the campaign for more low-income housing.Javier H. Vald\u00e9s of Make the Road New York, an immigrant rights and social justice organization, said that Mr. Westin had approached him about joining the campaign against Ms. Glen and he declined.\u201cIt has not been our fight,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mandate comes from the mayor and that\u2019s who needs to set the tone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner Family Stands to Gain From Visa Rules in Trump\u2019s First Major Law", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byJust hours after the appropriations measure was signed on Friday, the company run until January by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, was urging wealthy Chinese in Beijing to consider investing $500,000 each in a pair of Jersey City luxury apartment towers the family-owned Kushner Companies plans to build. Mr. Kushner was even cited at a marketing presentation by his sister Nicole Meyer, who was on her way to China even before the bill was signed. The project \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family,\u201d she told the prospective investors.The sequence of events offers one of the most explicit examples to date of the peril of the Trump and Kushner families maintaining close ties to their business interests and creates an impression they stand to profit off Mr. Trump\u2019s presence in the White House. It also illustrates the problems of the so-called EB-5 visa program that prominent Republican and Democratic members of Congress want changed.Bipartisan critics in Washington say they want to revamp the visa program because it is often abused. It supports high-end luxury projects, like the Kushner family deal, instead of promoting job creation in rural America or distressed urban areas, as it was intended. It has also been criticized by federal regulators for insufficient safeguards against illicit money coming into the United States; in the case of one applicant, they found potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels.There is no assertion that Mr. Kushner broke any conflict-of-interest rule; but the law does not prevent his relatives from attempting to exploit those ties to benefit the family business.In fact, Kushner Companies \u2014 when Mr. Kushner was still at the helm \u2014 had received $50 million in EB-5 financing for a separate New Jersey project, a Trump-branded luxury high-rise tower in Jersey City that opened late last year.After a surge in attention to the topic over the weekend, a spokesman for Mr. Trump said on Monday that the president also endorses changes to the visa program, including perhaps increasing the price foreigners must pay to get the special immigration status. A White House statement said the administration \u201cis evaluating wholesale reform of the EB-5 program to ensure that the program is used as intended and that investment is being spread to all areas of the country.\u201dThe statement also said that Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, has recused himself from EB-5 related matters: \u201cJared takes the ethics rules very seriously and would never compromise himself or the administration.\u201d In a statement from Kushner Companies, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister said it was not her intent to mention her brother as a way to lure investors.But the matters involving Mr. Kushner, the White House and Kushner Companies are different. None of those previous presidential relatives took jobs in the White House while simultaneously benefiting from a multibillion-dollar business with international partners, who also stand to benefit from federal programs.Although Mr. Kushner has shed stakes in some of the company\u2019s investments, he has retained most of his interest, as the main beneficiary of a series of trusts invested in the firm\u2019s various projects. His stake, along with some other investments, is worth as much as $600 million, and possibly much more, according to a government ethics disclosure form made public by Mr. Kushner in March. But Kushner Companies has declined to make public a list of its partners.When it was created in 1990, the EB-5 visa program was intended to provide a new source of financing for projects in underserved areas, defined as places with high unemployment. But there are no federal standards for defining such neighborhoods. And developers often provide gerrymandered maps to qualify under the program.The Kushner project in Jersey City \u201cis a textbook example of the abuses we have seen in the last six or seven years,\u201d said Shae Armstrong, a Dallas lawyer who has joined with members of Congress, including Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Ms. Feinstein, to call for changes in the program.That part of Jersey City, less than three miles from Manhattan, is hardly an economically depressed area, and a luxury apartment building is going to create few permanent jobs. \u201cAnd it is why other towns in rural America are not getting EB-5 money,\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.Indeed, in the Beijing presentation delivered by Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister, the firm cited the high household income of the majority of the residents \u2014 between $100,000 and $200,000 \u2014 in the Trump-branded building that has already received EB-5 financing.The $1 billion Kushner project at the center of the current controversy is a set of high-rise towers \u2014 including 1,730 apartments and 89,000 square feet of retail space. The company is seeking $150 million through the EB-5 program.Traditional lenders can charge interest of 12 to 18 percent, said Gary Friedland, a professor at New York University who has written extensively about the program. But EB-5 loans can wind up costing developers as little as 4 percent, he said.\u201cThe immigrant investor\u2019s primary purpose is to secure a visa, so they accept minimal interest, as low as half a percent,\u201d Mr. Friedland said.For developers, said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, the appeal of EB-5 can be summed up in two words: \u201cCheap money.\u201dEric Lipton reported from Washington, and Jesse Drucker from New York.

{"Headline": "Big Payoff After Blackstone Courted a Saudi Prince", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byA little over a year ago, the private equity titan Stephen A. Schwarzman sat down with Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia and chairman of the kingdom\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, in hopes of expanding their relationship.Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s company, the Blackstone Group, already counted Prince bin Salman\u2019s Public Investment Fund as a major client. But the American financier now had a bold new idea: Court Saudi money to invest in projects like tunnels, bridges, airports and other sorely needed infrastructure improvements, predominantly in the United States.That investment vehicle, which Blackstone plans to double in size, represents a new focus for the firm. More important, the fund \u2014 announced during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and a summit meeting of global chief executives that Mr. Schwarzman attended \u2014 dovetails with a $1 trillion infrastructure initiative the Trump administration has promised, to be fueled by government partnerships with the private sector.\u201cNo one else is in all the categories of infrastructure, in all the regions of the world and all the different classes of infrastructure,\u201d Hamilton E. James, Blackstone\u2019s president, said in an interview after the deal was announced on Saturday. \u201cSo I think we have an opportunity to establish overnight a leadership position.\u201dIndeed, less than a week after the Public Investment Fund\u2019s contribution was revealed, Blackstone\u2019s marketing to other investors has already begun.But its pitch will be made in a crowded field. The low interest rates that led to richly valued stock and bond markets have made infrastructure investing increasingly attractive, and others are seeking similar opportunities.There may also be political hurdles. Blackstone\u2019s $40 billion push and others like it appear to be a bet that the Trump administration, while troubled by its own brand of volatility, will be able to unleash a wave of spending on roads, bridges and other public projects.Investments in projects like bridges and roads \u2014 either by taking stakes in existing infrastructure or by putting up money to build something new \u2014 are, by nature, often longer-term than the corporate buyouts and real estate deals that are typically associated with private equity firms.Yet they also have the benefit of being less volatile investments that produce steady returns.Infrastructure investments average returns of 10 percent a year, according to the data provider Preqin: less than an investment in a basket of stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index would have generated for much of the past decade, but without the wrenching ups and downs of the public market.\u201cThe appetite for infrastructure investing is really strong, and investors are currently looking to increase their exposure right now,\u201d said Tom Carr, an expert in infrastructure investing at Preqin. \u201cThe returns have been very stable, and because these are long-term investments, they sit very well in the portfolios of pension funds and insurance companies.\u201dIn North America, the territory where much of the infrastructure money is raised, fund-raising activity has been on a tear in recent years, with infrastructure investors now overseeing $376 billion, Preqin calculates.Still, there is a long road ahead. Private-sector investing in infrastructure is a nascent business in the United States, compared with countries like Canada and Australia.And while Mr. Trump has vowed to streamline the permitting process for construction projects and has proposed a budget earmarking $200 billion for infrastructure over the next 10 years, his handling of an F.B.I. investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia has raised doubts about what he can accomplish in Washington.Private equity experts also cautioned that the commitment of such a large sum to one fund by a single investor, as in Saudi Arabia\u2019s case, is highly unusual. While Blackstone will be making the investment decisions, navigating the merits of various deals with such a large and influential partner will add complexities that more diversified funds do not face.Some of those are practical, and others optical.\u201cIf I\u2019m driving from here to New York, do the tolls I pay contribute to the improvement of the roads I\u2019m on? Or is it returned to the Public Investment Fund?\u201d asked Simon Henderson, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has written extensively about the Saudi royal family and its economic plans. \u201cIn domestic political terms, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201dBlackstone executives say they are undaunted by the political opposition Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts may face, and note that their infrastructure fund plans began when Hillary Clinton was generally regarded as the most likely next president.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can wait or expect Washington to fundamentally change its ways,\u201d said Mr. James, who raised money for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cSo we try to set up our business to thrive regardless of what happens down there.\u201dHe added that, despite his boss\u2019s advisory role in the Trump administration, the White House was not involved in Blackstone\u2019s deal with the Saudis.Farther from the presidential limelight, Blackstone\u2019s competitors have managed to profit and grow in an environment that is widely regarded as cumbersome for infrastructure projects, which often require dozens of legal permits and years of waiting.Attractive infrastructure investments can vary. Some deals involve existing assets, like taking stakes in airports or major shipping ports with the aim of building up value and then locking in profits with a sale.Other projects, such as gas pipelines and power generation plants, have longer life cycles, with a fund \u2014 often with a partner in tow \u2014 backing investments at the start-up phase.That firm, founded by Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a former top banker at Credit Suisse, is the second-largest player in the private equity infrastructure sector, according to Infrastructure Investor, a trade publication. Founded in 2006, the company now manages $40 billion and, like Blackstone, recently announced its own record capital raising, with a new $15.8 billion fund.Mr. Ogunlesi is well connected, too. A member of the president\u2019s advisory council led by Mr. Schwarzman, he is also the lead director on the board of Goldman Sachs, where a number of the president\u2019s top aides once worked.He declined, through a spokesman, to comment for this article. But in a recent interview with Infrastructure Investor, Mr. Ogunlesi was measured in his assessment of the White House.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything encouraging about the direction of the Trump administration, it\u2019s that they want to streamline the regulatory approval process in the U.S., which I think is necessary, and I don\u2019t think they need to be less concerned about the environment,\u201d he said, in a nod to the regulatory hurdles that have thwarted a number of infrastructure projects.But then the financial crisis hit, investor appetite dried up, and the recently hired infrastructure specialists left and started their own fund, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, in 2011, leaving Blackstone without a dedicated infrastructure fund for years.This week, Blackstone named Sean Klimczak, a senior managing director from the firm\u2019s private equity group who had been involved in corporate infrastructure projects as part of that job, to lead its new effort. With the $20 billion from the Saudis, an expected $20 billion from other outside investors, and the possibility of borrowed capital to finance individual projects, Blackstone hopes to generate up to $100 billion in total spending power.Blackstone executives say they are in the early stages of identifying potential infrastructure investments and most likely will not pin down specific projects for weeks to come.Those could range from schools and hospitals to highways, airports and bridges, depending on where the need and the potential returns are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Johnson Delves Into His Personal History as Candidate for Governor", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byNEWARK \u2014 The journey that led Jim Johnson to a candidate forum here on a recent weeknight sponsored by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began months ago inside a church in Montgomery, Ala.It was the same church that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. attended and it was part of a tour of civil rights monuments across the South that Mr. Johnson, 56, embarked on with his eldest daughter. As the son of a church organist, Mr. Johnson feels at home in a church, and he struck up a conversation with one congregation member.\u201cHe said to me, \u2018You know, I\u2019m listening to you talk, I\u2019m seeing how you are, you made your money, you\u2019ve got your house, your car, your kids are taken care of, you have the nice clothes, but there\u2019s something burning in your heart,\u2019\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said the man paused before offering his advice: \u201c\u2018Do that.\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u201d became running for the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey. Yet, as a candidate whose nascent political career was spurred by a civil rights trip and who is the only black candidate in the field, Mr. Johnson had to overcome an initial reluctance to delve too deeply into his personal journey.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a story of sort of something that\u2019s deeply personal than a policy issue,\u201d he said of his trip to the South. \u201cAnd for me, while it\u2019s core, people often seem to be interested in other issues.\u201dBut now, whether it is becoming more comfortable discussing his personal experiences on race or a recognition that with less than two weeks to go until the June 6 primary election he is facing daunting odds, Mr. Johnson has begun to lower his guard and get more personal.In the final televised debate recently, Mr. Johnson talked about criminal justice reform and recalled the first time he ever received \u201cthe talk.\u201d\u201cI was about 6 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cThe talk was this: I was going to the store and my mom said to me, \u2018It\u2019s great you can go to the store by yourself, but remember when you leave, make sure whatever you\u2019re getting, Bazooka bubble gum, goes in the bag and you get a receipt.\u2019 I knew from that point on that criminal justice was not fair for all of us.\u201dHe also described volunteering at a prekindergarten class and seeing the class disadvantages some black and Hispanic students faced. It is one reason, he says, he supports universal pre-K.And at a fund-raiser this month in West Orange sponsored by a gay rights group, he shared the story of his family, noting that he has been married twice, first to a black woman and now to a white woman.\u201cThe issues of bringing people together are for me existential issues for my family,\u201d he recalled telling the donors. \u201cMy children are black. My stepchildren are not. And you have within our family Jews, the descendants of a soldier in Hitler\u2019s army, a descendant of the Mayflower, and the descendants of people who were stolen from Africa and came right off the Middle Passage, and we\u2019re all at the same table after multiple generations within the United States. And we have to confront that not only because of the different ways we see the world with different ways the world sees us. And so we make it work.\u201dHe has also built a campaign that he says he believes puts core values of the civil rights movement \u2014 justice and equality \u2014 at the heart of his platform. He has called for an extensive ethics overhaul to break up the power broker world of New Jersey politics, with calls to eliminate no-bid contracts, ban contributions from lobbyists and require all political groups to list their contributors. And whatever issue he is promoting \u2014 affordable housing, education, criminal justice \u2014 he frames as it as a means of providing equal opportunity.Mr. Johnson tends to speak softly, but sternly, and his reserved, self-described wonkish style doesn\u2019t result in soaring speeches or viral moments meant to captivate voters who have remained largely apathetic about the race.While Mr. Johnson surprised some in the state by becoming the first candidate to qualify for public financing, he has been dwarfed by Mr. Murphy.Mr. Johnson also would have to overcome historical trends \u2014 African-Americans represent about 15 percent of New Jersey\u2019s population and the state has never elected a black governor. And the United States has elected only two African-American governors \u2014 Deval Patrick of Massachusetts in 2006, and Douglas Wilder of Virginia in 1989.History, however, doesn\u2019t concern Mr. Johnson.\u201cI\u2019ve lived life very much, some people would say, on the tip of the spear because it\u2019s frequently that I\u2019m the only African-American in certain rooms,\u201d he said.While he has had to invest much of his time introducing himself to voters, some of those at the N.A.A.C.P. forum here at Essex County College recalled meeting Mr. Johnson in the past.\u201cHe participated in a program we had three years ago on knowing your voting rights and engaging in politics,\u201d said Dawn Manning, of West Orange.While she has not decided who she will support on Election Day, Ms. Manning, 48, was happy to see Mr. Johnson onstage.\u201cI was pleasantly surprised, I\u2019ll say, to hear that he was a candidate,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cbecause I thought at that time, he was someone who ought to be serving our state.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fabulous Apple Cash Machine", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byStrategiesGreat things are expected of the most valuable company on the planet.Apple, which has a world-beating market capitalization of $776 billion, is still meeting those expectations, but barely. And that could cause headaches down the road for investors and for the stock market as a whole.Apple shares, among the most widely held in the world, hit a new record on Friday, yet the company\u2019s sales have been so-so and no new game-changing gadgets other than a revamped iPhone are in sight.In a nutshell, after a stumble in 2016, Apple started to grow again late in the year and continued to do so in the first three months of this one, but not by much. Revenue in the first quarter was 5 percent higher than over the same period a year earlier \u2014 a respectable but hardly eye-popping performance, and one that won\u2019t restore Apple\u2019s old reputation as a paradigmatic \u201cgrowth company.\u201dYet Apple\u2019s stock rose last week, after increasing more than 28 percent this year. The company generates profits on a barely conceivable scale. So what\u2019s the problem? It is simply that Apple\u2019s standing in the stock market has largely been built on that aging little object, the iPhone.A major iPhone rejuvenation is expected in September, the 10th anniversary of its birth. That is likely to spur greater sales, for a while at least. But how long can the iPhone wield its financial magic, and will the company come up with another invention with awesome monetary powers?It may seem unfair to quibble this way, given Apple\u2019s technological accomplishments and financial position. The company makes useful and reliable, if expensive, products. I\u2019m typing on a Mac, have an iPhone in my pocket and an iPad tucked away in my backpack, and all have served me well. The Apple Watch has its aficionados, though I\u2019m not one of them. But whatever your relationship with Apple devices, the company has not come up with a technological game changer in years.\u201cApple is the greatest corporate cash machine in history,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe should appreciate that amazing achievement. The problem is, it\u2019s not growing much. It\u2019s a slow-growth cash-generating machine.\u201dOn Tuesday, the company provided fresh details of how great a cash machine it is. In just three months, after expenses and investments and payouts to shareholders, Apple\u2019s already colossal pile of cash and marketable securities grew another $10.8 billion, reaching a nearly unfathomable $256.8 billion.In the scheme of things, how big is that? Consider that $256.8 billion is more than the value of every other American company except Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S & P Dow Jones Indices.But there is little sign right now that Apple intends to dispose of its money that way, in a gigantic acquisition. Instead, the company announced on Tuesday that it would expand its program of returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The numbers here, too, are so immense that they are hard to grasp.In a conference call with stock analysts, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that since 2012, Apple\u2019s buybacks and dividends amounted to $211.2 billion: The buybacks alone total $151 billion. Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201dAll of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business. We\u2019re in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.\u201dToni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said a favorable tax deal could add another $9 or so to Apple\u2019s shares, which are now trading at about $149. The expected redesign of the iPhone should also help the stock in the next several months, he said, because \u201cwe\u2019ve found that Apple\u2019s share price rises in the three to six months before the new phone comes out.\u201d Apple stock is in that sweet spot now, he said.Like Mr. Damodaran, however, he remains skeptical about Apple\u2019s longer-term growth prospects. \u201cThe company is so big that it takes a lot to move the needle for growth,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view. Back in February, when Apple shares were still trading at $130, he calculated Apple\u2019s value based on metrics like cash flow and declared that the company was \u201cfully deserving of its market value.\u201d But when the stock price reached $140, he sold his own shares. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great company,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the price.\u201dIt isn\u2019t a crazy price, not if you expect that Apple will remain disciplined and highly profitable and, maybe, even have another growth spurt next year. But unless the old Apple magic returns, the company right now is not a bargain.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

His wife died four years ago, but he shares the house with their daughter and grandson.He could move to a single-floor apartment or an assisted living facility, but like most older people, he wants to stay put. \u201cI have a lot of good memories here,\u201d he said.The center has looked at three of the most important accessibility features that allow people to move safely around their living spaces: entrances without steps, single-floor living, and wide hallways and doorways that can accommodate wheelchairs.\u201cLess than 4 percent of the U.S. housing stock has all three of those,\u201d said Jennifer Molinsky, a senior research associate at the center.Add two more important elements for aging in place \u2014 doors with lever handles, and light switches and electrical outlets that can be reached from a wheelchair \u2014 and the proportion drops to 1 percent.You\u2019ll often hear older people vow that they won\u2019t leave their homes except \u201cfeet first.\u201d Without modifications, however, the design of most older Americans\u2019 homes could eventually thwart their owners\u2019 desire to stay in them.Solving that problem, individually or collectively, means confronting certain obstacles.I asked how many it would take to serve all the older and disabled Americans who want to age in place. \u201cTen times the number we have now,\u201d he said. Moreover, participants in the program remain unevenly distributed, clustered in cities.\u201cShe\u2019s better at spotting problems than I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I come in and make the changes based on what she suggests.\u201dA survey of remodelers last year by the National Association of Home Builders found that the most common aging-in-place modifications were bathroom grab bars and higher toilets, followed by curbless showers, widened doorways and added lighting.\u201cIf your aging mother is going to come live with you, you can pour a gently sloping sidewalk to your front door\u201d that allows her to enter without climbing steps, Mr. Bawden pointed out. \u201cBut a zero-step entrance is also good for a mom with twins in a stroller.\u201dYet even as more professionals enter the field, costs present a major barrier.Though prices vary by location, most CAPS remodelers can install two grab bars for a modest $200 to $300. Figure $60 to $90 to replace a doorknob with an easier-to-maneuver lever, Mr. Bawden said, and $175 to $250 for every relocated light switch or outlet.But replacing a tub with a roll-in shower will run $8,000 to $10,000, he said. A new bathroom incorporating universal design elements could top $25,000.Homeowners will find scant government help with that expense. Some states reimburse homeowners through tax credits or Medicaid, and the Department of Veterans Affairs offers some grants. (It is paying the bill for Mr. Goldberg\u2019s $7,900 renovation, for instance, and buying the new stair lift.)\u201cHow do we structure these programs so they\u2019re available not just to the few, but to the many?\u201d Mr. Trudeau asked. \u201cC.M.S.\u201d \u2014 the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency \u2014 \u201cneeds to start thinking about this.\u201dAnother obstacle is homeowners\u2019 own discomfort with aging and the changes it brings. Some start adapting their homes before they need to, but others resist.\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest hurdle to overcome, is someone admitting they need these modifications,\u201d Mr. MacNeill said. \u201cThe adult children see the writing on the wall, but the parent is saying: \u2018I don\u2019t need that. I\u2019ll be all right.\u2019\u201dYet older adults are fervent remodelers: Those over age 55 account for more than half of all home improvement spending, the Harvard study reported.Her 66-year-old client wasn\u2019t particularly interested in making her home more accessible. But Ms. Masiello tactfully pointed out the attractiveness of contemporary grab bars (she used polished nickel) and made sure the new refrigerator had a freezer on the bottom.She suggested textured kitchen floors that wouldn\u2019t be slippery. And because aging eyes can lose depth perception, the color of the kitchen counters contrasts with the floor.Her client was delighted. \u201cI imagine I could live here forever,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

At the front of lecture halls hang smiling portraits of his father and grandfather, who led the nation before him.While the university\u2019s chancellor, Park Chan-mo, said the arrests were not related to the teachers\u2019 work at the school, the men were accused of \u201chostile acts,\u201d a charge that is often used against people accused of spying or proselytizing.That effectively makes them bargaining chips in the high-stakes conflict between Pyongyang and Washington. As Mr. Kim pursues a destabilizing nuclear weapons program and the Trump administration warns that the time for \u201cstrategic patience\u201d is over, the school gives the regime access to a rare commodity in their country: American citizens.The volunteers\u2019 arrests have also cast a light on the school and the ways in which critics say it has, perhaps inadvertently, aided the regime.Some of those critics say the school is training the future elite of a dictatorial regime that abuses human rights and threatens its neighbors with nuclear weapons. Right-wing activists in South Korea accuse the school of educating future hackers.The school \u201ccannot operate in North Korea without making compromises to the regime \u2014 either in money or information \u2014 and I am uncomfortable with the extent of such a compromise,\u201d said Suki Kim, who taught English at the university in 2011 as a journalist working undercover. She later described her experience in the book \u201cWithout You, There Is No Us.\u201dMany of those compromises are apparent on campus.Students march to the cafeteria singing songs swearing loyalty to Mr. Kim. Course materials have to be approved by the North Korean authorities, who have their own staff members installed on campus. Faculty members must have \u201cguides\u201d with them when they venture off campus.While the foreign faculty has unfiltered access to the internet, most students do not. Teachers have to watch what they say \u2014 students are required to report any subversive comments.One American professor was deported for trying to give a student a Bible.An obelisk at the university, erected by the North Korean authorities and dedicated to Mr. Kim\u2019s grandfather and father, has drawn scorn from outside observers.\u201cKorean churches have ended up building a temple of idol worship there,\u201d said the Rev. Lee Ho, the leader of the anti-Communist Holy Korea Network.The university said the monument and other state propaganda were \u201cobligatory,\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d elements of all schools and other official establishments in North Korea.For the staff of about 90 foreign volunteers from a dozen or so countries, teaching at the university is a chance to gain a foothold in an atheistic country by befriending future North Korean leaders and teaching them an international mind-set.The volunteers mingle and eat with the 500 or so handpicked students, who live on the campus. Together with their families, the staff members constitute the single largest foreign community in North Korea.The teachers, many of whom are Korean-American missionaries, are allowed to practice their faith among themselves. But the one inviolable rule is that they are not allowed to proselytize.\u201cWe want to teach the North Koreans how to catch fish, rather than giving them fish,\u201d said Mr. Park, also a Korean-American and a former president of South Korea\u2019s prestigious Pohang University of Science and Technology. \u201cThis will help narrow the economic gap between the two Koreas and the cost of the eventual reunification.\u201dThae Yong-ho, a North Korean diplomat who defected to the South last year, said the university was popular among the children of the elite and taught them market principles in a country desperate to modernize its economy. Mr. Thae also dismissed the allegation that the school was training future hackers.And the university continues to grow, with plans to add a new medical school to the campus in southern Pyongyang.Despite being in the spotlight, the school is trying to play down the significance of the volunteers\u2019 arrests.One of the detainees, Kim Sang-duk, an accounting teacher who is also known as Tony Kim, had frequently visited the northeast, where he distributed humanitarian aid to children\u2019s homes and recently delivered 20,000 blankets to flood victims, school officials said.The other, Kim Hak-song, a Christian pastor, supervised an experimental farm on campus, visiting for a month at a time from China, where he worked as a missionary for a Los Angeles church, according to school officials and the church\u2019s website.Both were detained as they were trying to leave the country. The government has provided no further details on their cases, including whether they are linked.\u201cWe were told that their detentions had nothing to do with what they did at the school and that otherwise they would have been arrested on the school ground,\u201d Mr. Park said during an interview in Seoul, the South Korean capital. \u201cWe are praying for them.\u201dThe school has reminded its faculty of local rules, but otherwise life there continues in a \u201cperfectly normal manner,\u201d the school said in a statement for this article. Several volunteers from the school have left North Korea in recent days, as planned and without incident, it said.The university also says it takes care not to violate United Nations sanctions.\u201cWe are in regular dialogue with officials in the U.S. and other administrations on this point, including sharing details of our curriculum,\u201d the statement said.When the university\u2019s founder, Kim Chin-kyung, who is also known as James Kim, visits South Korean churches to raise money, he asks congregants to \u201cpay a price\u201d for reunification and for their fellow Koreans suffering in the North, an appeal that resonates with many Christians in the South.He argues that reconciliation is the only way to achieve reunification of the divided Korea, and that Christian love can help nurture it.Whether or not that works, the school has surely opened the minds of some students a bit simply by allowing them contact with foreigners.Will Scott, an American computer scientist who taught there from 2013 to 2015, said some of his students admitted to \u201chaving nightmares\u201d when they first met teachers from the United States, a country they had learned to demonize from childhood.But the students were eventually able to channel their hatred toward the American government and came to accept the individuals they met there.But the government tries to reinforce loyalty, requiring the students to take a class on the state ideology of juche, or self-reliance, every Saturday.When Chancellor Park complained that the class would not give students enough time to do their homework, he said, a North Korean administrator had a pointed retort.\u201cMr. Chancellor,\u201d he said, \u201cyou yourself go to church every week, don\u2019t you?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kushner Companies Backs Out of Chinese Investor Events After Furor", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 The real estate company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, said on Friday that its employees would no longer take part in a cross-country roadshow in China this month.Executives from Kushner Companies, including Nicole Meyer, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister, were expected to appear in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou and the central city of Wuhan this month, according to ads for the events.But after an uproar, the company and its Chinese partner said on Friday that Kushner Companies would no longer be present at those events, although it will continue to actively court investors.The company is seeking $150 million in financing for a New Jersey housing development through a program that gives foreigners who invest at least $500,000 a shot at green cards, which allow permanent residence in the United States. The overall sum represents about 15 percent of the total cost of the property project.On Friday, Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said its employees would no longer participate in the roadshow after taking part in meetings in Beijing and Shanghai last weekend.The Chinese partner of Kushner Companies, an immigration agency named Qiaowai, said on Friday that the meetings this month would go forward, but that no one from Kushner Companies would attend. Qiaowai had marketed the Kushner family\u2019s visit as a five-city tour over two weeks, ending in Wuhan. The Chinese firm will still give presentations on the New Jersey project, field questions on the investor visa program and solicit investments.Ms. Meyer added a star turn to efforts by Kushner Companies to raise money in China. Mr. Kushner is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s elder daughter, Ivanka. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, fascination with his family has grown in China, especially as Mr. Kushner has become a power broker in relations between Washington and Beijing.Speaking at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing on Saturday, Ms. Meyer said the New Jersey project, called One Journal Square, \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family.\u201d She said Mr. Kushner, who resigned as chief executive of the company in January, was now serving in the White House.The roadshow also raised questions about the investor visa program known as EB-5, which has been plagued by fraud and abuse scandals and is likely to be overhauled this year.Even in China, where business and politics often mix, there was a hint of indignation. State-run news media published reports asking whether the company was benefiting from unfair competition.But Hao Junbo, a lawyer in Beijing, said Ms. Meyer\u2019s emphasis on family connections would probably prove to be a winning message in China.\u201cChinese people have a tradition of worshiping powerful officials,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an innate attraction to Chinese investors. They will automatically label the program as one with official backing after they hear the name of Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\u201dJesse Drucker contributed reporting from New York.

{"Headline": "How to Read the C.B.O. Score of the Health Bill Like an Expert", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byPublic HealthToday, the Congressional Budget Office will issue important numbers about the House-passed version of the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to repeal and replace portions of the Affordable Care Act.Although the budget office had analyzed an early version of the bill, the House on May 4 took the unusual step of voting before the budget office could gauge how several last-minute amendments might affect the deficit or the number of uninsured.We also asked them the No. 1 question they\u2019d be looking for the score to answer. Here are their big questions and best guesses at answers. They will help you read the report like an expert, too.In practical terms, this is the most important question that the C.B.O. needs to answer for the bill to move forward. Republicans are passing their health overhaul bill through a special budget process in order to avoid a filibuster in the Senate. That process comes with a number of special rules.One is that the bill must not increase the federal deficit beyond a 10-year window. Our entire panel thought the bill would still hit that target.Bottom line: Any number less than $2 billion in savings is a huge problem. But even a bigger number could spell trouble, depending on where the savings come from.The initial version of the bill would have resulted in 24 million fewer Americans with health insurance in a decade, the C.B.O. estimated. Most of our experts think that number will fall a little bit with the recent changes.Those cheaper plans, however, are likely to cover fewer medical benefits, and may cost more for people with a history of serious illnesses. Many of our experts said the crucial changes would come not from the total number of uninsured Americans, but who they are.The version of the bill that passed the House is likely to exclude more people who are older and sicker, while covering more who are younger and healthier. \u201cFocus will be on premiums and on coverage, but there is a shift from sick to healthy and from good insurance to bad that needs to be emphasized as well,\u201d wrote Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at M.I.T.Four of our experts thought the uninsured number would decline slightly. One thought it would be unchanged. And one thought it would increase slightly. The numbers ranged from 20 million to 25 million.Bottom line: The topline number will be the one everyone is talking about. But shifts in who gets insurance coverage are important, too.The MacArthur Amendment could push premiums down even more by allowing plans that cover fewer benefits and by discouraging sicker customers from buying insurance.Bottom line: The average insurance plan is likely to get slightly cheaper, but cover less.The hardest job for the C.B.O. is estimating the effects of the MacArthur Amendment, which allows states to waive several insurance regulations. In order to make calculations, the office\u2019s economists must first estimate how many states will decide to pursue the waivers, how many people live in those states, and which rules they will choose to waive. To figure that out, C.B.O. employees have probably spent the last few weeks speaking with state officials and studying how states have previously tried to change program requirements.Some experts have said the waivers will be unpopular, and only a few states will pursue them. Others have argued that they are likely to become widespread. Our panel estimated a wide range of effects, saying as few as 10 percent of Americans would be affected or as many as half.\u201cOne could argue 100 percent, depending if the definition is just one provision and Secretary [Tom] Price is lenient in granting waiver requests,\u201d wrote G. William Hoagland, the senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former director of the Senate Budget Committee. The answer matters, both politically and in terms of the report\u2019s headline numbers.Bottom line: If few states pursue waivers, then the Senate is dealing with a bill that\u2019s much like the one scored in the early C.B.O. report. If many do, then the amendment will broadly reshape what health insurance covers and who can afford it.About these estimatesThe Times asked 20 experts in health economics and budget policy, including former directors of the C.B.O., to assess the version of the American Health Care Act that passed the House. Seven responded, including people who have served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.Panel of expertsJOSEPH ANTOSResident scholar and Wilson H.

Walker, a professor at Wesleyan University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that her authoritative biography of Garvey was \u201can interesting and intelligent attempt to break away from clich\u00e9s and acrimony\u201d over his willfulness and attraction to the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s notion of racial purity. Instead, he wrote, Professor Stein delved into Garvey\u2019s success in moving from \u201cagitation to organization.\u201dIn an Op-Ed article in The Times in 1983 Professor Stein recommended that Garvey be pardoned for his conviction in 1923 and subsequent deportation on trumped up mail-fraud charges involving his Black Star shipping line.\u201cThe record exposes political motivation at every stage of the prosecution,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the law must not be used for suppression of dissent, and the F.B.I. must not serve the political prejudices of its bureaucrats. Pardoning Marcus Garvey, albeit tardily, is a small step toward reaffirming this.\u201dProfessor Stein\u2019s \u201cRunning Steel, Running America: Race, Economic Policy, and the Decline of Liberalism\u201d (1998), blamed government policy as much as globalization for the steel industry\u2019s demise.In 2013, Professor Stein was named a distinguished professor at City University and was awarded a fellowship to study the expansion of the American economy in the 1990s. She attributed the economy\u2019s comeback in that decade to a \u201cneoliberal recipe for growth,\u201d whose ingredients included market solutions, fiscal discipline, liberalization of trade and deregulation.Judith Susan Stein was born on April 17, 1940, in Brooklyn to George Stein, a stockbroker, and the former Anne Shuchman, who taught history and civics at Erasmus Hall High School.She graduated from James Madison High School and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Vassar College in 1960 and a doctorate in history from Yale in 1967, a year after she began teaching at City College.She is survived by her brother, Jonathan Stein.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Coal Jobs Prove Lucrative, but Not for Those in the Mines", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byGlenn Kellow, the coal executive who led Peabody Energy through bankruptcy, just collected an estimated $15 million stock bonus. John Eaves at Arch Coal, another recently bankrupt coal giant, got an award valued at $10 million.The view from the coal pits is far less rosy.From 2004 to 2016, the average annual wage for chief executives in the coal industry grew as much as five times faster than those of lower-paying jobs in the industry, like construction or truck and tractor operator jobs. Executive pay averaged $200,000, up 60 percent from $125,000, while paychecks for truck and tractor operators rose just 15 percent, to $43,770 from $38,060. Pay for construction jobs in mining rose just 11 percent, to $35,080 from $31,470.Pay for chief executives in the coal industry also grew much faster, on average, than that of their counterparts across the wider economy, while the average pay for coal industry construction workers failed to keep up with similar jobs in other fields. The data excludes bonuses, share options and other perks, which often inflate executive compensation \u2014 and the pay gap \u2014 many times more. Mr. Kellow\u2019s stock options in the last year, for example, are worth almost 350 times what a typical coal truck and tractor operator makes in a year.The lopsided pay structure in coal is a reflection of an economy marked by widening income inequality, where gains at the top of the income scale have come amid stagnation, or losses, at the bottom. But with coal mining, the yawning gap takes on an added significance. President Trump has made lifting the fortunes of blue-collar and rural Americans a centerpiece of his administration.And the work is a far cry from the stable, well-paying union jobs that were once the industry\u2019s norm. Average pay for a miner under a United Mine Workers of America contract comes out to at least $61,650 a year, and closer to $85,000 a year with overtime, said Phil Smith, a spokesman for the union.Instead, many coal miners now compete for temporary jobs, which pay by the hour and offer few benefits. An online posting for an underground coal miner job in Waynesburg, Pa., offered as little as $17 an hour.\u201cI\u2019m getting guys that used to be in the coal industry who left and went to work in oil and gas, and bringing those guys back,\u201d said Mr. Grose, who places workers at some of Appalachia\u2019s biggest coal producers. \u201cIt went from nothing to something.\u201d\u201cThese small outfits, if you didn\u2019t produce, you were gone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t say nothing. You had to take what they gave you.\u201dMr. Combs was laid off at least five more times before finally, in 2014, his doctor told him his body was giving out to black lung disease. He now lives with his wife on Social Security and pension payments.\u201cNone of them are worth that,\u201d he said of the coal executives. \u201cThey get that money on the backs of the men working here.\u201dThe steep executive salaries have come despite dismal recent performances by coal companies that have driven a string of former giants into bankruptcy. Coal executives misread the market in China, racing to develop mines there only to see demand falter, which also caused American coal exports to slump. At home, they have been unable to stem a slide in the domestic market, driven by cheaper natural gas.Despite those woes, top coal executives have continued to draw hefty rewards.Peabody paid its executive team around $75 million from 2012 to 2014, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the same period, the company lost nearly $2 billion.In 2016, Alpha Natural Resources secured a $12 million bonus package for its executives during bankruptcy proceedings, saying they should be compensated for navigating the complexities of the process. The previous year, the company lost $1.3 billion.Seven Arch Coal executives received about $8 million in bonuses three days before the company filed for bankruptcy in January 2016, seeking to cut $4.5 billion in debt. An Arch Coal spokeswoman, Logan Bonacorsi, said that the company had consistently given out bonuses in the first quarter of the year, and that they were driven mainly by safety and environmental performance metrics.Some workers at Arch Coal sites, including some truck drivers, are employed by third-party businesses, and the company had \u201cno insights into wage rates\u201d at those companies, she said.Vic Svec, a Peabody spokesman, said that average industry wages were lower than those at Peabody, whose coal miners \u201ccan earn wages and bonuses nearing six figures per year.\u201d He said the majority of stock bonuses would be shared by employees below the company\u2019s executive ranks, though he declined to give a detailed breakdown.An Alpha Natural Resources spokesman, Steve Hawkins, declined to comment.Coal miners face other woes. Mr. Trump has proposed eliminating funding for programs that support laid-off miners in Appalachia. Congress, however, reached a last-minute deal this week to finance health benefits for more than 20,000 retired miners \u2014 miners whose employers have long gone bankrupt, leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to guess who they think most of,\u201d said Bob Cox in Beaver Dam, Ky., who worked in Appalachia\u2019s mine tunnels for 35 years before losing his last coal mining job in 2002, at age 56. Mr. Cox has an early stage of black lung disease.\u201cI feel like I gave them the best part of my life, and they paid me \u2014 guess the way it was supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end, it didn\u2019t turn out in my favor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scammed, and Owing $132,038 for Parking Tickets", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byAbout New YorkMost New Yorkers, seeing a parking ticket on their car windows, wince, then curse, maybe mutter a serenity prayer. Giancarlo De Lellis, a home improvement contractor with jobs in Manhattan, has numbed himself.\u201cA ticket a day for each vehicle that is doing work in the city,\u201d Mr. De Lellis said. \u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s part of doing work in New York City, and my clients understand that as well.\u201dPrayers and profanity aside, businesses with big piles of tickets occasionally hire brokers who deal with them in bulk before city administrative judges. Park at a hydrant? No reduction. In a truck zone? That might be dropped.As Mr. De Lellis, 32, grew a family business from its base in Queens and on Long Island into Manhattan, he needed help managing the summonses.For a time, it was a great success.Mr. Amofah won the dismissal of hundreds of tickets issued to De Lellis vehicles, collecting a fee of 20 percent of the original fine. Rather than go to the bulk ticket courtroom, Mr. Amofah fought each ticket by email, submitting a defense online. He lost on only a few tickets, which Mr. De Lellis paid.Last autumn, a parking ticket judge noticed that the proof in one case looked suspicious, and sent it to the fraud division for parking violations in the city\u2019s Department of Finance. A meter receipt seemed to show that Mr. De Lellis had, in fact, paid the meter at the very time that the ticket was issued.Actually, the receipt had been doctored. So had hundreds more submitted by Mr. Amofah on behalf of Mr. De Lellis and other clients, according to Ellen Young Fein, director of legal affairs for the parking division. Real receipts were altered to cover the time and date of the tickets. But an investigation found they had been issued by machines not in service at the relevant time, or showed rates not charged at those meters, or more hours than were available.With such stakes, the parking fraud division has developed formidable antennas. For instance, a large food distribution company based in New Jersey disguised the true identity of its trucks by changing the insignia on the grills and bumpers to other makes and models, the motor vehicle equivalent of wearing a wig and fake beard to a bank robbery. Parking tickets cited the bogus make and model. Later, the food company would argue that the tickets were defective and produce the trucks\u2019 registration papers, which showed their real provenance. Eventually, this string of unlikely victories turned up on a computer report, and city lawyers recovered $680,000.The meter receipt scheme evaded detection because each ticket was disputed separately online, with cases dispersed among as many as 200 judges.\u201cObviously, if you show up with 100 muni-meter receipts and say your street officers overlooked these, they are going to say this is absolutely impossible,\u201d Mr. De Lellis said.But who is on the hook for the tickets that should have been paid \u2014 and the stiff penalties for a scam? Ms. Young Fein says the answer in state law is unequivocal: the owner of the vehicle, not an agent or broker. A $65 ticket becomes a $345 one.But, Mr. De Lellis protests, he had nothing to do with the scheme. The first he knew of it, he said, was when the city notified him in November.His tickets for three years, originally $25,400, would cost $132,038 with penalties counted.Suddenly, Mr. Amofah dropped out of touch. All their dealings had been by email, Mr. De Lellis said; there was a weekly invoice showing the tickets dismissed, and others that he had to pay. \u201cHe never showed us what his evidence was that was sent to the city,\u201d Mr. De Lellis said. (Mr. Amofah could not be reached by phone or email this week.) A city program now allows businesses with fleets of vehicles to pay tickets in bulk at set rates.Mr. De Lellis said he would gladly pay the full cost, but that fraud penalties would ruin him.Ms. Young Fein said that if vehicle owners could pin the blame for fraud on agents, they would have nothing to lose by going to unscrupulous ones.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the people who activate the meters and park the way they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d she said.The experience has eaten away at Mr. De Lellis\u2019s serenity about tickets. \u201cI\u2019m trying to defend myself to the death,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a home improvement contractor who hired a man to dispute his vehicles\u2019 parking tickets. He is Giancarlo De Lellis, not De Lillis. The error was repeated in a photo caption.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Book Would You Recommend for America\u2019s Current Political Moment?", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byBookendsIn Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Francine Prose and Thomas Mallon suggest reading that suits the current moment and tells us what we can expect from it.By Francine ProseJane Mayer\u2019s \u201cDark Money\u201d explores the roots of the intense class divisions and gross inequalities that beset us.Jane Mayer\u2019s harrowing \u201cDark Money\u201d should be required reading for anyone who wants to know how our country got into the mess we\u2019re in. Mayer shows how the intense class divisions and gross inequalities that beset us now were neither inevitable nor accidental, but carefully orchestrated by a handful of billionaires determined to transform the United States into a cash machine from which only the wealthiest citizens could withdraw.Beginning in the 1970s, alarmed by Richard Nixon\u2019s tough new restrictions aimed at protecting the environment, these oil, banking and industrial moguls spent fortunes working behind the scenes, fighting against anything that would increase their costs or decrease their profits. Perhaps the most famous of these Wizard of Oz-like figures are Charles and David Koch, but there are others (among them the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos) whose stories Mayer tells: tycoons who silenced whistle-blowers, intimidated rivals, sued and blackmailed their own siblings, and whose plans for us involved polluting our air and water, lowering taxes for the wealthy, and drastically decreasing the amount we spend on education, health and welfare. To implement their agenda, they started foundations, think tanks and university programs; they financed libertarian political campaigns and the Tea Party movement, all the while using these \u201ccharitable\u201d donations as loopholes to avoid paying taxes. According to Mayer, President Obama never stood much of a chance against the power of his opponents\u2019 money, determination and resistance \u2014 and their untiring and ultimately successful efforts to turn the Republican Party into the \u201cparty of no.\u201dGreed isn\u2019t pretty, and \u201cDark Money\u201d won\u2019t make you feel differently about the deadly sin that is currently ruling our society. But the book answers some questions. In its final paragraph David Koch tells us everything we need to know about what motivates him and others like him. When, as a child, he was asked to share a treat, he would say, \u201cI just want my fair share \u2014 which is all of it.\u201dIf \u201cDark Money\u201d confirms our suspicions about the past and the present, Nadezhda Mandelstam\u2019s \u201cHope Against Hope\u201d \u2014 a memoir about what she and her husband, the great poet Osip Mandelstam, endured during the worst years of Stalin\u2019s regime \u2014 reflects our darkest fears about a possible future. And yet, despite the terror and suffering it describes, I am always heartened and consoled by the beauty and intelligence with which Mandelstam tells us how a group of decent, resourceful, gifted and complicated human beings braved a terrible era.Having written a poem comparing Stalin\u2019s fingers to fat grubs, Osip was arrested by the despot, who (as seems typical of despots) had no sense of humor and appears to have been particularly offended by the line about his fingers. Nadezhda had a prodigious memory, and her book is full of sharply observed moments: We see the poet Anna Akhmatova insisting that Osip, on his way to prison, eat the egg (a great delicacy in those days) that the Mandelstams have procured and prepared for her, in honor of her visit. Dense and detailed, the book tells us what it was like to cope with the lack of basic necessities and to live under a dictatorship: learning to lie, watching every word, discovering who can and cannot be trusted, struggling to preserve one\u2019s dignity. And everywhere are astute and moving observations about poetry, love and life.One more book I might add: For those days when you feel the need to take a break, to experience a different time and place, to take the kind of vacation from reality that only a great book can provide, pick up Charles Dickens\u2019s \u201cDavid Copperfield.\u201d Read the first sentence, then the second. See what happens next. At this current moment, perhaps even more than most, there\u2019s a great deal to be said for literature as a passport, as an inexpensive, trustworthy and temporary means of escape.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6By Thomas MallonTrump-Nixon comparisons are in vogue, and any consideration of them requires \u201cThe Haldeman Diaries,\u201d the indispensable narrative that Richard Nixon\u2019s chief of staff, Harry Robbins (H. R.) Haldeman, began keeping on Jan. 18, 1969, two days before the start of a presidency distinguished by bold foreign overtures; beset by Vietnam and domestic dissent; and destroyed, finally, by Watergate. Haldeman switched from handwriting the diaries to taping them late in 1970, only months before the White House, interested in better record-keeping, began taping itself.Nixon seeks to create for himself a personal \u201cmystique,\u201d a spooky charisma that will wean the public from its memory of John F. Kennedy\u2019s glamour and flash: \u201cThe P made the point that in describing Nixon you have to make the point that he\u2019s always like the iceberg, you see only the tip.\u201d But if he can be \u201ccool, tough, firm and totally in command\u201d during a crisis (Haldeman\u2019s own view of him), Nixon remains, day to day, painfully maladroit with other people. The chief of staff shrewdly monitors his psychology. When a reporter describes one presidential statement as having been \u201cbitter,\u201d Nixon descends into an angry mood that Haldeman deconstructs: \u201cI think he knows it was bitter and thus doubly resents it.\u201d In May 1970, when the P ventures out to the Lincoln Memorial around dawn, to talk with young antiwar protesters, Haldeman writes: \u201cI am concerned about his condition.\u201d Seven months later, Nixon decides (not uninterestingly) \u201cthat the major effect of the youth revolution is its effect on parents and their guilt complexes.\u201dThe days grind on with problems and personalities that never seem to evolve. How can the White House best deploy the quotable and incendiary Vice President Spiro Agnew? Will Henry Kissinger, the national security adviser, and William Rogers, the secretary of state, ever stop complaining about each other? Haldeman curates the administration\u2019s flamboyant gestures (P \u201cordered me to have \u2018Portnoy\u2019s Complaint\u2019 \u2026 removed from White House library\u201d); its small screw-ups (\u201cP launched his Indian message with meeting with Taos tribe. No one mentioned the whole deal would have to be translated\u201d); its daily little lies (\u201cThe Apollo shot was this morning; the P slept through it, but we put out an announcement that he had watched it with great interest\u201d).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Hopes for a New Chapter at the America\u2019s Cup", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byHAMILTON, Bermuda \u2014 The coffee table, fittingly for a modern America\u2019s Cup team headquarters, was made of carbon fiber.\u201cI love this book,\u201d Sir Ben Ainslie said, reaching out to touch its cover. \u201cAmazing guy.\u201dBut as Ainslie and his team begin their own quest for the America\u2019s Cup on Saturday in Bermuda, he can only hope that he and Lipton do not end up having too much in common.Despite five well-financed challenges from 1899 to 1930, Lipton never won the Cup, which in his era was one of the premier sporting events. Lipton won plenty of admirers on both sides of the Atlantic as a gallant loser, but he has come to embody Britain\u2019s 166-year history of frustration in the Cup.Though it began in British waters in 1851 off the Isle of Wight, the British still have yet to win it.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Ainslie said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s our motivation really as a team, to right that wrong in our maritime history.\u201dThe problem is that Ainslie and his high-profile team appear to have a speed problem. Their new foiling catamaran has been bringing up the rear in the practice racing on Bermuda\u2019s Great Sound.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on a number of significant upgrades to get our speed competitive,\u201d Ainslie said. \u201cI believe we can do that, and if we can, we can race as well anyone. We\u2019ve proven that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great to have them,\u201d Spithill said of Land Rover BAR. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably got one of the biggest budgets and one of the largest teams.\u201cIn the practice racing, they haven\u2019t been at the level of Japan, Artemis and Team New Zealand. But I\u2019ve witnessed some changes in the past, and we, for one, will not be counting them out.\u201dSpithill speaks from experience, a very pleasant experience that he shared with Ainslie in San Francisco in the last America\u2019s Cup, in 2013.Four years after putting together one of the most rousing comebacks in any sport, Ainslie and Spithill were sitting side by side on Thursday in the America\u2019s Cup village in Bermuda for a news conference as the leaders of rival teams.So goes the Cup, where bands of brothers often break up in search of a better offer. But Ainslie, the most prominent sailor in Britain with his four Olympic gold medals, had long planned this uniform change and this British team, even if he had to be very patient.He was a reserve helmsman for Team New Zealand in the 2007 Cup in Valencia, Spain; then part of a would-be British challenge Team Origin that never got the chance to challenge. He looked set to remain on shore again in 2013.\u201cI remember just before the 2013 Cup having dinner with John Bertrand,\u201d Ainslie said of the Australian skipper who helped put an end to American domination of the Cup in 1983 in Newport, R.I. \u201cJohn and I built up a great friendship over the years. He\u2019s somewhat of a mentor, and I remember saying: \u2018This Cup is bloody hard. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m ever going to get involved. I am struggling to see the pathway.\u2019\u201dBertrand shared his own experiences, how he had held different roles with Australia and went through similar frustrations before their breakthrough in 1983.Ainslie continued: \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018You just need to keep going because it changes so quickly.\u2019 And then two or three weeks later, there I was with Oracle and this amazing comeback.\u201dThe comeback provided Ainslie the platform he needed to found his own team. Land Rover BAR (BAR stands for Ben Ainslie Racing) represents the Royal Yacht Squadron, the iconic club in Cowes where the Cup began when the avant-garde visiting yacht America defeated a fleet of British yachts in a race around the Isle of Wight with Queen Victoria among the spectators.\u201cThe Squadron has only challenged three times since 1900 \u2014 1934, 1937 and 1958 \u2014 because we have been very wary of the reputational risk that the America\u2019s Cup seems to bring in its wake,\u201d said Christopher Sharples, the club\u2019s commodore, in an interview on Thursday. \u201cThose risks are still with us, of course, but Ben came not just with his own stellar record but also with a highly respected group of financial backers, such as Sir Charles Dunstone and Sir Keith Mills, both members of the Royal Yacht Squadron.\u201dOracle, despite being an American team, is an international assemblage of talent. But Land Rover BAR is predominantly British; all but one of its sailors carries a British passport. And all are well aware that a British triumph could be a major boost at home for sailing, which long ago ceased to be a mainstream spectator sport.\u201cIt would resonate very, very strongly,\u201d said Martin Whitmarsh, the chief executive of Land Rover BAR and former head of the Formula One team McLaren.\u201cIt\u2019s all good stuff. I don\u2019t like a lot about nationalism, but if, or should I say when, we win this trophy and we take it back, it will be absolutely huge the feeling on our little island.\u201dWhitmarsh and Ainslie concede that #bringingithome \u2014 to use the team\u2019s social media hashtag \u2014 could certainly take more than one attempt.The other challengers are strong. Oracle could be even stronger. And though Oracle\u2019s unconventional, revenue-driven decision to stage this regatta in the British overseas territory of Bermuda means that, in Ainslie\u2019s words, the Cup is \u201calready halfway home,\u201d victory is still, in Ainslie\u2019s words, \u201ca long way away.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re getting closer to it,\u201d he said, with Thomas Lipton\u2019s biography still in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are right to write us off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Plan Offers No Clarity, and So Far No \u2018Magic Unicorn\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe unveiling of President Trump\u2019s first budget and the initial congressional hearings on overhauling the tax code should have brought clarity to the administration\u2019s top legislative priorities.That didn\u2019t happen.Instead, testimony from Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic advisers cast even darker shadows over a murky legislative process that has fallen well behind schedule. Their explanations of the budget and their tax plans in public seemed to generate more questions with almost every answer.Here\u2019s where things stand.The most confounding aspect of the White House budget was that it appeared to double count the effects of economic growth.It appears to improperly use the economic expansion that it predicts its policies will produce to both pay for tax cuts and reduce the deficit.Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday that the administration was using accounting that would \u201cmake Bernie Madoff blush.\u201dAfter being called out for using fuzzy math, Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, explained at a congressional hearing on Thursday that the administration used a tax plan placeholder in its budget that was revenue neutral on a \u201cstatic\u201d basis.The meaning? That it was not counting on economic growth to pay for its hypothetical plan.This implied that the White House planned to compensate for any revenue lost through tax cuts by curbing deductions or finding ways to raise revenue. But that contradicts what the administration has been saying for months.Mr. Mnuchin has repeatedly called himself a big believer in \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d that predicts tax revenue will increase with strong economic growth.He reiterated at a separate hearing on Thursday that the tax cuts would in fact be paid for by economic growth and unspecified measures to broaden the tax base.If economic growth is not going to be the primary way to \u201cpay for\u201d tax cuts, the White House and Republicans in Congress are going to have to come up with the money from other places.The problem is that the White House has been down on some of the biggest potential revenue raisers that Speaker Paul D. Ryan has proposed.Mr. Mnuchin doused more cold water on the border-adjustment tax this week, revealing his serious concerns about the impact of taxing imports and exempting exports from taxation.That tax would have raised about $1 trillion over a decade. The White House also wants to maintain interest deductibility for businesses \u2014 a provision that could raise another $1 trillion if eliminated.While Mr. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady remain fierce proponents of the concept, it became clear this week that even Republicans on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee are deeply skeptical.Mr. Brady and Mr. Ryan are now discussing modifications and phase-ins for the idea, but the White House appears to have no interest at all.For his part, Mr. Brady appears to be ready to compromise but not prepared to scrap the border tax. At a conference this week, he said that if anyone had a more pro-growth tax proposal they should \u201cbring it.\u201dIf Republicans do not find a way to pay for their tax cuts, they most likely will be temporary and it would break Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to balance the budget.\u201cThe White House is still looking for a magic unicorn,\u201d said Itai Grinberg, a tax policy professor at Georgetown University\u2019s law school.At his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Mr. Mnuchin pleased Democrats when he promised that Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan would not be a tax cut for the rich. Hoping to hold him to that vow, they called the pronouncement the \u201cMnuchin rule.\u201dIn testimony this week, Mr. Mnuchin danced around that promise.He insisted that it was Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d to focus on middle income tax cuts. But he is not ruling out the possibility that the wealthiest taxpayers could see their tax bills get smaller, too. \u201cI want to be careful about not guaranteeing anything,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.He also maintained that the White House was working collaboratively with the Republicans in the House and Senate on a tax plan and that all of the president\u2019s wishes might not make it into the final bill.Pressed on whether Mr. Trump would veto tax legislation that benefited the 1 percent, Mr. Mnuchin said: \u201cThe president will look at the overall package.\u201dWith a tax overhaul by August off the table, Republicans are now focusing on getting something done before Christmas.But first they need to find a way to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. And pass a budget resolution. (There are also the distractions of investigations.)And then a new problem was injected into the mix: the federal debt ceiling. Mr. Mulvaney revealed on Wednesday that tax revenue is coming in a little bit slower than expected. And it is running out of time more quickly than expected.So Congress will have to raise the debt limit sooner rather than later. Mr. Mnuchin urged members of Congress to pass a debt ceiling increase before they headed home for the summer break.This is easier said than done. Many Republicans, including members of the House Freedom Caucus who opposed previous increases in the debt ceiling without spending cuts, will want concessions for raising it.If that fight turns into a time-consuming brawl, it could well push tax reform into 2018.Advertisement"}

Global warming denialists took comments out of context to allege widespread scientific fraud.Judith Enck, a former top E.P.A. official who is critical of the agency\u2019s new direction, said its online presence \u201cnow looks like the National Mining Association website.\u201dDavid M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former top prosecutor of environmental crimes at the Justice Department, has taken part in several such efforts, including briefs filed before Mr. Trump took office. He said the work was important both as an attempt to preserve environmental progress and as a message to his students.In November, many of his students expressed dismay over the election results \u201cand their concern that everything they came to law school for no longer mattered,\u201d Professor Uhlmann said. \u201cMy message to them was, \u2018Everything you came to law school for matters more than ever before.\u2019\u201dOther lawyers are stepping up to protect dozens of climate scientists who have been targeted by private conservative groups demanding their personal emails and other documents. The groups, which dispute the powerful evidence underlying climate change science, use the tactic to unearth embarrassing and inartful language in private correspondence and then publicize it.The tactic can be \u201ca P.R. home run,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University who received one such demand in 2012. He said he recognized the filing as \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d intended to \u201cfind anything that makes climate scientists look foolish, or corrupt, or biased or stupid \u2014 anything that can cast doubt on climate science.\u201dIn light of those costs, the defense fund got its start. What had been an informal referral network for scientists facing legal pressure took on structure and financing. Mr. Trump\u2019s election has provided a boost to the defense fund, said Joshua Wolfe, a founder.\u201cWe\u2019ve been a bit overwhelmed by the number of checks that came in postelection,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Emmanuel Macron Embraces E.U. to Put France \u2018Back in the Picture\u2019", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byFor the past year, and longer, the European Union has been politically radioactive, deemed untouchable by most mainstream candidates for national office in Europe. Yet Mr. Macron, 39, not only embraced the embattled bloc, he proclaimed membership of it to be a necessity for France\u2019s future: needful of reform, certainly, but something to embrace rather than run from. And he defeated the most europhobic of opponents, the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen.Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute for International Affairs in Rome, said Mr. Macron\u2019s victory had helped the bloc avoid a cataclysm. \u201cThe alternative would have been the end of the European Union,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means France is back in the picture.\u201dIf France is again vital to European affairs, any euphoria is certain to be short-lived. First, Mr. Macron faces many domestic challenges in translating his centrist promises into policy and in assuaging those millions who voted for Ms. Le Pen, cast blank ballots or did not vote at all.The populist threat to the European Union \u201cremains alive and has to be taken seriously,\u201d said Stefan Lehne, a former Austrian diplomat and a visiting scholar with Carnegie Europe. In France, \u201cmore than 40 percent of French voters opted for anti-European populist parties in the first round,\u201d he said, and in Italy, \u201cthe Five Star Movement and Northern League could easily win the general election expected to be held in February 2018.\u201dBeyond that, he added, the existing populist governments in Hungary and Poland \u201cconstantly put the values on which the E.U. is based into question.\u201d\u201cIf Macron manages to stop the populist tsunami, he\u2019ll be rewarded by his European counterparts,\u201d said Florence Gaub, a senior analyst at the European Union Institute for Security Studies in Paris. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to make some demands that other French presidents could not. Because everyone needs him to be a success, and if it stops with France, maybe it stops forever.\u201d\u201cTo be competitive again, France has to reform and kick-start its economy, and the big question is whether Germany and Merkel can help,\u201d said Stefan Kornelius, of the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, who is a biographer of Ms. Merkel. \u201cGermany has profited from the weakness of France, but France has to do this itself.\u201dThere is serious talk in Berlin of some kind of prize to encourage Mr. Macron, with more German investment in European programs and more flexibility on deficit spending. But Germany has its own elections in September, Mr. Kornelius noted, and Ms. Merkel knows that there is little sympathy among German voters \u2014 especially among the anti-European party Alternative for Germany \u2014 for handouts to France, let alone to southern Europe.\u201cThere will be encouragement but no quick prize for Macron,\u201d Mr. Kornelius said. \u201cJust pouring money into those stagnating economies is something she\u2019s refused to do for eight years, and she won\u2019t change now,\u201d he added, referring to Ms. Merkel.Yet officials in Germany are sensitive to growing resentment in other countries toward their country\u2019s trade surpluses and voting power in the European Union, which will only grow with the British withdrawal. And the French have traditionally spoken up for the bloc\u2019s smaller countries, especially those where the state plays a larger role in the economy.Mr. Macron is pro-European, but he has said that \u201cwe have to listen to our people and listen to the fact that they are extremely angry today, impatient, and the dysfunction of the E.U. is no more sustainable.\u201d If the bloc continues as it is today, he told the BBC before the Sunday runoff, it would be a \u201cbetrayal\u201d that could lead to \u201ca \u2018Frexit,\u2019 or we will have the National Front again.\u201dOn many issues, Mr. Macron will be a natural ally for the Germans, including on European defense. France has been unusually passive in the last six months on the question of European security, whereas it is normally vocal, said Ms. Tocci of the Institute for International Affairs. \u201cHaving France back is essential for European defense, and if Macron could install some ambition, it would be very welcome,\u201d she said.For Britain, Mr. Macron\u2019s election is not good news, at least on the face of things. Prime Minister Theresa May says that Britain wants a strong European Union as a partner even after it leaves. But Mr. Macron, a former banker, has taken a tough stand on the British withdrawal, known as Brexit, criticizing European leaders for trying to make a special deal with former Prime Minister David Cameron before Britons even voted to leave the bloc.Mr. Macron has refused any special post-withdrawal deal for the City of London, Britain\u2019s financial heart. He has also warned that British financial institutions should not be able to sell their services in the eurozone and has called openly for bankers, researchers and academics to leave Britain and move to France.After Mr. Macron\u2019s victory, however, his top economic adviser, Jean Pisani-Ferry, used softer words on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has an interest in a hard \u2018Brexit,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Pisani-Ferry told the BBC. \u201cThere is a mutual interest in keeping prosperity that exists.\u201dStill, he said of Mr. Macron, \u201cThere will be a tough negotiation, and he will be tough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Russian Officials Discussed How to Influence Trump Aides Last Summer", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American spies collected information last summer revealing that senior Russian intelligence and political officials were discussing how to exert influence over Donald J. Trump through his advisers, according to three current and former American officials familiar with the intelligence.The conversations focused on Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman at the time, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who was advising Mr. Trump, the officials said. Both men had indirect ties to Russian officials, who appeared confident that each could be used to help shape Mr. Trump\u2019s opinions on Russia.Some Russians boasted about how well they knew Mr. Flynn. Others discussed leveraging their ties to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the deposed president of Ukraine living in exile in Russia, who at one time had worked closely with Mr. Manafort.The intelligence was among the clues \u2014 which also included information about direct communications between Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and Russian officials \u2014 that American officials received last year as they began investigating Russian attempts to disrupt the election and whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates were assisting Moscow in the effort. Details of the conversations, some of which have not been previously reported, add to an increasing understanding of the alarm inside the American government last year about the Russian disruption campaign.The information collected last summer was considered credible enough for intelligence agencies to pass to the F.B.I., which during that period opened a counterintelligence investigation that is continuing. It is unclear, however, whether Russian officials actually tried to directly influence Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Both have denied any collusion with the Russian government on the campaign to disrupt the election.Whether the Russians worked directly with any Trump advisers is one of the central questions that federal investigators, now led by Robert S. Mueller III, the newly appointed special counsel, are seeking to answer. President Trump, for his part, has dismissed talk of Russian interference in the election as \u201cfake news,\u201d insisting there was no contact between his campaign and Russian officials.\u201cIf there ever was any effort by Russians to influence me, I was unaware, and they would have failed,\u201d Mr. Manafort said in a statement. \u201cI did not collude with the Russians to influence the elections.\u201dThe White House, F.B.I. and C.I.A. declined to comment. Mr. Flynn\u2019s lawyer did not respond to an email seeking comment.The current and former officials agreed to discuss the intelligence only on the condition of anonymity because much of it remains highly classified, and they could be prosecuted for disclosing it.In his congressional testimony, Mr. Brennan discussed the broad outlines of the intelligence, and his disclosures backed up the accounts of the information provided by the current and former officials.\u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election. And they were very aggressive,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. Still, he said, even at the end of the Obama administration he had \u201cunresolved questions in my mind as to whether or not the Russians had been successful in getting U.S. persons, involved in the campaign or not, to work on their behalf again either in a witting or unwitting fashion.\u201dMr. Brennan\u2019s testimony offered the fullest public account to date of how American intelligence agencies first came to fear that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign might be aiding Russia\u2019s attack on the election.By early summer, American intelligence officials already were fairly certain that it was Russian hackers who had stolen tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. That in itself was not viewed as particularly extraordinary by the Americans \u2014 foreign spies had hacked previous campaigns, and the United States does the same in elections around the world, officials said. The view on the inside was that collecting information, even through hacking, is what spies do.An unclassified report by American intelligence agencies released in January stated that Mr. Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\u201dRussia views Ukraine as a buffer against the eastward expansion of NATO, and has supported separatists in their yearslong fight against the struggling democratic government in Kiev.The biggest payment, though, came from RT, the Kremlin-financed news network. It paid Mr. Flynn $45,000 to give a speech in Moscow, where he also attended the network\u2019s lavish anniversary dinner. There, he was photographed sitting next to Mr. Putin.A senior lawmaker said on Monday that Mr. Flynn misled Pentagon investigators about how he was paid for the Moscow trip. He also failed to disclose the source of that income on a security form he was required to complete before joining the White House, according to congressional investigators.But after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls, Mr. Flynn was fired as national security adviser after a tumultuous 25 days in office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Derek Jeter, Face of Yankees\u2019 Glory Days, Will Get a Lasting Tribute", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byOn BaseballThe Yankees will honor Derek Jeter this weekend, having played a series in Cincinnati, a city with an unlikely significance in their recent history. It was there, in 1976, that they first played in the World Series with George Steinbrenner as their principal owner.A generation later, in 2003, they were back there in the regular season and seemed listless to Steinbrenner. As a remedy, he abruptly named Derek Jeter captain.\u201cWhy Cincinnati?\u201d catcher Jorge Posada, Jeter\u2019s buddy, wondered aloud that day. \u201cWhy not do it in New York?\u201dA reasonable question, but for Steinbrenner, of course, every moment was urgent. Jeter had been the unofficial captain for years by then, with four championship rings to prove it. And he had withstood off-season criticism from Steinbrenner, turning a test from the boss into a marketing opportunity for them both \u2014 they appeared in a Visa commercial together, dancing in a conga line. Jeter, indeed, was Steinbrenner\u2019s kind of guy.The Yankees were in first place when Steinbrenner anointed Jeter, but they had fallen hard after a furious start, losing 17 of 27 games. They had lost in the first round of the playoffs the year before, and lost in the World Series the year before that, and Steinbrenner wanted a jolt. He went with a hunch.\u201cMy gut tells me this would be a good time for Derek Jeter to assume leadership,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cHe is a great leader by the way he performs and plays. I told him I want him to be the type of cavalry officer that sits in the saddle. You can\u2019t be a leader unless you sit in the saddle. I think he can.\u201dWe know the rest. Those Yankees quickly resumed their dominance and returned to the World Series, with Jeter starting the famous rally off a tiring Pedro Martinez in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series against Boston. Six years later, Jeter led the Yankees all the way, meaning that when Steinbrenner died, in July 2010, he went out a champion.Steinbrenner now has the biggest display in Monument Park, his bronze portrait centered on the back wall, his stars forever in his view. A keen understanding of the value of stars, more than anything else, was Steinbrenner\u2019s most important instinct. It sometimes helped the Yankees win, and it always helped them make money.Jeter\u2019s retirement, after the 2014 season, left the team without its most recognizable face. That likeness will now be preserved with a plaque in the Bronx \u2014 another will surely follow in Cooperstown in 2020 \u2014 and no Yankee will ever again wear Jeter\u2019s No. 2. The captaincy has also been vacant since he left.This is not unusual; until Jeter\u2019s appointment, the position had been vacant since Don Mattingly\u2019s final game in 1995. What the team has really struggled to replace is the standing Jeter had as a compelling, must-see player, the kind so vital to sustaining the Yankees\u2019 upscale brand.For a while, the Yankees still had a certified celebrity on the roster: Alex Rodriguez, whose fame was partly notoriety. The wholesome and humble leading man \u2014 with attention-grabbing talent to match \u2014 is a rare find, but now the Yankees just might have him.Jeter solidified the status of the two teams in 2000, as the most valuable player of the crosstown World Series. It could not have been anyone else. The Yankees were his team, and that was his stage. Nobody else seemed made for it in quite the same way.The Mets had one sliver of hope in that Series, when they grabbed Game 3 after the Yankees had won twice. Then Jeter belted the very first pitch of Game 4 for a home run, and the next night, the Yankees were champions. When Jeter doused his boss in the boozy postgame celebration, Steinbrenner played along.\u201cHe\u2019s allowed,\u201d Steinbrenner said.Now, Jeter hopes to follow Steinbrenner\u2019s example and buy a stake in a team of his own. He is part of a group, with the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, trying to arrange financing to buy the Miami Marlins. Doing so would fulfill a well-known ambition for Jeter, although it would represent something new.Four more teams let Jeter go by: the Cleveland Indians, the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati Reds. None of those teams have won the World Series since.Call it the Curse of the Captain, a No. 2 who should have been No. 1.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Only Congress Can Solve the North Korea Problem", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile there is no love lost between Democrats and Republicans these days, they do seem to agree on one thing: North Korea\u2019s rapidly accelerating nuclear program poses a grave threat to the United States. And yet, despite bipartisan unity and President Trump\u2019s frequent saber-rattling, one element of our North Korea policy remains puzzling: Why aren\u2019t our sanctions against the country stronger?North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is much more advanced than Iran\u2019s ever was, but the sanctions the United States has imposed on North Korea are nowhere near as harsh as those on Iran before the 2015 nuclear deal. This is especially troubling since North Korea already possesses nuclear weapons and is developing systems that would enable them to hit the United States.For the United States to hit North Korea with the full brunt of our sanctions arsenal, Congress must act swiftly and aggressively using our most potent economic weapon: secondary sanctions. These are not aimed directly at the target country but rather at third parties conducting business with that country (for example, Chinese banks facilitating North Korean payments).Secondary sanctions can be diplomatically problematic because they can cause tensions with otherwise friendly countries. Unsurprisingly, when the executive branch has a choice, it often prefers not to impose them.But it is not just the White House that has the power apply secondary sanctions. Congress can pass laws that force the Treasury Department to impose them. For years before the Iran nuclear deal, Congress routinely passed bills that mandated secondary sanctions. These laws eventually moved the Obama administration to punish companies in China, Germany and Italy that were doing business with Iran.Moreover, in legislation passed in 2011, Congress compelled the Obama administration to threaten sanctions against countries that refused to reduce their imports of Iranian oil. The law worked as intended, resulting in a substantial decrease in Iran\u2019s oil sales \u2014 to 1.1 million barrels per day in 2013 from 2.5 million barrels per day in 2012. Even China significantly cut back its Iranian oil purchases. Shortly after the law began to bite, Iran was ready to enter serious negotiations over its nuclear program.So far, Congress has refrained from mandating broad secondary sanctions against North Korea\u2019s trading partners. This inaction is explained by a lack of congressional focus on North Korea policy, the absence of a vocal domestic constituency pushing for tougher measures and concerns about angering China. But Congress should now end its restraint and pass a North Korea sanctions law that encompasses restrictions similar to those that were imposed on Iran.For starters, Congress should mandate sanctions against any bank or company involved in purchases of North Korean minerals, coal, textiles or other goods that earn Pyongyang hard currency. North Korea continues to make billions of dollars annually from its exports, which go primarily to China but also to India, Pakistan and other countries. The funds collected from these exports prop up the Kim regime and finance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. As it did with Iran in 2011, Congress should allow temporary waivers for countries that significantly reduce their imports from North Korea. This will give China and others a reasonable period \u2014 perhaps three or six months \u2014 to halt business with North Korea.Other prime targets for secondary sanctions include financial institutions that provide services to North Korean banks, shipping lines that call at North Korean ports and insurers that underwrite cargoes to and from North Korea. The only exceptions should be for trade in humanitarian goods like food and medicine. Such sanctions would present businesses around the world with a clear choice: Cut ties with North Korean counterparts or suffer the costs of American sanctions.The White House may bristle at the idea of Congress driving policy on North Korea, but it should be thankful for legislative action. While Congress plays the \u201cbad cop,\u201d President Trump will benefit from greatly enhanced negotiating leverage. And although such an approach would garner international criticism, particularly from Beijing, businesses in China and elsewhere would most likely fall into line.That\u2019s because the alternative is not successfully defying the United States \u2014 access to the American financial system is too valuable to risk losing it \u2014 but rather facing sanctions and possibly bankruptcy. Nevertheless, to prevent diplomatic blowback, the Trump administration should work to amass the type of good will the Obama administration earned on Iran, traveling around the globe to secure as much buy-in as possible.There is no magic bullet for Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear belligerence. A military strike against North Korea\u2019s program could lead to devastating retaliation, and even the harshest sanctions may not change Kim Jong-un\u2019s calculus. But as North Korea moves closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon that can hit the United States, we would be remiss not to see if the full weight of our sanctions might make Pyongyang reverse course. To do otherwise would be foreign-policy malpractice.Edward Fishman, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, was a member of the secretary of state\u2019s policy planning staff during the Obama administration.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Economists See Little Magic in Tax Cuts to Promote Growth", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byIf one assumption has undergirded Republican economic policy for decades \u2014 and is the foundation of the Trump administration\u2019s first budget proposal \u2014 it is that tax cuts will unleash fantastic growth.The basic idea is that shrinking the government\u2019s share increases what people take home, encouraging workers to work more and investors to invest more. But while taxes can create incentives that can promote growth, liberal and conservative economists alike said there was no evidence that the White House budget announced on Tuesday would do so.The Trump administration promises to cut taxes, keep revenues steady and crank out average annual economic growth of 3 percent, but neither the budget nor the tax reforms previously outlined in sketchy form provide enough detail to figure out if that will happen.While the United States cruised along with 3 percent growth \u2014 and higher \u2014 in the late 1990s and mid-2000s, growth has not reached anywhere near that level since well before the recession. The best showing in the past decade was in 2015, when the annual rate of expansion hit 2.6 percent.Since mid-March, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have fallen from 2.62 percent to 2.28 percent on Tuesday, a sign that traders are discounting the likelihood of a sudden pickup in growth.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.An analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan by the bipartisan, nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that the federal debt would rise by $5.5 trillion over the first decade. Even if lower taxes encouraged people to save and invest more, the huge government deficits created by the budget would crowd out private investors and offset some of those direct effects, several economists said.Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington, said he and other researchers had repeatedly found that \u201cdeficit-financed tax cuts were usually harmful to growth.\u201dCutting the tax on investment income, for example, delivers the most bang for the buck, Mr. Viard said, but unless the lost revenue is made up through increases in other taxes or spending cuts, the deficit will balloon and economic growth will suffer.Previous presidents have not had a lot of success using tax cuts to spur growth. \u201cThe historical record is pretty clear that large tax cuts don\u2019t pay for themselves through economic growth,\u201d said Michael J. Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia University.The 1981 tax cut that President Ronald Reagan pushed through did provide a short jolt to the economy, Mr. Graetz said, but he pointed out that the administration was compelled to raise taxes in 1982 and 1984 to keep the deficit under control.Tax cuts championed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 performed even worse. While the cuts temporarily stimulated spending by putting more money in people\u2019s pockets, they did not have much impact in enhancing the economy\u2019s ability to produce goods and services.Both President Trump and the House Republicans\u2019 proposals reserve the biggest tax cuts for the wealthiest. Slashing rates at the top is probably the least effective way of spurring spending, however, because high-income households have the luxury of socking away a financial windfall, said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at the research firm IHS Markit. The Trump plan, he said, \u201ccould well end up hurting a lot of poor people without boosting growth.\u201d\u201cIf you tilt the tax cuts toward lower-income households, they will spend more of it,\u201d Mr. Behravesh said. \u201cThere is virtually no debate among economists about that.\u201dAnd the deep cuts in the budget to programs that benefit primarily those at the bottom of the economic ladder will, if anything, reduce their spending.The Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201dThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that the budget cuts would decrease growth by more than 1 percent by 2020.Many economists on the left and the right agree that the current code as it applies to businesses is misguided: It puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage and encourages corporations to keep income abroad. But fixing that problem isn\u2019t merely a matter of slashing rates.\u201cWith the economy back to near full employment, conventional tax cuts or stimulus spending won\u2019t have that much of an effect,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cWhat is needed are policies that genuinely augment the supply side of the economy.\u201dWhat might that look like? Instead of simply cutting rates, Mr. Holtz-Eakin would opt for incentives for business to invest in new equipment or software, infrastructure investments that speed transportation and ease other frictional costs, and retraining that improves workers\u2019 skills and increases the proportion of prime-age Americans who are employed.Mr. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute added tax relief for child-care expenses to the list of reforms that could bolster growth.There are lots of reasons to tinker with the tax code, many experts say, but the notion that there is a simple cause-and-effect relationship between cuts and growth is faulty. \u201cTax policy is clearly not some overwhelmingly powerful tool that affects growth,\u201d Mr. Viard said. There are simply too many other things \u2014 like technology, worker productivity and aging \u2014 that can either muffle or overwhelm their impact.In the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory in November, many business leaders and investors thought that the Washington logjam might finally break and that corporate tax reform, more infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies would be passed by Congress and signed into law.But with Washington and the White House now distracted by the investigation into possible ties between former Trump aides and Russia, momentum for major tax cuts or a big infrastructure bill has stalled.On Friday, the government will announce revised figures for growth in the first quarter of 2017, but not much improvement from the initial 0.7 percent estimate last month is expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Day of Subway Delays Snarls Almost a Dozen Lines", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byAfter several days of painful subway delays in New York City this week, there was more turmoil during the commute on Friday morning.Signal problems in Queens. Reports of a sick passenger in the Bronx. A train breakdown in Manhattan.On Friday morning, blame for some delays was placed on an investigation at the Jay Street-MetroTech station in Brooklyn after a man was found dead on an A train there, the police said. But most of the problems were the routine types of incidents that regularly plague the subway.Transit advocates have focused the blame on Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who runs the transportation authority. On Thursday evening, Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for subway riders, held a rally outside Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan office to urge the governor to address worsening service.\u201cNew York is a dynamic, prosperous city, but our transit system feels increasingly like third-world infrastructure,\u201d said John Raskin, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cThrough all of the misery riders are experiencing, Governor Cuomo has been conspicuously silent. No announcement, no action, no plans.\u201dAt the rally, the group held signs reading, \u201cGov. Cuomo Help Us,\u201d and displayed the hashtag #CuomosMTA \u2014 an attempt to tie the governor to the delays. Many New Yorkers mistakenly believe that Mayor Bill de Blasio controls the subway.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, called the rally \u201cperformance art\u201d and said the governor was focused on \u201creal solutions.\u201d\u201cWe agree with riders that delays are unacceptable, and we share in their outrage, which is why Governor Cuomo secured record and unprecedented investment in the M.T.A. that will fix problems that have persisted for generations,\u201d Ms. Lever said in a statement.Subway ridership has grown to nearly six million riders each day \u2014 its highest level since the 1940s. But the system\u2019s aging infrastructure is becoming increasingly brittle, trains are breaking down more frequently and even the smallest hiccup can produce a cascade of delays.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scaling the World\u2019s Most Lethal Mountain, in the Dead of Winter", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Sports of The TimesFor reasons of history and culture, Polish climbers are among the world\u2019s most audacious. This winter, a group will attempt K2, the world\u2019s most dangerous mountain.Supported byThe mountain rises glistening from an encasement of glaciers in the far reaches of the Karakoram. Pyramid-shaped, an austere link to eternity, K2 yields only to Everest in height and is deadlier. Its walls are vertiginous no matter the approach.Only the most experienced climbers attempt ascents, and for every four who crawl to its peak, one dies.And then there is winter. Fourteen of earth\u2019s mountains exceed 8,000 meters (26,246 feet), and climbers have reached the peak of 13 in winter. K2 is the forbidding exception. Ten Polish climbers hope to make history by reaching the summit next winter.These men will hike through knee-deep snow to a base camp at 18,645 feet, surpassing all but one mountain in the United States. Atop K2\u2019s near-vertical slopes, glacial icefalls dislodge car-size hunks of ice. Winds at the summit reach hurricane strength, and temperatures can fall as low as minus 80 Fahrenheit.The climbers could wait two months in their tents, in hopes the gales relent for a few days. They have no margin for error; K2 routinely kills those trapped on its flanks.This is the way of the Polish climbers, who for reasons of history and culture have earned reputations as the greatest climbers of the Himalayas in winter. They are prisoners of their dreams.Janusz Golab is a long-limbed lion of a climber with curly hair that goes here and there like an ethereal nimbus. He is 49, still in his prime for a great climber, and he will be one of those charged with making it to the summit of K2 next winter. We talk as he stands in the darkened attic of a lodge in the Morskie Oko valley in Poland, looping purple rope in preparation for a training climb in the subzero of the Tatra Mountains.To scale K2 in winter is not such modest madness. He has children and at least one girlfriend, and he appears filled with a love for life. It so happens he enjoys its deadly challenges. He has climbed in Antarctica, Greenland and the Himalayas. \u201cWinter is the best season.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging. It\u2019s obvious it\u2019s the best.\u201dThere\u2019s so much to unpack about this climb to the most hostile tip of the planet, a mountain that is 28,251 feet high and sits in the Karakoram range on the border of Pakistan and China. There are the technical and strategic challenges, and the task of picking a team in the individualistic world of high-altitude climbing. These men will live and work in the worst possible conditions for months. Each knows he may not return.Four climbers will make the final push to the summit without oxygen. Each has lost partners on climbs.There is, too, the power that history exerts on the Poles. A decade ago, what remains of the old guard challenged a younger generation to test limits of flesh, endurance and creativity in the Himalayas. Their story, embedded in the urge of free spirits to slip the unsmiling bonds of a Cold-War communist government, offers our starting point.Generations of Poles flocked like homing pigeons to the dark and jagged peaks of the Tatra Mountains, which rise on Poland\u2019s southern border with Slovakia. Men and women scaled its granite walls in summer heat and in the belly of winter. When the photographer Max Whittaker and I accompanied five Polish Himalayan climbers to the Tatras in January, snow piled swollen on steep mountainsides and the temperature hovered near zero.After World War II and its slaughters, the Communists imposed a controlling regime. Its bureaucrats held all passports. Whether factory worker, engineer or mathematician, everyone scuffled for money. The mountains offered freedom from all that.Poland\u2019s climbing clubs swelled with members. The most famous was found in Katowice, a steel town a few hours drive from the Tatras.The Katowice club overlooked Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Street; its coat of arms is an eagle and an ice pick. Many dozens of climbers each night talked mountains, life, and more mountains, and sang songs and drank vodka. To gain admission at that time, a young climber had to demonstrate technical prowess, sleep outside on a mountain ledge (known as a bivouac), pass written tests and show a command of mountaineering history, art and literature.The blue-eyed Krzysztof Wielicki, who at 67 is among the most accomplished Himalayan climbers alive, will lead the K2 expedition. He remains limber and lively in his seventh decade, with a second wife and young children. He has climbed three Himalayan peaks in winter, including Everest, and has the bowlegged amble of a man with little left to prove. His eyes glisten when asked about his youthful hunger. \u201cWe climb here, and here, and here,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd if you climb O.K., they say, \u2018O.K., you have passed summer Tatra.\u2019\u201dHe lifts his finger high in imitation of the hardened club members. \u201c\u2018Now you have to do winter Tatra.\u2019\u201dWhen Polish climbers obtained permission to climb the peaks of Western Europe, they discovered another problem: The West was terrifically expensive.One night in January, I sit in the village home of Janusz Majer, 70, a burly climber who is working to obtain the $335,000 in government and private financing needed to underwrite the assault on K2. His friend and climber, Wojciech Dzik, joins us.Over salamis and cheeses and a prodigious amount of wine, we talk of long-ago mountaineering adventures. They had finished a climb in the Dolomites in the 1970s when they saw a sign for cappuccinos. Dzik, a mathematician, did the mental currency conversion. \u201cMy God! It was one-tenth of my salary,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAfter that, we lived like Jesus, on bread and wine.\u201dThe Poles turned to the mountains of Asia, where the technical challenge was magnitudes greater and the cost magnitudes less. In search of money, they walked into factory offices in Katowice and pointed to towering industrial chimneys. We\u2019ll paint these at half your usual cost.The factory managers winced. A scaffold, they said, costs more than your price.We work Alpine-style, the climbers replied. Soon engineers and mathematicians and electricians rappelled down chimneys from dawn to dusk.Then they hopped into old vans, Jack Keroaucs all, and set off for the Hindu Kush. No fancy equipment, no endorsements, no publicity; just freedom from the strictures of life in Poland. \u201cBack then, to leave a job was O.K.,\u201d Wielicki tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re making just $50 a month. No big deal. Bye-bye.\u201dBy the time the Poles reached Asia in great numbers, climbers from other nations had scaled all the 8,000-meter peaks.The Poles decided to find fame Tatra-style and climb those peaks in winter or by risky new routes. The audacity of their ascents was legendary. Their ranks produced Wanda Rutkiewicz, the first woman to summit K2, and the first man to scale three giant peaks in winter, Jerzy Kukuczka. That climber and a partner scaled K2 in summer along a route so dangerous, even suicidal \u2014 it passed beneath unstable ridges of ice \u2014 no one else has attempted it. To this day, it is known as the Polish Line.Some climbers were artists who specialized in free climbs, with as little gear as possible. Others were expeditionary geniuses who plotted climbs like military assaults. Polish newspapers chronicled this as American newspapers do baseball.To sit now with the Polish mountaineers, old and young, is to hear voices rise and laughter roll in like ocean breakers. They tell tales of supplies piled atop camels and flirtations with entrancing local women and negotiating with turbaned mechanics to eke a few more miles out of wizened vans. They recall Silesian dumplings and vodka in base camp and frozen bivouacs at 22,000 feet and fogged brains and hallucinations (they do not use oxygen when climbing). Always there were other worldly vistas.\u201cUp there at night, to hear glaciers calve: Boom. Boom. Boom. My God,\u201d recalls Dzik, the white-haired mathematician. \u201cI was just a poor bored lecturer in Poland. It was like going to heaven.\u201dAnother visitor accompanied them: death.The grand climbers perished at a frightful rate. They were trapped by swirling tempests; died of altitude sickness; slipped and catapulted into the abyss. There is no field of athletic achievement where death rides so insistently on your shoulder.It is tempting to wonder if these men harbor a romance with two lovers, life and death. Wielicki, the leader of the upcoming expedition, was renowned for his solo ascents of Himalayan peaks. His stamina was unmatched. (As expedition leaders must, he will remain at base camp during the ascent of K2.)I put the question of death\u2019s allure to him and he shakes his head. He wanted to live, always, even if along the serrated edge of a knife. He noted an axiom of climbing: A young climber is the most endangered, as he does not know enough to worry. To that, he adds another: An older climber should not draw too much comfort from mastery of technique. That can prove a frail shield in the high Himalayas.\u201cYou need luck,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes.\u201dRough sleep precedes a climb. It\u2019s as if the dark imaginings of Hieronymus Bosch scamper through the cranium. A climber clings to a crumbling wall. Another sees a friend fall past him. Another feels creatures pulling at his feet.On the mountain, climbers escape into concentration as pure as a monk\u2019s repose. Life becomes detail: Click into the rope and unclick; secure boot crampons and dig for footholds. There is a whack of the ice pick and another one, and one after that. They scale 27,000-foot-high puzzles. Sometimes climbers go a day or two without food; sometimes they fail to notice.Kacper Tekieli is one of the climbers whom Max and I accompany to the Tatras. He has a tangle of dark curls and a mischievous smile, and is a philosophy major with a love of mountain literature. At 32, he has built a considerable mountaineering reputation, although he cannot afford to give up working as a barista in the old quarter of Krakow. He watched a friend slip to his death last year in the Himalayas; he\u2019s not sure he needs K2.Tekieli talks of the singular focus needed to summit a Himalayan peak in the maw of winter. The universe narrows to a meter or two. \u201cThere\u2019s something mystical. It\u2019s not about the mountain, which is inert. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s what you discover about yourself in all those hours of concentration.\u201dSix K2 climbers gather on a winter afternoon in a Warsaw gym under the eyes of a trainer, Karol Hennig, who works with state health institutes. He invites me to join. I decline, pleading a sore Achilles and a severe attack of common sense.The climbers range from their 30s to 63, and most are of modest build. They fill backpacks with iron bars and work stair-climbers. They do tortuous lifts and pull-ups.Their fingers and toes are as adhering as those of a gecko. They retain one-third more oxygen than a well-conditioned adult. After the workout, their heart rates return to baseline as easily as an elevator descends from one floor to the next.Two nights later, the Himalayan climbers are deep in the Tatras, taking a conditioning climb up the Monk, a saw-toothed 6,781-foot peak. Max the photographer is a skilled climber and accompanies them; I hike to an ice fall and wave goodbye. Janusz Golab is a force unto himself, climbing with precision and economy of motion, a strong-limbed cat.Marek Chmielarski, 40, is one of the Tatra climbers and will join the K2 team. He paints oil platforms from the North Sea to Azerbaijan. He chuckles at the mention of their oxygen-retention scores: \u201cJanusz scores pretty much at the bottom. And he has been to the top of K2 and is the best climber in Poland.\u201dThe climbers also monitor levels of vitamin D and iron, which help stave off hypobaric hypoxia, the process by which thin air deprives the body of replenishing oxygen.No one can be certain how a body will react at the top of the world. At K2 base camp, the air has half the oxygen found at sea level. At 26,000 feet, climbers enter the Death Zone; it is devilishly difficult to draw a breath, and the heart strains to pump blood. When climbers reach the summit, their breathing will be a shallow, fast pant. They will vomit and suffer dehydration and begin to hallucinate.Wielicki recalls a past-exhaustion night on a solo Himalayan climb. He huddled inside a tiny tent and made tea for two: himself and his companion, whose presence was no less intense for being imaginary. \u201cI felt him,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, he was not there.\u201dK2 is a northern loner; it sits 800 miles northwest of Nepal\u2019s grand Himalayan peaks, exposed to winds that gust from the Arctic Circle. In February, its walls are colder and more wind-blasted than those of Everest.All of which brings us to climbing strategy.The favored mountaineering style today is Alpine, which is to say, going solo or with a partner, and without fixed ropes. A premium is placed on daring routes or the speed of the climb.None of that would work on K2 in February.The Poles mastered the dominant expedition style a half-century ago. It requires a willingness to subsume ego in the collective. If a team numbers 10 climbers, six will take the role of worker bees, laying pitons and ropes and tents at camps higher on the mountain.These men will scale cliffs of pre-collisional granite to 25,000 feet, even as K2 threatens a rain of avalanches. The summit team will pull up those ropes and sleep in those tents. As they draw within 3,000 feet of the peak, they will go forward without oxygen.How to prepare excites debate. I talk about this with Adam Bielecki, a tall drink of water with dreadlocks and a boyish ebullience. Age 33, married with a toddler and another baby on the way, he began climbing as a teenager. He is one of the elite, and a candidate to join the summit team.He overflows with ambition and chafes at old ways. Bielecki favors a bottom-of-the-world strategy to prepare: Send summit climbers to Chile, where it is summer, and climb a 22,000-foot Andean peak. Stay put until bodies accommodate to the thin air. Then fly to Pakistan and trek quickly to base camp.\u201cAll we need is three days of good weather and we will get to the top of K2,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be a revolution in high-altitude climbing.\u201dBielecki attempted that strategy during a winter ascent of Nanga Parbat, a 26,660-foot mountain in Pakistan that goes by the self-explanatory nickname Killer Mountain. The climbers arrived acclimated, but a winter storm front descended and would not lift.The younger generation of climbers view Bielecki\u2019s strategy as a good gamble. When I put the question to Wielicki, the old legend sounds distinctly unconvinced. He sees a young climber too sure of himself. \u201cYou need super luck to come from South America and find the weather to your liking,\u201d he says.He offers a thin smile. \u201cYou cannot rely on super luck.\u201dPolish Himalayan exploration all but ended in 1989. Its greatest climber, Jerzy Kukuczka, fell to his death, and an avalanche on Everest swept away five other well-known Polish climbers.The Communist government collapsed. As that wounded nation rebuilt, an age of entrepreneurs dawned. The life of a vagabond climber seemed frivolous.Artur Hajzer was among the prematurely retired. Intense, a man of many faces, he had been a partner of the famed Kukuczka. After his friend died, he could face no more mountains. He opened a chain of climbing and outdoor stores.Restlessness welled; he yearned for the Himalayas. He began to run and lost his pot belly. He and Wielicki issued a manifesto: \u201cYoung, angry, ambitious\u201d Polish climbers should embrace \u201cpositive suffering\u201d and return to winter Himalayan climbing.Wielicki speaks of daily life as drained of excitement. \u201cJob, home, eh, O.K.,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to feel great emotion, you must write a story.\u201dThey offered traditional training: winter in the Tatras, then the Alps, then the Himalayas. Their obsession was very Polish: to conquer K2. They were not hand-holders. Bielecki courted Hajzer, emailing a list of his ascents, including climbs up 20,310-foot Denali in Alaska.\u201cYour list does not impress me at all,\u201d Hajzer wrote back.Bielecki sent a longer list. Hajzer relented, a little: \u201cO.K., it looks better than I thought.\u201dBielecki had found a mentor. \u201cHe could get angry really fast. He never said he was sorry, but he was fair,\u201d Bielecki says of his teacher. \u201cWe were generational orphans and he introduced us to Himalayan climbing.\u201cI loved him.\u201dGenerational tensions bubbled. The younger climbers had trained less and came of age in a time of individual branding. When apprentices returned from a Himalayan foray with severe frostbite, veteran mountaineers scoffed at the \u201cpreschool\u201d climbers.Success came rapid-fire, as did sorrow.In the winter of 2013, Bielecki and three others set out to ascend the 26,414-foot Broad Peak. Two grew exhausted near the top, and Bielecki noted that nightfall and still more crushing cold approached. Perhaps they should retreat. The others disagreed.Bielecki and his partner made it back to their tents, badly frostbitten. The slower duo perished.A Polish mountaineering commission assailed Bielecki: You violated the brotherhood of the rope and deserted comrades. This was a too-harsh indictment. To wait for others at 25,000 feet in minus-25 degree temperatures is deadly. Ice forms thick on nostrils and goggles. Water and power gels freeze solid. Hands, feet and arms go numb.A tomb forms around you.Bielecki\u2019s voice is plaintive. \u201cOn top of a mountain in Karakoram in winter, your state of mind eludes words,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are beyond the edge of what people call fatigue.\u201dMountain deaths are dominoes; one precipitates another. Soon after, Hajzer flew to the Himalayas intent on finding peace by climbing. He carried the weight of too many deaths.A storm coiled like a snake around a mountain. Hajzer lost sight of his young partner and descended quickly, looking for him. He lost his balance and fell 1,800 feet to his death.He was 51. His body remains in a Himalayan crevasse.\u201cIt was Artur\u2019s last lecture,\u201d a climber said at his funeral in a grand cathedral in Katowice. \u201cPeople die in the mountains, even the best ones.\u201dWielicki is the remaining master. He must choose among their climbing children, and his eye is unsparing. For the summit, he must choose the elect of the elite. There is Golab, the climber who was with us in the Tatras.Bielecki, the man-child with the otherworldly endurance near the summit, is another natural choice. But his hunger for fame is a bonfire, and that worries the older man. Wielicki defended the young climber after the deaths on Broad Peak. To listen to him is to wonder if he harbors doubts.\u201cHe is a very good climber, but he has climbed for himself,\u201d the older climber says. \u201cHe is pursuing me, I. Maybe it is a little strange on our team because we all must work together.\u201dIf a storm approaches, if darkness descends, the climbers must turn back, even if within sight of that fabled summit. \u201cIf I say, \u2018No, come down\u2019, they must listen,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone wants to be the best, and that is how we die.\u201dHe gives to ambition a nod of self-recognition.\u201cLogic competes with emotion. Everyone wants to write their own story.\u201dWe wander the medieval streets and bars of Krakow with the Himalayan climbers. The question of K2, to risk all for history, falls unevenly across their shoulders. Marek Chmielarski, that painter of oil platforms, will go, although his wife, a teacher, worries.\u201cThey think we are crazy.\u201d he says. \u201cThey are right, of course.\u201dGolab is in: \u201cSometimes I wonder why I am doing this. I don\u2019t like to connect nationalism and climbing. But these are my friends and we are on a mission.\u201dWe run into Kacper Tekieli, the other Tatra climber, making cappuccinos in a coffee bar off Krakow\u2019s grand square. He could join the elite four who summit K2. That mountain, mythical and moody and deadly, once consumed him.\u201cI was captivated,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the Polish specialty is suffering.\u201dHe grew up in Gdansk, a shipyard city, and came to climbing as a philosophy student. He took solo trips (known in Polish as the lonely style) across the high Tatras in winter. He climbed Alpine and Himalayan peaks. Last summer he lost a friend in the Indian Himalayas, watching him slip away as rescuers neared.\u201cI was very, very close to him when he fell.\u201d Tekieli\u2019s dark eyes flicker and he fingers his wedding band, which hangs on a leather cord around his neck. \u201cI will keep climbing, but I think I don\u2019t know the result of that yet.\u201dAnd K2? He shrugs. \u201cMountains are very important to me, it\u2019s the original world, a place of passion. I want to keep finding beautiful paths up mountains.\u201dHe pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I need K2 in winter.\u201dDays later, Wielicki, the old legend, and I watch snow fall on a frozen lake. He acknowledges the age of winter climbing could draw to a close. Danger weighs on him as it did not decades ago. His wife is adept on cliffs, and he twitches as she moves up a rock face. He is pleased his children have not inherited his passions.And yet, God, that mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the problem of the people in the Katowice club, but of the people of Poland. Always they ask: \u2018You go? Why not? You should write something historic. Finish your story\u2019.\u201dThose who stand within the shadow of that monolith in winter describe a sensation akin to having landed on an extraterrestrial world. All is black and white and gray with periodic wild flashes of razor-blue sky and sun. K2 sits 70 miles from the nearest village, at the end of a path that threads across the Baltoro and Godwin-Austen glaciers. Periodically these ice flows disgorge the bones of dead climbers.K2\u2019s fastness is so complete, it acquired no dependable name from the Balti tribes, who for millenniums did not know of its existence. A British geographer making a trigonometric survey gave the mountain its name, a clipped abstraction capturing its indifference to life and time.The Polish mountaineers will arrive in late December and will wait days and weeks and months in hopes that incessant winds do not rend their tents. Here and there, they will climb that fantastically steep mountain and lay rope lines on its sides. Then they will slip into sleeping bags in 30- and 40-below temperatures. They will update expedition pages on Facebook and send emails to wives and girlfriends and children.They will pray for a three-day break in the weather.Why climb it? I put the question to Bielecki. He knows better than most that glory is not the inevitable reward of the Himalayas.\u201cClimbing is about pleasure and pain \u2014 in winter that balance is lost,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no pleasure to be found in Karakoram in winter. You are uncomfortable every minute of every day. But the great emotion of making history, of making an accomplishment no one else did, that is immense, almost spiritual.\u201dIt\u2019s the allure of that diamond-hard and deadly pyramid in the deepest reaches of the Karakoram range.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Insider-Trading Case Ensnares Hedge Fund", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byFor hedge funds, information is a valuable currency. A scrap of insight about a coming change in government policy can be as precious as any market data, potentially making the difference between a profit or loss on a trade.As a result, political intelligence firms have proliferated inside the Beltway. But among the firms that traffic in information between Washington and Wall Street, one political insider\u2019s tips to a New York hedge fund crossed a bright line, the authorities said on Wednesday.The Washington consultant, David Blaszczak, and four other men were charged in an insider-trading scheme, accused of using confidential information about government financing to trade shares in the health care companies that would be affected by the changes.Three current and former partners at Deerfield Management, a health care hedge fund firm, paid Mr. Blaszczak to provide inside information about policy decisions at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, leading to millions of dollars in illegal profits, federal prosecutors in Manhattan and securities regulators said.While federal prosecutors have been investigating the case for more than a year, it is the most prominent insider-trading case to be filed by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan since its chief, Preet Bharara, was fired by President Trump in March. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spend more than $1 trillion a year on health care programs for the elderly, disabled and lower income families and are major buyers of medical instruments, drugs and medical services.Mr. Blaszczak, a former employee at the agency and founder of Precipio Health Strategies, was accused of pumping a friend at the agency for market-moving information that he passed to his clients at Deerfield, an unsealed indictment said.In his interactions with the hedge fund partners, Mr. Blaszczak bragged about his access to the inside information. In an email message, he said his analysis differed from that of one of his competitors because that competitor \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anyone at cms. His guesses are just wild random guesses,\u201d according to a separate complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The information involved tips about potential changes in government policy and regulations for things such as radiation therapy and kidney dialysis and how these policies would affect publicly traded companies.Two of the partners, Rob Olan and Ted Huber, were named in the indictment on Wednesday. Jordan Fogel, who worked at Deerfield from 2006 until last year, was charged separately and pleaded guilty this month.Federal prosecutors in New York contend the scheme generated $3.5 million in illegal profits. The S.E.C. said the information led to $3.9 million in illegal profits.\u201cDeerfield is committed to maintaining a strict culture of compliance and the highest ethical standards,\u201d Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Deerfield said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are cooperating fully with the government\u2019s investigation.\u201dMr. Huber\u2019s biography described him as a partner who \u201cprovides extensive research and analysis on individual companies operating in the health care industry.\u201dBarry Berke, his lawyer, said in a statement that Mr. Huber denied wrongdoing and that \u201chis research was based on detailed and rigorous analysis as well as the type of information regularly and properly relied upon by institutional investors in evaluating health care and medical companies.\u201dA biography for Mr. Olan on Deerfield\u2019s website described him as a \u201cpartner on the devices team at Deerfield since 2002.\u201dDavid Esseks, Mr. Olan\u2019s lawyer, said, \u201cRob Olan is an innocent man and looks forward to clearing his name at trial.\u201dMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Fogel, said his client was \u201cresolving this issue and looking forward to the future.\u201dMr. Blaszczak used a friend and former colleague, Christopher Worrall, a senior staff member at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as his insider. Mr. Worrall would communicate \u201cmaterial, nonpublic information\u201d about the agency\u2019s rate decisions through text messages, telephone calls and meetings, including some at the agency\u2019s offices, the S.E.C. said.Mr. Blaszczak would pass the information to his hedge fund clients, sometimes within minutes of the communications, prosecutors said.In email exchanges made public by federal prosecutors, Mr. Blaszczak and Mr. Worrall would exchange banter with clients about how much money they could make by collaborating. In one email exchange in 2014, Mr. Blaszczak told Mr. Worrall that they would \u201ckill it working together.\u201dMr. Worrall responded: \u201cYou\u2019re like a drunk whore to me. Hard to resist. Lol. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Worrall, who was also charged, declined to comment. Mr. Blaszczak\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Blaszczak was paid $193,000 for his information over a year and a half, according to the S.E.C. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Blaszczak was paid $263,000 in consulting fees between 2012 and 2014.His name surfaced this year in the trial of Stefan Lumiere, a former Visium Capital Management employee, in a securities fraud trial. Christopher Plaford, a witness at the trial, testified that Mr. Blaszczak had provided him with confidential information that he used to make trades in two stocks.\u201cAs the second political intelligence case brought by the S.E.C. and D.O.J., this case underscores the government\u2019s focus on political intelligence firms and the need for investment professionals to closely monitor the sources of information that potentially emanates from government agencies,\u201d said Antonia Apps, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw several big insider-trading cases and is now a partner at the law firm Milbank.In the latest case, Mr. Worrall gave information to Mr. Blaszczak because of their friendship and in exchange for future employment or business opportunities, the S.E.C. said. The agency cited one example, in September 2011, when Mr. Blaszczak introduced his friend to a private health care policy firm, where Mr. Worrall then interviewed for a job. He did not take the job but used it as leverage to get a $10,000 raise.In the communications cited by authorities, some of the men appeared to be aware that their success in milking inside tips to make money could be their undoing.In one email exchange on July 1, 2013, Mr. Fogel and an unidentified co-conspirator discussed a trading strategy based on information from Mr. Blaszczak about Fresenius, a company that provides kidney dialysis, before an announcement. The unnamed person sounded a note of caution and urged the hedge fund managers not to \u201cget too greedy\u201d in acting on the information.One day later, Mr. Fogel credited Mr. Blaszczak for the insight, adding, \u201cWish we didn\u2019t wuss out but will still make a couple million on it.\u201dMr. Fogel suggested Mr. Blaszczak get paid more for his insights: \u201cLets not get crazy but still. Way more valuable than the other dc clowns put together I think.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Next President: A Look at the Leading Candidates", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byFor more than half a century, South Korean voters have had to pick leaders capable of navigating fraught diplomatic waters. Presidents there need to balance the demands and challenges of China, its biggest trade partner; the United States, its principal ally; and North Korea, a hostile rival with a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons and missiles.Here\u2019s a look at South Korea\u2019s three leading presidential candidates and how they might approach Mr. Trump.Moon Jae-in, 64, a human rights lawyer, leads the latest polls by a wide margin. A former student activist, he also served in the government of his friend Roh Moo-hyun, who was president from 2003 to 2008.Mr. Moon supports South Korea\u2019s alliance with Washington, but he has contended that the country needs a more balanced diplomatic approach to the United States and China.\u201cI will create a government most feared by North Korea, most trusted by the United States and most reliable for China,\u201d Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised campaign speech in April.In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Moon accused Mr. Trump of acting \u201cunilaterally and without close bilateral consultations\u201d after suggesting that South Korea should pay for Thaad.Ahn Cheol-soo, 55, a centrist and founder of the People\u2019s Party, was polling around 10 percent as recently as March, but he has seized on growing anxiety over North Korea to become a serious contender for the presidency.Mr. Ahn initially opposed the Thaad deployment, but he has since reversed that position and said it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d to alter an agreement with an ally. That has been viewed as an attempt to woo conservative voters, who support the deployment.\u201cWe should never recognize North Korea as a nuclear power,\u201d Mr. Ahn said recently. \u201cIf the North is about to launch a nuclear attack, we should first strike the source of attack.\u201dIt remains to be seen how successful Mr. Ahn\u2019s play for the conservative vote will be. The latest surveys have shown his surge in popularity fading, as Hong Joon-pyo, the candidate of Ms. Park\u2019s conservative Liberty Korea Party, has narrowed the gap with him. That is the last snapshot of the public mood until the election; under election law, no polls conducted after Tuesday can be published.A former physician who became a software mogul before entering politics, Mr. Ahn, like Mr. Trump, is from a wealthy, well-connected family and is often characterized as a populist. The men have something else in common: an alma mater.Both Mr. Ahn and Mr. Trump attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. During a debate in April, Mr. Ahn said he would use his school connections and business background to build a rapport with the American president.Mr. Hong, 62, bills himself as the true representative of conservatives, who suffered a political body blow with Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment and have been looking for a new standard-bearer.A cantankerous ex-governor and former prosecutor, Mr. Hong has employed rhetoric that has been compared to Mr. Trump\u2019s. He has said he would order the first executions in the country in two decades and crack down on \u201caristocratic unionists\u201d whom he accuses of slowing the economy.\u201cIf I am elected, the first thing I will do is to propose a summit meeting with President Trump on board the Carl Vinson,\u201d Mr. Hong said this week, referring to the American aircraft carrier sent to the region in a show of force against North Korea.Mr. Hong has angered many people with his views on social issues \u2014 promising, for instance, to \u201ccrack down\u201d on homosexuality, on the grounds that it spreads AIDS. (Homosexuality is a sensitive issue in South Korean politics, largely because many churchgoing voters oppose it, and Mr. Moon has said that he does not approve of it.)Mr. Hong also recently said that \u201cwashing dishes is women\u2019s work.\u201d And in a passage from his 2005 memoir that recently came to light, he describes participating in what appears to be an attempted date rape while in college.In the book, Mr. Hong writes that a roommate asked him and other friends to obtain a supposed aphrodisiac, which the roommate mixed into a beer that he gave to a girl. \u201cHe said the drug did not work,\u201d Mr. Hong wrote. \u201cShe woke up and put up strong resistance, biting and scratching him in the face.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Key to Improving Subway Service in New York? Modern Signals", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "New York\u2019s subway is struggling with old infrastructure and overcrowding. The M.T.A.\u2019s failure to modernize its signal system is a crucial example.Supported byAt a subway station deep under Manhattan, a dingy room is filled with rows of antique equipment built before World War II. The weathered glass boxes and cloth-covered cables are not part of a museum exhibit, however \u2014 they are crucial pieces of the signal system that directs traffic in one of the busiest subways in the world.Much of the signal equipment at that station, at West Fourth Street, is decades beyond its life span, and it is one of the main culprits plaguing the overburdened subway.At the current pace, transforming every subway line could take half a century and cost $20 billion.With a modern signal network, trains on the system could run closer together and therefore more frequently, allowing the subway to absorb more riders as the city\u2019s population grows.London has installed a computerized signal network on four of its 10 main subway lines, and work is underway on four more. Of New York\u2019s 22 lines, only the L train has the advanced signal system. A second line, the No. 7, may have it later this year, after a delay.Confronted with infrastructure dating to the 1930s and a vast system of 472 stations (the most of any subway in the world), officials are forced to decide which projects to prioritize with limited financing. The transportation authority asked for $3.2 billion for signal and communications work in its latest five-year capital proposal \u2014 about 10 percent of its $32 billion budget request \u2014 but $400 million was cut from the plan approved by state leaders last year. The request reflected the need, and it was higher than in the previous two capital plans, when the agency requested $2.4 billion, on average, for signals and communications.\u201cFifty years is way too far out there,\u201d Thomas F. Prendergast, former chairman of the authority, said in his final interview before leaving the job in January. \u201cWe have to find a way to shorten that.\u201dNew York\u2019s more than century-old subway has been essential to the city\u2019s growth, but there is increasing alarm that after years of progress, the system is sliding backward. To accommodate the nearly six million riders who take the subway on weekdays \u2014 the highest level since the 1940s \u2014 the authority is spending billions of dollars on new stations and more spacious trains.The opening of the Second Avenue line and its ornately decorated stations in January was a high point for the agency, but the signal system \u2014 the least visible yet perhaps greatest challenge of all \u2014 remains mired in an analog era. Signal problems account for about 13 percent of all subway delays, and are the second most common reason for weekday delays, after overcrowding, according to statistics from the agency.Most of New York\u2019s subway system still relies on antiquated technology, known as block signaling, to coordinate the movement of trains. A modern system, known as communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C., is more dependable and exact, making it possible to reduce the amount of space between trains.The process is complicated. It requires installing transponders every 500 feet on the tracks, along with radios and zone controllers, and buying new trains or upgrading them with onboard computers, radios and speed sensors. The authority also had to develop a design and software that was tailored to New York\u2019s subway.Over the years, the authority has kept pushing back the timeline for replacing signals. In 1997, officials said that every line would be computerized by this year. By 2005, they had pushed the deadline to 2045, and now even that target seems unrealistic.Upgrading the signals is expensive, but an even bigger challenge is scheduling work on such a vast system where ridership is always high, even on weekends, Mr. Prendergast said.\u201cThe money issue, as difficult as it is, is an easier issue to sort than how much work can the system sustain at one given period of time,\u201d he said.As ridership exploded on the L line, which runs between Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan, the agency did not have enough train cars built to communicate with the new signals.The authority awarded a contract for the No. 7 line work in 2010, but Hurricane Sandy struck two years later, damaging subway tracks and delaying the project. And officials have been reluctant to frustrate riders by halting train service for long stretches, leaving workers with few windows to finish the work, Mr. Barone said.Then there is the constant uncertainty over the authority\u2019s finances. State and city leaders feuded over the agency\u2019s current capital plan for a year, and the agency still does not know how Mr. Cuomo will finance much of the $8 billion he committed toward the pared-down $29.5 billion five-year plan. Transit advocates say that having a stable funding source would benefit signal work and other long-term projects.Then there is London. A close look at how it is attacking the same problems could provide something of a blueprint for New York.As its population climbs, London is facing similar concerns about subway overcrowding. The London Underground, known as the Tube, opened in 1863 and is the oldest subway system in the world. It now carries about five million people each day, its highest ridership ever. The crowding at rush hour is so intense that officials sometimes must close certain stations.The rollout of modern signals on four lines has significantly reduced delays, making travel across this huge city of nearly nine million people more efficient. This month, the Victoria line will reach a peak of 36 trains per hour \u2014 compared with 27 trains per hour a decade ago, and among the highest rates in Europe. In New York, the Lexington Avenue line, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway route, runs a peak of 29 trains per hour.On the Victoria line, which already has some signal upgrades, riders enjoy reliable service and a constant flow of trains.\u201cI\u2019ve never been stuck waiting for a train,\u201d Joe Brooke, a 20-year-old student, said as he rode the line on a recent afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient, easy, quick.\u201dLondon has moved more quickly on signals because officials completed the work on each line faster as they gained experience, prioritized funding for the project and were willing to face commuter wrath when closing stations. The projects have required disruptive weekend closings and a major overhaul of the system\u2019s infrastructure.\u201cPeople think it\u2019s just a few computers \u2014 how could it be so expensive?\u201d Mark Wild, the managing director of the London Underground, said in an interview at his office. \u201cIt\u2019s new trains, new track, new power. The signals are a relatively small piece of the capital cost, but it\u2019s the bit that unlocks it.\u201dOver the years, officials learned from each line and settled on standard technology, Mr. Wild said. The Northern line modernization was completed in about three years \u2014 a shorter period than on other lines.\u201cThe key thing to get across is: The duration to do these jobs gets shorter and shorter the more you do it,\u201d Mr. Wild said.Tube riders applaud the results. Maes Al-Gabry, 25, who recently moved to London from New York, said she often found herself waiting \u2014 and waiting \u2014 on subway platforms in New York. On the Tube, a train arrives every minute or two.\u201cIt\u2019s so much more reliable,\u201d she said as she rode the Victoria line on a recent afternoon.But Transport for London, the agency that runs the Tube, has faced obstacles, too. In 2013, it canceled a contract with Bombardier, a transportation company, over concerns that it could not complete signal work on four older lines on time, and started over with a different company.\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling Transport for London knows how to do this now,\u201d Mr. Joseph said.In New York, subway officials are working to replace track and cable equipment on the lines with the oldest infrastructure and to move the No. 7 train to a modern signal system. Signals on the Queens Boulevard line will be upgraded next.But in Queens, regular weekend closings on the No. 7 line have set off an uproar. Some people have moved rather than endure unending disruptions, said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Democrat who represents western Queens.\u201cWe have people who are just at their wits\u2019 end,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly frustrated and incredibly angry, and there is no end in sight.\u201dMr. Barone, of the Regional Plan Association, argues that New York should schedule longer closings to finish the work more quickly. Mr. Van Bramer agreed that it would be better to simply \u201crip the Band-Aid\u201d off by doing all the work at once.Wynton Habersham, head of the subway department at the transportation authority, said he would prefer longer closings, too, but the agency has to weigh the impact on riders.\u201cThe reality is, if we had our druthers, we\u2019d probably shut an entire line down to do a signal project,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to do that brings a lot of inconvenience and brings a lot of pain to our customers.\u201dOn a recent evening, Mr. Habersham walked along the train tracks near 34th Street in Manhattan as workers replaced antiquated switches and cables. A signal system should last about 50 years, he said, but the one that guides trains through this slice of Manhattan has been in place for about 80.\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where it\u2019s getting difficult to maintain the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re maintaining it and it\u2019s safe, but it\u2019s 30 years beyond its useful life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise of the Fat Start-Up", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIn 2003, Keith Rabois, a longtime Silicon Valley investor and executive, had an ambitious idea: He wanted to start a website that would instantly offer a fair price for your home. If you accepted the offer, the site would agree to buy your house immediately, closing the deal in a matter of days.To Mr. Rabois, the plan seemed obvious: Homes are the most expensive possession many of us own, and yet they are also the most difficult to trade on \u2014 to sell in a hurry if you need to relocate or are otherwise looking for quick cash. But tech could solve that. By analyzing lots of sales data, a company could come up with an accurate price for most homes; then the start-up could buy houses quickly, charge people a convenience fee and sell the homes over a longer period of time.There was just one problem: Back then, Silicon Valley was in the middle of a post-dot-com bust and nobody would fund such an expensive plan. So Mr. Rabois sat on the idea for more than a decade. Then in 2014, amid flusher times, he and several partners opened the home-buying company, called Opendoor. Opendoor has since raised more than $300 million in equity and has also taken out more than $500 million in debt. It plans to be in 10 markets by year\u2019s end.In the process, Opendoor also has become a model for a new kind of tech upstart: Call it the fat start-up.But modern capital markets have since unlocked far grander opportunities for tech entrepreneurs. They are blessed with essentially unlimited access to money, and ideas that once seemed too expensive, too risky or just too crazy are now getting off the ground. These start-ups are fat \u2014 with capital, with industry-altering ambition and, to their critics, often more than a little hubris.Opendoor fits that mold. Its plan is precarious: It faces rising competition, high operating costs and \u2014 because we are talking about the market that caused the global financial crisis \u2014 the possibility of an unforeseen blowup. But if it works, Opendoor could be transformative; by making buying and selling houses as easy as buying and selling cars, it might thoroughly alter the American economy and change how we think of homeownership.\u201cReal estate is a $25 trillion asset class \u2014 people spend more on housing than food, transit, health care and education,\u201d said Eric Wu, a founder and the chief executive of Opendoor. \u201cWe think we can make it work much better than it does now.\u201dSo far, Opendoor is growing quickly. In broad strokes, the service works exactly like Mr. Rabois\u2019s original vision. If you want to sell a home in Opendoor\u2019s price range, you go to the site, type in your address, answer a few questions and then wait for an email.The company has data scientists who have developed a sophisticated system for modeling home prices. Opendoor focuses on the middle of the market, and will neither buy distressed homes nor luxury homes, for which pricing dynamics aren\u2019t predictable. If your house meets its criteria, it will send you an offer meant to reflect the best estimate of your home\u2019s value.The offer comes with costs. If you use a traditional real estate agent, you pay a commission of around 5 percent to 6 percent of the sales price (the commission is split between the buyer\u2019s agent and the seller\u2019s agent). Opendoor charges an average commission of around 7.5 percent (it pays a portion of it to real estate agents).For the extra fee, you get certainty: Opendoor will close on the sale of your house in three days, clearing the way for you to relocate, buy a new house or, who knows, leave the country in case of political instability. It will also let you lease back your house if you need extra time, a convenient feature if, say, your new house needs some work.A surprising number of people are saying yes to Opendoor\u2019s offer. Mr. Wu said that about 30 percent of people who request an offer decide to take it. Opendoor declined to provide revenue or growth numbers, but because housing sales data is public, outside analysts have been able to track the company\u2019s progress. Once it buys your house, the company makes necessary repairs and then puts it up for sale. On average, it sells the house within about 90 days.The company has been streamlining other parts of the real estate process. The houses it sells are fitted with internet-enabled cameras, sensors and door locks, allowing potential buyers to unlock the home with Opendoor\u2019s app and come and go as they please. (I tested this on a visit to Phoenix in December; it was quite handy.) It also started a mortgage brokerage operation, so buyers can speed up their access to capital \u2014 a potential precursor to offering home financing on its own.Opendoor is aiming to stay ahead by offering a more customer-friendly service and by rapidly expanding. Mr. Wu argues that as the company grows, Opendoor will be able to unlock more efficiencies in its business, allowing it to reduce its commission much further \u2014 even approaching parity with the traditional sales process.\u201cThere is obviously substantial appeal for this product,\u201d Mr. Mahapatra said. \u201cBut my question would be, \u2018Is there a way that other players in this space might reproduce this seamlessness, but be less expensive?\u2019\u201dFinally, there\u2019s the nightmare scenario: a real estate crash. Part of the reason Opendoor is expanding to new markets is to avoid the vicissitudes of the business. Opendoor\u2019s biggest liability is all the houses it owns; if some kind of disaster were to befall Phoenix and home sales cratered there, Opendoor would find itself holding hundreds of houses it couldn\u2019t sell. By operating in several markets, Mr. Wu said, the company could insulate itself from local crashes.What if there\u2019s a nationwide correction? Mr. Wu said his team had run simulations on previous crashes, including in 2008, and had found one of two scenarios: On the one hand, the business might slow down for a few years, then pick up as the market does. Or it might even do better, because sellers would decide to pay a higher premium to get a certain offer.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that we might thrive in times of volatility,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Sound crazy? Yeah, well, we\u2019re talking about a website that will make an offer on your house, sight unseen. Everything about it is crazy. But that\u2019s the tech business these days, and who knows \u2014 it could work.An earlier version of this column misstated Opendoor\u2019s operating procedure. It will make an offer on your house sight unseen, but it will not close the deal without seeing it.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Does New York State Control the Subway? That\u2019s the 20-Cent Question", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byTwenty cents.That was the subway fare in 1968, and politicians from New York City to Albany knew that the surest way to get voted out of office was to be seen as responsible for raising it.So when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and his deputy, William J. Ronan, made their gambit to seize control of the city\u2019s transit system, they couched the move as an attempt to preserve the 20-cent fare.But it was about more than that. It was a battle of egos, pitting the giant who had remade the city\u2019s infrastructure, Robert Moses, against a governor insistent that the state take over the entire transportation network.At the heart of the scheme proposed by Rockefeller and Ronan was a bold idea: Because the state controlled the tolls on the city\u2019s bridges and tunnels, it could subsidize the subway and keep fares in check.So was born the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose enormous portfolio includes not only the subway system, but also two commuter railroads that extend to Long Island and Connecticut, and nine bridges and tunnels across the city\u2019s five boroughs.But the powerful agency that was created has ended up being used by state leaders both to wield enormous influence over the region\u2019s transportation system, and to avoid blame and responsibility when things go wrong.As subway service deteriorates, with delays soaring, riders could be forgiven for being frustrated in trying to find someone to hold accountable.In many ways, it is the structure of the authority, formed in the political battles of a half-century ago, that has given rise to the current problems.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, sought to put the current crisis in context, saying it has been decades in the making.\u201cThe fundamental problem with the city subway system is that it is way over capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is extremely outdated, and now it\u2019s crumbling. It\u2019s the same thing you see with La Guardia Airport and J.F.K. Airport and Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. All of our infrastructure is 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years old, 100 years old, and it hasn\u2019t been maintained.\u201dHe added: \u201c\u2018Well, why didn\u2019t you maintain it?\u2019 Well, because it cost a lot of money, and it\u2019s not glamorous for politicians to spend money on it. The first thing to overlook is maintenance, so ultimately it catches up to you.\u201dMr. Cuomo said he had ambitious plans for the subways. \u201cI have invested more in the M.T.A. than any governor in the history of the state of New York,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the largest capital plan ever. So we have the funding for the long-term fixes, and we\u2019re doing it. We just need a bridge to get from here to there.\u2019\u2019While Mr. Cuomo said he was doing all he could to fix the problems, he also said there were limits to what was possible.\u201cI have representation on the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThe City of New York has representation on the board. So does Suffolk, Nassau, Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland, other counties.\u201dCritics, however, note that Mr. Cuomo has already had six years in office to address the region\u2019s transit woes. And while the governor committed about $8 billion to the transportation authority\u2019s $29.5 billion capital improvement plan, he has not specified how the state will fully finance its share.Many riders who complain about having to spend money on such lousy service may not be aware of a basic truth: Their subway fares do not come close to paying the cost of running the system, much less modernizing and expanding it.That is as true today as it was in 1968, when Rockefeller succeeded in taking control of the last vital piece of the region\u2019s transportation apparatus: the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which had built up a large trove of surplus cash. The agency\u2019s ample coffers gave Rockefeller the upper hand in taking over the subway system from the city.The state had already taken control of the bankrupt Long Island Rail Road and was working to take over the troubled Metro-North system. One man stood in the way of Rockefeller\u2019s complete control: Moses, who was by then a lion in winter, but one who still had some bite left in him.He derided the plan as \u201cgrotesque\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d Mayor John V. Lindsay, though he knew that the city\u2019s subway could not address its needs through self-financing, also opposed the takeover.But Rockefeller, with his own infrastructure visionary by his side, in Ronan, prevailed, and on March 1, 1968, the M.T.A. was established.So great was Ronan\u2019s influence on the region\u2019s transportation system that it was referred to at the time as the \u201cWholly Ronan Empire.\u201d\u201cHe was as sharp as a 40-year-old,\u201d Mr. Moss said.Mr. Moss said the creation of the M.T.A. was revolutionary at the time \u2014 public transit would be tied to the revenue of cars and trucks crossing bridges and tunnels.\u201cIt was a national breakthrough,\u201d he said. Even today, with bridge traffic on the rise, the tolls generate billions of dollars to subsidize public transportation.The question then became how to distribute that money.\u201cThe deal Lindsay made was flawed,\u201d Mr. Moss said. He said the board had come to be dominated by interests outside the city, and over the years, according to critics, politicians representing Long Island and Westchester County have gotten an outsize piece of the pie.Mr. Moss also said that when the state took over the Long Island Rail Road, it could have taken another step that might have solved one of the most intractable problems in the city\u2019s infrastructure network.\u201cIt was a grave mistake not to buy Penn Station,\u201d he said.While Mr. Moss said the city should have more influence over the transportation authority, he scoffed at the idea of giving it back control over the subways.\u201cThe mayor can\u2019t get rid of 80 horses in Central Park,\u201d he said, referring to the debate over the city\u2019s horse-drawn carriage industry. \u201cYou think he can handle six million subway riders?\u201dPhilip Plotch, an assistant professor at St. Peter\u2019s University in Jersey City, who is writing a book about the Second Avenue subway, agreed that giving control of the subway back to the city was a nonstarter.But he did think there were some ways that the city might be able to exert more pressure.\u201cIt would certainly make sense if the M.T.A. board was more proportional based on population,\u201d he said.Mr. Moss, on the other hand, sees the main flaw in the byzantine structure of the agency \u2014 with each of the different commuter rails and the subway operating its own fief \u2014 adding to the costs of procurement and slowing the pace of reform.\u201cEveryone wins when you don\u2019t know who is in charge,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cEveryone but the rider.\u201dEmma G. Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Soon, the model Gisele B\u00fcndchen was standing by the pool on Mr. Leitersdorf\u2019s roof while a photographer snapped away.To finance her nascent operation, Ms. Blumin took out a series of loans on Manhattan properties and flipped them.

Farley Post Office across from Pennsylvania Station and a space in the West Village, both of which have served as main sites for New York Fashion Week events.Dan Barasch, an entrepreneur and a friend of Ms. Blumin\u2019s since their days at Cornell University, said she was guided by a desire to have an \u201cadventure that was risky, that others wouldn\u2019t try.\u201dThat sense of risk took her to Puerto Rico, where Ms. Blumin was in the process of buying a house, according to another friend, Vanessa Grigoriadis, a writer for several publications, including The New York Times Magazine.Shortly after celebrating the birthday of her son Theo in April, Ms. Blumin traveled to Puerto Rico with her children.

{"Headline": "As \u2018Brexit\u2019 Tensions Rise, E.U. Proposal Targets London Finance", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byEuropean Union officials fired an opening salvo on Thursday in a \u201cBrexit\u201d-related dispute that could threaten London\u2019s status as the undisputed financial capital of Europe and affect hundreds of trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of financial products.In the course of a series of proposed technical changes, the European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation bloc, hinted that it may seek a more centralized role in supervising the complex financial contracts known as derivatives when they are denominated in euros. It also suggested that it could institute requirements that clearing houses, which act as middlemen in derivatives transactions, be located within the European Union.Those rules, if enacted, could force clearing houses for derivatives to be regulated by European authorities even after Britain leaves the bloc, or to relocate part of their operations in order to avoid losing business to competitors.\u201cOf course, in the context of Brexit, we see that the situation is changing,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said in a briefing announcing the proposals. Enhanced supervision of such markets had been in the pipeline for several years, he said, but Brexit made the proposals more urgent.The negotiations over the financial sector are particularly vital for London \u2014 the ability to serve Europe-based clients from London in the so-called single market has been a main driver of growth for Britain\u2019s financial industry. Once the country leaves the bloc, that access will no longer be guaranteed: It will depend on the outcome of the talks.One important question for financial companies has been the extent to which they will be able to clear and settle transactions in euros, including derivatives, outside the European Union.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Derivatives are financial contracts linked to the future value of assets between two persons or companies. Usually tied to currency or interest rate fluctuations, they are designed to reduce risks for a company or individual holding the underlying asset and are often negotiated privately, rather than traded on an exchange as stocks are.But on Thursday, the European Commission offered a series of proposed technical changes related to the reporting of derivatives transactions. In briefing documents, it said that it would be necessary for firms that \u201cplay a key systemic role for E.U. financial markets\u201d to be subject to \u201csafeguards provided by the E.U. legal framework. This includes, where necessary, enhanced supervision at the E.U. level and/or location requirements.\u201dIt said it would present \u201cfurther legislative proposals\u201d in June to ensure financial stability and the safety and soundness of clearing houses.The biggest impact could be felt by LCH.Clearnet, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group and is the largest of the so-called central counterparties clearing euro derivatives in London. Central counterparties have had an increasingly important role since the financial crisis, acting as a backstop and guaranteeing derivative contracts even if one side in the transaction defaults.Amid the uncertainty of the Brexit negotiations, banks and other financial firms with large operations in London have been making contingency plans to guarantee they can still serve clients based on the Continent.Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its income in Asia, said on Wednesday that it was in discussions with regulators in Germany to open a subsidiary in Frankfurt, and HSBC has said it may move as many as 1,000 jobs to Paris.Advertisement"}

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, under the leadership of Richard Ravitch, persuaded the governor and legislative leaders to allow the agency to issue bonds \u2014 clearing the way for a $7.2 billion, five-year capital program.The money went quickly, with much of what was earmarked for the subway system going toward new train cars and refurbishing of the existing fleet.But two major projects \u2014 the Second Avenue subway line and East Side Access, a plan that would allow Long Island Rail Road passengers to disembark at Grand Central Terminal \u2014 were ignored and were abandoned for decades.With each five-year capital plan, the authority has had to weigh long-term objectives against short-term needs, with immediacy almost always winning out.The problem has been one of simple math and competing interests. The money must be spread among all of the M.T.A.\u2019s agencies, including two commuter railroads, nine bridges and tunnels, a bus system and the largest subway network in the country. Most importantly, say transit advocates and experts, the money spent has never been enough, leading to the current crisis.\u201cIn every other Western and Asian country, the national governments subsume the burden of paying the capital needs of their public transportation systems,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said in a recent interview. \u201cIn the U.S. it\u2019s been a struggle. The federal government has provided only a fraction of what the needs are.\u201cBut if your responsibility is the governance of New York and you are not going to get the money from a fairy godmother, then you have no choice but to extract revenue from the people who vote,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no other magic way.\u201dIt did not take long for the second-guessing to begin.\u201cWhile this is the largest capital program we have had so far, most of what it does is keep the subway system from falling apart,\u201d said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.An explosive growth in ridership since the 1980s has outstripped the capital budget\u2019s ability to keep pace with the strains, transit advocates say, threatening to make the subway system a victim of its own success.At the same time, subway cars are breaking down faster. The average distance traveled between breakdowns is about 112,000 miles, down from 200,000 in November 2010. The authority, in its defense, points out that the current rate remains a staggering improvement from 1981, when the mean distance between failures was 7,000 miles.Much of the state\u2019s portion of the capital plan has historically been financed through bonds, putting a burden on the agency\u2019s operating budget, nearly a fifth of which goes to paying down debt service. \u201cThe M.T.A. has been forced to cannibalize itself,\u201d said James F. Brennan, a former Brooklyn assemblyman who was chairman of the committee overseeing government authorities.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration counters that he has made a priority of the authority\u2019s capital budget. About half of the budget goes to the subways, while the rest is allotted to buses, commuter rail, tunnels and bridges.The governor committed $8.3 billion in state money to the current plan, up from $770 million for the last one, for a total capital budget of $29.5 billion \u2014 the largest ever, even when inflation is taken into account, according to budget officials. (Critics have complained that the state has not identified the source or specified the timing of its funds.)In contrast with past practice, the state pledged to cover the expense of much of the borrowing, acknowledging the fiscal stress it had caused the agency. Also, Mr. Cuomo squeezed an additional $1.8 billion from New York City itself, a significant jump in its contribution.\u201cPeople are always going to say, \u2018We want more,\u2019\u201d Robert Mujica, the state\u2019s budget director, said. \u201cBut the governor has recognized that the state needs to put up more, and that\u2019s why the governor this time has said we are going to fund $8 billion and we\u2019re going to pay the debt service.\u201d\u201cThe level of investment we\u2019ve been making every five years is inadequate,\u201d said Veronica Vanterpool, an authority board member who heads the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. \u201cThe M.T.A. puts out a capital program with a price tag based on what is politically feasible, instead of what the system truly needs.\u201dAnother report from the authority that was commissioned by Mr. Cuomo drew similar conclusions: that depreciation of the agency\u2019s trillion-dollar asset was \u201cfar outpacing investment\u201d in maintaining its infrastructure. The 2014 report, from the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, said that the funding challenges put the authority \u201cat best on a path of continual catch-up.\u201d\u201cOur recommendations got buried,\u201d said Ms. Vanterpool, a member of the commission that wrote the report.Yet the authority says the current capital plan will go a long way toward relieving some of the problems that have troubled the system. The plan allocates $3.2 billion for more than 1,000 new cars, many with an accordion-style design that allows riders to move between cars while the train is in motion.In addition, the capital plan invests $2.75 billion to upgrade signals, including more than $1 billion earmarked for the computerized system known as communication-based train control, which allows cars to run closer together.Still, some budget experts say that transit officials should have invested in computerized signals years ago.\u201cThe mistake was the incredibly slow place at which they have approached upgrading and modernizing the signal system,\u201d said Charles Brecher, director of research at the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group. \u201cWhat was spent on the Second Avenue subway could have paid for a lot of new signals.\u201dVeronique Hakim, interim executive director of the authority, insisted it had entered a new era of growth and renewal. \u201cWe spent the first 20 years of capital programs fixing decades of neglect in the transit system,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that changed dramatically.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about maintenance and improvements to such a massive and complex system as New York City Transit, trends develop over time and they are invisible to the riding public for years,\u201d said Tom Wright, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group.\u201cThen there\u2019s more demand on the system, capacity is not increasing, maintenance is being stretched out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t become visible until it hits a certain threshold level. That is what transit advocates expected to happen, and it\u2019s what is happening now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration\u2019s Push for Gas Exports Faces Market Glut", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 The Trump administration is moving to make the United States the world\u2019s leading exporter of natural gas as a central component of both energy and trade policy.The administration\u2019s ambitions were explained emphatically last month by Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and they were followed up by the Energy Department\u2019s authorization last Tuesday for a Texas export terminal that Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum have pursued for years. Other administration plans include opening the way for more gas exports from Oregon to serve Asia.In recent years, there was strong domestic opposition to the exports, from manufacturers and others, out of fear that domestic gas prices would rise, and the Obama administration moved cautiously before increasing the pace of export terminal permit approvals during its second term.With supplies appearing bountiful, and other countries aiming to increase their own production, opposition has mostly abated, except in pockets of the East Coast and Pacific Northwest. There remains enthusiastic support along the gulf coasts of Louisiana and Texas, where there is substantial room for more growth.For the Trump administration, the economic benefits of gas export infrastructure are paramount. Each natural gas export terminal can require an investment of $10 billion or more, produce thousands of construction jobs and consume millions of pounds of steel. Then there is the additional drilling and production of gas, which is then cooled to minus 260 degrees, condensing it to a liquid known as liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to be shipped on giant tankers to Asian, European and Latin American markets.\u201cExporting L.N.G. meets many objectives, including helping to address the trade imbalance,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit, a consultancy. \u201cThis supports jobs, this supports investment in energy, this supports exports, a whole host of administration objectives.\u201dOnce six facilities under construction or being expanded are completed over the next few years, the additional liquefied gas exports could amount to as much as $50 billion in annual revenue, depending on gas prices. Much of that would help balance the trade deficit with China, an administration objective.Additionally, four big pipelines are being built this year to take more gas to Mexico, and at least two more are slated to begin transporting gas by the end of 2018. With Mexico converting its power sector to natural gas from fuel oil, the country already imports more than 5 percent of United States gas production, which particularly helps Texas gas producers and pipeline companies.To some extent, even American coal companies could benefit from more gas exports, because exporting natural gas tends to support its price. That is important because inexpensive gas has been the leading enemy of the shrinking coal industry, a head-to-head competitor.Proponents in the State and Energy Departments have also long argued that more gas exports can provide better security to energy-hungry allies like Japan; lessen the dependence of Europe on Russia, which has been known to use gas as a political weapon; and speed up the replacement of coal with gas to curb climate change.But construction has begun on so many terminals in recent years in Australia, Malaysia, Russia and the United States that supplies of liquefied gas shipped in tankers are expected to increase by nearly 50 percent over the next five years while global gas demand is increasing by less than 2 percent a year.In the United States alone, where Cheniere Energy began major liquefied gas exports only last year, shipments are expected to jump to nearly six billion cubic feet a day from the current 1.5 billion cubic feet a day by the end of the decade as a cluster of projects are completed on the gulf coast.The momentum for start-ups hit a wall over the last two years worldwide, and four United States projects approved in recent years have not yet begun construction. Companies have been content to complete the permitting process, seek financing and markets, and develop construction plans in the hope they can act fast in case the market turns around.\u201cThe pace follows the market and not the wishes of the U.S. government,\u201d said Nikos Tsafos, president and chief analyst at the consultancy Enalytica. \u201cNo one is really out there fishing for new projects right now.\u201dThe gas business is cyclical, and proponents say it is only a matter of time before demand picks up. China and India are increasingly turning to gas to replace coal and improve the air quality of their cities. Gas demand for transport is growing in Iran, Pakistan and Argentina. Germany has largely given up on nuclear power, and it needs natural gas to replace some of the lost power.Some L.N.G. executives say that the global demand for gas will grow as more export and import terminals are built and that the United States will continue to have a cost advantage over other major producers, including Qatar and Russia, because of the abundance of American gas production.\u201cIt\u2019s been demonstrated over the last two years that when you have low natural gas prices, demand increases much faster than what people think,\u201d said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian, a Houston company developing a $15 billion L.N.G. export project south of Lake Charles, La.\u201cThe Trump administration has discovered the power of natural gas,\u201d Mr. Souki added. \u201cToday, we are the top gas producer in the world, and in another three or four years, we\u2019ll be one of the top two gas exporters in the world, right up there with Russia.\u201dThat is certainly what the Trump administration is hoping for, although its policies may not have much of an immediate impact.\u201cWe could be and should be the largest exporter of L.N.G. in the world,\u201d Mr. Cohn said at a Washington conference in April. He said the first thing the administration would do was issue a permit for an export facility in the Northwest, a reference to the Jordan Cove L.N.G. terminal in the Oregon port of Coos Bay, where a Canadian company, Veresen, has proposed to build.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last year denied a permit to the terminal as well as a pipeline to link it to production, saying the pipe would have \u201cadverse effects on landowners.\u201d There was also strong opposition from local environmental groups.The commission can reconsider the issue, but not any time soon, because three of its five seats are vacant and the Senate has been known to take months to confirm commission nominations.With additional fanfare, the Energy Department last week authorized Golden Pass Products, a partnership between Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum, to export domestically produced gas from the Texas coast.\u201cThis is not only good for our economy and American jobs but also assists other countries with their energy security,\u201d said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who championed the oil and gas industry as Texas governor.The Golden Pass facility, originally designed for gas imports before the shale production boom created a glut, has largely remained dormant for the last six years. With an additional investment of $10 billion or so, the plant could become a force on international markets and export two billion cubic feet of gas a day, nearly 3 percent of current American gas production.Golden Pass claims construction of the facility would mean 45,000 direct and indirect jobs over five years, and 3,800 direct and indirect permanent jobs.The partnership released a one-line statement in response to the administration announcement: \u201cGolden Pass Products is pleased to have achieved this important regulatory milestone as we continue to work to develop the export opportunity.\u201dBut executives noted that the companies had not yet made a final decision on whether to go ahead with the investment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Humanity of Numbers", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byIvory TowerWith their strange and puzzling relationship to numbers, the Pirah\u00e3, a small group of hunter-gatherers who live deep in the Amazon rain forest, seem like some fantastical creation of Jorge Luis Borges. Their relationship to numbers is: They don\u2019t have one. The language they speak has no precise number words, not even \u201cone\u201d or \u201ctwo.\u201d It also lacks what linguists call grammatical number \u2014 terms like \u201cboth,\u201d from which you can tell the speaker is referring to two of something. While the Pirah\u00e3 do have some number-like phrases, they are ballpark expressions, like \u201ca few\u201d in English.More curious still, these linguistic limitations track behavioral limitations. The Pirah\u00e3 cannot, with any consistency, precisely differentiate quantities larger than 3. If you show them a lineup of seven spools of thread and ask them to replicate it, they struggle, creating lineups of five or six or eight. They can tell that a large group of spools is bigger than a much smaller group \u2014 psychologists call that an approximate number sense \u2014 but their exact number sense conks out after 3. Were there four Beatles or five? The Pirah\u00e3 couldn\u2019t rightly say.Everett stresses that numbers are not concepts we arrive at \u201cnaturally and natively.\u201d Like a flint arrowhead or the wheel, they are tools people invented a long time ago, and we know how to use them only because we find ourselves in a society in which that knowledge has been preserved and transmitted. Without these symbols, we, like the Pirah\u00e3, could not \u201csee\u201d divisions between most quantities. With them, as Everett tells it, our ancestors learned to count, and thereby \u201cradically transformed the human condition,\u201d making possible such number-dependent developments as complex agriculture.You needn\u2019t venture into the wild to find illustrations of our crude inborn number sense. Perhaps the most convincing evidence, Everett notes, comes from cognitive research on children. Even shortly after birth, prelinguistic infants are capable of identifying discrepancies between the quantities 1, 2 and 3, as well as recognizing disparities between large and small groups of things. But well after they start walking and talking, children still find it hard to learn what 4 and 5 are, and how they are related.This rudimentary feel for quantities \u2014 precision with small ones, blurry approximation thereafter \u2014 can be observed not only in young children and isolated peoples like the Pirah\u00e3 but also in nonhuman primates like chimps and some nonprimate animals like rats. It appears to be our genetic endowment, an apparatus good enough to have helped us survive the rigors of natural selection. It may also underlie certain widespread features of the world\u2019s languages, such as the fact that they permit distinctions between one thing and many (\u201ccar\u201d versus \u201ccars\u201d) and allow for the identification of two things (\u201cboth\u201d) or three (though not in English), but in no known cases do they give you the means to refer to precise quantities of 4 or more \u2014 unless, of course, you use a number.If numbers don\u2019t come to us naturally, where do they come from? When children learn numbers, Everett emphasizes, it can\u2019t be a process of learning names for concepts they already have. It must be a process of \u201cconcepting\u201d those names: Words like \u201cfour\u201d and \u201cfive\u201d and \u201csix\u201d function as place holders for ideas children eventually grasp. With instruction and practice, they start with concepts they know intuitively (such as that 2 is one more than 1) and learn to construct others by analogy (such as that 8 is one more than 7). Much as a fishing rod is a tool we use to acquire fish, number words are tools we use to acquire number concepts.This account seems to present a paradox: How did we ever manage to create names for quantities if we weren\u2019t able to recognize quantities without names for them? This consideration has led many scholars to conclude, contrary to Everett, that we must be biologically \u201cwired\u201d for numbers. Everett\u2019s response is speculative: While human beings typically cannot discriminate an exact quantity such as 4 without number words, he suggests that some people \u2014 people we might call inventors \u2014 must have occasionally hit upon the idea that the quantity of 4 could be referred to precisely. Many thousands of years ago, by giving names to these otherwise fleeting ideas, such inventors made their insights available to others, creating tools to be borrowed, shared and developed further.In 1202, Leonardo, also known as Leonardo Fibonacci, published \u201cThe Book of Calculation.\u201d While the book didn\u2019t contain any original mathematical discoveries, it did offer elegant methods for solving arithmetical problems, often using examples involving money \u2014 investing, converting or otherwise allocating it. The impact of these examples, which underscored the application of arithmetical methods to business and trade, was considerable. In the early 2000s, a historian of mathematics demonstrated that \u201cThe Book of Calculation\u201d was a main driver of the financial revolution that arose in medieval Tuscany soon after its publication. Around the same time, a professor of finance showed that the book\u2019s innovative treatment of financial decision making facilitated the development of complex financial tools over the next few hundred years.Devlin, a mathematician who has proved a few \u201clargely unremarkable theorems\u201d while distinguishing himself as a popular expositor of mathematics, has more than a little sympathy for Fibonacci. No doubt he was also relieved to learn that although Leonardo\u2019s name is attached to the famous set of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence, Leonardo did not discover them, but merely included a brief discussion of them in his book. The Fibonacci sequence \u2014 a progression of numbers whose first two terms are 1 and 1, and each subsequent term of which is the sum of the two preceding terms (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on) \u2014 seems to have first appeared more than a millennium earlier in a book by a Sanskrit grammarian.Or perhaps you\u2019d rather learn a bit more about that weird tribe in the Amazon?James Ryerson is a senior staff editor for The Times\u2019s Op-Ed page.

We made our case in the press and in ads, and people listened, and we won. And Montana was better for it. That election was one of the most thrilling nights of my life.The defeated Democratic candidate, Rob Quist, is a folk singer who believes in single-payer health care. He ran a grassroots campaign, visiting almost all of Montana\u2019s 56 counties, some of them extremely remote, and he accepted no money from lobbyists or corporate PACs.My dad was shocked.My father had dinner that night with a friend who lives in Billings, who thought the alleged attack on a reporter would energize Mr. Gianforte\u2019s supporters and guarantee him the election. But my father was newly hopeful about Mr. Quist\u2019s chances.I was hopeful, too. The Montanans I know look out for each other, and dislike bullies, frauds and Californians. I thought they would never elect a creationist tech millionaire from San Diego (by way of New Jersey) who had done something so seemingly unhinged.But I was wrong. So now I\u2019m in mourning for the state I thought I knew.I gave money to Rob Quist\u2019s campaign, as a lot of people did. I feel much closer to political races in Montana than in California, where I live. My family is in Montana, and my heart is there. When I was five, my father was the majority leader in the Montana House, and I had an engraved badge that said, \u201cMaile Meloy, Assistant Majority Leader.\u201d I knew that our legislature was passing progressive environmental laws and I was proud of them \u2014 proud of us.The balance in the House isn\u2019t the only reason this special election was so important, or indicative of the future. It\u2019s important because it shows that a strategy of regarding corporations as people, deliberately disenfranchising voters and battering the First Amendment is working, but it\u2019s working to the detriment of us all. As many longtime members of Congress have pointed out, answering reporters\u2019 questions (without violence) is part of the job.I\u2019m trying to be encouraged that the race was as close as it was, and to be hopeful about the volunteers knocking on doors all day. I want to feel as energized about the political process as I did as a kid. I\u2019d like to think that our free press will continue to reveal pervasive ugliness and violence for what it is, and that eventually voting will be easier for people, regardless of where they live.

{"Headline": "For Trump and G.O.P., the Welfare State Shouldn\u2019t Be the Enemy", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byEven Republicans hotly critical of Donald Trump\u2019s brand of populist nationalism were a little giddy with excitement when he won the presidency with healthy Republican majorities in both houses of Congress.Fond partisan fantasies of unified conservative government have given way to night sweats. Congressional Republican resistance to Mr. Trump\u2019s new budget, which combines big increases in military spending with deep cuts to Medicaid and nutritional support for the poor, is one piece of evidence that the party\u2019s legislative agenda is a mess.The small-government fanatics of the Freedom Caucus and its former member Mick Mulvaney, now director of the Office of Management and Budget, may think huge tax cuts financed by reducing health benefits for millions of voters \u2014 23 million if the American Health Care Act is enacted, according to the latest Congressional Budget Office analysis \u2014 is a great idea. But it\u2019s wildly unpopular with the public, including Republican voters, many of whom rely on Medicaid. Moderate Republican legislators thus find themselves forced to pick their poison. Is it better to suffer electoral blowback for cutting popular programs or for fecklessly impotent unified Republican government?Republicans need a fresh formula that can both win elections and govern. Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination was a triumph of bread-and-circuses populism over reheated Reaganism. Yet the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party remains zealously committed to the idea that tax and spending cuts are the magic key to economic growth.Mr. Trump\u2019s toxic nationalism certainly isn\u2019t the answer to his party\u2019s need for a new governing philosophy. There is a strand of thinking implicit in some Trumpian pronouncements that combines support for the welfare state with antiregulatory free-market zeal. Republicans would do well to draw it out.For decades, Republicans have traded on confusion in the meaning of \u201cbig government\u201d and \u201cfree markets.\u201d The regulatory state and the size of government are intertwined, but they contain logically and practically separable strands.But this is a false choice. Regulatory policy and fiscal policy are independent dimensions, and they can be rebundled in different packages. Mr. Trump\u2019s gestures toward a big-government, low-regulation package \u2014 rooted more in instinct than intellect \u2014 proved popular with Republican voters. The free-market welfare state may seem like an oxymoron \u2014 especially from the perspective of today\u2019s conservative ideologues \u2014 but it\u2019s in fact the best idea for a fractious, cornered Republican Party.Let\u2019s start with the regulatory state. Federal, state and municipal regulations add up to a serious drag on innovation, business formation, job creation and economic mobility. Republicans routinely rail against regulation but have undermined the credibility of their free-market ideals by using them as cover to help allies in the financial and energy sector. They rarely do anything significant to reduce the regulatory frictions that hold back growth.Instead, stuck in the grip of stale \u201csupply side\u201d dogma, Republicans consistently choose to spend down their political capital by cutting taxes and struggling in vain to reduce spending. Tax and spending cuts are supposed to increase growth by rewarding work and returning resources to the private sector. And this can work, especially when tax rates are counterproductively punitive.But economists have struggled to find empirical evidence of the negative effects of bigger government on growth. And indexes of economic freedom produced by free-market think tanks like the Fraser Institute and the Heritage Foundation show that big government and high levels of economic freedom often go hand in hand \u2014 despite the fact that such measures are specifically constructed to illustrate the evils of big governments.Republicans need to recognize finally that secure property rights, openness to global trade and a relatively low regulatory burden are much more important than fiscal policy for innovation, job creation and rising standards of living.To be sure, a deregulatory agenda in the hands of Mr. Trump and Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, is likely to be deployed as a mechanism for delivering favors for cronies. But a principled and effective regulation-reducing agenda will strengthen, not weaken, the rule of law.Republicans make a critical mistake, both factual and strategic, when they cast the welfare state as the enemy of prosperity and freedom. Far and away the biggest items in the budgets of advanced countries are \u201cwelfare state\u201d social programs, like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which account for nearly half the federal budget. This creates three huge problems for Republicans.Mr. Trump is president in part because he has \u2014 or had \u2014 better political sense than more ideological Republicans who are implicitly or explicitly committed to cuts to popular programs as the foundation of their economic agenda.Second, dynamic, competitive markets drive growth and opportunity through \u201cdisruptive innovation,\u201d which necessarily destabilizes industries and displaces workers. The lack of a robust safety net capable of keeping people from becoming collateral damage of routine creative destruction, such as the automation and offshoring of jobs or the closing of local plants, generates anxiety and hostility to the sort of economic policy that produces growth and employment. So not only are sound safety nets popular, but they also increase the public\u2019s tolerance for the dislocations of a dynamic free-market economy.Third, the idea that reducing taxpayer-financed government spending is the key to giving people more freedom and revving up the economy encourages conservative hostility to government as such. Republicans for whom it\u2019s definitional that greater liberty and prosperity come from less government tend to distrust it as a matter of principle. Democrats in turn come to distrust that Republicans who believe this can govern in good faith.This leads to an overall decline in trust for institutions and contributes to the polarization and dysfunction that lead voters to clamor for populist outsiders who will shake up the system. But populist politicians like Mr. Trump, who cater to discontent, never make the system work better, because they don\u2019t know or care how it works.The Republican legislative agenda is stalled because party members have boxed themselves in with their own bad ideas about what freedom and rising prosperity require. A new pro-growth economic platform that sets aside small-government monomania and focuses instead on protecting citizens\u2019 basic rights to commit \u201ccapitalist acts between consenting adults,\u201d as the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick put it, has both practical and political advantages. It helps a lot to correctly diagnose what\u2019s hurting the economy. Removing the regulatory barriers that make it hard for people to get work, start businesses and find affordable housing would actually do what tax cuts are supposed to do \u2014 liberate stymied productivity and brighten the prospects of ordinary Americans.Fortunately, defending a more freewheeling economy implies no hostility to the welfare state. On the contrary, a generous and effective safety net can be embraced as a tool to promote and sustain a culture of freedom, innovation and risk taking. Politically, repairing and improving the slipshod infrastructure of the safety net would liberate Republicans from the bad faith of attacking the welfare state in one breath, halfheartedly promising not to cut entitlements in the next and then breaking that promise once in power.More important, grasping that government spending is compatible with high levels of freedom and economic vitality would give Republicans space actually to govern. The belief that it is necessary always and forever to reduce spending leads to the embarrassing spectacle of obstruction and paralysis unfolding on Capitol Hill.A Republican Party that aimed instead to free markets and improve the effectiveness and composition of spending could govern, govern well and win elections doing it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Museo del Barrio Fires Executive as New Director Faces More Challenges", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byEl Museo del Barrio, which has struggled with financial problems and abrupt leadership changes in recent years, has fired one of two senior executives who had been temporarily running the institution. The dismissal comes after El Museo, the oldest museum in the United States devoted to Latino art, appointed a new executive director who is facing multiple challenges, including a basic one: obtaining permission to work in the United States.Museum supporters say that discord accompanying the firing may distract from efforts to support poor and working artists from the Latin diaspora and to raise the institution\u2019s international stature. The new director, Patrick Charpenel, a respected curator in Mexico City, will be under pressure to steady an organization with deep roots in New York City but one that has cycled through three executive directors over the last seven years and has reduced its hours of operation.The fired executive, Berta Col\u00f3n, who had served as the deputy director of institutional advancement, said she was told on May 19 at the museum that she was being dismissed for \u201cperformance reasons.\u201d But she disputed that assertion in a letter to the board of trustees, writing that the museum would face a deficit of more than $800,000 by the end of the fiscal year and that anticipated revenue numbers she had been provided were \u201cnot based on solid expectations and in some cases were grossly inflated.\u201dShe went on to accuse Carlos G\u00e1lvez, who was named with her in August to lead the museum temporarily, of employee intimidation. \u201cStaff is threatened with the possibility of being fired, they are pitted against each other,\u201d Ms. Col\u00f3n wrote. \u201cDuring this period of transition without an executive director, Carlos has created an environment that promotes distrust, fear of retaliation and isolation.\u201dMr. G\u00e1lvez did not return calls to a phone number in his name seeking comment for this article, and a spokeswoman for El Museo said in an email that \u201cthe museum is declining to comment at this time.\u201d Questions that remain unanswered include whether the museum is looking into the accuracy of Ms. Col\u00f3n\u2019s assertions and whether the incoming director, Mr. Charpenel, was involved in the decision to fire her.The controversy comes as the museum, on Fifth Avenue\u2019s Museum Mile, awaits the arrival of Mr. Charpenel, who was born in Mexico and was named as director on May 1 but has not yet obtained the paperwork needed to work in the United States, according to two people close to museum officials. The two spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly.And he will have to navigate the bureaucracy of the City of New York, which owns the museum\u2019s building, on Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, where a tall scaffold has stood for years in front of the facade as part of planned repairs.Now he may also have to deal with the fallout from the letter by Ms. Col\u00f3n, who wrote that the way she handled her duties had never been formally evaluated before her firing. Ms. Col\u00f3n added that she and other directors and staff members had recently discussed Mr. G\u00e1lvez with a museum trustee.In her letter to the board, which was obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Col\u00f3n wrote that during what was supposed to have been a confidential vetting process, Mr. G\u00e1lvez met with museum workers, conveyed information about the four leading candidates for the executive director slot and identified two he thought the staffers should support, suggesting jobs could be lost if other candidates were selected.Yasmin Ramirez, an ex officio museum trustee appointed by the de Blasio administration, referred specific questions about Ms. Col\u00f3n\u2019s allegations to the board chairwoman, Maria Eugenia Maury, but also offered her own thoughts.\u201cI applaud the choice of Patrick because of his history of supporting and exhibiting collectives and artists involved in social practice work and who articulate critical perspectives on art and politics and the human condition,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said by phone. \u201cAt the same time I am troubled by the recent dismissal of Berta and what I read in her letter about employee intimidation, and that has to be investigated at Museo del Barrio, especially given our history of supporting artists and audiences from poor and working classes.\u201dMr. Charpenel was trained as a philosopher and is described by El Museo as a curator and collector. His most visible post was as the director of the Museo Jumex (pronounced WHO-mex) in Mexico City, which opened in 2013 as a showcase for the private collection of Eugenio L\u00f3pez Alonso, the sole heir to the Grupo Jumex juice fortune, and is run by a foundation financed by that company.\u201cHow much real estate, how much programming will go to Puerto Rican artists?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is the cost to the community whose blood, sweat and tears went into forming El Museo?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The senior Warner executives who made a group decision to produce \u201cKing Arthur\u201d saw a chance to put a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spin on a well-worn medieval story. But it proved a massive miscalculation: Younger audiences in particular showed very little interest, even with Mr. Ritchie (\u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d) in the director\u2019s chair.Questions about the effectiveness of Warner\u2019s marketing machine also circulated in Hollywood over the weekend.As recently as last summer, when shoddily made films like \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d arrived on the Warner assembly line, Warner marketers were able to save the box office day with their signature maneuver: a big, bombastic, back-up-the-Brink\u2019s-trucks advertising campaign. But consumers seem to be pushing back, ignoring blanket marketing and instead placing enormous emphasis on review-aggregation sites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.In the last six months, Warner has found substantial hits in \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Batman Movie.\u201d But in that same period, Warner has been unable to \u201copen\u201d midmarket movies like \u201cUnforgettable,\u201d \u201cCHIPS,\u201d \u201cLive by Night,\u201d \u201cCollateral Beauty\u201d and \u201cFist Fight.\u201d And now comes a disastrous debut for the lavishly budgeted \u201cKing Arthur.\u201dWarner ultimately decided to release \u201cKing Arthur\u201d in the shadow of what was always expected to be a box office monster, \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d That Disney-Marvel sequel was again a huge No. 1 over the weekend, taking in $63 million, for a two-week domestic total of $246.2 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data.In the near term, the failure of \u201cKing Arthur\u201d heightens pressure on the coming Warner film \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d which Hollywood and Wall Street analysts already viewed as a make-or-break release. If successful, that big-budget film, scheduled to arrive on June 2, could offset \u201cKing Arthur\u201d losses and show that Warner has put its superhero operation back on track. (\u201cKing Arthur\u201d was financed in part by Village Roadshow.)Warner also has high hopes for Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk,\u201d set for release on July 21, and the horror film \u201cAnnabelle: Creation,\u201d which is scheduled for Aug. 11.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Manuel Noriega, Dictator Ousted by U.S. in Panama, Dies at 83", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byManuel Antonio Noriega, the brash former dictator of Panama and sometime ally of the United States whose ties to drug trafficking led to his ouster in 1989 in what was then the largest American military action since the Vietnam War, died Monday night in Panama City. He was 83.President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama announced Mr. Noriega\u2019s death on Twitter early Tuesday morning.Muerte de Manuel A. Noriega cierra un cap\u00edtulo de nuestra historia; sus hijas y sus familiares merecen un sepelio en paz.Mr. Varela\u2019s post read, \u201cThe death of Manuel A. Noriega closes a chapter in our history; his daughters and his relatives deserve to bury him in peace.\u201dMr. Noriega died around 11 p.m. at Santo Tom\u00e1s Hospital, an employee there confirmed. No official cause was immediately given.Mr. Noriega had been in intensive care since March 7 after complications developed from surgery to remove what his lawyer described as a benign brain tumor. His daughters told reporters in March that he had had a brain hemorrhage after the procedure. He had been granted house arrest in January to prepare for the operation.His medical problems came on the heels of a legal odyssey that had begun with the invasion and led to prison terms in the United States, France and finally Panama. While imprisoned abroad he suffered strokes, hypertension and other ailments, his lawyers said.After returning to Panama on Dec. 11, 2011, he began serving long sentences for murder, embezzlement and corruption in connection with his rule during the 1980s.It was an inglorious homecoming for a man who had been known for brandishing a machete while making defiant nationalist speeches and living a lavish, libertine life off drug-trade riches, complete with luxurious mansions, cocaine-fueled parties and voluminous collections of antique guns. It was a quirky life as well: He liked to display his teddy bears dressed as paratroopers.Mr. Noriega, who became the de facto leader of the country by promoting himself to full general of the armed forces in 1983, had a decades-long, head-spinning relationship with the United States, shifting from cooperative ally and informant for American drug and intelligence agencies to shady adversary, selling secrets to political enemies of the United States in the Western Hemisphere and tipping off drug cartels. Whose side he was on was often hard to tell.In the 1990 book \u201cIn the Time of the Tyrants,\u201d a chronicle of the Noriega years, the journalists Richard M. Koster and Guillermo S\u00e1nchez Borb\u00f3n gave a startling example of Mr. Noriega\u2019s double-dealing. While providing secrets about Cuba to the United States, they wrote, Mr. Noriega sold Fidel Castro thousands of Panamanian passports, at $5,000 each, for use by Cuban secret agents and possibly agents of other Soviet bloc nations.The authors estimated that his illicit gains came to at least $772 million. (The White House put his personal fortune at $200 million to $300 million in the months before his ouster.)\u201cHe craved power and became a tyrant,\u201d Mr. Koster and Mr. S\u00e1nchez wrote in laying out Mr. Noriega\u2019s ultimate undoing. \u201cHe craved wealth and became a criminal. And the careers came in conflict.\u201dMr. Noriega\u2019s two-facedness was known to American officials. But they saw him as useful in helping them maintain influence in Panama at a time of leftist uprisings in Central America. He provided, for one thing, an important listening post in the region.Mr. Noriega turned more violent toward political opponents, setting his feared anti-riot units \u2014 his \u201cDobermans\u201d \u2014 on demonstrators.The United States Senate in 1986 overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling on Panama to remove Mr. Noriega from the Panamanian Defense Forces pending an investigation of charges of corruption, election fraud, murder and drug trafficking. The next year, after Congress cut off military and economic aid, Panama defaulted on its foreign debt payments, and its economy contracted by a startling 20 percent.In 1988, Mr. Noriega was indicted in Miami and Tampa, Fla., on federal narcotics-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He was accused of turning Panama into a shipping platform for South American cocaine destined for the United States, and allowing drug proceeds to be hidden in Panamanian banks.Mr. Noriega responded by organizing demonstrations in Panama against the United States. Gripping a machete as he spoke to a crowd, he declared, \u201cNot one step back!\u201d The slogan began appearing on billboards throughout Panama City.Then, on Dec. 16, 1989, Panamanian troops shot and killed an unarmed American soldier in Panama City, wounded another and arrested and beat a third soldier whose wife they threatened with sexual assault.\u201cThat was enough,\u201d President George Bush said in announcing the invasion, which included more than 27,000 troops.A White House statement as the invasion got underway said the United States had acted \u201cto protect American lives, restore the democratic process, preserve the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties and apprehend Manuel Noriega.\u201d Political commentators assigned other motives, including a way for Mr. Bush to shake off perceptions of weakness; his poll numbers rose significantly after the invasion.Panamanian forces were overwhelmed as Mr. Noriega escaped into hiding, surfacing days later, on Dec. 24, at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. Twenty-three American service members were killed and more than 300 wounded in the invasion; casualties among Panamanians have been disputed, with the Panamanian government at the time estimating that several hundred soldiers and civilians had died, while some human rights groups insist the toll was much higher.American troops descended on the embassy, and a standoff followed. For a time, American forces blasted heavy metal music (including Van Halen\u2019s \u201cPanama\u201d) to torment Mr. Noriega and prevent reporters with directional microphones from hearing conversations between military and Vatican officials. He surrendered on Jan. 3, 1990, and was flown to jail in Florida, leaving behind a new president sworn in on an American military base and a new era for Panama.Manuel Antonio Noriega was born in a Panama City slum on Feb. 11, 1934 \u2014 or was he? The date has been in dispute. In a court hearing in France in June 2010, he gave his birth year as 1936, but then corrected himself, saying it was 1934, the generally accepted date. Legal documents have listed it as 1938, and Mr. Noriega had been said to lie about his age.His father was a public accountant and his mother a cook or laundress, depending on the account, but for murky reasons they were gone from his life in early childhood. He told interviewers that he had been raised by a godmother. He attended the Instituto Nacional, Panama\u2019s best public high school, and in a yearbook he named his life\u2019s ambitions: to be a psychiatrist and president of Panama.When his plans for medical school did not work out, a connection in government helped him get a scholarship to a military academy in Peru. On his return, he began rising in the National Guard.In the late 1960s, he came under the wing of Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, a dictator who would sign a 1977 treaty in which the United States would agree to cede control of the canal and the American property alongside it in December 1999. Mr. Noriega became a loyal aide to General Torrijos, orchestrating the abuse and imprisonment of opponents and tightening relationships with American law enforcement and intelligence.He took on the moniker \u201cEl Man,\u201d but the nickname that endured among his detractors was \u201cPineapple Face,\u201d owing to his pockmarked skin. (A judge in California in October 2014 dismissed a lawsuit filed by Mr. Noriega\u2019s representatives protesting the use of his likeness and the \u201cPineapple Face\u201d moniker in a \u201cCall of Duty\u201d video game.)Embracing his power, Mr. Noriega rigged elections to favor his handpicked candidates. He strengthened ties to drug traffickers. But he also sought bonds with the United States.Colonel North was a central player in a Reagan administration scheme to sabotage the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua by secretly selling arms to Iran and using the proceeds to finance rightist Nicaraguan rebels, known as the contras. Congress had banned funding them.Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate Sandinista leaders or sabotage them in exchange for Colonel North\u2019s help in repairing Mr. Noriega\u2019s deteriorating image in Washington. A congressional report said the sabotage plan had been approved, but there is no evidence that it was carried out. In any event, it was too late for image rehabilitation; the American invasion was around the corner.After he was stripped of his rank by Panama\u2019s new civilian government in 1990 and taken to Florida to face charges, Mr. Noriega\u2019s booking photo, disseminated around the world, became emblematic of his fall. It showed him glum in a brown T-shirt holding a placard with the words \u201cU.S. Marshal, Miami, FL,\u201d reduced to federal prisoner 41586.Mr. Noriega was convicted in April 1992 and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He insisted all along that the trial and charges were a farce. \u201cI accuse George Herbert Walker Bush of exercising his power and authority to influence and subvert the American judicial system in order to convict me,\u201d he said in a two-hour courtroom speech.His sentence was reduced by 10 years, and he was later declared a prisoner of war, allowing him access to a telephone, more visiting hours and even a small salary, among other perks.But while he was in prison in the United States, Panama tried him in absentia for the execution of soldiers in the failed 1989 coup attempt. And in July 1999, France tried him in absentia on money-laundering charges, accusing him and his wife, Felicidad Sieiro de Noriega, of channeling $3 million in drug profits to banks.His lawyers argued that the money was payment by the Central Intelligence Agency, but the couple were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison.The United States had intended to release Mr. Noriega on parole in September 2007 after reducing his sentence by half for good behavior. But after a protracted extradition fight, he was sent to France in April 2010 for another trial on the money-laundering charges. Again he was convicted.Mr. Noriega is survived by his wife and three daughters, Lorena, Sandra and Thays Noriega.While incarcerated in the United States, Mr. Noriega wrote \u201cAmerica\u2019s Prisoner: The Memoirs of Manuel Noriega\u201d (1997, with Peter Eisner). In the book, he expressed frustration over his captors. \u201cNo one can avoid the judgment of history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI only ask to be judged on the same scale of treachery and infamy of my enemies.\u201dYet in June 2015, in an interview in prison with Panamanian television, he was more conciliatory, leaving people, once again, to guess about the real Mr. Noriega.\u201cI want to close the cycle of the military era as the last commander of that group,\u201d he said, \u201casking for forgiveness.\u201dYolette Nicholson and Azam Ahmed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Lawyers Say He Had No Russian Income or Debt, With Some Exceptions", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s lawyers say his income tax returns do not show income from Russian sources or debt owed to Russians, with the exception of $95 million paid by a Russian billionaire for a Trump-owned estate in Florida and $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013.In addition to the Florida estate and the beauty pageant, the lawyers said Mr. Trump had received undisclosed payments over 10 years from Russians for hotel rooms, rounds of golf or Trump-licensed products, like wine, ties or mattresses. But they said those amounts were \u201cimmaterial\u201d and would not have been identified as coming from Russian sources in the tax returns.The lawyers noted that their statement covers only the period dating back a decade, after their firm, Morgan Lewis & Bockius, began representing Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization. It leaves other questions unanswered, including whether Mr. Trump or his firms received Russian income or loans from entities registered elsewhere or whether he derived income from Russian-linked partnerships that file their own returns.\u201cThis is an artfully written letter, covering a limited time period,\u201d said David Cay Johnston, an expert on taxes and a former New York Times reporter who has written extensively about Mr. Trump. \u201cMuch of what we need to know about Trump and Russian money \u2014 and that includes money from Kazakhstan, Turkey and other places where Russian oligarchs operate \u2014 involves transactions prior to 10 years ago.\u201dStill, the details in the letter are generally consistent with what Mr. Trump\u2019s sons, Eric and Donald Jr., have said in recent interviews regarding income associated with Russian entities.They acknowledged the considerable profit gained from the 2008 sale of Maison de L\u2019Amitie, a beachfront estate in Palm Beach, Fla., which the Trump family acquired for about $41 million in 2005 and sold for more than double that, in what was then the most expensive residential real estate transaction in history. The buyer was a Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev.Previous reports have estimated that Mr. Trump was paid $14 million to $20 million to take the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow; the letter claims the actual income was slightly lower than that.Mr. Trump\u2019s sons also acknowledged that wealthy Russians were often bidders on Trump Organization condominiums, in apparent contrast to the lawyers\u2019 statement that any other Russian income from real estate sales was immaterial.But it is possible, because of the way real estate depreciation rules work, that profits from an individual sale might not show up in a way that has major tax implications.Mr. Trump\u2019s previously released financial disclosures also have not given any indication that corporate entities he directly controls or owns entirely had taken loans from Russian lenders.The White House released a letter from the tax firm Morgan Lewis that detailed its review of Russian connections in President Trump's tax returns from the last 10 years.Yet the Trump Organization could still be an investor in other entities for which he is not the sole or principal owner, and which have Russian debts. These types of loans have never been made public, as the financial disclosure report issued during the election campaign detailed only loans given to companies he controls.Some tax-law experts questioned key parts of the letter, including how the lawyers defined \u201cRussian\u201d sources and lenders. Major companies in Russia frequently use subsidiaries in other jurisdictions, like Cyprus, the Netherlands or the British Virgin Islands, to conduct overseas business. Moreover, it was unclear what the lawyers meant by asserting that the tax returns did not \u201creflect\u201d any income from Russian sources.The letter also restricts itself to income on Mr. Trump\u2019s returns, with no exploration of underlying transactions of other entities that file their own returns, such as partnerships.\u201cYou would have to dig down to books and records of underlying entities to see components\u201d of various sources of income, said Edward Kleinbard, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California. Without seeing the actual returns, he said, \u201casserting that TTO counterparties are not \u2018Russian\u2019 is genuinely meaningless,\u201d using an abbreviation for the Trump Organization.\u201cAll they\u2019re saying is that income or expense related to Russia doesn\u2019t show up on the return, but it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Stephen Breitstone, the head of the private wealth and taxation group at Meltzer, Lippe, Goldstein & Breitstone.On Friday, The New York Times asked the Trump Organization about Russian money that might have come through offshore corporate entities, as well as Russian-related loans to entities in which the Trump Organization is invested.Eric Trump, an executive vice president at the company, said he did not want to address specific questions, as doing so would lead to more unfounded speculation.\u201cWe have no projects in Russia, no financing from Russia, no business ties to Russia,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIt is a false narrative created by a faltering political party, and it is simply not true.\u201dIn President Trump\u2019s interview with NBC, he said he had sent a certified copy of the letter to Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has questioned the president\u2019s business dealings with Russia. A spokesman said Mr. Graham had no comment on the letter.The president referred to the Florida estate and the Miss Universe pageant in the interview, but said the letter \u2014 \u201cfrom one of the most prestigious law firms in the country\u201d \u2014 demonstrated \u201cthat I have nothing to do with Russia.\u201d\u201cI have a certified letter, just so you understand,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying that.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when Donald J. Trump acquired a beachfront estate in Palm Beach. Fla. It was 2005, not 2004.Jesse Drucker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Who pulled the trigger? The police department tells you. How was the heroin shipped across the border? The federal agent or prosecutor knows.In its nearly two decades on newsstands and in cellblocks, the gritty quarterly, which calls itself the Original Street Bible, has offered scoops on hip-hop killers and cocaine kingpins, all of whom have trusted that its editors would get their stories right.\u201cOur pages are often the first place that criminals come to talk about themselves,\u201d said Tiffany Chiles, who founded Don Diva in 1999 with her husband, Kevin Chiles, himself a former inmate. \u201cThat\u2019s how we got started \u2014 trying to give voice to voiceless people.\u201dThe couple\u2019s project \u2014 chronicling the illicit lives of convicts \u2014 has given Don Diva a veneer of authenticity in the underworld as glossy as its brash, alluring covers, though, it must be said, on at least one occasion an employee of the magazine suffered a fate similar to the subjects profiled within it. In 2009, a president of the publication, Sam Ferguson, was killed in his Chevrolet Impala in a drive-by shooting in Miami. More recently, Don Diva has found itself embroiled in a defamation lawsuit that other, more staid media outlets might not have been involved in.\u201cIt\u2019s like gold in there,\u201d said one former inmate who wrote for the magazine while he was serving time and asked for anonymity to preserve his post-incarceration reputation. \u201cWhen I was locked up, I used to get copies and have like 20 dudes outside my door just waiting to see it. Everyone in there was pretty much reading it cover to cover.\u201dWhat appears between those covers are largely articles that investigate the intersection of crime and hip-hop culture: firsthand accounts by traffickers like Demetrius Flenory, a leader of the Black Mafia Family, a Detroit-based drug ring that was known to run with rappers and was taken down in 2005 after the government accused it of running a multimillion-dollar criminal conspiracy.But mindful of their mission to educate as well as entertain, the Chileses also publish more substantial fare: thoughtful takeouts on the drug war or on Confederate-era monuments in New Orleans. There is a regular column on legal advice \u2014 Raw Law \u2014 and a section called the Sticky Pages, which features models in thong bikinis.\u201cIn order to get people up on the law and social justice,\u201d Ms. Chiles said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to put the rappers and the girls in there.\u201dIt is a constant source of amazement to the Chileses that all of this activity emerged from a period of darkness when Ms. Chiles, now 46, was regularly visiting her husband in federal prison.In 1994, at age 28, Mr. Chiles was arrested on charges of financing his music label, Big Boss Records, with the profits of one of Harlem\u2019s most extensive heroin and cocaine rings. At the time, Ms. Chiles, too, worked in the music business and was putting out a pamphlet filled with private photographs of rap and sports stars like Jay Z and Mike Tyson. The couple, who had met through mutual friends, sensed an opportunity and started to accompany the images with tales of crime and prison life, many of which came from Mr. Chiles\u2019s friends and fellow inmates.Though they keep their fingers on the cutting edge of street life, the Chileses see themselves as following in a long tradition of crime publications, one that reaches back to pulp magazines like True Crime Cases or National Police Gazette.Before appearing in Don Diva, many of the stories they had told \u2014 about, say, Larry Hoover, a Chicago gangster who is serving six life sentences for murder and narcotics convictions \u2014 existed mostly as oral-historical myth.\u201cNo one ever wrote this stuff down before,\u201d Mr. Chiles said. \u201cBefore we were around, people just spoke about these guys.\u201dAt a story meeting at their shared office space in Manhattan last month, several members of Don Diva\u2019s staff were speaking about the cover article for Issue 61, which is to come out this month. The article concerned a new trend passing through the nightclub scene: how the younger set apparently had switched from selling drugs to doing credit card fraud.Sitting behind her laptop at the head of the conference table, Ms. Chiles steered the conversation toward Don Diva\u2019s lawyer, Anthony Mayol, who serves as an adviser on matters of law and crime. It is part of the magazine\u2019s modus operandi to rely on experts for inside information, and when Ms. Chiles asked what penalties a scammer might face, Mr. Mayol told her it depended on the victim.\u201cIf they\u2019re scamming a big bank, they probably won\u2019t face too much in terms of a sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re scamming small account holders, it\u2019ll definitely be worse.\u201dThis pleased Mr. Chiles. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I like it that you \u2018heard.\u2019\u201dAs the meeting came to an end, Ms. Chiles ran through the offerings for the News U Can Use page and the Diva\u2019s Corner, a relationship and beauty section designed for female readers. There was a brief discussion on whether to try a fresh profile of the rapper Gucci Mane who was having a comeback after getting out of prison.\u201cI just want to be sure we get it right,\u201d she said, shutting down her laptop. \u201cThat we give our readers the nitty-gritty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His father, the Yorkshireman David Matthews, started out as a racing driver before becoming a self-made multimillionaire in a series of car dealership deals and in property development. His mother is Jane Parker, a Zimbabwe-born artist and onetime receptionist for Christian Dior.Alongside Spencer, James had another brother, Michael. He died in 1999 at 22 after becoming the youngest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest. He disappeared on the way down, and his body was never recovered. In his memory, the family created the Michael Matthews Foundation, which builds schools to provide education for children in remote places.James Matthews was educated at Uppingham School but did not go to college, instead initially following his father into motor sports. He then entered a finance career as a trader in London, before setting up Eden Rock in 2001.Outside his day job, Mr. Matthews is a keen skier (so is Ms. Middleton), an avid tennis fan (Ms. Middleton is regularly spotted courtside at Wimbledon) and cyclist (the betrothed couple have competed together in a charity bike ride from London to Brighton). He owns a palatial house in Chelsea and a private jet.Ms. Middleton has some history with her modern-day Prince Charming. After meeting and becoming friends when the Middleton family went on vacation to Eden Rock more than a decade ago, the couple reportedly dated for a short period in 2012 before Ms. Middleton embarked on a three-year relationship with another financier, the stockbroker Nico Jackson. Ms. Middleton has also dated the banking heir J J Jardine Paterson and the former cricketer Alex Loudon, but a rumored romance with her sister\u2019s brother-in-law, Prince Harry, seems largely fictional \u2014 wishful thinking by the British tabloids.In 2015, Mr. Matthews was back on the scene. Last June, less than a year after rekindling their romance, the two announced their engagement after a minibreak to the Lake District. Ms. Middleton received a gigantic octagonal ring featuring a three-carat Asscher-cut diamond, understood to have been bought from the London jewelers Robinson Pelham and valued around 200,000 pounds.Pippa Middleton arriving for her wedding to James Matthews at St Mark\u2019s Church in Englefield, England, on Saturday.It will be held at St. Mark\u2019s, a 12th-century church on the private estate in Englefield, Berkshire, just six miles from the quaint village of Bucklebury, where the bride grew up with her older sister, Catherine, now the Duchess of Cambridge, and younger brother, James. A full revamp of the sprawling estate on which the church sits has been underway for the past week, with stone walls being repaired and gates being painted in a regal gold leaf hue.After the service, the newlyweds and their expected 150 guests will then travel to Ms. Middleton\u2019s parents\u2019 Bucklebury home for a marquee reception. Carole and Michael Middleton bought the Georgian Grade II-listed manor house, which has an 18-acre garden, in 2012.Ms. Middleton and the duchess have a similar approach to style, favoring elegant, conservative pieces by British labels that still show off their athletic physiques. In the final run-up to her moment in the spotlight, Ms. Middleton has reportedly been on an intensive three-month bridal boot camp, which includes yoga, Pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes, as well as specially prepared meals.There has been no further official comment on guests, though one can expect a loyal gaggle of Ms. Middleton\u2019s friends from the University of Edinburgh, the cream of high society, and perhaps even some uninvited faces at the ceremony itself; guidance from the Church of England on \u201ccelebrity weddings\u201d published last month said that ordinary members of the public had the right to attend if they were parishioners, sending the British news media into a frenzy.Still, the Middleton sisters apparently generate millions of clicks, and papers need to be sold. And everyone wants a happy ending. Maybe, after the soon-to-be Mrs. Matthews drifts off into the sunset on her honeymoon this weekend, the feverish interest will die down for a while. Until she starts trying for a baby, when the whole circus will begin again. Bottoms up!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "False Payroll Information Allows 3 State Senators to Collect Thousands", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byALBANY \u2014 Staff members of the Republican-led Senate have repeatedly sent false information to the state comptroller\u2019s office that allowed tens of thousands of dollars in payments to three renegade Democratic senators who are allies of the Senate Republicans.The information \u2014 certifying Senators Diane J. Savino, Jose R. Peralta and David J. Valesky as committee leaders, despite Republicans holding those roles \u2014 was included in emails sent over three years to the comptroller\u2019s office from the Senate payroll office. The emails were obtained through a freedom of information law request on Thursday.Mr. Peralta of Queens, Ms. Savino of Staten Island, and Mr. Valesky of Syracuse are all second in command of Senate committees, and are all members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of eight Democrats who have partnered with Republicans to control that chamber for the last six years.The Independent Democratic Conference has maintained such payments are allowed by a clause that allows payment for service in any \u201cspecial capacity therein or directly connected therewith,\u201d though the law lays out exact dollar amounts payable to leaders in other positions.In at least three cases \u2014 in 2015, 2016 and March of this year \u2014 Senate payroll officials have sent certified lists identifying the three senators as leaders of their respective committees. In 2015 and 2016, two documents identified Mr. Valesky as chairman of the Health Committee, requesting two payments totaling $7,500. He received the stipends, though he was and remains the committee\u2019s vice chairman.Two weeks after that, a member of the Senate payroll staff sent an email to the comptroller\u2019s office with a \u201cSenate certification\u201d of members\u2019 owed stipends, and a request that checks be sent out in early April. A list that was attached identified Mr. Peralta as the chairman of the energy committee, and Ms. Savino as the Codes Committee chairwoman, asking for payments of $9,375 to Mr. Peralta and $13,500 to Ms. Savino.Both amounts were paid in early April, as were smaller stipends in March. In total, Mr. Savino and Ms. Peralta received $30,500 this year, before taxes, for positions they did not hold. The same holds true for Mr. Valesky, who received $30,000 in gross pay for the stipends in 2015 and 2016.The state comptroller\u2019s office declined to comment.Committee chairmanships are mostly handed out by John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who leads the Senate with Mr. Klein, the head of the independent Democrats. Mr. Klein has also named several of his members as committee leaders.State law prohibits knowingly presenting false documents to any public official or agency, a charge technically known as \u201coffering a false instrument.\u201d If there is intent to defraud, such an action may be considered a felony; otherwise it is a misdemeanor.It is unclear who drafted the documents incorrectly stating the chairmanships, which are held by Republicans. Senator Joseph Griffo of Rome, N.Y., leads the energy committee; Kemp Hannon, of Long Island, leads the Health Committee; and Senator Andrew J. Lanza of Staten Island is in charge of the Codes Committee. Lawmakers can receive only one stipend and all three men receive higher stipends for Republican leadership positions.Emails to the payroll official, David Natoli, who sent the information to the comptroller\u2019s office, were not returned.Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republican majority, said that records were submitted by Senate payroll. \u201cWe maintain that everything was done is what is allowed under the law,\u201d he said.Candice Giove, a spokeswoman for the independent Democrats, said that \u201call allowances are paid out and certified by the state comptroller, in accordance with the law.\u201cNeither Independent Democratic Conference Leader Klein,\u201d Ms. Giove continued, \u201cnor any other senator in his conference is involved in the filing of allowances, which is clearly spelled out in statute.\u201dThe payments to the three Democrats have offered a window into the Senate\u2019s de facto bonus system of stipends, known as \u201clulus.\u201d Almost every one of the 63 members of the Senate receives a stipend for their roles on committees, ranging from the leader of the Finance Committee (who earns $34,000 extra annually) to lower-ranking members of groups concerned with issues like aging, elections and agriculture. Many of those stipends pay $9,000 a year.The rise of the Independent Democratic Conference and its partnership with the Republicans has been a continuing source of frustration for mainline Democrats \u2014 led by Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Westchester County \u2014 who have been sidelined in a minority role despite having roughly three times as many members as Mr. Klein\u2019s group.On Thursday, those traditional Democrats seemed eager to know more. \u201cThe more we learn about this,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic Conference. \u201cThe more disturbing it gets.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the area in which Senator Joseph Griffo resides.

{"Headline": "Irish Police Investigate (but Don\u2019t Charge) Stephen Fry for Blasphemy", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe British actor Stephen Fry is known as many things: a witty television presenter, a roguish Twitter personality and an outspoken atheist. Over the weekend, the Irish authorities considered whether to add another label to the list: alleged blasphemer.The Irish police opened an investigation into whether remarks Mr. Fry made in a 2015 television interview \u2014 saying that God, if he existed at all, was a selfish maniac who deserved neither respect nor praise \u2014 had run afoul of a controversial blasphemy law enacted in 2009.The inquiry didn\u2019t last long. The authorities said on Monday night that no charges would be filed against Mr. Fry. But the news that they had even pursued the complaint to begin with set off an outpouring of bemusement and anger in Ireland, which has been grappling with its deeply conservative Catholic history.The interview at the heart of the matter began with a simple question from the television host Gay Byrne: What would Mr. Fry say to God if the actor and the Almighty ever met face to face? Mr. Fry\u2019s response, Mr. Byrne said afterward, was \u201cthe longest answer to that question that I ever got in this entire series.\u201dIf God does exist, Mr. Fry said, he is \u201cquite clearly a maniac\u201d and \u201ctotally selfish.\u201d He said he would ask God, \u201cHow dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s utterly, utterly evil,\u201d Mr. Fry continued. \u201cWhy should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?\u201dMr. Fry, who rose to fame in part through his portrayal of the outspoken 19th-century Irish writer Oscar Wilde, who had legal troubles of his own, declined to comment on the investigation, according to his representative, Christian Hodell.Eoin Daly, a lecturer in law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, said Mr. Fry was never in any real danger of prosecution. He said the law was introduced in 2009 only because the country\u2019s 1937 constitution required the country to have a blasphemy law, and an earlier one had been struck down in the courts.Lawmakers did their best to make the 2009 law \u201calmost unenforceable,\u201d with broad exemptions to protect free speech, Mr. Daly said. \u201cThere was a constitutional obligation to legislate this offense, but it was not against the constitution to create an offense that was of no use.\u201dThe Catholic Church has had profound cultural and political influence in Ireland, but adherence to its teachings has been waning in recent years. There are several continuing controversies in Ireland over the role of religion in public life, Mr. Daly noted, and Mr. Fry\u2019s brush with the blasphemy law is probably the least urgent.\u201cThere has been a huge transformation of public opinion away from the orthodox Catholic positions over the last quarter of a century, but you still have significant church involvement in public services, especially education,\u201d Mr. Daly said. \u201cYou could say the church has an outsize institutional role, considering the public opinion, values and beliefs in society.\u201d\u201cStephen Fry, regardless of your own religious views, was clearly making a number of points that he clearly felt very strongly about, in his usual witty way,\u201d Mr. Harris said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Basic but Crucial Things to Know About Student Loans", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byAs an eager but clueless student accepted to New York University about a decade ago, I signed away my financial future to the entities that lent me the money to attend. I had no clue how student loans worked, and N.Y.U.\u2019s meager attempts to explain didn\u2019t help much, so I just figured I\u2019d worry about all that stuff later.When you make a student loan payment, your money is applied first to the interest and then to the principal, which is the original amount you borrowed. If your payment is late, however, your money is applied first to your late fee.As your principal shrinks, so too does the interest you pay, since you\u2019re charged interest only on the remaining balance. This means that over time, the proportion of your payments that goes to your principal will gradually become larger. This is a good thing.Maybe, but in most cases, probably not.The most important thing to consider is whether, in the (very) long term, you\u2019ll make more money by ridding yourself of student debt early or by putting that extra payment money into a retirement savings plan.There are many variables that go into making this decision, but in nearly all cases, the smarter move is to put that extra money into a retirement savings account before putting it toward student loans \u2014 especially if you have an employer that will match retirement savings contributions. You can cheat yourself out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by forgoing retirement savings early on.Let\u2019s say you, like me, have five student loans with five different interest rates. If you refinance your loans, those five loans would be combined into a single loan that would have a single interest rate.This can be a smart move if you can get a lower interest rate, which may be possible if you have a great credit score. However, that new rate might be variable and could potentially increase over time. (Your current student loans are most likely fixed, meaning the rate doesn\u2019t change.) And, keep in mind, the larger the debt, the more important it is to have the lowest rate possible.Perhaps an even bigger issue to keep in mind if you\u2019re thinking about refinancing is that you might lose access to benefits you get from having federal loans, such as the ability to make payments based on income (which caps your payments at a certain percentage of your income), loan forgiveness, death and disability discharges, and longer deferment and forbearance options.Generally, if you\u2019re doing O.K. with your loans and your interest rate isn\u2019t outrageous \u2014 say, 8 percent or below \u2014 you don\u2019t have to worry much about refinancing. But if you have a rate much higher than that, you might want to reach out to a professional to get advice on refinancing.Advertisement"}

Two museums; 54,000 square feet of exhibition space; 189 artworks, including more than 100 sculptures (one of them almost 60 feet high); 21 cabinets filled with smaller objects.Occupying the Punta della Dogana and the Palazzo Grassi, museums run by the French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault\u2019s foundation, until Dec. 3, this privately financed exhibition purports to display artifacts that were once owned by the second-century collector Cif Amotan II and that have been salvaged, at vast expense, from the depths of the Indian Ocean. Mr. Hirst told the BBC that he had sunk \u201cprobably more\u201d than 50 million pounds, or about $64.5 million, of his own money into the project.Mr. Hirst\u2019s showmanship and chutzpah have turned this extravaganza of \u201cpost-truth\u201d art into one of the great love-it-or-hate-it exhibitions of recent years.\u201cIt\u2019s virtuosity and a big workshop,\u201d said Susanne Titz, director of the Abteiberg Museum in M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany. \u201cHe\u2019s supersmart, but it is cynical.\u201dCritical opinion of the show is divided, but has \u201cTreasures\u201d drawn enough buyers to become a commercial success? Fran\u00e7ois Odermatt, a collector from Montreal, is one such customer.\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy; the ideas are brilliantly audacious,\u201d said Mr. Odermatt, who, like others, bought works after being shown images on an iPad by Mr. Hirst\u2019s dealers. Mr. Odermatt said he paid about $2 million for a color-patinated Coral version of \u201cThe Diver,\u201d a 16-foot-high bronze sculpture inspired by a Francis Bacon painting, now on display at the Punta della Dogana. He said he had also tried to buy two other sculptures, but that the editions of those pieces had already been bought.Mr. Hirst\u2019s dealers, Gagosian and White Cube, have declined to comment on sales.Mr. Hirst\u2019s blockbuster show is just one of a number of events in Venice looking to gain the attention \u2014 and perhaps open the wallets \u2014 of the thousands of collectors, curators and museum directors who flock to the Biennale, which runs through Nov. 26.\u201cWe\u2019re happy our neighbor is Damien,\u201d said Yves Tr\u00e9panier, the gallery\u2019s founder, adding that the works of Mr. Penny and Mr. Hirst \u201cplay off each other in interesting ways.\u201d\u201cArtists love coming here,\u201d Ms. Miro said, \u201cand they\u2019re queuing up to exhibit in this space. The art world is so global now.\u201dVenice\u2019s alternating art and architecture biennales don\u2019t just draw artists, she said. \u201cPeople do come to the shows.\u201dTitled \u201cPoolside Magic,\u201d the inaugural show at Victoria Miro Venice consists of vibrantly colored mixed-media drawings that evoke the exotic atmosphere of Trinidad, where Mr. Ofili lives and works. Prices range from about $50,000 to $100,000.The market is more discreet at the Biennale itself, but collectors who learn the codes are aware that there is plenty for sale.\u201cThis says \u2018call me,\u2019 \u201d Alain Servais, a collector in Brussels, said on Wednesday at the \u201cViva Arte Viva\u201d exhibition in the Central Pavilion in the Giardini.

Ms. Macel invited 120 artists to contribute to her main group show at the Giardini and the Arsenale, but with a budget of 13 million euros (about $14.2 million), the Biennale relies on dealers to fund these presentations.The African-American artist Senga Nengudi was among 40 selected for the Giardini component of \u201cViva Arte Viva.\u201d Best known for her pantyhose sculptures from the 1970s, Ms. Nengudi, 73, is showing a new installation and wall pieces combining industrial metal with her trademark pantyhose medium. These were priced \u201con request\u201d at about $120,000 to $250,000.\u201cThis is intellectually and curatorially driven,\u201d said Thomas Erben, a New York gallerist who represents Ms. Nengudi in collaboration with the international dealership L\u00e9vy Gorvy. \u201cShe was invited by the curator. The Biennale is a prestigious event that will give her global exposure.

Cuomo rather than focusing on improving dismal subway service.As riders reach a breaking point over constant delays, Mr. Cuomo, who has been blamed for not conveying a strong enough sense of alarm about the subway\u2019s mounting problems, has begun laying out plans to fix the system. But the nearly $3 billion of additional funding for the capital plan largely focuses on other projects backed by Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority.John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for passengers, welcomed the increased commitment to the transit system, although he said he was concerned about the lack of urgency regarding subway service.\u201cInvesting in the M.T.A. is a good thing, but these changes won\u2019t address riders\u2019 core concern of the increase in crowding, breakdowns and delays,\u201d Mr. Raskin said.In a private meeting before the vote, there was a contentious debate among board members about the capital plan and doubts about its ability to pass, according to a person who was present for the discussion but not authorized to discuss it publicly. Board members raised concerns about the agency taking on additional debt and about whether the plan aligned with what the public had been demanding, the person said.The authority\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert E. Foran, said the plan would increase the agency\u2019s debt by about $5 billion, to about $42.5 billion. Mr. Foran said the increased debt would not require the authority to raise fares and tolls beyond gradual increases scheduled to take place every two years.\u201cThis is not putting any additional pressure on fares and tolls,\u201d Mr. Foran said.But some board members were not mollified. Veronica Vanterpool, one of two board members nominated by Mayor Bill de Blasio who voted against the amended capital plan, said she did not think the authority should have to take out more debt to finance the proposals.\u201cIt is a crushing amount of debt,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said.Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, has criticized the authority\u2019s rising debt. He has noted that it is higher than the national debt of several countries, including Iceland and Panama.Transit advocates have long called for the state to find new revenue sources to help pay for the authority\u2019s sprawling network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. A coalition called Move New York proposed a new version of congestion pricing that would charge tolls to vehicles entering central Manhattan to help finance the authority.\u201cThere may be some things that come out of it that the board wants to support in terms of amending this capital plan,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said of the competition.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the board\u2019s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, defended the rising debt load, arguing it was necessary to pay for new subway cars and buses.\u201cDo we have to borrow if we want things?\u201d Mr. Ferrer said. \u201cWe absolutely do.\u201dMr. Ferrer also praised Mr. Cuomo for taking responsibility for fixing the subway system and upgrading Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan during a speech on Tuesday.\u201cBelieve me, those are problems no rational politician runs toward \u2014 they run away from,\u201d Mr. Ferrer said. \u201cHe\u2019s running toward them, and I give him an enormous amount of credit for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hayes, a retiree in Roebuck, S.C., a small town outside Spartanburg, transferred $75,000 from her savings to an investment fund, she thought she was helping Christian miners in Africa fend off competition from conglomerates. She was promised a return of 10 percent a year.But before long, she and fellow investors learned that they had become victims of a Ponzi-like scheme \u2014 one, it turns out, that leads back to a former high-ranking European Union official.The investigators presented their conclusions in a damning report to the authorities in Malta last summer, according to interviews with people involved in the case and to records obtained by The New York Times. But nothing appears to have been done.Even when Brussels suspects wrongdoing by European Union officials, staff members often can do very little about it, because enforcement is largely up to the member nations.He added: \u201cWithout proper policing powers or help from member states, it simply serves to tip off fraudsters that they are under suspicion so they can destroy any evidence when, or if, they are finally prosecuted.\u201dMr. Kessler and his staff would not discuss the report about Mr. Dalli, saying they were not permitted to do so.Reached by phone and asked about the fraud investigation, Mr. Dalli said: \u201cListen, listen, listen. That case has been fomented by Kessler. A false report has been sent to the Malta police which has been investigated, O.K., and nothing has come out of it.\u201d He then hung up.His account was not supported by other officials, however.The report from Mr. Kessler\u2019s office was sent to the office of Malta\u2019s attorney general, Peter Grech. In a statement, Mr. Grech said his office would refer such findings to the police if there were \u201cthe possibility of criminally sanctionable conduct,\u201d but he declined to discuss the Dalli case.A spokeswoman for the Maltese police, Louise Camilleri, said that \u201cinvestigations are still ongoing.\u201dThe F.B.I. says it has struggled to get information from Malta. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Donald A. Wood, an agent in the Columbia, S.C., office, when asked about the fraud scheme.Mr. Dalli, born into a family of modest means during the bleak postwar years in Malta, trained as an accountant before becoming a management consultant and politician.Elected to Parliament in 1987, he became finance minister and then foreign minister. In 2010, he was sent to Brussels as the Maltese member of the European Commission, where each of the European Union\u2019s now 28 members is represented.His other major focus was tobacco regulation. He championed a law forcing cigarette makers to include health warnings that cover most of the surface of their boxes.Mr. Dalli was forced to step down when it emerged that a Maltese acquaintance had sought 60 million euros from a Swedish tobacco company in exchange for urging Mr. Dalli to soften restrictions on sales of a smokeless tobacco product.A former police chief in Malta, John Rizzo, said in a recent interview that \u201cthere was enough evidence to substantiate a criminal case against John Dalli\u201d but that he \u201ccannot really explain\u201d why Mr. Dalli was not charged in the tobacco case.Investigators allege that the trips were related to a Ponzi-style scheme \u2014 nicknamed Gold Pool \u2014 led by Mr. Dalli\u2019s friend Eloise Corbin, an American who had a long history of run-ins with the law and who boasted of connections to a rich Chinese family. (No one responded after a reporter knocked on Ms. Corbin\u2019s door, and left a letter requesting an interview, at her home in Malta.)Investigators say that Mr. Dalli and Ms. Corbin traveled together in 2011 and 2012 to a German health spa, and spent time together at a villa in the Bahamas, where he benefited from the use of an $8,000-a-month beachside villa that was not declared to the European Commission, his employer at the time.Many of the investors thought their money was going to an entity called Tyre Ltd., which reported trading gold. Mr. Dalli\u2019s daughters served on the board of the company, and its registered address was the same as a consultancy run by Mr. Dalli.In 2011, Ms. Corbin invited an American friend, Debbie Wicker, to Malta. They had met in the Philippines on a Christian mission in 2002, and shared an interest in Chinese medicine. Ms. Wicker brought eight people from South Carolina, including Ms. Hayes, into Gold Pool. (A woman who answered the phone at a number listed for Ms. Wicker in South Carolina hung up when this reporter identified himself.)During a visit to the Bahamas, Ms. Corbin introduced Mr. Dalli to Michael D. Brady, a founder of a Tea Party branch in South Carolina, as her business partner and as a European commissioner, and that \u201cgave credibility to her and the whole investment scheme,\u201d Mr. Brady wrote in an email.\u201cWe were also told that these miners were Christian and for that reason were being pushed out by the larger miners,\u201d said Mr. Brady, whose wife, Maria, briefly invested in the scheme.Ms. Corbin, he recalled, would take a percentage of the profits to help orphans in the Philippines, and it would be a \u201clegal and safe alternative to the stock market.\u201dMs. Hayes, who is a friend of the Bradys, recalled, \u201cMaria got out the Bible and looked up Tyre, and they\u2019re saying Tyre is supposed to be the wickedest city. We should have right there stopped and said, \u2018We better not invest.\u2019 But stupid us.\u201dAnother investor, James B. Geiger, who lives in Alabama and who invested $600,000, told European investigators that the \u201cfact that John Dalli as E.U. commissioner was involved gave me the trust\u201d he needed.Investigators who worked on the Dalli case wrote in their report that some victims of the fraud scheme were reluctant to talk because of their involvement in fringe political organizations.Ms. Hayes, 72, has battled heart problems and a hernia and has had to give up annual cruises \u2014 often to the Bahamas \u2014 to keep up payments for medical care.It wasn\u2019t until February 2015 that Ms. Hayes gathered seven other investors around her dining room table. But hopes of recouping their investments drained away when one of them, Janie B. Moore, 69, distributed copies of an anonymous email alleging that Ms. Corbin had already spent large sums of the investors\u2019 money to pay for indulgences like the rented Bahamas villa.It was \u201ca matter of time and the funds disappear,\u201d the email warned.The investors \u201crealized at that point they had been suckered,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who had invested $409,000, which she described as her life savings. She never received a dividend and recovered only $7,200 from her investment.Ms. Moore says she is unable to buy a new car or travel. \u201cDalli\u2019s living high on the hog and we have no money to even live on,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything breaks down, I am just stuck with it.\u201dMark Micallef contributed reporting from Valletta, Malta.

{"Headline": "Arts Groups on Edge as New York City Re-evaluates Cultural Funding", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byThe elite, majestic museums of Manhattan never had to worry about competing for city money with the small-fry arts groups of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. Those organizations, hardly world famous or well connected, had to accept scraps while the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lincoln Center and other giants enjoyed a relative feast of resources under the city\u2019s century-old formula for financing cultural institutions.But this two-tiered system of haves and have-nots is poised for its biggest transformation in decades. Mayor Bill de Blasio and his lieutenants are deep into a re-examination of New York City\u2019s $178 million arts budget and other cultural resources to try to give a higher profile \u2014 and perhaps more taxpayer money \u2014 to smaller institutions in disadvantaged neighborhoods.The prospect of a new approach, with an emphasis on greater equity, has some major arts organizations fearful they will end up with less of the municipal-funding pie, while more marginalized groups are hopeful about finally receiving more.The de Blasio administration\u2019s intentions and vision will become clearer with the release of the city\u2019s first \u201ccultural plan,\u201d which represents the mayor\u2019s big chance to put his stamp on the artistic landscape of the city and counteract his reputation for caring little about culture. City Hall declined to comment.But in pursuing these changes, city officials could be setting the stage for an art-world version of class warfare, with cultural giants and their well-heeled patrons pitted against smaller, less-glamorous institutions that focus chiefly on serving racially and economically diverse local audiences. Mayor de Blasio, a progressive with national political ambitions, has tried to make equity a theme of his tenure.The mayor\u2019s team is to submit the cultural plan to the City Council by July 1. Next week, in a prelude of sorts, city officials will release a summary of the views of some 20,000 residents who have commented about culture during public meetings on the plan during the past year throughout city\u2019s the five boroughs.Jimmy Van Bramer, majority leader of the City Council and chairman of its Cultural Affairs Committee, said he helped spearhead legislation to create the plan and identify inequities in order to establish \u201cmore funding opportunities for small, emerging, community-based nonprofit cultural organizations.\u201dBut in a recent interview, he acknowledged a potential unintended consequence.\u201cThere is great concern out there that somehow folks would have funding pulled as a result of this process,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to take from one to give to another, to rob Peter to pay Paul.\u201d\u201cThere will be something that says there are parts of New York City that are under-resourced, and that\u2019s going to be something we want to address,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said. \u201cIt\u2019s also going to say that there is great recognition on the part of this administration of the value of major cultural institutions. These are very important, not just for tourism \u2014 which we do care about \u2014 but also to the spirit of the city.\u201dThe city\u2019s re-evaluation is taking place as arts organizations nationwide struggle to cut costs and raise revenue amid President Trump\u2019s threatened elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts, dwindling philanthropic dollars and increasing competition for donors and audiences. In the face of potential cutbacks, major cultural institutions like New York City Center are trying to make clear how much the city\u2019s funding matters to them.\u201cThe support we receive from the city is essential for us,\u201d Arlene Shuler, City Center\u2019s president and chief executive, said, \u201cto carry out our responsibilities as caretakers of this exquisite landmark building that houses one of New York City\u2019s pre-eminent cultural institutions.\u201dCity Center is one of the 33 arts groups in city-owned buildings, on city-owned land, or both, that make up the Cultural Institutions Group. These institutions collectively receive about 63 percent of the $178.3 million municipal arts budget. The Metropolitan Museum receives the largest annual allocation, $26 million, while the Bronx County Historical Society receives the least, $184,072.The remaining 37 percent of the budget is distributed through a competitive application process among nearly 1,000 organizations that are not in or on city property.Less prominent arts organizations, some of them also part of the Cultural Institutions Group, say this might be an opportunity for them to catch up a little.\u201cWe are serving an underserved community in southeast Queens; we are what the cultural plan is all about,\u201d said Cathy Hung, executive director of the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, which will depend on the city to cover about half of its $1.3 million costs next year.\u201cIn this neighborhood, we don\u2019t have the private resources \u2014 I don\u2019t have the corporations and foundations and individuals,\u201d Ms. Hung added. \u201cHowever you flip the coin, we are always on the wrong side.\u201dThe current funding formula lacks clear criteria or consistency, city and arts officials say. Funding has been determined on a case-by-case basis as organizations joined the Cultural Institutions Group, and city arts leaders have long questioned the formula. The amounts have remained largely stable, with the biggest and often wealthiest institutions receiving the most money.But that doesn\u2019t mean larger organizations are financially healthy, arts managers say. The Met\u2019s allocation, for example, represents just a small fraction of its $332 million annual operating budget.Some say the city should focus on trying to increase its arts budget over all, so that every organization is fortified.\u201cWhat is needed is more money \u2014 there is simply not enough,\u201d said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president emeritus of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, who is on the Citizens\u2019 Advisory Committee appointed by the mayor to consult on the cultural plan.\u201cYou see other cities like London making a big investment in culture,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fighting over crumbs; it\u2019s about expanding the pot.\u201dIn addition, some arts leaders say, these larger organizations make a significant contribution to the mayor\u2019s cultural priorities, namely educating children. \u201cIt\u2019s not one big cocktail party with rich people,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cThey are getting the mission part, too, and that\u2019s got to be respected.\u201dIn an indication of the mayor\u2019s sympathies, the city used a $10 million increase in the culture budget last year to give smaller arts organizations a 12 percent increase and larger ones a 6 percent increase.Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, which financed the cultural plan\u2019s research, said this kind of redistribution makes sense. While organizations like New York City Ballet, a Cultural Institutions Group member on whose board Mr. Walker serves, are important for tourism and other parts of the city\u2019s economy, smaller arts groups outside Manhattan are also crucial, he said, and have a harder time.\u201cLarger organizations have more capacity to raise private funds\u201d compared with arts groups \u201cin low-income communities of color and in places like Staten Island,\u201d he said.\u201cIf culture in New York only means large, rich organizations, then we lose the lifeblood, which are the small, innovative, entrepreneurial, off-the-beaten track kind of organizations with small budgets that the city should also be funding,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not possible for those organizations to thrive anymore, New York will have all of the features of an unequal city.\u201dThe results of this re-examination period won\u2019t be felt right away; Mr. Finkelpearl noted that the cultural plan will come out after the city has finalized next year\u2019s budget. But because the city\u2019s cultural funds are finite, the process is expected to affect how much public support arts organizations will be able to count on in years to come.\u201cI understand that resources are limited,\u201d Mr. Van Bramer said. \u201cBut budgets are statements of values, budgets are about priorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Scenes at Orchard Platform, a Struggle to Innovate", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byOn a warm morning early last year, a start-up founder named Matt Burton addressed a group of 175 investors and executives at the sleek glass IAC building in Chelsea.Mr. Burton described how his company, Orchard Platform, already a provider of loan data to financial institutions, would soon unveil its own trading platform for loans.It had all the earmarks of a successful plan. Mr. Burton and the other Orchard founders had worked at an online ad exchange called Admeld, sold to Google for $400 million. Venture capital firms and Wall Street heavyweights including John Mack and Vikram Pandit had invested in Orchard. And Lending Club, the leading start-up offering online loans, had not yet been engulfed in scandal.\u201cWe\u2019re launching a full marketplace from scratch,\u201d Mr. Burton said a few months later, at Orchard\u2019s Flatiron district office, and we \u201chope everyone shows up.\u201dBut they didn\u2019t.More than a year after Mr. Burton revealed his big plans, Orchard has completed just a scattering of transactions. Over that time, it burned through more than $5 million in legal fees and other expenses. A regulatory snarl over whether the loans would be treated as securities caused delays. Major lending platforms were reluctant to participate. And the market for loans was thrust into upheaval by a wave of defaults and a scandal that broke last May at Lending Club.Next month, hoping to add momentum, Orchard plans to unveil a scaled-back version of the platform, eight months later than first planned.But regardless of the company\u2019s fate, its struggles thus far reveal just how hard it can be for a new entrant \u2014 even one with successful founders, a promising service and big-name investors \u2014 to break into a highly regulated industry.In a series of interviews over the last 15 months, Mr. Burton and other Orchard employees offered an unusual inside look at a project that has not gone as envisioned, but that they believe still holds promise \u2014 especially in a Trump era of potentially lighter financial regulation.\u201cIn general, it has been a humbling process going through it,\u201d Mr. Burton acknowledged last week. \u201cWe have definitely learned a ton. When you\u2019re operating in a new space in fintech, it\u2019s hard.\u201dWhen Orchard was founded in 2013, marketplace lending was just taking off. Unlike banks \u2014 which take deposits, make loans and hold capital to absorb loan losses \u2014 marketplace lenders match investors and borrowers directly, with the investors taking the risk of losses in exchange for higher interest rates.Orchard began by offering institutional investors an automated service to analyze the loans and buy them from different online lenders. But its long-term plan always included creation of what Mr. Burton calls a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d trading platform.\u201cWhat got us excited was seeing what happened in online advertising,\u201d said Dan Ciporin, whose Canaan Partners invested in Lending Club and Orchard. In that realm, he said, access to data drove a shift away from ads being sold via \u201cgolf-course relationships.\u201d Mr. Burton\u2019s pitch: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do the same thing in financial services?\u201dBut building an auction-style exchange for loans proved to be significantly more complex than building a marketplace for online ads.As Matt Harris, a start-up investor at Bain Capital Ventures, put it, \u201cBuilding a trading venue and attracting liquidity is somewhere between difficult and impossible.\u201d He still believes Orchard can get there eventually.Mr. Burton, 32, is 6 feet 4 inches, thin and resolutely cheerful. He sometimes takes his miniature Australian shepherd dog, Chico, to the office. At his desk is the 1972 book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance.\u201dSeeking financial expertise, Orchard recruited a few Wall Street veterans from Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns. In late spring of last year, Mr. Burton had more than a dozen roadshow meetings with executives from the largest loan platforms, including Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace and Social Finance.He hoped to charge them monthly fees of $2,500 to $5,000 to participate. Orchard also offered them the ability to be its \u201cdata partners,\u201d so Orchard could standardize their data for trading purposes \u2014 which Mr. Burton called \u201cthe big heavy lift.\u201dStandardizing data was daunting because each loan platform had its own legal and data formats, such as different definitions of debt-to-income, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, which tracks alternative lending.Orchard also enlisted the help of Meredith Cross, a lawyer at WilmerHale and the former head of corporate finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, as it met with Wall Street regulators.But in July, S.E.C. officials told Orchard that they would consider loans being traded as securities, potentially imposing a tougher level of oversight. That made some lenders nervous about participating. Some lenders were also concerned about exposing investors they had cultivated to loans from competitors.\u201cWe do not have a current need for a trading platform,\u201d said Ryan Rosett, a chief executive of Credibly, which offers small-business loans. \u201cOur capital markets team has the ability to sell our loans directly to a pool of institutional investors.\u201dBy late July, 10 of the 30 top lenders signaled they could not participate quickly enough to meet a planned Oct. 15 platform debut. Among them was Lending Club, even though its board had three Orchard investors, including Mr. Mack and Mr. Ciporin.Orchard was also fighting a separate headwind. The broader market for online loans was being buffeted by higher consumer loan defaults and investor fears. Some online lenders cut staff members, and others shut down as loan growth dried up.In late September, Orchard postponed the unveiling of the trading platform, newly named \u201cOrchard X,\u201d to November from October. A few weeks later, its new goal became \u201cjust to do some trades of any size\u201d by year-end, one Orchard staff member said. But Orchard X\u2019s regulatory approvals were delayed until January.In December, Mr. Burton expressed frustration at the difficulties. As Orchard X struggled to get going, he said, legal documents for trades had \u201cballooned to 150 pages from a 20-page contract,\u201d leaving him exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m a tech guy!\u201d he said.As it moves forward, Orchard has played down the regulatory issue, proceeding without an explicit formal S.E.C. ruling on whether the loans are securities. It is a potentially risky move, but one the company believes will work in part because it has dropped its goal of legal standardization, cutting the need for lending platforms to agree on regulation issues. The S.E.C. declined to comment.In January, Orchard X arranged its first sale of about $30 million in loans from an ailing platform, a small-business lender called CAN Capital. The auction took a lengthy four weeks to complete. But Orchard X did receive a fee of 0.5 percent of the sale price.It has since provided data for a smaller loan sale for another lender, Credibility Capital, and signed up with a dozen other lenders to broker loan auctions as well as private placements and two other types of transactions \u2014 \u201cforward flow\u201d agreements and credit facilities \u2014 in which investors provide funds to lenders for future loans.Although Orchard X would receive commissions for all such sales, it would not clear and settle the auctions like an exchange.Looking back, Mr. Burton said on April 4, Orchard should not have tried to persuade lenders to join the trading platform all at once. Having raised $30 million in 2015, Orchard plans to announce next month that it has raised an additional $20 million or more and to formally roll out its revised Orchard X transaction platform.Mr. Ciporin, the venture investor, is convinced that Orchard X will someday \u201cdo transactions instantaneously around any loan.\u201d And while acknowledging that Orchard \u201cdidn\u2019t initially provide enough time for an evolutionary process,\u201d he remained optimistic.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody sees this as a major blow,\u201d he added. \u201cI would put it in the category of a minor hiccup.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some who never had faith in the first place are taking matters into their own hands, to the chagrin of the authorities.Tasos Sagris, a 45-year-old member of the Greek anarchist group Void Network and of the \u201cself-organized\u201d Embros theater group, has been at the forefront of a resurgence of social activism that is effectively filling a void in governance.\u201cPeople trust us because we don\u2019t use the people as customers or voters,\u201d Mr. Sagris said. \u201cEvery failure of the system proves the idea of the anarchists to be true.\u201dThese days that idea is not only about chaos and tearing down the institutions of the state and society \u2014 the country\u2019s long, grinding economic crisis has taken care of much of that \u2014 but also about unfiltered self-help and citizen action.Yet the movement remains disparate, with some parts emphasizing the need for social activism and others prioritizing a struggle against authority with acts of vandalism and street battles with the police. Some are seeking to combine both.Whatever the means, since 2008 scores of \u201cself-managing social centers\u201d have mushroomed across Greece, financed by private donations and the proceeds from regularly scheduled concerts, exhibitions and on-site bars, most of which are open to the public. There are now around 250 nationwide.Some activists have focused on food and medicine handouts as poverty has deepened and public services have collapsed.In recent months, anarchists and leftist groups have trained special energy on housing refugees who flooded into Greece in 2015 and who have been bottled up in the country since the European Union and Balkan nations tightened their borders. Some 3,000 of these refugees now live in 15 abandoned buildings that have been taken over by anarchists in the capital.The burst of citizen action is just the latest chapter in a long history for the anarchist movement in Greece.Anarchists played an active role in the student uprisings that helped bring down Greece\u2019s dictatorship in the mid-1970s, including a rebellion at the Athens Polytechnic in November 1973, which authorities crushed with police officers and tanks, resulting in several deaths.Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, anarchists have joined leftist groups in occupying portions of Greek universities to promote their thinking and lifestyle; many of those occupied spaces exist today, and some are used as bases by anarchists to fashion the crude firebombs hurled at the police during street protests.Over the years, anarchists have also backed a spectrum of causes, such as opposing \u201cneoliberal\u201d education reform or campaigning against the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.The police and the authorities tread lightly in the area.The police have recently raided some buildings illegally occupied by anarchists, called squats, in Athens, in the northern city of Thessaloniki and on the island of Lesbos, a gateway for hundreds of thousands of migrants over the past two years. But the authorities have stopped short of a blanket crackdown, which would be difficult for the leftist Syriza party of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to condone.In an interview, Public Order Minister Nikos Toskas said that the police sweeps were \u201csystematic,\u201d and that the raids were being carried out \u201cwhere they are needed.\u201dThe mayor of Athens, Giorgos Kaminis, condemned the squats, saying they have compromised \u201cthe quality of life of the refugees.\u201d\u201cNo one knows who they are controlled by and what conditions people being put up in occupied buildings live in,\u201d he said in a response to a reporter\u2019s questions.In Exarchia, one of the squats includes a former state secondary school that was abandoned because of structural problems. Established last spring with the help of anarchists, the squat is now home to some 250 refugees, mostly from Syria, who have set up a chicken coop on the roof. Many more refugees are on a \u201cwaiting list\u201d for other occupied buildings.The squats function as self-organized communities, independent from the state and nongovernmental organizations, said Lauren Lapidge, 28, a British social activist who came to Greece in 2015 at the peak of the refugee crisis and is actively involved with several occupied buildings.\u201cThey are living organisms: Kids go to school, some were born in the squat, we\u2019ve had weddings inside,\u201d she said.Another initiative in Exarchia involves anarchists and local residents who have moved a cargo container into the neighborhood\u2019s central square, calling it a political kiosk, from which they distribute food and medicine and sell anarchist literature.Vassiliki Spathara, 49, a painter and anarchist living in Exarchia, said the initiative was necessary because the local authorities would not intervene \u201ceven to replace light bulbs\u201d in the square, known as a haunt for drug dealers, though activity has abated recently.\u201cThe authorities want to downgrade the area because it\u2019s the only place in Athens that has an organized, anti-establishment identity,\u201d Ms. Spathara said.Mayor Kaminis said the local authorities were cooperating with residents \u201cto rejuvenate the area,\u201d and insisted that Exarchia residents had the same rights as all Athenians.Yet in Greece\u2019s crumbling political landscape, anarchists appear to be styling themselves as a political alternative to the government.He noted, however, that anarchists had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to make sure that tragedies \u2014 like the deaths of three people in May 2010 when an Athens bank was firebombed during an anti-austerity rally \u2014 did not happen again. Though anarchists were blamed, none were convicted in a trial that ended with three bank executives convicted of manslaughter through neglect resulting from safety oversights. (They were released on bail, pending an appeal.)Another anarchist group, Rouvikonas, is looking beyond violence, though its members have made a cause of raiding and vandalizing state offices and businesses.Last week, members of the group, armed with large wooden sticks festooned with black anarchist flags, conducted a night patrol of a large park in central Athens, saying the police had not intervened to stop the drug trade and prostitution involving young migrants.Mr. Toskas, who oversees the Greek police force, said the authorities had made a major dent in the drug trade in Exarchia. \u201cSome anarchist groups want to say that they got rid of drugs in the area so that they can control it,\u201d he said.Rouvikonas members recently applied to a local court to found a \u201ccultural society\u201d\u2014 to help organize fund-raising events \u2014 and on Saturday the group presented its \u201cpolitical identity\u201d at a squat in Exarchia. (Anarchists insist they are not forming a political party.)\u201cAnarchists obviously cannot form a political party,\u201d said Spiros Dapergolas, 45, a graphic designer who belongs to Rouvikonas. \u201cBut we have our own means to enter the political center,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get bigger.\u201dThe group\u2019s long-term aim is \u201cmilitant unionism,\u201d Mr. Dapergolas said. But, he conceded, it is not easy for people to organize themselves. In the meantime, he said, \u201cwhat Rouvikonas is doing can be done by anyone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Declares a Form of Bankruptcy", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byWith its creditors at its heels and its coffers depleted, Puerto Rico sought what is essentially bankruptcy relief in federal court on Wednesday, the first time in history that an American state or territory had taken the extraordinary measure.The action sent Puerto Rico, whose approximately $123 billion in debt and pension obligations far exceeds the $18 billion bankruptcy filed by Detroit in 2013, to uncharted ground.While the court proceedings could eventually make the island solvent for the first time in decades, the more immediate repercussions will likely be grim: Government workers will forgo pension money, public health and infrastructure projects will go wanting, and the \u201cbrain drain\u201d the island has been suffering as professionals move to the mainland could intensify.Puerto Rico is \u201cunable to provide its citizens effective services\u201d because of the crushing weight of its debt, according to a filing on Wednesday by the federal board that has supervised the island\u2019s financial affairs since last year.The total includes about $74 billion in bond debt and $49 billion in unfunded pension obligations.While many of Puerto Rico\u2019s circumstances are unique, its case is also a warning sign for many American states and municipalities \u2014 such as Illinois and Philadelphia \u2014 that are facing some of the same strains, including rising pension costs, crumbling infrastructure, departing taxpayers and credit downgrades that make it more expensive to raise money. Historically, Puerto Rico was barred from declaring bankruptcy. In the end, however, financial reality trumped the statutes, and Congress enacted a law last year allowing bankruptcy-like proceedings.At the same time, Puerto Rico\u2019s efforts to coax its creditors to agree to concessions have gone nowhere. Now the coming court proceedings will give Puerto Rico extraordinary powers to impose losses on holdout creditors unilaterally.Puerto Rico has roughly $73 billion of bond debt, and nearly $50 billion of unfunded pension obligations to restructure.The island\u2019s many creditors \u2014 whose lawsuits filed against Puerto Rico on Tuesday prompted the island\u2019s request for court relief on Wednesday \u2014 are likely to receive far less of their money back than they want. Their predicament may turn out to be a cautionary tale for bond holders of other troubled states and cities. Puerto Rico\u2019s case could show public workers and retirees that seemingly inviolate pension systems can be changed, too.The next step is for the Supreme Court \u2014 specifically, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 to designate a federal district judge to handle the case.The island\u2019s lawyers may view some district courts as more likely to be favorable to them than others. Some creditors fear Puerto Rico will seek to have the case handled in the Southern District of New York.Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, issued a statement Wednesday aiming to offer some reassurance, even as he sought the federal court\u2019s protection. \u201cWe remain committed to holding good-faith negotiations to reach agreements with our creditors,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped the court proceedings would \u201caccelerate the process.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the extraordinary power Puerto Rico will now have in court to unilaterally impose big losses on creditors.Some of those creditors are furious.\u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s proposal is not a credible starting point for negotiations,\u201d Andrew Rosenberg of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, an adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of Puerto Rico General Obligation Bondholders, said in a statement. He said that moving the proceedings to bankruptcy court would put the situation in \u201cfree-fall.\u201d\u201cThat things are starting out in such a highly adversarial way strongly suggests this will be a long and contentious journey for Puerto Rico,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics who closely tracks activity in the municipal bond market.Despite the depth of the island\u2019s troubles, many Republicans in Congress have opposed debt relief, saying that the island has long received big federal subsidies for its health system, public housing and other works. They said Puerto Rico should explain what it had done with that money before it got any more help.Last week President Trump suddenly added fuel to those fires, saying on Twitter that there should be no \u201cbailout\u201d for Puerto Rico.On the island, Washington is not seen as a helper but as an unsympathetic colonial overlord. The step toward bankruptcy-like proceedings, under a federal judge, intensified complaints that Puerto Rico has lost all control of its own future.But at the same time, some Puerto Ricans say quietly that if the court proceedings really do allow their government to cancel debt, their island may finally get the fresh start it needs.The coming court proceedings will not be formally called a bankruptcy, since Puerto Rico remains legally barred from using Chapter 9, the bankruptcy route normally taken by insolvent local governments. Instead, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 petitioned for relief under Title III of the Promesa law, which contains certain Chapter 9 bankruptcy provisions but also recognizes that, unlike the cities and counties that use Chapter 9, Puerto Rico is not part of any state and must in some ways be treated as a sovereign.Bankruptcy lawyers and public finance experts are watching Puerto Rico\u2019s case closely, to see if it shows a path that financially distressed states like Illinois might also one day take. States, like United States territories, currently cannot declare bankruptcy.The only creditors who reached an agreement with Puerto Rico were the holders of a class of bonds, about $9 billion worth, that were sold to raise money for the island\u2019s public power utility. Those creditors gave concessions that the governor pointed to Wednesday as a good example for other creditors to follow.The governor\u2019s fiscal plan also calls for shifting all current government workers from pensions into 401(k)-style retirement plans. Current retirees will continue to receive their traditional monthly pensions, but the amounts are to be reduced by about 10 percent on average.The governor\u2019s hand was forced by the expiration on Monday, at midnight, of a court stay that had been keeping Puerto Rico\u2019s creditors from suing. On Tuesday, as soon as the stay expired, bondholder groups and at least one bond insurer sued. Wednesday\u2019s actions by the governor and the federal supervisory board effectively blocked the lawsuits from proceeding.An earlier version of this article misstated the annual cost of fully servicing Puerto Rico\u2019s $73 billion in bond debt. It would be about $3.5 billion, not $3.5 million.An article on Thursday about Puerto Rico\u2019s debt relief effort misstated the amount of its unfunded pension obligation. It is $49 billion, not $49 million. The article also misstated the type of judge and court that the Supreme Court would designate to handle Puerto Rico\u2019s case. It will be a federal district court and judge, not a bankruptcy court and judge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Complaints, Fannie Mae Will Stop Selling Homes to Vision Property", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byOne of the biggest firms in the rent-to-own home business is now on the federal government\u2019s do-not-sell list.Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance giant, said on Tuesday that it had stopped selling properties to the firm, Vision Property Management, after conducting a review of the firm\u2019s rent-to-own program, which operates in more than a dozen states.The mortgage finance company will also impose restrictions on future sales of foreclosed homes to firms that engage in abusive forms of seller financing \u2014 which includes selling homes on either rent-to-own leases or in long-term installment agreements known as contract for deed.The policy change by Fannie could put a big crimp in the business model of certain investment firms that have sprouted up since the financial crisis. These firms buy foreclosed homes on the cheap and sell them to people unable to qualify for a conventional mortgage.Housing advocates have criticized the seller-financed business for fostering abusive practices that take advantage of poor people and contribute to neighborhood blight.\u201cFollowing an extensive review, Fannie Mae will no longer sell REO properties to Vision Property Management,\u201d said Pete Bakel, a spokesman for the mortgage giant, referring to real-estate-owned properties. \u201cFannie Mae remains committed to providing liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, and being a leader and innovator in neighborhood stabilization efforts,\u201d he added.A Freddie Mac representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The congressman earlier this month criticized Vision for failing to cooperate with his investigation and for not providing all of the documents he had requested. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Mr. Cummings said, \u201cVision withheld documents from both Congress and Fannie Mae, so I applaud this decision to end sales to this company.\u201dA lawyer for Vision took issue with Mr. Cummings\u2019s characterization and denied his client was being singled out by Fannie. The lawyer noted that Fannie was reviewing dealings with all rent-to-own and contract for deed companies.\u201cWe\u2019ve provided them with every single relevant document that they have asked for,\u201d said Doug Gansler, a lawyer with Buckley Sandler who represents Vision. \u201cWe have fully cooperated because the mission is to provide homeownership.\u201cOther lawmakers have also raised concerns about Vision and similar firms. During a Senate hearing in May on the future of Fannie and Freddie Mac, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Mel Watt, was questioned over the sale of foreclosed homes to firms that use seller-financed contracts to sell to homeowners.Fannie also intends to begin reviewing how investors who buy more than 25 foreclosed home in a year are using them and will ask those investors to provide data about the homes.After the housing market collapsed nearly a decade ago, Fannie resold about 400,000 homes to investors, including more than 10,000 to firms that specialize in seller-financed deals. Some of those homes were sold in bulk transactions at rock-bottom prices. Fannie stopped such bulk sales in 2014. But firms continue to buy individual homes from Fannie on the open market.In all, Fannie has resold 1.2 million homes since 2009, the worst year of the crisis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Do We Appease North Korea?", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSince the early 1990s, American presidents have treated the growing threat of the North Korean nuclear program as a priority \u2014 but one to be dealt with later. North Korea\u2019s deep poverty and the apparent clownish nature of its leaders have sustained the illusion that its nuclear program could be bought out, the regime itself could be waited out, and that its largely concealed crimes against humanity could be tuned out.While the United States has vacillated between expedient deals, halfhearted sanctions, pleas to China for greater intervention and doing nothing, the North has methodically advanced its nuclear arsenal and missile capacity.The Bush administration showed even less backbone. After Pyongyang\u2019s first nuclear test, in 2006, Washington, distracted by the war in Iraq, lifted targeted financial sanctions on Pyongyang, returned to nuclear talks, turned a blind eye to the North\u2019s construction of a nuclear reactor in Syria, resumed food aid, and removed North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism.While the Obama administration was less prone to making concessions, Pyongyang took a great leap forward in its weapons programs by conducting four nuclear tests and four long-range missile tests.Although most North Koreans are cut off from the global economy, the regime elite remains beholden to international finance for moving proceeds from weapons trafficking. Pyongyang\u2019s international currency of choice is the United States dollar.North Korea is the only state known to counterfeit dollars as a matter of state policy. And the United States has largely declined to go after the Kim regime\u2019s money trail because of concerns that doing so would push Pyongyang to escalate its provocations. The United States has also mostly shied away from imposing sanctions on the regime\u2019s Chinese partners.Pyongyang\u2019s volatility, however, has deterred full enforcement. Sanctions enforcement, like domestic law enforcement, takes much work and time. Even a full-throttled effort is unlikely to yield results in the first couple of years. But until the United States inflicts a hard financial blow on the Kim regime by freezing its funds in offshore accounts, Washington will lack sufficient leverage for negotiations to be effective.With equal determination, the United States should overhaul its efforts to reach the North Korean people. Pyongyang does its best to block information, censor speech and monopolize knowledge. The state\u2019s invasive practices range from lifelong ideological indoctrination to life-ending punishment for thought crimes like watching video recordings of South Korean dramas or using illegal Chinese cellular phones.The United States must sustain these efforts until the Kim regime\u2019s denuclearization and dismantling of gulags are verified. The regime will step away from its nuclear program only when sustained financial pressure creates the specter of revolt or regime collapse, at which point Washington must negotiate a way out for the Kims.Sung-Yoon Lee is an assistant professor of Korean studies at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.Advertisement"}

Schiff is having a moment.The adulation stems from Mr. Schiff\u2019s role as the ranking Democrat on the House committee investigating possible collusion between President Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives.On Saturday, in a speech to the Democrats in Sacramento, Mr. Schiff returned the praise, calling them \u201cthe very soul of the resistance.\u201dWe caught up with Mr. Schiff by phone a couple of days later. Some excerpts: Republicans accuse the state\u2019s Democrats of letting an obsession with Mr. Trump sidetrack them from important issues. Is there some truth to that?Part of it is just structural. We are in the minority. And the administration is threatening to do away with health care for tens of millions of people and so we have to defend against that. And the president is walking away from our global leadership in combating climate change and we have to defend against that.But we have to continue to emphasize what we are for. And in particular how we\u2019ll create economic opportunity for all across the country.I do. And this is an area where I think the mantle of leadership is really being taken up by states like California that can lead the way in protecting families, opposing efforts to deport fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters. Do you worry about Mr. Trump punishing California?I worry about it in the sense that he does have a vindictive aspect of his character \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re either for me or against me.\u201dWe have a lot of power and influence in the California delegation to Congress. We have some of the top leadership on both sides of the aisle. So we\u2019re in a position to fight back against that. If Senator Dianne Feinstein doesn\u2019t run again, would you go for her seat?

{"Headline": "Texas Seeks Medicaid Money It Gave Up Over Planned Parenthood Ban", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byFour years after Texas gave up millions of dollars in federal Medicaid funds so it could ban Planned Parenthood from participating in a family planning program for low-income women, the state is asking the Trump administration for the money back.If the administration agrees to restore the funding for Texas, it could effectively give states the greenlight to ban Planned Parenthood from Medicaid family planning programs with no financial consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re asking the federal government to do a 180 on its Medicaid program rules,\u201d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research center that supports abortion rights. \u201cAnd depending how this shakes out, you could see a number of other states follow suit.\u201dThe issue, and the principle at stake, has put abortion rights supporters in the unusual position of opposing Medicaid funding for family planning services.The Texas program, now called Healthy Texas Women, provides contraception and screenings for cancer, H.I.V. and sexually transmitted diseases, and as of last year, screening and treatment for diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure, to women ages 15 to 44, with income up to 200 percent of the poverty level \u2014 about $23,760 for an individual \u2014 who do not qualify for Medicaid. It used to be what is known as a Medicaid waiver program, financed 90 percent by the federal government and 10 percent by the state. About half the states have similar programs for low-income women not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, Ms. Nash said.But Texas turned its version into an entirely state-financed program in 2013, when it cut out providers that \u201cperform or promote elective abortions,\u201d or contract or affiliate with providers that do so.Other states have recently expressed a willingness to forfeit Medicaid funds if doing so allows them to block Planned Parenthood from receiving tax dollars. This year, Missouri ended its Medicaid waiver program for family planning services and instead set up a state-financed program that excludes abortion providers. Iowa is planning to do the same.In its draft waiver application, the state said it hoped that by turning Healthy Texas Women back into a Medicaid waiver program, it would improve access and participation. The application noted that Texas had the nation\u2019s highest birthrate, with more than 400,000 births in 2015, more than half of which were paid for by Medicaid. It also noted than more than one-third of pregnancies in the state were reported as unintended, and that Texas had one of the highest teen birthrates in the country.On Monday, at a public hearing on the plan in Austin, several women and representatives of health advocacy groups expressed concern about the request.\u201cA strong Healthy Texas Women program should include Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Blanca Murillo, 25, who said she relied on Planned Parenthood for contraception that helped treat her polycystic ovary syndrome when she was a student at the University of Texas. \u201cI\u2019m asking the state to choose the health of Texas women \u2014 which it has a duty to protect \u2014 over scoring political points.\u201dStacey Pogue, senior policy analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, pointed to the so-called freedom of choice provision in Medicaid and said she was concerned that \u201csubmitting the waiver as is would invite litigation.\u201dA spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., which oversees Medicaid waiver programs, declined to comment.Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said, \u201cWe\u2019re been encouraged to present new and innovative ideas to C.M.S. for discussion for possible funding. This is a new administration, and we\u2019re looking at what funding opportunities may exist for us.\u201dTexas is also seeking to cut off all Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood; a federal judge blocked the effort earlier this year, but the state is appealing the decision.Conservatives have long targeted Planned Parenthood because its network is the largest provider of abortions, although about half of its affiliates do not perform the procedure. And federal funding is almost never used to pay for it; since 1977, a law known as the Hyde Amendment has prohibited using federal money for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when a pregnant woman\u2019s health is at risk.\u201cThere have been many statements out of this administration about its hostility toward Planned Parenthood,\u201d Ms. Nash said. \u201cSo this move by Texas is really testing all of that.\u201dRaegan McDonald-Mosely, the chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said, \u201cThe Trump administration must shut down this latest attack on women, because if the rest of the nation goes the way of Texas, it would result in a public health crisis for millions of women.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about a request by Texas to reinstate its Medicaid funds referred incorrectly to a law known as the Hyde Amendment. While it prohibits using federal money for abortions, there are exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when a pregnant woman\u2019s health is at risk; it is not the case that federal funding is never used to pay for abortions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Giant Loophole", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorOne of the major goals of tax reform is to reduce the opportunities for savvy taxpayers to game the system. But if President Trump and House Republicans have their way, we will have a new contender for the tax code\u2019s largest loophole: a new special cap on the tax rate for so-called pass-through business income.Pass-throughs are businesses that do not pay taxes but instead report their taxable profits to their owners, who then pay tax on their share of the profits. (Limited-liability companies, or L.L.C.s, are a common example of a pass-through.)This sounds technical, but the implications are huge, providing a big tax advantage over \u201cC corporations,\u201d like Ford or CVS, which pay corporate income taxes and whose shareholders pay a second layer of tax when the corporation pays dividends or its shareholders realize a gain.Supporters claim that most pass-throughs are mom-and-pop operations, and it\u2019s true that many are. But pass-throughs are also enormously popular among the wealthy, including people like the president himself, who owns some 500 pass-through businesses.President Trump has proposed cutting the top rate on most income, like wages, from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. But he wants to slash the top rate on pass-through business income \u2014 and only that \u2014 by a whopping 24.6 percentage points, from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. Republicans have proposed a similar plan, though with not quite as large a cut for high-bracket pass-throughs. (These figures ignore other proposals to eliminate Medicare-related taxes on high earners that are in the Republicans\u2019 health care bill.)This new loophole would encourage people to characterize even more of their income as pass-through income. Under this plan, if a wealthy executive sets up an L.L.C. to receive his $10 million salary, he could potentially save $2 million in taxes.To make matters worse, the proposal could destabilize funding for Medicare and Social Security, effects that aren\u2019t included in these estimates. As more people claim their labor income as business income, the Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds could collect less payroll tax revenue. Together with the pressure that the proposal\u2019s cost would place on our long-term fiscal outlook, this could jeopardize benefits for future retirees.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he can prevent gaming of the special rate cap, but there\u2019s no practical way to do so for the wealthy. The most prominent anti-avoidance proposal, by former Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, is simply a backdoor formula that replaces the headline preferential rate for pass-through income with a somewhat less preferential effective rate \u2014 essentially conceding that the only way to limit gaming is not to enact a preferential rate in the first place.Rather than falsely claiming that a cap on the pass-through rate would benefit small businesses, some advocates argue that it\u2019s only fair to treat all businesses the same. If Congress succeeds in cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent as the president has proposed, shouldn\u2019t the same rate apply to pass-throughs?Achieving tax fairness is an admirable goal, and Congress should pursue it. But to get there, it should try to close loopholes, not open giant new ones.Lily Batchelder is a professor of law and public policy at the New York University School of Law and was majority chief tax counsel for the Senate Committee on Finance from 2010 to 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Imperils London\u2019s Claim as Banker to the Planet", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byLosing LondonLONDON \u2014 From a skyscraper in Canary Wharf, the once-bustling cluster of docks transformed into a global banking center, traders at Citigroup\u2019s regional headquarters move unfathomable sums of money around the planet. They are exploiting London\u2019s unrivaled connections to the intricate plumbing of the international financial system.Now the flow of money is in doubt, imperiling London\u2019s fortunes.Somewhere between one-fifth and one-third of London\u2019s financial undertakings now involve clients based in Europe. Much of this business is dependent on so-called passports that give financial firms in one European Union nation permission to operate in the others. Free of a deal preserving the essentials of passport rights, many of these trades would be effectively illegal. The rules and regulatory proclivities of 27 remaining European Union nations would have to be satisfied.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even be able to service some clients, theoretically, once the U.K. exits,\u201d says Jerome Kemp, a New Yorker who is Citi\u2019s global head of futures, clearing and collateral at its London headquarters. \u201cIf the client driving the order is sitting in the European Union, then we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201dA large piece of London\u2019s banking business depends on its inclusion in the European Union.On a recent afternoon at Citigroup\u2019s headquarters, traders sit at banks of computer screens watching prices in markets scattered from Shanghai to S\u00e3o Paulo. One trader monitors the price of crude oil, eyeing a deal for an American refinery in Brazil. Another seeks to divine how stock markets in South Africa and Indonesia will react to higher American interest rates.A Swedish trader helps a money manager in Paris place a complicated bet that German government bonds will fall.\u201cThere\u2019s about 10 questions that immediately come to mind as to whether we could execute that trade in London after Brexit,\u201d Mr. Kemp says.Clearing is a crucial part of the work Mr. Kemp\u2019s team handles in London. Trades of derivatives worth about 850 billion euros a day ($928 billion) are now cleared daily in London, or roughly three-fourths of the total for the globe.Like every bank with a regional headquarters in London, Citi cannot just wait in the hopes that politicians will strike a deal preserving its access to Europe. Banks are already configuring plans to move significant numbers of people to other financial centers within the European Union, ensuring that trading can continue without a hitch after Brexit is complete.This is a historic reversal for a city that has for centuries functioned as a central artery for finance.As the seat of a colonial realm stretching from the Americas to Asia, London financed enterprises attendant to empire. Banking operations established by pioneers like Nathan Mayer Rothschild extended credit to shipping ventures that brought back treasure from distant shores.In modern times, the deregulation of London\u2019s financial markets attracted an influx of overseas banks. As globalization eroded international borders, money washed in from every shore.The industry employs more than 1.1 million people in Britain, while generating annual revenues reaching 205 billion pounds (about $265 billion).New York is bigger by some measures, but much of its business caters to the American market. London has become the ultimate international financial marketplace.Sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East manage investments here. Russian oligarchs and Saudi princes park fortunes here. China looks to London as a promising place to handle transactions involving its currency.Brexit will not touch most of this activity. At least one-third of London\u2019s financial industry revenues involve business inside Britain. Another third is tied to the world outside Europe.But disruption to the European business carries risks. Between 15,000 and 80,000 finance jobs could depart over the next two years, according to various studies. As transactions move, regulators in the new venues are likely to demand a heavier presence of human beings \u2014 people to hold accountable should matters go awry. As bankers move, so could accountants and lawyers.\u201cEveryone is preparing for the worst,\u201d says Davide Serra, chief executive of Algebris Investments, a hedge fund he co-founded in 2006. \u201cYou will see the emergence of Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin, Luxembourg, Madrid.\u201d\u201cTo the world, London now matters more than New York,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, New York will matter more.\u201dIn the view from the headquarters of Rothschild & Company, London\u2019s past and potential future are effectively laid out on display.The building sits on land that once held the home of the founder Nathan Mayer Rothschild. Conference rooms look down on the Bank of England. Across the River Thames, a 95-story glass-fronted pyramid known as the Shard punctuates the view. It was erected by a consortium of investment funds from Qatar.Within the original City of London \u2014 the heart of the finance industry, known as the Square Mile \u2014 cranes sit atop a half-dozen new skyscrapers in various stages of completion. Who will occupy them once Britain leaves Europe?Mr. Rothschild saw the beginning. Born into a Jewish ghetto in Frankfurt, he landed in the English mill town of Manchester at the end of the 18th century, intending to buy patterns for his family\u2019s textile business.He soon sniffed out a better opportunity in the City of London, the warren of streets laid down by the Romans at the lowest crossing point of the Thames. The bounty of empire was landing on the docks \u2014 tea from India, silk from China, cotton from the American South. Trade required credit. Mr. Rothschild carved out a niche. He negotiated terms at the Royal Exchange \u2014 today, a shopping mall full of Italian luxury goods.As the Duke of Wellington confronted Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, Mr. Rothschild worked on behalf of the crown, quietly amassing gold and silver to pay the troops. Napoleon succumbed.The Rothschild bank soon helped other governments finance operations by borrowing from British merchants.By the middle of the 20th century, Warburg, another London bank, was selling bonds for the Italian highway network, raising $15 million in American currency. This was the first issue of so-called Eurobonds, those raised in foreign currency \u2014 now a mammoth business.The mid-1980s brought the run of deregulation known as the Big Bang. Financial firms gained the freedom to set their own commissions, and to speculate and advise clients. Overseas companies could now acquire British banks.In came the foreigners \u2014 especially the Americans. The rule of law prevailed. The English language sufficed. A banker waking up in London could trade in Asia in the morning, then across Europe, catch the opening of markets in New York, and still make it home for dinner at some palatial spread in a leafy neighborhood.London finance had previously operated by gentlemanly code.\u201cI used to catch the 5-to-9 tube,\u201d recalls Robert Leit\u00e3o, who spent the \u201980s at Morgan, Grenfell & Company, one of the oldest banks in the City, and who now counsels clients on mergers for Rothschild. \u201cWe were reliably in a bar by 5 o\u2019clock.\u201dYet as investment banks like J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley swept in, they began poaching clients. \u201cWe had to get up earlier,\u201d Mr. Leit\u00e3o says.He recalls his first brush with an American bank during a telecommunications merger in the early 1990s.\u201cWe\u2019d go in with our little black-and-white documents and Goldman Sachs came in with what was the first landscape-color presentation we\u2019d ever seen,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember one of my colleagues saying to me as we came out of that meeting, \u2018Oh my God, the world\u2019s changed.\u2019\u201dAs trading swelled and buildings required rewiring for high-speed internet, the global banks outgrew the City. Many established headquarters in new skyscrapers in Canary Wharf.Much of what was taking place now had little to do with financing business. Money was arriving to avoid tax collectors in other jurisdictions. Traders were wagering via exotic, lightly regulated instruments known as derivatives \u2014 creations that would play a leading role in pulling the world into the financial crisis of 2008.Paul Woolley worked in the asset management industry. He watched pension funds flood in from around the world, as local managers concentrated more on collecting fees than doing right by retirees. He saw London refashioned into a playground for hedge fund billionaires.For Mr. Kemp, Citibank\u2019s global head of futures, history is rolling backward.Back in 1987, when he landed in Paris, working as a broker at a French bank, every nation was effectively its own fief. Buying a bond in Spain meant having to go through the local trading desk.But as Mr. Kemp jumped to JPMorgan Chase and more recently to Citi, these institutions increasingly concentrated people in London.More than a trillion dollars in foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives change hands in the City every day, nearly three times the volume in New York, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\u201cIt just made perfect sense to focus everything in a U.K. entity,\u201d Mr. Kemp says. \u201cNow, we are looking at unwinding that ball of string that we\u2019ve worked so hard to put together over the last 20 years.\u201d\u201cAnything involving sales and trading in European currency or to European customers is exposed,\u201d says William Wright, founder of New Financial, a London-based research institution.Some British leaders express hope that Europe will assent to a deal that allows finance to carry on, even as Britain leaves the single market. But Europe confronts existential threats to its union. Leaders are intent on ensuring that Britain absorbs a blow to discourage other countries that might leave.Frankfurt, Dublin and other European cities are courting financiers. Mr. Macron \u2014 a former Rothschild investment banker \u2014 is keen to win finance jobs for Paris.All of this enhances the prospect of no deal, and the beginning of a new era for London.Two decades ago, Mr. Serra, the hedge fund manager, arrived here from his native Italy, landing as a researcher at UBS, the Swiss financial services giant.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get a decent espresso,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember the first Lavazza machine I wanted to put in my bank, and the compliance and I.T. came. They felt, because it was a non-U.K. machine, it had a risk of burning the place down.\u201dTwo decades later, Mr. Serra\u2019s fund manages about $7 billion worth of holdings. His office in the upscale neighborhood of Mayfair boasts a top-of-the-line espresso machine.For his company, Brexit is just a minor nuisance, he says. He must merely open a small subsidiary somewhere in Europe.But one thing could prompt him to abandon London \u2014 limits on who can live here. His team hails from Hungary, Bulgaria, India, China, Spain, the United States, Ireland, Australia and Britain.\u201cIf their immigration policy will curb my capacity to hire the best talent,\u201d he says, \u201cthen I\u2019ll move.\u201dAdmiralty House in central London is a solid brick piece of Britain\u2019s imperial legacy, a four-story building fronted by columns near the Royal Horse Guards. \u201cFrom here,\u201d reads a plaque at the entrance, \u201cthe worldwide affairs of the Royal Navy were run for centuries.\u201dToday, the building is a central element in a transaction connecting British finance to investors scattered from the Middle East to Southeast Asia, a deal structured to comply with Shariah, or Islamic law.As London reimagines its place in a post-Brexit world, city leaders are probing terrain far beyond Europe for potential financial business. They are seeking to make London a hub for settling purchases of Chinese wares. They are exploring new varieties of bonds involving foreign currencies. They are redoubling efforts to tap into the growing world of Shariah-compliant finance.The Islamic world is awash in money, yet the dictates of Shariah forbid trading in interest. This has prompted creative minds to consult with Muslim clerics to dream up financial instruments that effectively pay interest without technically doing so.London has been angling for a piece of the action. Three years ago, the British government issued a Shariah-compliant version of a government bond, using a structure called a sukuk.Admiralty House and two other buildings were officially sold to a government entity. The government then rented the buildings back from itself, distributing the proceeds to investors who bought the sukuk.Britain was the first Western government to issue Shariah-compliant bonds, raising \u00a3200 million (then, about $340 million).\u201cThe U.K. government\u2019s primary objective was effectively a demonstration of the City of London and the U.K. legal and regulatory and tax system being open for business,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Callaghan, a partner at the law firm Linklaters, who advised the British government on the bond issue. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a global financial center without being able to demonstrate that you have a viable Islamic framework.\u201dExpanding the city\u2019s fortunes by going global makes sense. Yet arithmetic suggests these new frontiers cannot compensate for the revenues Brexit may displace.In the decade since the London Stock Exchange began listing sukuk bonds, about $48 billion has been raised through 65 different issues. London clears derivatives worth that much in the course of a morning.\u201cIslamic finance is starting from a very low base,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Callaghan says. \u201cIt is a base that is growing, but it is never going to take over the world.\u201dBrexit does not negate London\u2019s financial savvy. It does not taint British law, or undermine London\u2019s appeal as a cosmopolitan entrep\u00f4t.But it redraws the lines of global trade, impeding the flow of money that built the city.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 Monaco", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate17 PhotosA ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT ON THE WATERFRONT IN MONACO $8.1 MILLION (7.4 million euros)This renovated one-bedroom apartment is on the fourth floor of Le Grand Large, a complex on a Mediterranean bay, about a five-minute drive from the center of Monaco. The area, called Fontvieille, was developed on reclaimed land in the 1970s and \u201980s, and includes a 275-slip marina.This apartment is 1,152 square feet (107 square meters), including two wide, covered balconies. The unit is a \u201cgood size\u201d for Monaco, where apartments are \u201chistorically small,\u201d Ms. de Champfleury said.It is entered via a private elevator from the basement parking garage and is three rooms: a living room, kitchen and master bedroom with en-suite bathroom. A wraparound balcony is accessible from the bedroom; the other balcony is off the living room, offering views of the bay and Monaco\u2019s famed cliffs, known as the Rock, which is home to the royal palace.The master bedroom also has built-in cabinetry, and the bathroom has marble walls and counters, as well as a remote-controlled towel-heating rack.There is under-floor heating throughout the apartment, and an integrated technology system allows the entertainment, air-conditioning and lighting to be controlled remotely. The furniture is included in the asking price, as is a parking space in the garage. There is round-the-clock security and a concierge, Ms. de Champfleury said, and the building has an outdoor pool.The average price paid for a resale home in Monaco last year was $4.7 million (\u20ac4.3 million), a 180 percent increase from a decade earlier, according to the report, while in Fontvieille, one of the most popular areas with home buyers, the average resale price was $6.4 million (\u20ac5.8 million).One reason for the high prices is the lack of new construction in recent years, said Irene Luke, a partner in Savills\u2019s Monaco office. Of the 553 homes sold in Monaco last year, only 33 (6 percent) were new buildings, according to the company\u2019s data. \u201cThere is certainly a shortage of new properties for sale,\u201d Ms. Luke said, and those that are new and large \u201care especially in demand.\u201dRecently, however, the market has begun to slow, with the number of sales declining after a record year in 2016, agents said.Most of the homes available are apartments. \u201cThere are some independent villas, but not many,\u201d Mr. de Mallet Morgan said. \u201cAnd they tend to sell quickly if they are in good order.\u201dMonaco\u2019s famously low taxes continue to attract home buyers, agents said, but the demographics are changing. Buyers tend to be younger and more interested in making Monaco their primary residence. \u201cThey have residences all over the world as well,\u201d Ms. Luke said, but \u201cMonaco is not a secondary residence or holiday destination.\u201dForeign buyers still come from all over the world, including Russia, former Soviet Republics, the Middle East and South Africa, Mr. de Mallet Morgan said, as many of them see Monaco as a more stable environment than their home countries. \u201cWherever there is political or fiscal instability, we see people coming to Monaco because of its safe-haven status,\u201d he said. \u201cSecurity and stability are precious commodities in today\u2019s world.\u201dThe buying process is straightforward and follows most international guidelines, agents said.A notary handles the details of the transaction and performs a search of the land registry for title records. The initial contract is signed with a 10 percent deposit held in escrow by the notary, Mr. de Mallet Morgan said, and financing is readily available for qualifying buyers.Although the process is usually issue-free, he added, \u201cwe always advise buyers to consult with a lawyer before making an offer, so they are fully informed of all elements of the transaction.\u201dThe process usually takes two to three months, but it can be much faster, Ms. Luke said: \u201cWe have done deals in a couple of days.\u201dFrench; euro (1 euro = $1.09)There are no capital gains, property or income taxes in Monaco. Property registration, title registration and notary fees are typically about 6 percent of the purchase price, agents said, and the buyer pays a commission of about 3 percent, plus a value-added tax that could be 20 percent of that.This apartment has a $931 (\u20ac850) monthly building maintenance fee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jersey City Mayor Balks at Tax Break for Kushners", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe Democratic mayor of New Jersey\u2019s second-largest city, who has had his ups-and-downs with the state\u2019s volatile governor, Chris Christie, is now threatening to stymie luxury development dreams of the family of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The project \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family,\u201d Ms. Meyer said in Beijing to an audience of people interested in securing permanent residence in the United States in exchange for investments of $500,000 or more.The roadshow in China added fuel to fears that the Trump family has not sufficiently severed ties to its varied business interests, leaving open many avenues to conflicts of interest.In Jersey City, the Kushner family\u2019s involvement in the project has stirred up opposition among liberal and progressive residents of Jersey City who are critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, especially his stance on immigration. One activist group has campaigned to \u201cevict Trump-Kushner,\u201d demanding that the city refuse any tax breaks to companies that Jared Kushner has a stake in.In his brief posting, which linked to a story in The New York Times about the investor roadshow in China, Mr. Fulop indicated that he had found fault with the terms of the requested tax abatements.Some critics of the mayor charged this week that the opposition to the tax break was aimed at appeasing liberals who disapprove of Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent political,\u201d said Bill Matsikoudis, a former Jersey City corporation counsel who is running against Mr. Fulop. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to throw a bone to the progressive, very anti-Trump people in Jersey City.\u201dMr. Matsikoudis, a Democrat, said he could not recall a request for a large tax abatement being turned down in Jersey City, whose leaders have used tax breaks to lure developers to its growing financial district on the west bank of the Hudson River. But he added that the package of tax breaks the Kushner group was seeking appeared to be quite rich even by the standards of the Fulop administration.The tax breaks would require an ordinance passed by the City Council, which has not yet taken up the matter. But in his posting, Mr. Fulop said, \u201cI don\u2019t foresee the council voting in favor.\u201dThat pronouncement drew cheers from \u201cEvict Trump/Kushner,\u201d which released a statement saying, \u201cwe know that our resistance is just beginning.\u201d Alluding to the promotional events in China, the group said, \u201cThis attempt to use the office of the presidency for personal profit is grossly unethical. Such behavior is a direct consequence of Jared Kushner\u2019s failure to fully and transparently divest from his businesses.\u201dA spokesman for the Kushner Companies, James Yolles, said the project would be a boon to Jersey City. \u201cOur current proposal for One Journal Square would provide 4,000 sorely needed union jobs and $180 million in tax revenue for Jersey City over the next 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier this year, we looked at the market and decided on a more conventional project, which we think strengthened our proposal. We are committed to moving ahead with this meaningful investment in the long-term future of Journal Square.\u201dJared Kushner has divested his interests in the One Journal Square project, selling them to a family trust whose primary beneficiaries are his siblings and whose trustee is their mother. He remains the beneficiary of a series of trusts that hold stakes in the majority of the Kushner Companies business.About 18 months ago, One Journal Square received $93 million in tax breaks from the state of New Jersey through its Economic Development Authority. The main partner of the Kushner Companies in the project is KABR Group, a private equity real estate firm.A different Kushner Companies project that opened late last year in Jersey City relied on $50 million raised from foreign investors seeking entry to the United States on EB-5 visas. That visa program awards foreigners the right to live in the United States for two years, and a good shot at permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects.That building, a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment, got its EB-5 funding entirely from Chinese applicants. Applicants from China account for about 75 percent of the EB-5 visas.The Kushners seek $150 million in EB-5 financing for One Journal Square. The copy of the abatement application for the project estimated that the project would cost more than $820 million.Jesse Drucker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "British Columbia\u2019s Business Temptation: An Opaque Array of Tax Breaks", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 British Columbia is well known for its spectacular landscape and outdoorsy living, its swanky urban real estate and bouillabaisse of cultures.A fact not so well known? It has a sweet deal for businesses, offering them tax breaks in an unusually opaque arrangement.Like many places, British Columbia set up a system of tax incentives to lure businesses to the far western Canadian province in the hopes of creating jobs and transforming Vancouver into a global financial center.But if the program has been good for business, it\u2019s been less beneficial for British Columbia.Participating companies have created few jobs, according to government figures, while more than 140 million Canadian dollars ($106 million) have been doled out in tax refunds since 2008, when the initiative was expanded.The incentives operate under a cloak of secrecy that is unusual for similar efforts in Canada and the United States, critics say. The province will not name the companies that get the breaks. The only information available about them is on the website of a nonprofit that promotes the program.\u201cThis is essentially a temporary foreign-worker program for the rich, with secret government subsidies for multinational corporations,\u201d said Dermod Travis, the executive director of IntegrityBC, a nonpartisan political watchdog group based in Victoria, the provincial capital. \u201cThe government is selling B.C. as a tax haven for the global elite to park investment here, but not have to contribute.\u201dThe provincial Ministry of Finance, which runs the effort, says it is a success, with 82 companies participating. Jamie Edwardson, a spokesman for the ministry, declined in an email to identify those companies or discuss the amount of refunds each has received, citing a ban on publicly disclosing taxpayer information in the law that created the incentives. He said the law protects taxpayer privacy.Experts say that with few public details, it is hard to tell whether the plan is worth the lost tax revenue. They also say the lack of disclosure prevents the public from knowing if companies are using the province as a pit stop on a global quest to avoid taxation. \u201cThere\u2019s a real concern corporations are just stripping money out of places,\u201d said Michael Knoll, a law professor and a director at the University of Pennsylvania Law School Center for Tax Law and Policy. \u201cThis lack of transparency is aiding that process.\u201dThe International Business Activity Act, initially passed in 1988, allows companies to claim a refund of up to 100 percent of their provincial corporate income taxes on a number of business activities, including lending, foreign exchange trading and investment management, which could bring a company\u2019s tax rate down to 15 percent.Over the years, the plan was expanded several times. In 2010, an expansion allowed high-paid nonresidents of Canada who work in British Columbia for participating companies to receive new generous tax breaks unavailable to Canadian residents.The tax breaks favor foreigners in other ways, too. Companies can receive refunds on real estate activities with foreigners, including mortgage loans on property in Canada for international buyers. Conducting the same domestic activities for Canadians would not qualify for the refunds. This has raised concerns that the tax refunds may encourage banks and other companies to prioritize foreigners over Canadians in Canada\u2019s overheated housing markets.\u201cThere is no reason for this organization to be outside of government,\u201d said Duff Conacher, a founder of Democracy Watch, a Canadian civic organization, \u201cexcept to escape the ethics, transparency and accountability requirements government institutions have to face.\u201dIn a recent interview, though, he said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. \u201cThe program was not actually set up to be a job creator,\u201d he said.It is unclear which businesses listed on AdvantageBC\u2019s website are in the program and receiving tax breaks. But a company must be a core member to get the refunds.In 2014, the province expanded the program for foreign banks, which it said would raise the potential for investment from Asia, especially China. \u201cThese amendments to the International Business Activity Act send a strong message to foreign companies that B.C. welcomes their business, setting the stage for increased investment,\u201d said Michael de Jong, the finance minister, according to a government news release.Mr. de Jong declined to answer questions about the program, including whether the public should be able to know which companies are receiving the tax breaks.Scott Neufeld contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spared by Sandy, but Still Agonizing Over What Comes Next", "Date": "2017-05-31", "News": "Supported byResilient DesignThough they live just a half-mile from the Paerdegat Basin in Brooklyn, George and Laura Fishman were spared the kind of damage that upended their neighbors\u2019 lives during Hurricane Sandy. (There were not, for instance, fish in their basement.)But that posed a problem of its own.How, the Fishmans asked themselves, can we prepare for the next one? Should we buy flood insurance? Should we elevate our boiler and water heater? Should we get out altogether?That effort reaches all the way to a two-story semidetached brick-and-frame house on Avenue M in the Canarsie neighborhood that the Fishmans have owned for 42 years. Canarsie sits on the vast Jamaica Bay. Numerous creeks and basins, like the Paerdegat, penetrate upland from the bay, putting surrounding areas at risk of flooding.\u201cWe settled here because it was very convenient to our jobs, it was close to where our parents lived, it was less congested and it was close to the water,\u201d Dr. Fishman said. \u201cAnd George is a kayaker.\u201dOn existing flood maps, the Fishmans\u2019 property is not in a high-risk zone. They did not have to obtain expensive flood insurance to qualify for a mortgage, which they have since paid off.During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, their house emerged unscathed while basements in surrounding houses were flooded by the Paerdegat Basin. Cars and trees around them were lost to saltwater. Power was out for 48 hours. And the sewer backed up. But the pitch of the Fishmans\u2019 street ensured that the floodwaters only lapped up near their yard.\u201cPeople have to understand the technical specifics of their property in relation to the flood plain,\u201d Ms. Peale said. \u201cAre you above it? Do you have livable spaces below it? Where is the lowest part of your property that intersects with the flood plain? We really don\u2019t want folks to put their heads in the sand and pretend this isn\u2019t an issue.\u201dThe program is \u201cnow serving hundreds of homeowners like the Fishmans,\u201d she added.The altimeter has a hand-held measurement module tethered by a 100-foot cord to a small base unit. Mr. Davidson entered a reference elevation on the module (in this case, mean sea level) and then took readings by moving the module from one spot to the next.For example, when Mr. Davidson placed the module on the basement floor, the display read \u201c06.03 FT,\u201d meaning that it was 6.03 feet above mean sea level.On the interim map, however, the Fishmans\u2019 house is not within the high-risk 100-year flood plain. But the city expects to complete new insurance maps in three to five years, working with FEMA. Conceivably, the boundaries of the 100-year flood plain could be redrawn to include the Fishmans\u2019 house. If so, it would formally be regarded as high risk.The preceding paragraphs only hint at the nearly impenetrable complexity of flood risk assessment. It\u2019s easy to see why homeowners need all the technical help they can get.On May 1, the Fishmans sat down with Elizabeth Malone and Nadine Carpenter of Neighborhood Housing Services, who helped them interpret the elevation certificate.\u201cIt was recommended that we seal the basement floor,\u201d Dr. Fishman said. \u201cWe are seriously considering this. But we are not going to raise our \u2018mechanicals\u2019 by moving them to the first floor. The engineer\u2019s report indicated that this would cost between $10,000 and $15,000.\u201d\u201cBecause of our location and the fact that we do not have a mortgage, we are not required to purchase flood insurance,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cBut it might be a good idea since now we qualify for a \u2018preferred rate\u2019 policy. The premiums are relatively low, and if we sell our home, this lower base rate will be transferred to the new owner.\u201dSell their home? Where would they rather be than in Canarsie?\u201cWe wanted to live near the water because it\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Dr. Fishman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Budget Proposes Deep Cuts in Energy Innovation Programs", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s budget proposal for 2018 envisions a flurry of changes to domestic energy policy, reaping billions of dollars in one-time revenue from oil and gas resources while cutting research into future energy technologies that could pay long-term dividends.Critics say these cuts could imperil American leadership in cutting-edge clean energy industries.\u201cIt is incredibly shortsighted to slash funding for energy R&D and let other countries take the lead in developing new technologies and markets that are going to grow quickly in the years to come,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.Mr. Trump also proposes repealing part of a 2006 law that diverted about 37 percent of the revenues from oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama from the federal government.The White House estimates that repealing the law and redirecting the state oil revenue back to Washington could yield $3.5 billion over 10 years. Those states, and the oil lobby, are expected to push back fiercely.2016 is the hottest year on the historical record and the third consecutive record-breaking year, scientists say.The administration estimates that selling the oil will generate a profit of $16.5 billion over 10 years. While the Energy Department has the authority to sell some oil in the reserve, such a major reduction would almost certainly need action from Congress, and the prospects of success for such a move are unclear.\u201cThere are credible arguments that the optimal size of the S.P.R. should be smaller than it is,\u201d Mr. Bordoff said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re selling off a big chunk of a national security asset that we\u2019ve held for 40 years, that should be rooted in a detailed analysis of the country\u2019s energy needs, not short-term budget considerations.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s budget also proposes a drastic restructuring of the way electricity is bought and sold in Western states, which rely heavily on cheap hydroelectric power generated by government structures like the Hoover Dam in Nevada. Mr. Trump proposes selling off thousands of miles of government-owned transmission lines that move this electricity to homes across nearly 20 Western states, from Arizona to Wyoming, creating estimated revenue of about $10 billion over a decade.Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, said the plan had no chance.\u201cSelling government-owned transmission lines to the highest bidder will just have the effect of jacking up power rates, and no one in that region is going to be in favor of this,\u201d she said.The proposal would also restart the Nuclear Waste Fund fee program, which charges electricity users money to be funneled toward construction of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump in Nevada, with estimated revenues of about $3 billion over 10 years. But that money would be specifically earmarked for construction of the nuclear waste repository, which has been mired in delays and disputes for decades.An earlier version of this article misstated the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

{"Headline": "Patrick Buchanan Reveals Himself to Be the First Trumpist", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Patrick J. Buchanan is a merry troglodyte, a naughty provocateur. He still calls homosexuality \u201csodomy,\u201d just to get the goat of a community he will only reluctantly call \u201cgay.\u201d He writes that he wanted to be named ambassador to South Africa by President Ford so he could support the apartheid government. He thinks public television is \u201can upholstered playpen\u201d for liberals. He considers \u201cThe New York Times\u201d an epithet. His stump appearances in his outlaw 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns were a guilty pleasure for the reporters who followed him, a hilariously clever, and prescient, exhibition of right-wing populism. \u201cBuchanan,\u201d Richard Nixon once told him, \u201cyou\u2019re the only extremist I know with a sense of humor.\u201dAnd it is Buchanan, not Nixon, who emerges as the central \u2014 and most intriguing \u2014 character in \u201cNixon\u2019s White House Wars,\u201d an entertaining memoir of that benighted presidency. Buchanan\u2019s Nixon is a familiar figure: distant, awkward, smart, defensive and damaged, caring a bit too much what the Establishment \u2014 a word Buchanan uses frequently \u2014 thinks of him. The not-so-tricky president is a policy moderate; he has surrounded himself with brilliant, if mainstream, experts like Henry Kissinger and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. There is also a retinue of traditional moderate Republican aides like Ray Price and Leonard Garment, and technocrats like H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Buchanan, the house wing nut, finds all this moderation frustrating; he began as a peripheral figure in the Nixon White House, a political gunslinger perhaps a bit too hot for the high-rent nuances of governance. Over time, however, Nixon realized that the \u201cliberal establishment\u201d was unwilling to cut him a break \u2014 even as he created the Environmental Protection Agency and maintained many Great Society programs \u2014 and a gunslinger could have his uses. Buchanan\u2019s pen provided the ammunition for Vice President Spiro Agnew\u2019s attacks on the media (which seem downright civilized compared with current presidential standards). But Nixon sensed that Buchanan was onto something much bigger than vitriol, a new grand strategy for the Republican Party, a new majority anchored by the white working class, not just in the South, but also in the Northern ethnic, mostly Catholic, enclaves. This philosophy has been the driving vision of Buchanan\u2019s life. It has made him one of the most consequential conservatives of the past half-century. Indeed, he\u2019s a reactionary who was also an avatar: the first Trumpist.Buchanan was born in Washington, D.C., in 1938, although his family\u2019s roots are in Mississippi. He celebrates ancestors who fought for the Confederacy, but his most enduring loyalty is to the conservative Catholic Church of the 1950s \u2014 the church schools he attended, the Knights of Columbus, the Legion of Decency, Sodality and the Holy Name Society. His people are the white ethnic \u201cunfashionable minorities,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cmedia minorities.\u201d He was kicked out of Georgetown University for a year after a drunken fight with the Washington police: \u201cI was ahead on points, until they brought out the sticks.\u201d But he attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism \u2014 one of his few Eastern elitist credentials, which he used to become an editorial polemicist for the conservative St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He was astonished by the 1960s. Well-off draft dodgers offended him; the New York construction workers who beat up the protesters were his team. Teddy Kennedy\u2019s ability to \u201csurvive\u201d Chappaquiddick was a confirmation of Buchanan\u2019s worldview. Nixon, he believed (correctly), would have been crucified if he\u2019d done something similar. He and Nixon \u201cwere like working-class kids in an elite university who, caught smoking pot in the dorm, would be expelled and disgraced for life, while the legacy students would be confined to campus for the weekend.\u201dIt was the \u201clegacy\u201d students in the C.I.A. and on John F. Kennedy\u2019s staff who had started the war in Vietnam \u2014 and \u201clegacy\u201d students who opposed it; the children of Irish pipe fitters had to fight it. Despite the war\u2019s provenance, Buchanan was an unabashed hawk who believed Vietnam was necessary to stem the tide of Communism. He continued to believe this even as Nixon proved that Communism wasn\u2019t monolithic by embracing the Russians in d\u00e9tente and going to China \u2014 Buchanan was along for the Beijing trip, appalled. Still, Buchanan\u2019s assessment of the impact of the defeat in Vietnam on American society has real power to it: \u201cThe American establishment that led us to victory in World War II \u2026 would never recover from Vietnam, never regain the confidence of the nation. For Vietnam was not an unwinnable war for a country that had reduced the Japanese empire to smoldering ruins in four years. \u2026 The simple truth is the American establishment lost the war in Vietnam because it lacked the will to win it.\u201dThis is where Buchanan\u2019s philosophy begins. The country that Nixon inherited in 1969 was \u201cno longer one nation and one people, but a land divided by war and race and culture and politics.\u201d The Establishment was feckless, guilt-driven, hypocritical. Buchanan saw school busing to achieve racial integration as a domestic Vietnam. It was social engineering imposed by a liberal judiciary upon white ethnic communities \u2014 the Irish, Italians, Poles \u2014 who had nothing to do with slavery. Once again, the rich kids weren\u2019t drafted to ride the buses. Buchanan advised Nixon that the administration\u2019s position should be: \u201coutlawing all segregation, but not requiring racial balance.\u201d This line extends to affirmative action, which he calls \u201cracial injustice.\u201d These are the opening battles of Buchanan\u2019s culture war. His case is primal and compelling. These issues are not merely about tribal racial prejudices; they are about class.Buchanan\u2019s political calculus is that the \u201csilent majority\u201d is larger than the \u201cfashionable minorities,\u201d who include violent antiwar protesters \u2014 nearly five bombings a day in 1971-72! \u2014 racial agitators, limousine and lifestyle liberals. In fact, the only real weapon that the counterculturalists have is the elite media, which he described, in a memo to Nixon, as their true adversary: \u201cThe Nixon White House and the national liberal media are as cobra and mongoose.\u201d Does any of this sound familiar?Nixon won the 1972 election in a historic landslide, using Buchanan\u2019s strategy, but lost the war. Buchanan was boggled by Watergate, which he considered stupid. Why bug the Democrats when Nixon\u2019s new majority is about to win bigly? Somehow he managed to skate through the scandal, compartmentalized, kept out of the loop, but asked for cleanup advice \u2014 and famously told Nixon to \u201cburn the tapes.\u201dIt is easy to be horrified by Buchanan\u2019s gleeful excesses, but that is the reaction he\u2019s hoping to elicit. Humorless upper-crust liberalism is the fattest of targets. Beneath the vitriol, though, Buchanan has spent his career raising important questions that our society has never seemed willing to discuss forthrightly. What should be the limits of identity politics? In a democracy, should courts or legislatures decide basic policies like abortion, busing and campaign finance? Should we trade the higher prices that will come from protectionism for the increased stability that might come from keeping more blue-collar jobs at home? These are the issues that Buchanan has been thumping for the past 50 years, and that Donald Trump exploited in 2016. They cannot be dismissed.

{"Headline": "A Tiny Park Fights for Sunlight Among New York City Skyscrapers", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byNew Yorkers have to elbow their way onto packed subways below ground. They have to eke out room on teeming sidewalks and streets just to get anywhere.And in a city where no space can be taken for granted, increasingly they have to fight for the very light and air above their heads.A city plan to rezone the heart of Manhattan has touched off a new campaign to protect the afternoon light falling on a beloved park that offers honey locust trees, azaleas, pansies and a 25-foot-high waterfall. It is a lush oasis in a neighborhood starved for green space.The foundation that runs the park, on East 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues, says the rezoning would allow taller buildings that could block its afternoon sun, endangering the plant life and making the spot colder, darker and far less inviting. This patch of greenery \u2014 known as Greenacre Park, a 1971 gift from a granddaughter of the industrialist John D. Rockefeller Sr. \u2014 is at the center of a brewing battle between light and darkness as the city grows ever more vertical.\u201cYou have to have light \u2014 it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer,\u201d said Gail O. Caulkins, the president of the Greenacre Foundation and the granddaughter of the philanthropist Abby Rockefeller Mauze.Adrian Benepe, a former New York City parks commissioner, said urban parks were among the last remaining \u201ccommon grounds\u201d for access to sunlight.\u201cAs cities grow more vertical, you\u2019re wiping out the sunlight on many streets,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd parks are the only place to consistently find sunlight.\u201dThe city does assess the impact of shadows from new construction, but only when a zoning change is required, prompting many to call for a more comprehensive policy that reviews the effects of all tall buildings.After Michael Kwartler, an architect and shadows consultant who wrote a 1991 proposal on preserving sunlight in parks, found that the huge towers rising in Hudson Yards would block much of the sunlight on a boulevard and park planned as part of the development, changes were made, but not enough to prevent extensive shadows.\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that really needs to be solved, and not on a case-by-case basis,\u201d he said.Greenacre Park, a space so small (6,360 square feet) that it is called a \u201cvest pocket park,\u201d was pieced together from three lots once occupied by a store, a garage and part of a synagogue. Today, it feels like the terrace of a grand country estate, with Knoll chairs and tables beside vibrant flower beds, a trellis with heat lamps for the chill, and cascading water drowning out the urban din. It has an average of 700 visitors daily.City planners said they did not expect the size and shape of the buildings used in the foundation\u2019s study to be built under the rezoning plan, though they also said that the city did not impose height limits in Midtown and that a review just for those sites would duplicate their work.This is not the first time that Greenacre Park has faced the loss of sunlight. In 1980, there was another campaign against a planned building that would have blocked the light.\u201cIn a large park, if there\u2019s a shadow cast by a tall, skinny building, people can just move to another part of the park,\u201d said Lois Cremmins, the foundation\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut in a vest pocket park of this size, the light is obliterated.\u201dFor regulars like Neil Storer, 54, a marketing consultant, the park would not be the same.\u201cOases don\u2019t exist without sunlight,\u201d he said. \u201cTrees and plants will wither.So will humans. We need sunlight for the vitamin D and the feel-good factor.\u201dKate Wichmann, 32, an interior designer, said she would not have bothered to stop if the park were in shadow.\u201cI\u2019d keep walking,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a dark apartment. I have a dark office. That\u2019s the last thing I\u2019d do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It says that they have accumulated an impressive pile of cash for a down payment (typically 20 percent, sometimes more) and that they have sufficient liquidity (and charm) to pass the scrutiny of a co-op or condo board. But plenty of people are like Mr. Brown, who have the wherewithal but not the will.Ms. Braddock said: \u201cHere, there\u2019s no stigma attached to renting, which is not true elsewhere in the country.\u201d\u201cWe had a broker tell us, \u2018My clients have $9 million to spend on a co-op or condo, and they\u2019re getting frustrated because they can\u2019t find the home of their dreams,\u201d Mr. Cho said. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re making compromises and feel embittered about it.\u2019 And then the client says: \u2018Why don\u2019t I keep my liquidity working for me? Why don\u2019t I buy a country place somewhere and why don\u2019t I just rent the best?\u2019\u201dHe also talked about a few couples who bought prewar apartments on Fifth and Park Avenues and who, during the subsequent renovations, rented at the Easton, where, depending on the size of the unit, they paid from about $5,000 to $22,000 a month. \u201cThey love it so much that now they want to sell the co-op they bought and just stay at the Easton,\u201d he said.While Ms. Bradshaw doesn\u2019t want to keep shelling out money and not building up equity, (she said she is paying between $2,500 and $3,000 a month) and while she wants to own because it would be a declaration that she has entered a certifiably grown-up phase of life, she said: \u201cI\u2019m 33 and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to come in the next year or two. Also, I don\u2019t necessarily see myself as a lifetime city girl. Maybe I\u2019ll buy in the suburbs.\u201dStephen Ceurvorst wouldn\u2019t necessarily question the mental competence of those who choose to buy an apartment in New York City. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not for him.The building was built more than a century ago and has a nice feel as well as a very well-equipped gym, a billiards room, a theater and an attentive landlord. There is also plenty of space between his bedroom window and the window in the neighboring high-rise, \u201cso I don\u2019t have to put my shades down when I get out of bed,\u201d he said. For this, he said he pays $5,000 to $10,000 a month, \u201cand I could afford to pay double that.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t much difference in lifestyle between owning and renting in Manhattan, except that if you pay rent you can spend more on the arts and sports and still have money left over,\u201d he continued. \u201cI prefer to rent and go to dinner anywhere I want. Why spend the extra money to buy, when in New York you sleep in your apartment but you live in the city?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada Today: A Fire\u2019s Lingering Effects, Novelty Socks and a Secretive Tax Program", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byEach week, Canada Today mixes The Times\u2019s recent Canada-related coverage with back stories and analysis from our reporters, along with opinions from our readers.So when I returned to Fort McMurray this week, it proved to be an emotional, and often delicate, assignment. Whether or not I asked, nearly everyone I interviewed insisted on retelling the stories of their escapes. And at some point, almost everyone choked up.The last time I saw the city\u2019s mayor, Melissa Blake, was in Edmonton while the flames and smoke were still menacing Fort McMurray. She had just been evacuated by air and taken straight to a news conference. After the meeting with reporters, which was at Alberta\u2019s emergency management headquarters in a distant industrial park, Ms. Blake was stranded, so I gave her a lift across town to a relative\u2019s home.While the rebuilding that Ms. Blake predicted is gradually happening, she had another concern this week: Fort McMurray\u2019s emotional recovery. In the year since the fire, she told me that 29,000 people in the city had sought help with mental health issues. The figure for the preceding year was just 1,000.It would be wrong, however, to suggest that Fort McMurray is in the midst of a collective breakdown. Person after person told me that the past year has brought them closer to neighbors. And the city\u2019s rebuilding seems to have given new vigor to a longstanding campaign by many residents for laws requiring that oil sands workers move to Fort McMurray, rather than fly to their high-paying jobs there from other parts of Canada.When a journalist hits a wall of government secrecy, he starts wondering what is hiding on the other side. That\u2019s what happened back in February when I emailed British Columbia\u2019s ministry of finance, asking about an obscure provincial tax incentive program and its mysterious members, which have received over U.S. $100 million in tax refunds since 2008.Almost no information is publicly available about the province\u2019s International Business Activity program, which provides tax incentives to attract corporations to the province. Who are they? What has the province received in return? The ministry refused to say.So began a monthslong hunt for answers that involved scouring government records and exploring a private organization, which the program\u2019s participants are legally required to join, run by a former finance minister from the province. Among the group\u2019s members were a slew of Canadian property developers, Chinese state-owned corporations, an investment firm that solely manages the family fortune of a Wall Street billionaire and a trio of companies the U.S. government sanctioned last year for money laundering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Did the Great Hollywood Baseball Movie Go?", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byOn SportsThis spring, trying to bring some routine to my life as a new father, I made a pledge to watch a lot more baseball. It started out well enough: The Mets, my adopted team, ran out to a reasonably strong start before the injuries and losses started piling up in late April. But my attention also wandered, much more so than it does when I watch basketball or football. My pseudoscientific interest in the sport has long since passed \u2014 there was a time when I would dive into any statistical study with the same delight as a biology student first dissecting a frog and seeing how all the organs connect beneath the surface. Now that baseball has become more of a therapeutic diversion, I find myself wishing I knew how to put the frog back together.This fitful watching is caused, at least in part, by the informational clutter that accompanies every baseball telecast. Of all the major sports, baseball benefits the least from high-definition technology: The greens are nuclear, and the extreme close-ups really aren\u2019t good for much beyond showing you the path taken by a sweat bead as it runs down a pitcher\u2019s face. Even supposedly helpful viewing aids, like the box that demarcates the strike zone or the cometlike streaks that show you the path of a pitch, take baseball out of its familiar, comforting settings \u2014 the laconic pacing, the simplicity of one player throwing a ball that another player tries to hit with a stick \u2014 and places it within intensely focused frames that promise, but rarely provide, some new insight into the game. No room is left for the imagination.The silent spaces in baseball used to be filled in by novelists and filmmakers. They supplied quick-witted, slang-driven repartee that felt both revelatory and reassuring for dugout conversations and meetings on the mound. The makers of films like 1989\u2019s \u201cMajor League\u201d and 1988\u2019s \u201cEight Men Out\u201d gave us the thoughts of the batters as they dug into the box, the catcher\u2019s mantras and occasional trash talk, the umpire\u2019s endless exasperation. And while all that may have been fantasy, it convinced you that what you couldn\u2019t hear or see while watching a baseball game could be translated directly into cornfed American English.Some mix of skyrocketing salaries, the steroid-era hangover and camera technology has rubbed away that implicit charm. Relatable baseball heroes are in retreat \u2014 and Hollywood seems to have lost interest in creating them. Over the past decade, there have been only four major studio baseball releases. Compare that with the late \u201980s and early \u201990s, when a handful of baseball movies came out nearly every year, including classics like \u201cBull Durham,\u201d \u201cMajor League,\u201d \u201cField of Dreams\u201d and \u201cA League of Their Own.\u201dPhil Alden Robinson, the director of 1989\u2019s \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d attributes the decline in the number of baseball movies to Hollywood\u2019s need to court foreign audiences and financing \u2014 despite increasing numbers of international players in the majors. He also acknowledges a cultural shift. Two decades ago, baseball and its sepia-toned past could stand in for any number of sentimental ideas about the country. No longer. Robinson says football might better fit the American psyche, \u201ca reflection of more violent times.\u201d He believes he could probably scrape together the money to make \u201cField of Dreams\u201d today, but, he told me, \u201cit would have been a lot less money.\u201dThere\u2019s also a subtle aesthetic difficulty when it comes to baseball movies: Even as modern broadcasts capture more detail, what you see on the screen no longer resembles the nostalgic, pastoral vision of the game. The imaginations of writers and filmmakers have been displaced by mere information.Baseball, more than any other American sport, has an extensive visual archive, and the change in imagery \u2014 the sharpening of focus, the addition of color \u2014 always created a sense of progress across eras. Babe Ruth winks in grainy, flickering black and white. In the 1951 home run known as \u201cthe shot heard round the world,\u201d you can see Bobby Thomson\u2019s swing, but the camera that tracks the ball out of the park is so jumpy, unsteady and late to the trajectory that it looks as if it were shot on an iPhone by someone six beers in. Bob Gibson and Sandy Koufax come through in blurry, bright color, but you can rarely see their faces as they wind up and throw. By the 1975 World Series, when Boston\u2019s Carlton Fisk seems to will the ball to stay fair with his flapping arms until it\u2019s a home run, you can see the \u201c27\u201d on Fisk\u2019s back and the square outline of his jaw, but the field still looks as if it were lit by mosquito zappers. Baseball nostalgia is tied to the way the game looked at any given moment in the past; the progress of the game is told, more than anything else, by the changes in its imagery.Last week, I watched a replay of David Ortiz\u2019s game-winning home run in the 12th inning of Game 4 of the 2004 A.L.C.S. It happened nearly 13 years ago, but it could have been last October, the way the scene was presented: the HD video, the score at the top of the screen, Joe Buck calling balls and strikes. We may be past the point when the only way to distinguish among coming eras will be by the change in uniforms. In terms of action and detail, the post-HD eras are likely to all look the same \u2014 our eyeballs can\u2019t take in much more than what\u2019s being beamed out to today\u2019s 4K and 1080p televisions. Baseball\u2019s visual clock, which once kept time for a changing country, now seems frozen.It\u2019s difficult to imagine a major Hollywood studio producing another great baseball movie. The rich, if somewhat oversaturated, cinematic treatments look weird compared with HD feeds. And the story lines that ran through all those old movies \u2014 the scrappy underdogs who band together to take down the Yankees, the disillusioned veteran who rediscovers his love for the game \u2014 have aged even worse. For years, the heroes in baseball movies were just variations on Jimmy Stewart \u2014 thin, patient, but seething with buried emotion that would come spilling out when he embraced the game again.In the \u201980s and \u201990s, Kevin Costner became an updated version of Stewart\u2019s impassioned stoic. When Robinson and the studio were debating whom to cast as their lead in \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d he said, Costner was their first choice, but they didn\u2019t approach him because he had just starred in \u201cBull Durham,\u201d and they couldn\u2019t imagine that he would want to do back-to-back baseball movies. But a studio executive slipped him a copy of the script, and Costner immediately said he was interested. \u201cKevin had that kind of Middle American appeal,\u201d Robinson told me.Baseball\u2019s cinematic vision of Middle America no longer means what it once did. The failing family enterprise and the old, forbearing white \u2014 or Negro Leagues \u2014 ballplayer now remind us of an extinct vision of the country and the growing distance between Middle America and the coasts. The attempts to update the archival, sun-kissed, Midwestern vision \u2014 whether on last year\u2019s \u201cPitch,\u201d the Fox TV show about a woman pitching in the majors, or \u201cMillion Dollar Arm,\u201d the 2014 Disney movie in which Jon Hamm goes to India to convert cricket bowlers into pitchers \u2014 are canceled or bomb at the box office.\u201c\u2009\u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 was an attempt to do something that transcended time,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cIt speaks to this undeniable feeling that we know we can\u2019t go back and right old wrongs, but wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could?\u201dJay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jared Kushner\u2019s Other Real Estate Empire", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byFeatureThis article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization.In the townhouse next door lived an older woman with whom Warren became friendly, even doing her grocery shopping once in a while. But over the course of a few months, the woman started acting strangely. She began accosting Warren\u2019s visitors. She shouted through the walls during the day. And at night she banged on the wall, right where Warren kept the bassinet in which her third child slept, waking him up.Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex\u2019s property manager, a company called Sawyer Realty Holdings. When there was no response, she decided to move out. In January 2010, she submitted the requisite form giving two months\u2019 notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher \u2014 the federal low-income subsidy that helped her pay the rent \u2014 elsewhere. The complex\u2019s on-site manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read \u201cThe tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease.\u201dSo Warren was startled in January 2013, three years later, when she received a summons from a private process server informing her that she was being sued for $3,014.08 by the owner of Cove Village. The lawsuit, filed in Maryland District Court, was doubly bewildering. It claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease\u2019s expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. And the company suing her was not Sawyer, but one whose name she didn\u2019t recognize: JK2 Westminster L.L.C.Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor\u2019s degree in health care administration, and she disregarded the summons at first. But JK2 Westminster\u2019s lawyers persisted; two more summonses followed. In April 2014, she appeared without a lawyer at a district-court hearing. She told the judge about the approval for her move, but she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney\u2019s fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5,000. There was no way Warren, who was working as a home health aide, was going to be able to pay such a sum. \u201cI was so desperate,\u201d she said.If the case was confounding to Warren, it was not unique. Hundreds like it have been filed over the last five years by JK2 Westminster and affiliated businesses in the state of Maryland alone, where the company owns some 8,000 apartments and townhouses. Nor was JK2 Westminster quite as anonymous as its opaque name suggested. It was a subsidiary of a large New York real estate firm called Kushner Companies, which was led by a young man whose initials happened to be J.K.: Jared Kushner.But the Kushners\u2019 empire, like Trump\u2019s, was underwritten by years of dealing in much more modestly ambitioned properties. Jared\u2019s grandfather Joseph Kushner, a Holocaust survivor from Belarus, over his lifetime built a small construction company in New Jersey into a real estate venture that owned and managed some 4,000 low-rise units concentrated in the suburbs of Newark. After taking over the business, Charles expanded Kushner Companies\u2019 holdings to commercial and industrial spaces, but the company\u2019s bread and butter remained the North Jersey apartment complexes bequeathed to him by his father.A year later, in August 2012, a Kushner-led investment group bought 5,500 multifamily units in the Baltimore area with $371 million in financing from Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage lender \u2014 another considerable bargain. Two years later, Kushner Companies picked up three more complexes in the Baltimore area for $37.9 million. Today, Westminster Management, Kushner Companies\u2019 property-management arm, lists 34 complexes under its control in Maryland, Ohio and New Jersey, with a total of close to 20,000 units.The complexes date mostly from the 1960s and \u201970s, when white flight from the city was creating a huge demand for affordable housing in Baltimore County. They were meant to exude middle-class respectability \u2014 unglamorous but safe and pleasant enough, a renter\u2019s Levittown. Since then, however, they have slipped socioeconomically, along with the middle class itself, into the vast gray area of the modern precariat \u2014 home to casino workers, distribution-warehouse pickers, Uber drivers, students at for-profit colleges. Although most of the tenants I met in a series of recent visits to the complexes pay their own rent, ranging from about $800 to $1,300, some of them receive Section 8 assistance, as Kamiia Warren did; Baltimore County has no public housing for a population of more than 825,000, so these and similar complexes have become the de facto substitute.At the time of the 2012 Baltimore purchase, Kushner raved about the promise of the low-end multifamily market. \u201cIt\u2019s proven over the last few years to be the most resilient asset class, and at the end of the day, it\u2019s a very stable asset class,\u201d he told Multifamily Executive. He said things were proceeding well in the Midwestern complexes he purchased a year earlier. \u201cIt was a lot of construction and a lot of evictions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the communities now look great, and the outcome has been phenomenal.\u201dThe garnishing started that month. Warren was in the midst of leaving her job, but JK2 Westminster garnished her bank account too. After her account was zeroed out, a loss of about $900, she borrowed money from her mother to buy food for her children and pay her bills. That February \u2014 five years after she left Cove Village \u2014 Warren returned to court, this time with the housing form in hand, asking the judge to halt garnishment. \u201cI am a single mom of three and my bank account was wiped clean by the plaintiff,\u201d she pleaded in another handwritten request. \u201cI cannot take care of my kids when they snatch all of my money out of my account. I do not feel I owe this money. Please have mercy on my family and I.\u201d She told me that when she called the law office representing JK2 Westminster that same day from the courthouse to discuss the case, one of the lawyers told her: \u201cThis is not going to go away. You will pay us.\u201dThe judge denied Warren\u2019s request without explanation. And JK2 Westminster kept pressing for the rest of the money, sending out one process server after another to present Warren with legal papers. Finally, in January 2016, the court sent notice of a $4,615 lien against Warren \u2014 a legal claim against her for the remaining judgment. Warren began to cry as she recounted the episode to me. She said the lien has greatly complicated her hopes of taking out a loan to start her own small assisted-living center. She had gone a couple of years without a bank account, for fear of further garnishing. \u201cIt was just pure greed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was unnecessary.\u201d I asked why she hadn\u2019t pushed harder against the judgment once she had the necessary evidence in hand. \u201cThey know how to work this stuff,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey know what to do, and here I am, I don\u2019t know anything about the law. I would have to hire a lawyer or something, and I really can\u2019t afford that. I really don\u2019t know my rights. I don\u2019t know all the court lingo. I knew that up against them I would lose.\u201dA search for \u201cJK2 Westminster\u201d in the database of Maryland\u2019s District Court system brings back 548 cases in which it is the plaintiff \u2014 and that does not include hundreds of other cases that have been filed in the name of the company\u2019s individual complexes.A vast majority of these cases have been filed by a single small law firm in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills. The law office of Jeffrey Tapper specializes in \u201ccollections\u201d work, with an emphasis on landlord-tenant cases. It has represented several other real estate management companies, including Sawyer, which retains a stake in many of the Kushner complexes.In April, I drove to Owings Mills in hopes of speaking to Tapper. As I waited for him by reception, I overheard an assistant making a call about a new case, saying that the firm would continue to pursue one tenant even if the other person on the lease had filed for bankruptcy. Tapper emerged, a man in his mid-60s with white hair, a paunch and a large smartphone clipped to his belt. Our interview was brief. \u201cI\u2019m not having any conversation with you that has to do with one of my clients,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not helping you with any of whatever you\u2019re trying to do.\u201dIn the cases that Tapper has brought to court on behalf of JK2 Westminster and individual Kushner-controlled companies, there is a clear pattern of Kushner Companies\u2019 pursuing tenants over virtually any unpaid rent or broken lease \u2014 even in the numerous cases where the facts appear to be on the tenants\u2019 side. Not only does the company file cases against them, it pursues the cases for as long as it takes to collect from the overmatched defendants \u2014 often several years. The court docket of JK2 Westminster\u2019s case against Warren, for instance, spans more than three years and 112 actions \u2014 for a sum that amounts to maybe two days\u2019 worth of billings for the average corporate-law-firm associate, from a woman who never even rented from JK2 Westminster. The pursuit is all the more remarkable given how transient the company\u2019s prey tends to be. Hounding former tenants for money means paying to send out process servers who often report back that they were unable to locate the target. This does not deter Kushner Companies\u2019 lawyers. They send the servers back out again a few months later.In March 2009, Joan Beverly, a probation agent, signed the lease for her daughter, Lennettea, for a unit at Dutch Village, a complex on the northern edge of Baltimore. Lennettea moved out a year later, several months before her lease was up. Kushner Companies bought Dutch Village more than two years later. In December 2012, JK2 Westminster filed suit in Baltimore County District Court against Beverly, seeking $3,810.16 \u2014 several months of rent it said it was owed, plus about $1,000 in repair costs, including $10 for \u201cfailure to return laundry room card.\u201dThat February, Lennettea filed a written court notice explaining that her mother, who was dying of pancreatic cancer, was \u201cin terminal hospice care and is not eligible to work.\u201d She added by way of supporting evidence a letter from the hospice provider to Joan Beverly\u2019s bank, explaining her and her husband\u2019s late mortgage payments on their home: \u201cThere has been added financial stress because Mrs. Beverly is very ill at this time.\u201d But JK2 Westminster persisted in seeking a hearing on the suit. In March, a district court judge found in favor of the company \u2014 a total judgment against Joan of more than $5,500.Joan died two weeks later. Her husband, Tyrone Beverly, a retired longshoreman, requested that the judgment against his deceased wife be removed but was denied. The case remains open in the court database. Tyrone, who was married to Joan for 32 years, told me that he had assumed the judgment had been dismissed and was unaware that it was still listed as awaiting payment. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t treat us fair,\u201d he said.The sweeping nature of the company\u2019s pursuit of tenants was most evident when those tenants were, in fact, prepared to defend themselves. Shawanda Hough moved out of her unit in the Carriage Hill complex in the northwestern Baltimore suburb of Randallstown in early 2012 after black mold worsened her son\u2019s asthma, landing him in the hospital twice. After the maintenance crew tried and failed to fix the problem, she got the rental office\u2019s written permission to move out in advance of her lease. But then Kushner Companies bought Carriage Hill, and a year and a half later, in August 2013, JK2 Westminster filed a lawsuit against Hough, seeking $4,068.53.Hough fought back. In a court filing, she said that she had kept all of her documentation, and that the company had assured her that it had not lost a dime in rent; she had gone so far as to coordinate the time of her departure with the arrival of a new tenant. JK2 Westminster went ahead with a hearing before a judge a month later, but the judge ultimately found for Hough.Cases like Hough\u2019s, however, were the exception rather than the rule. Over all, about nine out of every 10 cases brought by JK2 Westminster that I surveyed resulted in judgments against the defendants, who often did not appear in person for the hearings \u2014 and if they did, almost never had legal representation. How could it possibly be worth Kushner Companies\u2019 while to pursue hundreds of people so aggressively over a few thousand dollars here and there? After all, the pursuit itself cost money. And it wasn\u2019t happening just in Baltimore \u2014 Doug Wilkins, a lawyer in Toledo who has represented some of the complexes bought there by Kushner, told me the company is seeking far more monetary judgments than did previous owners.When I presented JK2 Westminster\u2019s record of litigation to Matthew Cypher, a Georgetown University business professor who used to work for the real estate giant Invesco, he said it was highly unusual to put so much effort into pursuing former tenants in court. \u201cThese people fade into the shadows of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that there\u2019s that much to go after.\u201d Brian Pendergraft, an attorney in Greenbelt, Md., who works on both sides of landlord-tenant litigation, told me he had heard of large property-management companies pursuing former tenants for unpaid rent but not going so far as to pursue tenants who predated the company\u2019s ownership of a complex. \u201cI guess you can do it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool.\u201dBut Matthew Hertz, whose Bethesda, Md., firm represents landlords and tenants in similar cases, explained to me that there is a logic behind such aggressive tactics. The costs of the pursuit are not as high as you might imagine, he said \u2014 people are not that hard to find in the age of cellphones and easily accessible databases. \u201cIf I give my process server a name and phone number, it\u2019s generally enough to trace you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have a date of birth and Social Security number, it\u2019s even easier.\u201d The legal costs can be billed to the defendant as attorney\u2019s fees, if the terms of the lease allow. And garnishing wages is relatively easy to do by court order, assuming the defendant has wages to garnish.As for pursuing former tenants from years before the new company\u2019s ownership of a complex, Hertz said it was hardly different from an investor\u2019s buying a portfolio of mortgages: It\u2019s debt to be collected on. \u201cIf you buy someone\u2019s properties, you\u2019re buying their debts, not just their assets. You take the good with the bad, and try to collect on the bad. Even if you only get back 5 percent, you\u2019re making something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m buying up this property and if I can collect anything, it\u2019s gravy on top.\u2019\u2009\u201dThere was, Hertz added, an ancillary benefit to such relentless pursuit: sending a message to current tenants. One way to make sure that tenants are paying their rent and to keep them from breaking leases early \u2014 which brings with it the costs and hassles of having to clean apartments and find new tenants \u2014 is to instill a sense of fear about violating a lease. \u201cAny landlord takes that into account,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cThey know tenants are going to talk to each other. If they say, \u2018He\u2019s going to come after you,\u2019 it\u2019s deterrence.\u201dWhen Kushner Companies finally responded to my questions about the cases, they essentially affirmed Hertz\u2019s reasoning. As manager for the Baltimore complexes, the company had a \u201cfiduciary obligation\u201d to its ownership partners to collect as much revenue as it could, said Kushner Companies\u2019 chief financial officer, Jennifer McLean, in a written response. She said the company\u2019s legal costs have been \u201cminimal\u201d compared with what it seeks to recover.McLean declined to comment on several cases, including Kamiia Warren\u2019s. But she said the pursuit of Joan Beverly, the woman dying of cancer, was justified. \u201cThis tenant owed the landlord $3,819.16,\u201d she said in the written statement. \u201cAs property manager, it\u2019s our job to collect rent payments.\u201dIn general, \u201cWestminster Management only takes legal action against a tenant when absolutely necessary,\u201d McLean said. \u201cIf legal action is pursued, however, the company follows guidelines consistent with industry standards.\u201d She added: \u201cWhile taking a tenant to court is far from an ideal outcome, that option \u2014 and clear rules governing it \u2014 must exist as a last resort.\u201dThe complex, like the others I saw, seemed designed to preclude neighborliness \u2014 most of the townhouses lack even the barest stoop to sit out on, and at least one complex has signs forbidding ball-playing (\u201cviolators will be prosecuted\u201d). At another complex, kids had drawn a rectangle on the side of a storage shed in lieu of a hoop for their basketball game. The only meeting points at many of the complexes are the metal mailbox stands, the Dumpsters and the laundry room. And the only thing that united many of the residents I spoke to, it seemed, was resentment of their landlord.They complained about Westminster Management\u2019s aggressive rent-collection practices, which many told me exceeded what they had experienced under the previous owners. Rent is marked officially late, they said, if it arrives after 4:30 p.m. on the fifth day of the month. But Westminster recently made paying the rent much more of a challenge. Last fall, it sent notice to residents saying that they could no longer pay by money order (on which many residents, who lack checking accounts, had relied) at the complex\u2019s rental office and would instead need to go to a Walmart or Ace Cash Express and use an assigned \u201cWIPS card\u201d \u2014 a plastic card linked to the resident\u2019s account \u2014 to pay their rent there. That method carries a $3.50 fee for every payment, and getting to the Walmart or Ace is difficult for the many residents without cars.Tenants who pay after the 5th are hit with late fees that start around $40 to $50 and escalate from there, with court fees usually added on as well. What upsets residents most, though, are not the fees themselves but that the property managers, instead of putting pink or yellow late notices and court summonses discreetly in mailboxes or under doors, post them in public \u2014 on the front doors of townhouse units or on lobby walls or lobby doors of apartment buildings. This bothered even tenants who said they always paid their rent on time. \u201cThe whole neighborhood knows,\u201d said Marquita Parmely, a truck driver who pays $1,010 a month to rent a townhouse at Essex Park, near Cove Village. Dareck Cromwell, a retiree living at Carriage Hill, told me: \u201cThey put them in the windows for everybody to see, to see your business. That\u2019s not right. You don\u2019t put people\u2019s business out like that.\u201dCompounding these grievances was Westminster\u2019s maintenance of the properties \u2014 or lack thereof. Their complexes comprise hundreds of units, but typically have only four or so workers looking after them. Alishia Jamesson, a 30-year-old Highland Village resident, invited me into the small living room of the $842-a-month townhouse she and her fianc\u00e9 share with her two children. The room was cluttered with bags from Walmart and Dollar Tree, ketchup packets and supplies for the work Jamesson took up after she lost her cashier\u2019s job at Walmart for missing too many shifts for parenting duties: making personalized tote bags and gift baskets for weddings.Jamesson showed me three large holes in the walls of the townhouse, which Westminster charged her and her fianc\u00e9, Keith Riggs, $150 to fix in October but had not yet repaired. \u201cEvery time I ask about drywall they say, \u2018Oh, well, we only have one drywall person,\u2019\u2009\u201d Riggs told me. There was also black mold spreading around the bathtub, a large brown stain and crack on the wall adjacent to the stove and a gap in the bathroom skylight that allowed in rain and snow. Jamesson told me that the refrigerator hadn\u2019t worked for more than a month before being replaced; her family had lived on canned food and boxed milk.Complaints about poor upkeep abounded at the other complexes too. At Highland Village, there was the matter of the vacant unit that burned down one night a couple of months ago: its shell was still standing, attended by nothing but plywood and a tarp. At Essex Park, east of the city, Marquita Parmely, the truck driver, told me she had a mouse infestation that was severe enough that her 12-year-old daughter recently found one in her bed. Parmely also has a 2-year-old with asthma, which is aggravated by allergens in mice droppings. She moved her own bed and other furniture away from the walls to dissuade mice, kept the family\u2019s laundry in tote bags after mice started appearing in the hamper and vacuumed twice a day. Her neighbor told me it took weeks for staff members to replace a rear window that had been shot out by kids with a BB gun.At the Carroll Park complex in Middle River, Md., Jen Jackson showed me a ceiling leak that was causing a mold problem. At the Whispering Woods townhouses nearby, a resident named Nicole, who asked that I not use her last name, told me she had filed unheeded complaints about loose plastic shutters, one of which finally fell off and hit her in the head. (When I visited Nicole again a few weeks later, she told me that Westminster staff had scolded her for speaking with me and told her not to do so again. A large black pickup followed me and a photographer as we walked through the complex until we left.) In the same complex, Renee Cook showed me the large swath of her downstairs ceiling that had collapsed and the mold and mildew beneath the carpet, each resulting from a leak from her neighbor\u2019s (illicit) washer-dryer.Asked about such conditions, Kushner Companies said it follows industry standards for maintenance staffing and exterminator visits, and that it and its partners had spent $10 million on upgrades across the complexes. \u201cDespite those improvements, issues still arise, given the age of the properties,\u201d said McLean, the chief financial officer. Shortly after I put questions to the company about specific tenants\u2019 complaints, Cook\u2019s ceiling was repaired.The worst troubles may have been those described in a 2013 court case involving Jasmine Cox\u2019s unit at Cove Village. They began with the bedroom ceiling, which started leaking one day. Then maggots started coming out of the living-room carpet. Then raw sewage started flowing out of the kitchen sink. \u201cIt sounded like someone turned a pool upside down,\u201d Cox told me. \u201cI heard the water hitting the floor and I panicked. I got out of bed and the sink is black and gray, it\u2019s pooling out of the sink and the house smells terrible.\u201dCox stopped cooking for herself and her son, not wanting food near the sink. A judge allowed her reduced rent for one month. When she moved out soon afterward, Westminster Management sent her a $600 invoice for a new carpet and other repairs. Cox, who is now working as a battery-test engineer and about to buy her first home, was unaware who was behind the company that had put her through such an ordeal. When I told her of Kushner\u2019s involvement, there was a silence as she took it in.\u201cGet that [expletive] out of here,\u201d she said.East of the city, I met Chris Freimiller, a 38-year-old resident of the company\u2019s Morningside Park complex, who was smoking Newports in his car before heading to work at a Rite Aid distribution center. Freimiller complained to me about the persistent leaks from the toilet and the ceiling damage it had caused, and about being hit repeatedly with late fees. He told me he voted for president for the first time ever last year \u2014 for Donald Trump. His vote, he said, was motivated by \u201cthe racial and police issues. How bad it got with Obama and how he seemed to promote the cop-bashing and the racial divide.\u201d Did knowing that he was sending his late fees to Trump\u2019s son-in-law change anything? \u201cYeah, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cAs if they need any more money.\u201dOn April 17, three cases were being held consecutively in Baltimore\u2019s District Court involving tenants of the Dutch Village complex. One was against Catherine Silver, a Morgan State University student who had given notice that she was moving at the end of March \u2014 she was fed up with lousy maintenance (among other things, a perpetually clogged toilet and a ceiling leak in her closet). But when Silver went to Walmart to pay her March rent with her WIPS card, the money mistakenly ended up not in the account for Dutch Village but the one for Kushner Companies\u2019 adjacent complex, Pleasantview.Westminster Management started eviction proceedings. On March 23, a sheriff\u2019s deputy changed the locks on the unit. Silver was traveling at the time \u2014 it was spring break \u2014 and it was not until March 31 that she was able to explain to a judge what happened and get her keys back. By that point, it was too late to get her possessions into the moving truck she\u2019d rented, and classes had resumed. She stayed in the unit, in which Westminster had turned off the heat and hot water, trying again to plan her departure. But Westminster was now after her for April\u2019s rent, despite the fact that the company had literally barred her from being able to move before April, as she had intended. On April 25, a judge ruled that she needed to pay half of April\u2019s rent, plus court costs: $471.Westminster had a lawyer from Tapper\u2019s firm, Andrew Rabinowitz, at the April 25 hearing, which lasted more than three hours \u2014 all over less than $500. The next day Rabinowitz was back to defend Westminster against Silver\u2019s criminal complaint over the unfounded eviction. This time, he was more accommodating, perhaps because he realized a reporter was present. After conferring with Dutch Village\u2019s property manager, who was also in attendance, Rabinowitz agreed to let Silver have until the end of May to move out, rent-free, as long as she paid for April. Silver asked if she could have her hot water turned back on. He said he would look into it. But when I visited Silver two weeks later, the hot water was still off. The stove was covered with the pots she was using to boil water for bathing.On May 10 at the Highland Village complex, a woman was distributing the yellow \u201cfailure to pay rent\u201d notices filed with the District Court to tenants who were behind on their May rent. One went up on the door of a man who introduced himself to me as Tommy, a recently divorced house painter with two children, who was at that moment sitting in his pickup truck reading Psalm 91 to gird himself for a visit to traffic court. He said he didn\u2019t know why he kept being hit with late fees and court fees at Highland Village because he was up to date on the rent itself.Over at Carroll Park, Mike McHargue, the private investigator, had also received a yellow notice and was trying to find out when he needed to come up with money to avoid eviction. So was Chris Freimiller, the Rite Aid worker. He had missed a couple weeks of work with back pain related to a metal bar in his leg from an earlier car accident, and Westminster Management had moved quickly to file for eviction over $722.09 in missing rent, plus $66 in fees. When I arrived, Freimiller was sleeping on the couch after a night shift, and his wife, Jaclyn Meador, was trying to get an eviction date from the constable while their 11-year-old son, Ethan, looked on.One more yellow notice was affixed at the Highland Park home of Alishia Jamesson, the wedding-basket maker. Her fianc\u00e9 had left his job as a casino housekeeper to take a job handling Amazon packages near the airport, but his first check hadn\u2019t come through yet. Jamesson was working at Walmart again. The couple\u2019s car tags had expired, so both were enduring long public-transit commutes. No one had come from maintenance. There were still three holes in the wall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Looming Threat of Yellow Fever", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThree years ago, the West African Ebola epidemic set off a worldwide panic and the biggest global-health security crisis in years. Then Zika struck and the reality of those transmittable disease threats was brought even closer to home in the United States, with more than 5,000 cases reported and America still on high alert. Yet today, an even greater potential threat to the world is sweeping across Brazil.The disease, yellow fever, is a deadly virus that spreads as rapidly as Zika, with symptoms that can be as horrific as Ebola. It is transmitted by certain species of mosquito, including the same Aedes aegypti that carries Zika. Up to 15 percent of those bitten become severely ill, with symptoms that include black vomit and bleeding from the nose, mouth and eyes. For up to half of those who develop severe symptoms, yellow fever ends in a painful death.Until about a century ago, the disease regularly caused urban epidemics in the United States, including one in Philadelphia that killed 10 percent of the population in 1793, forcing President George Washington and others in his administration to flee what was then the nation\u2019s capital.Now, with Brazil facing an unusually large outbreak of yellow fever \u2014 there are 715 confirmed cases, more than 820 suspected cases and 240 confirmed deaths \u2014 another global health crisis looms. So far, the outbreaks have largely been confined to sparsely populated jungle areas. There is serious concern, however, that if the virus starts spreading in a major city, health authorities will be ill equipped to contain it. Rio de Janeiro, for one, is aggressively vaccinating its citizens in hopes of inoculating 12 million by the end of the year.Yellow fever already kills upward of 30,000 people a year worldwide, though in 2013 as many as 60,000 might have died from the disease. With the threat of yellow fever returning to regions where it was once expunged, that number could rise significantly. What is particularly worrying is the possibility of yellow fever taking hold in previously unaffected parts of the world like Asia. The combination of Aedes aegypti being prevalent there and about 1.8 billion unvaccinated people living in densely populated parts of that continent makes for a potential disaster.While there is no cure for yellow fever, a licensed vaccine has long been available that is safe, affordable and highly effective, providing lifetime protection with just one dose.The shortages made the situation so desperate that the World Health Organization and Unicef had to resort to fractional dosing in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, administrating one-fifth of a normal dose. We got lucky: The Brazilian manufacturer made available up to 2.5 million doses of the vaccine, and the outbreak was curbed.Now, the situation has reversed. Having already distributed 15 million vaccine doses since the outbreak began in December, Brazil has been forced to request 3.5 million doses from the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision, which oversees emergency stocks financed by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the nonprofit group I manage. With a global emergency stockpile of six million doses and about 12 million people living in and around Rio, it is easy to see why public health experts are worried. If Rio and one other major city experience an outbreak, it is doubtful whether stocks could be replenished fast enough to keep up with demand.The proportion of people living in urban areas, where diseases can spread far more rapidly than in rural areas with scattered populations, is forecast to rise from one-third of the planet\u2019s population in 1950 to two-thirds by 2050. Clearly, we need to revise our risk assessments for infectious diseases to reflect this trend. But just how large should vaccine stockpiles be? And for how many cities should we prepare?And while these emergency stockpiles are essential, if we have to call upon them we have in some way already failed. They should be our last line of defense. Instead, if we want to avoid a return of the kind of urban epidemic that killed 5,000 people in Philadelphia two centuries ago, we need to prevent outbreaks from occurring in the first place. That means improving mosquito control and simultaneously increasing immunity against yellow fever through routine immunization and pre-emptive vaccination campaigns.With winter arriving next month in South America, the outbreak will most likely be brought to heel. But as mosquito season approaches in the north, control measures will be essential if we want to avoid yellow fever following Zika\u2019s path, making its way north through Latin America to southern states in the United States like Florida.And if, or when, it arrives, awareness will also be critical to prevent its spread, especially because very few doctors in the United States have ever seen a case and hardly anyone is vaccinated. As things stand, shortages are already affecting the availability of yellow fever travel vaccines in the United States.History has shown that preventive approaches can be highly effective at controlling yellow fever, but if they are to work we first need to recognize there is a problem. To quote a long-ago Philadelphian, Benjamin Franklin, \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bethesda Readies for a Major Remake", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetFor decades, the downtown in Bethesda, Md., had little more than a hardware store, a toy store and a few restaurants. The small urban core along Wisconsin Avenue was mostly a place to pass through on the way to the District of Columbia a few miles to the south, or the Bethesda Naval Hospital or the National Institutes of Health several blocks to the north.But in the mid-1980s, as the Metro subway system\u2019s Red Line was extended to Bethesda, the unincorporated community began to take on the characteristics of a small city. Soon several high-rise buildings were constructed. They were filled by law firms, financial service companies and trade associations.Hotels, restaurants and boutiques soon followed, and a Barnes & Noble bookstore opened as an anchor in a revitalized retail area a few blocks from the Metro station. It was not too long before a bank replaced the hardware store on Wisconsin Avenue, movie theaters opened, and dozens of new restaurants arrived in the new pedestrian-friendly streetscape.Marriott also plans to open a hotel with at least 230 rooms and meeting spaces for conferences. The site, now occupied by low-rise commercial buildings, is near the famous greasy spoon the Tastee Diner, a popular relic of a bygone Bethesda.The county and the state have agreed to provide up to $62 million in subsidies and tax benefits to keep Marriott in Montgomery County and relocate about five miles from its current site. Montgomery County has also agreed to lease Marriott a public parking garage for weekday use during business hours, and the company expects to build its own underground garage with about 800 spaces.Marriott expects to enter into a long-term lease with the owners/developers, Boston Properties and the Bernstein Companies, said Carolyn B. Handlon, executive vice president finance and global treasurer of Marriott International.Company officials were excited to be moving to a more urban setting, where employees will be able to walk, bike or take the Metro to work, Ms. Handlon said.Planners and public officials predict that other large companies may follow Marriott.\u201cAll of that land is very desirable,\u201d said Nancy Floreen, a Montgomery County council member, chairwoman of the council committee that reviewed the new plans for Bethesda.Ms. Handlon said: \u201cWe asked our associates what they wanted. There was a common theme. Besides state-of-the-art technology, there was a real sense people wanted that vibrant, mixed-use urban community that you could walk to.\u201dMarriott\u2019s decision to get away from its car-centric office park and move its employees into an urban setting is the latest in a broader effort by Montgomery County planners to bring more people to its existing urban centers, and to create new ones, like the White Flint development a few miles north.Currently about 10,000 people live in what is considered Bethesda\u2019s downtown \u2014 an area stretching roughly from Bradley Boulevard to the south to Battery Lane to the north. About 37,700 people work there. According to county projections, the proposed changes in Bethesda could bring another 14,200 new jobs in the next 20 years. The community is also set to become a terminus on the Purple Line, a proposed light rail currently embroiled in a court battle.The new plan, which the Montgomery County Council accepted much of in a straw vote on April 25 before an expected formal vote in late May, also proposes a series of new, small parks and more bike lanes and walkways. Council members on April 25 endorsed limiting heights of commercial buildings closer to residential areas.The planners also want to encourage developers to include more affordable housing in their plans, by giving them additional density if they add extra moderate-priced housing into their mix. Affordable housing has been difficult to find in Bethesda for years.Many of the condos in downtown Bethesda sell for more than $1 million, and rentals for one-bedrooms can be expensive in newer buildings.Some residents in neighborhoods just across Wisconsin Avenue from the Metro and the Marriott site are worried that the new development will lead to traffic jams and other problems. They said they were fearful even though county planners proposed placing a cap on density that would allow no more than 4.2 million square feet in new construction if the plans are approved, as expected.\u201cThe pace and scale of the development has gotten to the point that I feel the county is unable to keep up with it,\u201d said Amanda Farber, an East Bethesda resident and co-vice president of the East Bethesda Citizens Association.Many nearby public schools are already overcrowded, according to county data. Gwen Wright, Montgomery County\u2019s planning director, said the county\u2019s public school system could opt to reopen some closed schools for younger students and might need to whether or not the new plan brings new students. Eventually, however, she said the community would have to come to grips with the need for a new high school in the Bethesda area.Allison M. Macfarlane, a professor at George Washington University and former chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, lives near the new Marriott site and is among those who are worried about the changes.\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the residents are anti-development,\u201d she said. \u201cBethesda could definitely use some updating and improving. But it should not be done in such a way that makes it completely unlivable.\u201d\u201cI hate what Bethesda has become \u2014 the overbuilding has hit a saturation point and traffic is a nightmare,\u201d wrote Mr. Cook, who is the editor of the Cook Political Report.\u201cAs best as I can tell, the master plan is to allow Bethesda and presumably anyplace else with a Metro stop to become antiseptic places of concrete, steel and glass, with no charm or personality \u2014 just tax revenue for the county.\u201dRoger Berliner, the County Council president, a Democrat whose district includes Bethesda, has been pushing for lower building heights in areas near single-family neighborhoods like East Bethesda.It is appropriate \u201cto have a compact with our existing neighborhoods to shield them from the worst effect of development, to have tall buildings right next to neighborhoods,\u201d he said at a recent council meeting.Ms. Floreen said she thought Bethesda would remain a desirable place to live, work, shop and dine even with new buildings.\u201cIt is on a Metro line, yet convenient to suburbia, and an urban location,\u201d she said. What the new plan will do, she hopes, is find ways to \u201ccreate the right incentives for people to do interesting things in Bethesda.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: A Nervous Time for Banks", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019m looking at that right now.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s words on Monday about creating a modern-day Glass-Steagall Act rippled across the finance industry.The declaration shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise. Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, has been promoting the idea of bringing back the legislation, which would separate investment and consumer banks.It would be surprising if Mr. Trump followed through.The president has maintained that he wants to pare the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes stricter regulation on banks, but it would be a much bigger move to bring back Glass-Steagall.It could be that the two-tiered system of regulations that Mr. Trump and his team have discussed with community banks is a new interpretation of Glass-Steagall.But there is some question about the benefits of reviving the legislation, and it\u2019s not certain that it would encourage lending, an issue about which Mr. Trump has complained.\u201cIf Glass-Steagall had been in effect, we couldn\u2019t have had some of the failing firms taken over,\u201d Ben S. Bernanke, a former Federal Reserve chairman, said of the financial crisis of 2008.A wave of consolidation has rolled across the media industry in recent years. And now that the Federal Communications Commission has eased regulations on ownership, local television is being lapped up, too.It also helps the broadcast companies build their defenses against online rivals, like Netflix and Hulu, and against content providers, like CBS and the Walt Disney Company, which are pushing for bigger fees from broadcasters.Those factors may be what prompted a change of heart from James Murdoch, chief executive at 21st Century Fox.Just a few months ago, he denied having any interest in buying more television stations in the United States. Fox is now said to be teaming up with the private equity firm Blackstone to work on a deal for Tribune Media.But the grand acquisition plan comes as Fox\u2019s attempt to buy the European satellite group Sky awaits a ruling from British regulators (pending a \u201cfit and proper\u201d test) and risks a throwback to another era, when Rupert Murdoch, now the Fox chairman, was known for his capricious and overpriced deals, Ms. Saba writes.At the same time, Fox News is still dealing with the repercussions of a sexual harassment scandal.Questions about how far the company will go to clear up its corporate culture remain \u2014 Mr. Shine has been replaced by Suzanne Scott, a veteran executive who also has deep ties to Mr. Ailes.Could the home-sharing company be preparing a smoother ride to an initial public offering?The legal action could have hampered its expansion efforts.The company has now cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest United States markets: It dropped a suit about a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms.Airbnb still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets, but clearing up some of these regulatory issues should create a more stable environment for the company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Necessary Empire", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLJUBLJANA, Slovenia \u2014 Elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany this year have brought much drama to the old Carolingian core, where Charlemagne founded his empire in the ninth century. This has always been the richest and most strongly institutionalized part of Europe. But should the European Union continue to weaken, the most profound repercussions will be felt farther east and south.There, along the fault line of the Austrian Hapsburg and Ottoman Turkish empires, former Communist countries lack the sturdy middle-class base of core Europe, and in many cases are still distracted by ethnic and territorial disputes 25 years after the siege of Sarajevo. They depend on pro-European Union governments as never before.Here in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, a country squeezed between Central Europe and the Balkans, officials and experts talk about a so-called phantom frontier that still exercises people\u2019s imagination. This is the \u201cAntemurale Christianitatis,\u201d the \u201cBulwark of Christianity,\u201d proclaimed in 1519 by Pope Leo X, in a reference to the Roman Catholic Slavs considered the front line against the Ottoman Empire. Croatia was the first line of defense against the Muslim Sultanate, and Slovenia the second. \u201cWhen Yugoslavia collapsed, it was assumed that none of this earlier history was important,\u201d one official said to me recently. \u201cBut a quarter-century after the disintegration of Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia, we find that we are back to late-medieval and early-modern history.\u201dThe Slovenes, governed for hundreds of years by the Austrian Hapsburgs, had in 2016 a per-capita income of $32,000. The Croats, with their mixed history of being heirs in part to the Austro-Hungarian tradition and in part to Ottoman and Venetian traditions, had a per-capita income of $22,400. But then comes the rest of the former Yugoslavia, which fell almost completely within the Ottoman Empire. Here we have Montenegro with a per-capita income of $17,000, Serbia with $14,000 and Macedonia, Kosovo and the former Ottoman parts of Bosnia with similarly low numbers. The economic and social distinctions from older, imperial divisions remain.This is not ethnic or racial determinism, since the Slavs of southeastern Europe have been shaped politically and economically more by the agency of foreign imperialism than by their own blood and language. The former Byzantine and Ottoman part of Europe \u2014 the part closest to the Middle East \u2014 is still the poorest, least stable and most in need of support and guidance from the European Union. Whether Europe remains a secure and prosperous continent, or fractures along traditional east-west fault lines \u2014 with authoritarians in Russia and Turkey carving out zones of interest \u2014 will play out most vividly in the Balkans. Thus, political developments in Paris, Berlin and Brussels have repercussions far afield.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been active throughout Central and Eastern Europe, and particularly in the Balkans, using various forms of subversion, from running organized crime rings to financing nationalist-populist movements to influencing local news media. Montenegro may be close to joining NATO, but it is often viewed as a veritable colony of Russian oligarchs and crime groups, where by some accounts Russia tried to stage a coup last year. Serbia and Bulgaria are seen as beachheads of Russian regional influence, even as neo-authoritarian governments farther north in Hungary and Poland increasingly bear similarities to the Russian regime. The effort by the Hungarian government to end the freedom of Central European University, founded in Budapest by the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros after the fall of the Berlin Wall, has to be seen in this geopolitical context.As for Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a referendum granting him near-dictatorial powers last month. The next day, he visited the tomb not of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, modern Turkey\u2019s founder, but the tomb of Mehmed II, known as the Conqueror, the 15th-century Ottoman sultan whose imperial armies marched westward from Constantinople as far as Bosnia. Whether it is in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Kosovo or elsewhere in the region, Mr. Erdogan is determined to fill the void opened by a declining European Union. Lawlessness in Macedonia, including violence in the Parliament itself over a contested government transition, demonstrates the political fragility of southeastern Europe.Yet it is only the European Union that can stabilize the Balkans. Only if Serbia, Albania and Kosovo all become members of the union can the ethnic dispute between Serbs and Albanians truly be solved. Within the European Union, Albania and Kosovo will have no need of unifying on their own. But if they were to attempt unification, it could become a casus belli for the Serbs. A similar dynamic holds for the continuing contest between Croatia and Serbia for influence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is peace for everyone in the former Yugoslavia within the framework of the European Union. There is only protracted conflict without it. Indeed, the European Union offers a world of legal states instead of ethnic nations, governed by impersonal laws rather than fiat, where individuals are protected over the group.The European Union, in other words, is the necessary empire.I use the word \u201cempire\u201d advisedly. The European Union has been such an ambitious enterprise mainly because it has sought a union over the former Carolingian, Prussian, Hapsburg, Byzantine and Ottoman domains, all with starkly different histories and economic development patterns. To accomplish that, the European Union has had, in effect, to replace the functionality of those former empires. Even inside the open borders of the Schengen Area, within which European Union citizens are guaranteed free movement, the union represents a sprawling territory, governed to a significant degree by a remote and only partially democratic bureaucracy, with many of its people demanding more direct representation. Isn\u2019t this a form of late and declining empire?Yet, it must be saved \u2014 and improved. Jan Zielonka of St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, writes optimistically of a vibrant \u201cneo-medievalism\u201d in Europe: a dynamic overlapping of identities and sovereignties \u2014 supranational, national and local \u2014 as cities and regions vie with a revitalized European Union for a claim on people\u2019s loyalties. Unless there is a credible European Union, none of the other layers of identity are possible without conflict.I recently visited the Croatian port city of Rijeka, close to the Slovenian and Italian borders, when the two-headed eagle was put back atop the bell tower. \u201cIt is a Hapsburg emblem, not a Croat, Hungarian or Italian one,\u201d a local ethnic-Italian writer, Giacomo Scotti, explained to me. \u201cIt was taken down by the Fascists and symbolizes the local freedom and autonomy that this city enjoyed under the Hapsburgs.\u201d Mainly because Croatia is a sovereign state within the European Union, and working toward entry into the Schengen and euro zones, do the circumstances exist for such a nonthreatening display of local pride.Here it is wise to consider what Yugoslavia was ultimately about. The great Italian scholar of Central Europe, Claudio Magris, refers to Tito in his epic travel book, \u201cDanube,\u201d as the last of the Hapsburg emperors, resembling Franz Joseph \u201cbecause of his awareness of inheriting a supranational, Danubian legacy.\u201d Like Franz Joseph, Tito held Yugoslavia together through a mixture of repression and, compared with other Communist states, benevolence. Now the states that were once part of Yugoslavia will find peace and security only through a new, far more benign imperial system: the European Union. So what happens next in the core of Europe \u2014 whether, for instance, France joins Britain in seeking to exit the European Union \u2014 is crucial to the rest of the continent.Robert D. Kaplan is the author of \u201cBalkan Ghosts\u201d and \u201cIn Europe\u2019s Shadow.\u201d He is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a senior adviser at the Eurasia Group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is It a Golden Age for English Golf?", "Date": "2017-05-24", "News": "Supported byWith a touch of uneasiness, Matthew Fitzpatrick approached Jordan Spieth in the locker room at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont to ask the then-reigning champion to sign a flag for charity. In perhaps the clearest sign of how success in the majors is expected for Fitzpatrick, Spieth gladly accepted the flag, and said, \u201cLet me tell you something, I\u2019ll be asking you to sign a few for me in the future, don\u2019t you worry about that.\u201dAs Fitzpatrick, who at 22 is ranked No. 41 in the Official World Golf Ranking, prepares for the European Tour\u2019s PGA Championship \u2014 the kickoff of the new Rolex Series, an eight-tournament stretch where each tournament has at least a $7 million purse \u2014 he is the latest young prospect to come out of England in what appears to be the dawn of a golden age for English golf. The championship will be played at Wentworth Club, in Virginia Water, England, where it has been staged for decades.Nearly a quarter of the 112 exempt players on the European Tour this season are English, as were half of last year\u2019s 12-man European Ryder Cup squad.At the Masters in April, a record 11 English players were in the field, breaking the mark of 51 years ago. They were led by the defending champion Danny Willett and Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose, who lost in a playoff. And there is this: The English invasion includes seven players ranked in the top 50 in the world and 13 in the Top 100, a staggering improvement from 16 years ago when there was one.\u201cWas it me?\u201d joked Paul Casey, the current World No. 14 and a former English amateur champion.Afraid not. That honor belonged to Lee Westwood, the 44-year-old from Worksop, who spent a combined 22 weeks as World No. 1 in 2010-11. Westwood is among the old English guard consisting of Rose, 36; Casey, 39; Luke Donald, 39; and Ian Poulter, 41.Together, they have won titles big and small, cashed checks for millions, and starred on victorious Ryder Cup teams. But they have claimed only one major among them \u2014 the 2013 U.S. Open by Rose \u2014 and have failed to win the British Open. (An Englishman has not hoisted the Claret Jug since Nick Faldo in 1992.)It is the new blood that has British fans dreaming of future glory. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our five, 10 years and obviously we can still continue to be there, but the next wave is catching up and coming through. It\u2019s going to be exciting times for English golf,\u201d said Rose, the highest-ranked of the bunch at World No. 9.Much of the credit for the infusion of talent goes to the high-performance training program of England Golf, the governing body for amateur golf in England.One of the most promising newcomers is Tyrrell Hatton, 25, who dreamed of playing professional golf since he was 5, when he traveled 30 minutes from his home in Marlow to attend the PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club.Since 2016, Hatton has recorded 14 top-10 finishes from Dubai to Orlando, Fla., where he tied for fourth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He has climbed to No. 16 in the world on the back of his first European Tour victory at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, and earned temporary membership on the PGA Tour, meaning he can accept unlimited sponsor exemptions for the rest of the season.Willett\u2019s triumph at the 2016 Masters, which ended a 20-year green jacket drought for England, has boosted the hopes of the country\u2019s new wave that this could be the year for a Claret Jug. (The 146th British Open will be contested in July at Royal Birkdale in Southport, England.)In 2010, Northern Ireland\u2019s Graeme McDowell was the first Briton to win the U.S. Open in 40 years. It opened the way to Rory McIlroy (2011) and Rose (2013) following suit, and Darren Clarke (2011) and McIlroy (2014) bringing the Claret Jug to Northern Ireland.\u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing each other for years,\u201d Chris Wood, 29, said of Willett, the World No. 22. \u201cOnce you see one guy do it, you all start believing you can do it, too.\u201dSix weeks after Willett won the Masters, Wood, No. 66 in the world, won the European Tour\u2019s PGA Championship.Besides being hailed for greater glory, the new wave benefited from England Golf\u2019s Talent Pathway, a program to develop world-class players, which took off in 1999, thanks to funding from the National Lottery.That\u2019s when Sport England \u2014 which oversees national governing bodies for various sports \u2014 began contributing to the golf body in four-year increments matching the Olympic cycle, with a total of 13 million pounds ($16.9 million) from April 2013 to cover the four years through March 2017, including \u00a33.3 million devoted to producing junior and amateur champions. Previously, financing was limited to fees paid by participating clubs from member fees.The additional resources gave England Golf the ability to support individual achievers from club to county competitions and on to national and international elite squads.\u201cAs soon as you are recognized within your county or region, you are given a chance to compete outside your comfort zone,\u201d said Nigel Edwards, a three-time Walker Cup captain for Britain and Ireland, and England Golf\u2019s director of performance since 2011.As an amateur, Rose represented his country in Japan at the age of 14, and a year later in Spain. Hatton remembers playing in the Czech and Turkish Amateurs. Tommy Fleetwood, 26, who finished second at the WGC Mexico Championship in March and has climbed to World No. 28, spent a month competing in Australia before turning pro in 2010.Edwards also sent four promising players to train in South Africa and South America this year. \u201cThey gave me that exposure to bigger and better,\u201d Rose said.Ken Schofield, executive director of the European Tour from 1975 to 2004, credited improved coaching methods for the English success.He noted that John Jacobs, a founding father of the European circuit and renowned instructor who died in January, told him repeatedly that the standard of teaching in the United Kingdom was the best he had seen in his lifetime.The celebrated instructor Pete Cowen and his associate Mike Walker teach Fitzpatrick, Westwood, Willett and Wood, and the putting expert Phil Kenyon is among the instructors available to England\u2019s top junior talent.From 2011 to 2015, Casey\u2019s father, Terry, was men\u2019s team manager for England Golf. In 2013, his stable of rising stars won the U.S., British, European and South American Amateur championships as well as the Home Internationals, the European Team Championship and the European Nations Cup.Despite golf\u2019s inclusion again as an Olympic sport in 2016 and Rose winning the first gold medal in golf in 112 years, Sport England\u2019s support for the elite England Golf program was trimmed to \u00a32.5 million for April 2017 through March 2021. Future funding of England Golf could come from within through a newly started \u201cGive Back\u201d program.Jamie Bower, Nick Marsh and Ashton Turner are each getting seven starts on the 2017 European Challenge Tour, the European Tour\u2019s developmental circuit, in exchange for pledging a portion of their future prize money to the England Players Fund to develop the squad.Time will tell if the 25 Englishmen on the European Tour under age 30 will be better remembered for quantity or quality, but the early returns are promising.\u201cWestwood and Donald got to No. 1, but I\u2019ve yet to see that English kid that is truly head and shoulders above the rest,\u201d Paul Casey said. \u201cThere is depth now, but I\u2019m waiting for that one kid that is like, \u2018Wow, this guy is going to be a rock star.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s President Enacts Law Placing Severe Restrictions on Aid Groups", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byCAIRO \u2014 President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday enacted a law that imposes strict new regulations on aid groups, stoking fears that his government intends to accelerate its harsh crackdown on human rights activists before a presidential election scheduled for next year.But recently Mr. Sisi has appeared emboldened by a burgeoning friendship with President Trump, who has hailed the Egyptian strongman as a \u201cfantastic guy\u201d and indicated that he did not intend to allow human rights issues to sour their relationship.\u201cEgypt and other regimes like Bahrain definitely feel they have a green light from Trump to undertake repressive actions in the name of counterterrorism and to anticipate that the Trump administration will not issue a word of criticism,\u201d said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington.Critics counter that Mr. Sisi\u2019s counterterrorism strategy is in fact foundering badly, yet the president seems intent on scapegoating progressives and political rivals.The law approved on Monday by Mr. Sisi places harsh restrictions on Egypt\u2019s 47,000 local nongovernmental organizations as well as about 100 foreign-financed ones. It makes their work subject to approval by a new regulatory body that aid workers say is likely to be little more than a vehicle for interference by the country\u2019s security agencies.Aid groups will need permission from the new body, which has not yet been established, to conduct fieldwork or publish surveys, and more broadly must ensure their work \u201cfits the state\u2019s plans, development needs and priorities,\u201d according to the law.\u201cThis is a complete disaster,\u201d said Mohamed Zaree, a prominent Egyptian human rights defender. \u201cThey have taken away everything. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s not just human rights organizations \u2014 they are also going after charities and any organized group they do not already control.\u201dMr. Zaree himself is currently facing trial on charges of endangering national security, and has been banned from leaving Egypt.Last week, Mr. Sisi\u2019s government blocked 21 websites in Egypt, including Al Jazeera; the Arabic language version of The Huffington Post; and Mada Masr, an independent news organization that has published several investigations into the workings of the security agencies. After an outcry on social media, Mada Masr appeared to be working again on Monday.Some saw the arrest as part of an effort by Mr. Sisi to clear the field of rivals before next year\u2019s presidential election. If Mr. Ali, one of those rivals, is convicted on charges of \u201cviolating public morals,\u201d he faces a potential two-year prison sentence and will be disqualified from running for office.In Washington, Mr. Sisi\u2019s warm relationship with Mr. Trump has been offset by stiff criticism from Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham. In a joint statement in December, they slammed the new aid law as \u201cdraconian\u201d and vowed to push for restrictions on American aid to Egypt, currently at about $1.3 billion a year, if it is enacted. Their offices could not be reached for comment on Monday.\u201cThis is a very bad day for Egypt,\u201d said Ms. Hawthorne, the analyst, who predicted that the new law would weaken Egypt by effectively criminalizing the work of many aid groups.\u201cWe have a terrible experience of seeing what happens when authoritarian regimes crush that space between citizens and the state,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what happened under Qaddafi in Libya, and it\u2019s what happened under Saddam Hussein in Iraq.

It spends the most on campaign contributions, has the largest army of lobbyists and has the biggest pile of chits among lawmakers to try to protect its own interests.Nearly every week that Congress is in session, the industry holds fund-raisers at private clubs and restaurants to help bankroll the re-election campaigns of its allies. One former lobbyist for PhRMA recently boasted that he had once organized six fund-raising events in a two-day period. (He asked that he not be named because the fund-raising efforts are supposed to be confidential.)In late April, for example, a PhRMA Industry Breakfast was hosted for Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, at the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, a members-only hot spot across the street from the Capitol.A spokesman for Mr. Shimkus said his actions were intended to protect cancer patients \u2014 pointing to a clinic in his district he said might close if the Medicare program had gone into effect \u2014 not the pharmaceutical industry.But other participants said industry influence \u2014 as drug companies attempted to preserve their bottom line \u2014 had played a decisive role.\u201cWhen we first proposed this, people were warning me, \u2018Be careful, everybody on K Street is going to be gunning for you now,\u2019 and I did not really know what they meant,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, a top Obama administration official who pushed the prescription drug price experiment. \u201cNow I know. When you take on pharma, you take on this whole town.\u201dStephen J. Ubl, the chief executive of PhRMA, acknowledged that his group had been \u201cvery engaged\u201d in defending his member companies\u2019 interests, and blamed a few bad actors \u2014 not his own members \u2014 for the public\u2019s disapproval.The pharmacy benefit managers are giants themselves. Two of the biggest, Express Scripts and CVS Health, which are among the nation\u2019s 50 largest companies, have initiated their own counteroffensive.The memo bragged about the group\u2019s courting of senior Trump administration officials. It also said it had met with Capitol Hill staff members and lawmakers, formed a partnership with conservative advocacy groups and created an advertising campaign called \u201cDrug Benefit Solutions.\u201dLast month, the group hosted several hundred government officials and other industry players at a fancy \u201cpolicy forum\u201d a few blocks from the Capitol, where it detailed just why its members were \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to save consumers money.A smaller war is playing out between pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacists, confrontations that have included covert operations.When the independent pharmacists descended on Capitol Hill in late April, they came with a brochure depicting benefit managers as sharp-toothed dogs, grabbing bags of money.Yet even as they walked the halls, a group calling itself Ask Your Independent Pharmacist sent a blast email to some of the same lawmakers the pharmacists had just met with. \u201cWhose interests are they on the Hill to champion \u2014 the pharmacist\u2019s pocketbook or the patients they claim to serve?\u201d an email asked.When The New York Times called a public relations firm, Kivvit, which operates out of an address listed on the email, staff members repeatedly hung up when asked who had paid for the message. After a reporter called the firm\u2019s Chicago headquarters, Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department aide in the Obama administration who now works at Kivvit, responded: Express Scripts had paid for the message.Jonah Houts, the head of government affairs at Express Scripts, said the company\u2019s role as a middleman drew fire from all sides.\u201cWe were designed to create tension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re successful at what we do, and that\u2019s why we want to make sure the lawmakers who are considering legislation that affects us understand that.\u201dThe generics industry has also come under attack. Though its drugs are generally cheap, some have also risen sharply in price, and prosecutors have been investigating claims of price-fixing by some of the largest players, including Mylan.Mr. Doggett, the Texas Democrat, said the industry war was in some ways a positive sign.\u201cWe have moved from \u2018There is no problem\u2019 to \u2018It\u2019s not my fault,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt begins to focus attention on what so many of my constituents already know the problem is, which is price gouging.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Liberals Wanted a Fight in Montana. Democratic Leaders Saw a Lost Cause.", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byThe margin in this race was relatively small in a state that Mr. Trump carried by more than 20 percentage points last year. But Mr. Quist\u2019s defeat disappointed grass-roots Democrats who financed nearly his entire campaign while the national party declined to spend heavily on what it considered, from the outset, an all-but-lost cause in daunting political territory.This tension \u2014 between party leaders who will not compete for seats they think they cannot win and an energized base loath to concede any contests to Republicans \u2014 risks demoralizing activists who keep getting their hopes up. It also points to a painful reality for Democrats: Despite the boiling fury on the left, the resistance toward Mr. Trump has yet to translate into a major electoral victory.In part, this is because the few special elections for Congress so far have taken place in red-leaning districts, where the near-daily barrage of new controversies involving Mr. Trump has not damaged him irreparably and where he remains fairly popular.The Montana contest was the second special House election this year in a conservative district where rank-and-file progressives rallied behind their candidate only to see Washington-based Democrats shrink from the fight as Republicans launched ferocious attacks to ensure victory.\u201cIf the national Democratic Party would start getting more involved in these races earlier, then maybe we could flip them,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating.\u201dFor Republicans, the outcome in Montana, where Mr. Gianforte apologized in his victory speech late Thursday night to the reporter he had attacked, is likely to calm nerves at least for a while, staving off what the party feared would be a full-blown panic if Mr. Gianforte lost on such favorable turf. Washington-based Republican strategists had grown increasingly pessimistic about the race in recent weeks, bemoaning their candidate\u2019s political deficiencies and predicting a narrow victory.For Democrats, though, the contest pointed to an increasingly heated disagreement over where the party has a realistic chance to win. Party officials in Montana and progressive activists beyond the state\u2019s borders grew frustrated last month watching outside Republican groups savage Mr. Quist as Democratic groups remained on the sidelines.But House Democratic officials make no apology for their prudence, believing they are more likely to claim the 24 seats needed to capture the House majority in suburban districts with highly educated voters, where anger at Mr. Trump runs high. That includes districts like the one in suburban Atlanta, previously represented by Health Secretary Tom Price, where both parties have poured tens of millions of dollars into a contest that looms all the more consequential after the Democratic defeats in Kansas and Montana.Even this week, just two days before the Montana vote, Mr. Luj\u00e1n announced new spending in the Georgia race. And in private, Mr. Luj\u00e1n was telling other House Democrats that Mr. Quist stood little chance, based on private polls showing Mr. Gianforte with a healthy, consistent lead of about 10 percentage points, according to one of those present at a closed-door meeting of the caucus. After the election was called, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee circulated a memo declaring that it had \u201crefused to waste money on hype.\u201dOn Friday, Democratic leaders emphasized that Mr. Quist had performed better than the party\u2019s past congressional candidates in Montana, apparently benefiting from the enthusiasm of rank-and-file Democrats even as he fell well short of victory. The party\u2019s nominees, they noted, are outpacing their predecessors on fairly forbidding terrain, and Democratic voters are participating at higher rates than Republicans, despite being outnumbered in these districts.But other Democrats acknowledged that they must work harder to make inroads with voters who live far beyond major cities and their suburbs, if they want to pick up seats like the one Mr. Gianforte just captured.While both Mr. Trump and key Republican policy proposals, like the American Health Care Act, are broadly unpopular in public polling, the president and his party retain a strong hold over rural America, potentially limiting the map on which Democrats can compete next year.Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, said that the outcome in Montana had come as little surprise, and that he took heart that it was \u201cnot an easy struggle\u201d for Republicans to retain a normally safe seat.But Mr. Crowley said that his party\u2019s approach to competing in rural areas was a work in progress, and that Democrats were still honing a positive message on the economy and jobs ahead of the 2018 campaign.\u201cWhat it says is we can be competitive in rural districts in states like Montana,\u201d Mr. Crowley said of the special election, adding: \u201cWith the right candidate, with the right resources.\u201dThe first element of that formula was on the minds of many Democrats on Friday, looking back at the avalanche of opposition research Republicans used against Mr. Quist as a sign that party leaders need to intervene more in primaries to ensure better candidates.\u201cI\u2019m for grass-roots politics, but if you\u2019re going to actually win seats, you need to focus on helping candidates who will be the most potent for the general election,\u201d said David Axelrod, the veteran Democratic strategist, holding up Mr. Ossoff as an example of someone party officials had coalesced around early. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons there\u2019s a competitive race there now.\u201dNational Democratic strategists were deeply skeptical of Mr. Quist from the outset: The party\u2019s campaign committee and House Majority PAC, a Democratic \u201csuper PAC,\u201d dedicated only modest sums to the contest. Both groups faced harsh criticism from the left for holding back while Republican groups pounded Mr. Quist early in the race, driving up his personal unpopularity and effectively disqualifying him in the eyes of many voters.But by not finishing more closely, Mr. Quist mitigated the postelection grumbling on the left. Two groups that had stoked enthusiasm for him \u2014 Our Revolution, a committee backed by Senator Bernie Sanders, and Democracy for America, a grass-roots liberal organization \u2014 applauded Mr. Quist for his effort but declined to fan grievances against the Democratic Party establishment.The party will face a more telling test of its favored strategy on June 20 in the Georgia runoff. Democrats are more optimistic about that contest, and the Montana defeat increases pressure on the party to deliver a special election victory at last.\u201cThat race becomes more of an actual test of what might happen in 2018,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.The good news for Democrats is that Republicans will be unable to replicate across the map next year the kind of multimillion-dollar spending blitzes they have mounted in this year\u2019s special elections.Yet while it may be possible for Democrats to win control of the House without staking their fortunes on states and districts like Montana\u2019s at-large congressional seat, the implications of being less competitive in rural precincts could have graver consequences in the Senate, where Democrats are defending a cluster of seats in conservative, sparsely populated states \u2014 including Montana.\u201cDemocrats have to compete in Western states and rural areas,\u201d said Tom Lopach, a Democratic strategist and former chief of staff to Mr. Tester. \u201cFor Democrats to have a governing majority, they have to listen to folks in rural America.\u201dMr. Lopach, who led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2016, said that writing off rural voters would be a betrayal of \u201cour governing philosophy of standing up for working folks and all Americans.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Bozeman, Mont., and Alexander Burns from New York.Advertisement"}

Brexit\u2019s advocates rarely pass up an opportunity to claim that the European Union economy is the world\u2019s weak link, and that Britain\u2019s reformed, dynamic and flexible economy has little to risk, and much to gain, from leaving it.

As the chart below shows, British economic growth between 2000 and 2015 lagged behind Spain and Germany.And in 2015 Britain ranks only slightly ahead of France, a country that has become synonymous in Britain with economic weakness.Sustainable increases in living standards require economies to combine land, labor, capital and technology in more efficient ways; Britain has made a poor job of this, helping to explain why Britons\u2019 wages have risen by much less than their French and German counterparts over the last 15 years.It also explains why Brits have to work longer hours than the French or the Germans to earn a comparable income, as the chart below shows.If the country\u2019s overall performance looks mediocre, note that it is also highly skewed by London and the southeast of England. In one of the most politically centralized democracies in the world, regions as economically diverse as the northeast of England and London are essentially run as if they face the same challenges, and, Scotland aside, those regions have scant scope to tailor policies to their particular needs. This is part of the reason why, since 2000, poorer regions of Britain have not been catching up with the richer regions of the European Union. Instead, they\u2019ve been falling further behind.So, why has the country\u2019s performance been so poor? The British government overdid austerity between 2010-12, but not by as much as the Germans, Italians or Spanish and by about the same as the French. And there is no evidence that government borrowing is \u201ccrowding out\u201d private sector investment by taking up too much of the available financing: interest rates are extremely low, pointing to a surfeit of savings over profitable investment opportunities.That leaves supply-side failures. Britain is generally perceived as a liberalized economy, and by some measures of labor market performance this is no doubt true: Non-wage labor costs, such as employer contributions, are low and it is easy to lay off workers, which reduces the costs of taking them on in the first place. But a successful labor market requires more than easy hiring and firing; it needs skilled workers, access to housing and good quality infrastructure. By these measures Britain has some real weaknesses.A significantly higher proportion of British 18- to 24-year-olds suffer from weak literacy and numeracy than those in France, Germany, Italy or Spain.And, despite strong population growth and rapid price increases, Britain is building around half as many houses as in the 1970s, and the supply of subsidised (or social) housing has pretty much dried up, making it difficult for many British workers to move to where the jobs are.Good infrastructure increases productivity by raising the return on investment and boosting foreign trade and can play a major role in addressing regional disparities. But, as the chart below shows, the country has invested less in roads, railways and air travel than other large European Union economies over the last 20 years.A Britain outside of the European Union will inevitably be less open to trade with member states, which will curb competition and productivity growth. Tax revenues will fall, further squeezing infrastructure investment and education spending. That\u2019s why, far from liberating Britain to conquer world markets as a buccaneering trading nation, Brexit threatens to make its mediocre economic performance even worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Profits From Store-Branded Credit Cards Hide Depth of Retailers\u2019 Troubles", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byDepartment stores and big name retailers are increasingly making the hard sell to sign up customers for credit cards at the register. The store cards promise deep discounts on clothing, furniture and electronics, and are tough for shoppers to resist.For some retailers, those credit cards are not just a sales tool, but also an essential way to bolster their struggling businesses \u2014 a trend that has worrisome implications for the industry and its customers.Weak consumer spending, digital competition and changing shopping habits have already roiled retailers. In recent months, the industry has shed tens of thousands of workers, making it one of the job market\u2019s weakest links. Macy\u2019s reported a sharp drop in earnings on Thursday, sending its stock spiraling and dragging down the rest of the industry.But the businesses may be in worse shape than they appear, since store cards are a shaky foundation. If more consumers fall behind on their payments, the profits could dry up, intensifying retailers\u2019 troubles.At Macy\u2019s, the money from branded credit cards accounted for 39 percent of the company\u2019s total profit of $1.9 billion last year, up from 26 percent in 2013, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley. Bloomingdale\u2019s, which is owned by Macy\u2019s, has pushed to increase the number of credit card customers that workers are expected to sign up each month, according to the store workers\u2019 union.At Kohl\u2019s, the profit from plastic totaled 35 percent, up from 23 percent, over that same period. At Target, it made up 13 percent of total earnings, up from 11 percent in 2013.Amazon, by comparison, derives only about 3 percent of its total operating profit from its credit cards.The cracks are starting to show. As signs of customer distress rise, one major lender, Synchrony Financial, which handles the credit cards for stores like Sam\u2019s Club, Gap and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, is now setting aside more money for bad loans.\u201cInvestors may not appreciate the magnitude of the retailers\u2019 stress because of the store card income stream,\u201d said Kimberly Greenberger, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley.J. Crew offers card holders 15 percent off their first purchase, while Home Depot offers one year of \u201chassle-free\u201d returns for card holders. A Macy\u2019s card offers savings of up to $100 for a two-day shopping spree.At first the cards can seem appealing to customers with limited budgets, allowing them to finance purchases they might not otherwise be able to afford. But the retailers make much of their money on interest charges, so they are counting on many customers going into debt.\u201cThese stores are propping up their failing businesses on the backs of lower-middle-class people,\u201d said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in New York, whose clients often have rung up thousands of dollars in debt on retail cards.Lillian Esposito, of Queens, accumulated at least 10 different credit cards, including ones from Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Walmart. The mother of two young boys, she used them to buy school supplies and Christmas gifts, taking advantage of store discounts on the cards.But any savings quickly evaporate when borrowers cannot pay off their bills right away.As Ms. Esposito watched her balances grow every month, she calculated paying $25 on interest for every $100 she spent. And she fell behind on some payments.She has since sworn off big retailers. \u201cNever again,\u201d said Ms. Esposito.Synchrony Financial, which issued some of Ms. Esposito\u2019s cards, declined to comment on her experience. But Samuel Wang, a spokesman for Synchrony, said the company underwrote \u201cin a way that takes into account a customer\u2019s ability to pay\u201d and encouraged customers in distress to contact the lender \u201cso we can help address their situation.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said in a statement the terms of its cards were similar to others.In some cases, customers end up owing more in interest than the original bill. Many store cards carry rates around 30 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s like fool\u2019s gold,\u201d said Bryan Hall, who lives in the Bronx.Mr. Hall, 48, charged thousands of dollars on cards from P. C. Richard, Best Buy and Kay Jewelers, for an iPad, a 46-inch television and a ring for a friend who was getting married. He then sold off items he bought to pay his rent and keep his car on the road. He stopped making payments on several cards.Kay Jewelers and Best Buy declined to comment on Mr. Hall. P. C. Richard did not respond to requests for comment.The payoff for employees is low. Workers at some stores earn as little as $1 for each new account they open, and the discounts that their customers get for signing up for a card also cut into the employees\u2019 sales commissions.A company spokeswoman, Cheryl Heinonen, said credit card enrollments are only one aspect of how employees are evaluated, but declined to discuss the confidential negotiations.Ms. Heinonen added that the company was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with its store cards, noting that card holders were among Macy\u2019s \u201cmost loyal and happiest customers.\u201d Citigroup, which issues the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s cards, declined to comment.Credit card profits could prove a fleeting lifeline for retailers. When customers fall behind or default, the banks are likely to clamp down on extending new cards, meaning that source of income for retailers can quickly evaporate.Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, said credit card profits were a \u201ctemporary subsidy\u201d that the industry could not count on over the long term.The problems are already starting to appear.Among the company\u2019s struggling borrowers was Jose Luis Garcia, a 75-year-old whose only income is from Social Security.Last August, Mr. Garcia went into a furniture dealer on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn planning to buy a box spring for $100 in cash. But after the aggressive sales pitch, he came out with a full bed set, totaling $2,041, including delivery. The purchase was charged to a Synchrony card, which he says he never wanted.Unable to keep up with interest payments of 29.99 percent, Mr. Garcia sought legal assistance from New Economy Project, a nonprofit group that helps low-income New Yorkers. After an inquiry from The New York Times, Synchrony said it looked into the matter and forgave his debt.\u201cThey took me for an idiot,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Whether you\u2019re a lifelong NYC resident who wants to move up into new digs or you live overseas and are looking for a change of scenery, everyone expects a dazzling range of options for entertainment, culture and cuisine when they consider buying a home.But beyond glitz-and-glamour, it\u2019s the people and experiences that make NYC neighborhoods unique. In fact, if you\u2019re a potential homebuyer, chances are you value these as much as high-end condo finishes and renovated bathrooms.Roschel Stearns, a licensed real estate agent in New York, says homebuyers aren\u2019t just looking for the hustle and bustle of the city. Instead, they\u2019re often focused on finding a \u201clivable feel in a neighborhood that will distinguish it from the busiest sections of the city.\u201dTriBeCa, the Upper East Side and Chelsea are three of the most sought-after neighborhoods in New York City\u2014 for homebuyers who want to purchase their first home to those looking to trade up. The people, places and features in these neighborhoods make them special for a variety of buyers.Artists and financial types might not be two groups you\u2019d rush to put together, but they both live happily in TriBeCa, a neighborhood in southwest NYC whose name is an acronym for \u201cTriangle Below Canal Street,\u201d an apt descriptor of its ideal placement in the city. You can find many of them mingling together while enjoying a cocktail or brunch at the nearby Beekman Hotel, which offers luxury accommodations in a landmark 19th-century building. Its stunning nine-story atrium has original cast-iron work along with two restaurants, including Top Chef star Tom Colicchio\u2019s Fowler and Wells.\u201cThere\u2019s a mix of business people, families, tourists,\u201d said Alex DiGregorio, sales coordinator at the hotel. \u201cWe get a lot of locals come in regularly; so much so that the concierge will know and say hi to the kids of some of the families.\u201dThe reason you\u2019ll find so many residents with differing backgrounds in TriBeCa? It comes down to the old standard real estate consideration for both groups: location, location, location. The art crowd appreciates the open spaces in converted warehouses where they can live and set up their studios; the bankers and stockbrokers enjoy the short commute to their offices in the Financial District.New developments along the Hudson are attracting a diverse group of residents, people who want to be in the thick of things without necessarily being reminded that they're in the middle of everything. They enjoy the less-crowded feel of the neighborhood, as well as leafy parks and the bike path and walkway along the river. They also enjoy the elegant old buildings with ornate ironwork that stand next to brownstones and refurbished factory spaces.Families are drawn to the good public schools, and everyone can appreciate the galleries and cultural offerings, such as the offbeat Mmuseumm, with its unusual exhibits and events.D\u2019Alessio works with people interested in obtaining a home and guides them through the entire mortgage process \u2014 which can be particularly complex in NYC, from pre-approval to closing. He has helped over 1,000 people finance homes, including those who have no U.S. credit history.He says he loves the neighborhood he works in: \u201cI started my first job in TriBeCa, and this neighborhood really has not changed since then, and that\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d he says.The  first public space acquired by the city specifically for use as a public park.The park features a 114-foot fountain designed by a local artist.A public park that features a basketball court, tennis court, a community garden and a gazebo.It\u2019s hard to believe that only 160 or so years ago this whole area was yet to be developed. First came rows of brownstones, then the mansions for the rich along the avenues, followed around 1910 by tall luxury apartment blocks. The Frick Collection, one of the pre-eminent small art museums in the U.S., is a testament to the early era of the Upper East Side: Henry Frick built his mansion in the early 1900s, with the intent that it would someday become the public museum it is today with a high-quality collection of paintings and fine furniture.Like Frick, many of America\u2019s wealthiest families chose the Upper East Side as their home: Your neighbors might have been Roosevelts, Rockefellers and Carnegies. And Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the New York City mayor since 1799, is on the most eastern end of the neighborhood.History is still to be found \u2014 indeed, the neighborhood has its own Historic District \u2014 but it\u2019s a thoroughly modern section of the city. Kemp Minifie, a personal kitchen coach and private chef, is an Upper East Side stalwart. She\u2019s watched the neighborhood change from its old German roots (\u201cAll that\u2019s left is the Schaller & Weber butcher shop and the Bavarian Inn\u201d) to a hub with a more cosmopolitan feel. Yet, she says one thing remains the same: \u201cIt\u2019s still a neighborhood, with lots of families and kids.\u201dIn fact, if you want to feel connected to the rest of the city but also at home in the heart of your vibrant community, the Upper East Side might be perfect for you. The neighborhood boasts luxury doorman buildings, upscale townhouses and top-end towers, but if you head toward the East River, away from the famous Museum Mile and millionaire homes, you can often find more affordable apartments and a youthful vibe.\u201cThe UES has a little bit of something for everyone,\u201d says Neal Blangiardo, who\u2019s been living in the neighborhood for nearly a decade with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cYou have billionaire row to affordable apartments, old and new, culture and cuisine. And food-wise, you can get everything under the sun, from Taiwanese to Sicilian to Ethiopian. It\u2019s the kind of place you can go to a modern-day speakeasy and have a drink that was invented in the 1920s.\u201dHerb Glaser, who runs Glaser Bake Shop on First Avenue near 87th Street with his brother, says he\u2019s seen the neighborhood change over the years. Glaser has been working at the bakery for nearly 40 years. The shop, which has been open since 1902, has been in the family for three generations of Glasers.In the bakery, you can find reminders of the past: a notebook used to record bakery orders in the 1920s and Glaser\u2019s parents\u2019 wedding picture (of course, they\u2019re standing in front of a cake that was baked at Glaser).And to go along with the black-and-white photos, the bakery makes the ever-popular \u201cblack-and-white\u201d cookie with divided brown-and-white frosting on top. While the shop didn\u2019t invent the cookie, its customers fancy that it perfected the pastry, which  despite its \"cookie\" name resembles the batter of a cupcake.But the more things change, the more they stay the same. The black-and-white cookies have been one of the bakery\u2019s top sellers for years, and hundreds still fly off the shelves every day, from minis to regular to super-sized.The only museum in the U.S. devoted to historical and contemporary design.The home of a collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early Modern and contemporary art.One of the world's largest and finest art museums, with a collection that includes over 2 million works of art.A horn sounds as a cruise ship departs from its dock, reminding you that the Hudson is your neighbor on the west in this neighborhood. Steel trestles support repurposed elevated train lines running north to south through the heart of Chelsea, giving the neighborhood the nerve-center that\u2019s the High Line park and walkway. Visitors and locals alike stroll above the traffic below and survey the city from a unique perspective on this roughly 1.5-mile park.\u201cNo matter what the season, the High Line offers unparalleled cityscape views and a syncopation that sets the beat for the hood,\u201d says Tim Horan, who has lived in Chelsea for 25-plus years.The High Line is just one of the places that give a nod to the melding of Chelsea\u2019s past and present: Railroads played a big part in the development of Chelsea in the second half of the 19th century as factories, lumber yards and mills set up shop from 14th Street up to 59th and needed freight access.Today, old industrial buildings house many contemporary art galleries and shopping arcades, such as the new Terminal Stores and Chelsea Market, where you get a mixture of locals and tourists sipping wine during a weekly workshop at Corkbuzz Wine Studio or picking out fresh fare for dinner at The Lobster Place.Likewise, a series of piers along the Hudson that were originally a passenger ship terminal in the early 1900s now are used by Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex, which includes a health club, rock climbing wall, the city\u2019s largest gymnastics training center, two basketball courts and a multilevel golf driving range facing the water.Brett Leveridge is a longtime resident of Chelsea who appreciates the blending of old and new. \u201cAround the corner from me, there are wooden structures from the 19th century that still house restaurants and stores,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to imagine the establishments that have stood there over the years, not to mention the generations of people who lived above them.\u201dThe neighborhood\u2019s housing also is like a love song marrying its rich history with more modern inspiration. You can buy a wide-open, renovated warehouse loft, choose the contemporary elegance of a new doorman building or find an old-school Chelsea walk-up to keep you in shape (and more cash in your pocket).Horan appreciates the neighborhood for both its old charm and modern flavor, which includes a mix of fitness studios and bustling nightlife. He\u2019s right in the heart of things, living in what he describes as \u201cmy lovingly restored 1850 townhouse, with all of the right bones for urban life, including a south-facing garden, where I have just started keeping bees.\u201dA vintage mom-and-pop bakery-coffee shop has served classic doughnuts and pastries 24 hours a day, seven days a week, since 1964.During the summer months, this docked Coast Guard lightship on the Hudson is home to a vibrant bar scene.Serves dishes made with local ingredients in a trendy setting near the High Line.Disclosure: HSBC is not responsible for the content of this article.

{"Headline": "Macron and Merkel Meet, Pledging to Save European Unity", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 The new French president and the veteran German chancellor used their first engagement on Monday to declare their determination to salvage European unity now that France has beaten back the immediate risk from radical populism, which threatened to undo the European Union itself.Hundreds of onlookers, some waving European flags, cheered at the brief ceremony.The election of Mr. Macron now offers the bloc, but Ms. Merkel in particular, a chance to hit reset and for its core partners to press ahead with overhauls to save the decades-old project of economic and political comity that has preserved peace and prosperity on the Continent.No doubt mindful of those stakes, the two very different leaders \u2014 he a 39-year-old novice politician and former investment banker, she a 62-year-old scientist from Communist East Germany, in office since 2005 \u2014 immediately sat down to a first round of talks.At a 25-minute news conference, they both took pains to emphasize that they would cooperate, and that they understood what Mr. Macron called \u201cthe message of worry and anger\u201d expressed in the extremist vote in France\u2019s presidential election.Neither leader addressed the other by first name \u2014 it apparently being a little too early in their relationship to adopt that European Union custom. But each was scrupulously attentive to the other at what Ms. Merkel termed \u201ca very critical moment for the European Union.\u201dThe chancellor did not rule out European Union treaty changes if that proved necessary to push medium-term overhauls. But first \u201cwe will work on what we want to reform,\u201d she noted with a smile.Mr. Macron is the fourth French president Ms. Merkel has dealt with since taking office in 2005, and easily the youngest. The Frenchman was met at the airport by his friend Sigmar Gabriel, Ms. Merkel\u2019s vice chancellor and foreign minister, an unusual departure from protocol that highlighted the German\u2019s desire to push the chancellor into close cooperation with Mr. Macron.The French president quickly signaled on Monday how seriously he takes the relationship with Germany, appointing \u00c9douard Philippe, a 46-year-old conservative who is said to speak fluent German, as his prime minister. The announcement came shortly before the president left for Berlin, where the French ambassador, Philippe \u00c9tienne, will now become Mr. Macron\u2019s senior policy adviser.Ms. Merkel and her strong-willed finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, had indicated before Monday\u2019s important talks that they were ready to be flexible in attempts to address France\u2019s economic woes, and the chancellor emphasized that Germans must not act superior.\u201cWe should not sit like people who know it all better, but as friends, in partnership, and with great respect for each other,\u201d Ms. Merkel said Monday before the meeting.The inequality between prospering Germany and a more struggling France has marred Europe\u2019s key partnership in recent years. That puts the onus on Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel to find the kind of close cooperation the two say they seek.If they succeed, noted Thorsten Benner of the Global Public Policy Institute, a Berlin-based think tank, it is not just Mr. Macron and France that would benefit.For now, Mr. Benner said in an interview, it is enough that both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Sch\u00e4uble have signaled they are ready to be flexible and invest in programs to spur development. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble conceded in an interview with the weekly Der Spiegel that Germany\u2019s trade surplus \u2014 which Mr. Benner said stands at 35 billion euros, or about $38 billion, with France alone \u2014 is too high. \u201cIt was very important that Sch\u00e4uble sent that signal,\u201d he said.For her part, Ms. Merkel said last week that she had been ready in 2013 to contemplate a eurozone budget \u201cwith which to help countries who want to reform.\u201d\u201cHere we could add means to the funds we already have in order to temporarily help countries in this area,\u201d Ms. Merkel said at a business dinner in D\u00fcsseldorf. \u201cI would gladly develop concepts with Emmanuel Macron which can quickly bring hope to people who have no work.\u201dFirst, however, Mr. Macron needs as much support as he can find in France\u2019s legislative elections in June. Then, Ms. Merkel needs to win the fourth term she seeks in Germany\u2019s national elections in September.Mr. Gabriel, the Social Democrat vice chancellor, has pushed hard for Berlin to relax its stance on government spending and the shared euro currency.If a French leader has the courage to speak of a common budget for the eurozone, then Germany should also have the courage \u201cto think again about some firm positions in the currency and be open to a Franco-German compromise in the currency union,\u201d Mr. Gabriel wrote in a paper published in Der Spiegel and said by his Foreign Ministry to be genuine.The new scramble in Berlin to be seen as ready for change brought warnings not to try too much and then disappoint European voters once more.\u201cPragmatic modesty and patience are advisable,\u201d wrote Christoph von Marschall, the senior editor at the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel.\u201cSmall steps are necessary and possible,\u201d but anything ambitious that eats away at solidarity is more difficult, he said. \u201cThe challenge now is to preserve the good will and the \u00e9lan until they are really needed, in winter. Macron and Merkel must not begin with the prickly subjects.\u201dEurope \u201chas just survived a near-death experience,\u201d wrote a Merkel biographer, Stefan Kornelius of the German daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. \u201cThere will not be many more chances. France and Germany should take their time. They do not just need a plan. It must also work.\u201dAurelien Breeden and Beno\u00eet Morenne contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

Ackman, the billionaire investor who has had a two-year losing streak, described how he was \u201cextremely humbled\u201d by his losses. Mr. Scaramucci, who was interviewing him, said he empathized. \u201cUnfortunately, I have been there,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said.The lack of a clearly defined role did not stop Mr. Scaramucci, known as the Mooch, from continuing to angle for a role in the White House.\u201cI am ready to serve,\u201d he said in opening remarks at SALT on Wednesday. \u201cAnd so, to the extent the president needs me, I will be available to him.\u201dIn the absence of a new job, Mr. Scaramucci, in a rambling confessional before hundreds of hedge fund insiders, offered hints about his future.\u201cI remain loyal to the president and to the cause,\u201d he said, telling a story about shaking hands with people at a Trump rally in Albuquerque and learning about the economic desperation many Americans face.\u201cIt took a billionaire who lives in a tower on Fifth Avenue next to the Tiffany\u2019s jewelry store to show me something that I missed from my own neighborhood,\u201d he said, referring to his upbringing on Long Island, which he has described as a blue-collar community.Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s state of limbo is a stark turnaround for a man who, just months ago, seemed to be on the fast track to a senior role in the Trump administration.\u201cAnthony is an entrepreneur and a good man,\u201d said Leon G. Cooperman, a hedge fund manager. \u201cHe professionalized the industry, and SALT is the highlight of the industry.\u201dMr. Cooperman, who has addressed SALT panels in previous years but was not at the conference this year, said Mr. Scaramucci \u201cwould have been a good addition to the administration\u201d but added that Mr. Trump \u201chas already appointed many intelligent people.\u201dMr. Scaramucci, 53, did not reply to requests for comment.In what has become industry lore, he transformed SkyBridge from a small seeding business on the brink of failure to a large fund of funds by buying Citigroup\u2019s hedge fund business in early 2010, as the bank was trying to shed risky assets.A longtime Republican donor, Mr. Scaramucci supported a handful candidates, including Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, in the presidential primaries last year. Along the way, he accused Mr. Trump of being a \u201chack politician\u201d who had a \u201cbig mouth.\u201dMr. Trump had equally tart words for hedge fund managers, who he said were \u201cpaper pushers\u201d who were \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dBut as Mr. Trump\u2019s unlikely candidacy gained steam, Mr. Scaramucci began to defend him. At last year\u2019s SALT conference, he hosted Steven T. Mnuchin, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign finance chairman and now the Treasury secretary.Mr. Scaramucci arranged meet-and-greets between Mr. Mnuchin and some of the billionaire hedge fund managers in attendance. The men also shared a meal with Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund and other conference speakers. Mr. Griffin contributed $100,000 to President Trump\u2019s inauguration.Mr. Scaramucci raised significant sums for the Trump campaign and joined his inaugural committee.He said he was offered a job in the White House on Jan. 12. On Jan. 17, he announced that he had sold his stake in SkyBridge to a consortium led by HNA Capital and RON Transatlantic. As part of that sale, the SALT conference affiliated with SkyBridge was spun off to some of his former colleagues.The sale of Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge stake was meant to remove any entanglements that would have prevented him from serving in the administration. But it may have had the opposite effect.The timing of the deal raised concerns that the politically connected HNA was currying favor with an incoming White House official.The other buyer of Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s stake in SkyBridge, RON, is linked to a Venezuelan-born banker who was close to the administration of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Bloomberg recently reported.Mr. Scaramucci has said the deal will close and that he has already been paid for his share.But so far, he has been left out of the Trump White House.Instead, Mr. Scaramucci was back in Las Vegas for his ninth SALT event, a conference he started as a way to market his hedge fund firm. This year, the conference had 1,800 participants and speakers, including Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and William A. Ackman, the activist investor. Entertainment included concerts by the Gipsy Kings and Duran Duran.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here, to be honest,\u201d he said on Wednesday at the opening of the conference. \u201cI was offered a job by the administration. The job didn\u2019t materialize\u201c he added.Jeffrey S. Gerson, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who helped put together the deal that transformed SkyBridge in 2010, said he expected to hear about Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s next act soon.\u201cI\u2019ve known Anthony Scaramucci for a long time, and I know you\u2019d a fool to bet against him,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people would have given up on Wall Street after being fired from a firm like Goldman Sachs, but not Anthony. He pulled himself up by his bootstraps and basically said, \u2018I\u2019ll be the one who decides if I\u2019m successful or not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gerson added.At the conference, Mr. Scaramucci was also distributing copies of his book, \u201cHopping Over the Rabbit Hole.\u201d Stacks of the book were piled high on tables at the registration desks, and every participant received a guest bag containing a copy. Mr. Scaramucci said the book, which was published last year, was an international best seller.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can come into my basement, and I can show you every copy I had to buy to make it an international best seller.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.

The two spoke for hours about the future of driving as they walked from the Ferry Building in San Francisco to the Golden Gate Bridge five miles away, according to two people who were familiar with the executives and who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.The friendship developed into a partnership. Mr. Levandowski left Google last year to form Otto, a self-driving trucking start-up that Uber acquired months later for nearly $700 million. Mr. Kalanick subsequently appointed Mr. Levandowski to run Uber\u2019s autonomous-vehicle research.And that has set off the bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, which has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing trade secrets from Google.As an industry that values certainty, Wall Street appears to be troubled by the Trump administration.Cited in the article, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could stymie the president\u2019s legislative agenda, which includes Wall Street favorites like lower taxes and fewer regulations.One unidentified chief executive told Mr. Cohan, \u201cUnlike the rest of this stuff that is going on, which you can actually say, \u2018Uh, there he goes again,\u2019 like the ship in Korea going north instead of south, this is different. It feels different.\u201dStill, bankers express optimism that the Trump administration will be friendlier to Wall Street than previous governments.Mr. Maris said his fund, Section 32, had about $150 million under management and would invest in a variety of industries, including sectors like health care and agriculture technology.He said he had initially considered setting up a bigger fund but had changed his mind.\u201cThere was something about it that didn\u2019t feel entirely right,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople sometimes make the mistake of judging funds by size.\u201dMr. Maris is the sole general partner for now and will be operating the fund out of his home in San Diego.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at unprecedented opportunities that can have impact and can be at a scale that were not totally imaginable in the past,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pipelines and Donald Trump: British Columbia Goes to the Polls", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThese are the issues voters are talking about as British Columbia holds its election for the provincial legislative assembly on Tuesday.Bordered by the United States on two sides, British Columbia is home to Canada\u2019s fastest-growing economy and has its lowest unemployment rate. But much of that is potentially threatened by Mr. Trump\u2019s recently announced tariffs on lumber, which affect the province\u2019s booming forestry industry. And the campaigning demonstrates how Canada\u2019s trade dispute with the United States is seeping into domestic politics.Here is a look at the contenders, and some of the issues they are fighting over.The election pits the governing BC Liberal Party, which despite its name is conservative, against the New Democratic Party and, to a lesser extent, the more progressive Green Party.The New Democratic Party, which draws more strongly in urban and liberal areas, has promised to ban corporate and union donations, build more housing that is affordable for the middle class and raise taxes to pay for social programs in a province marked by rising economic inequality.It may all come down to the performance of a potential kingmaker, the Green Party, which is promising to double the province\u2019s tax on foreign buyers of Canadian property to 30 percent, cancel an oil pipeline to the coast that China desperately wants, and broaden environmental regulations.Much as in the United States, oil pipelines are a source of political conflict in British Columbia.Ms. Clark\u2019s government supported the pipeline after initially opposing it last year. The party received over $546,000 in political donations from Kinder Morgan, an oil company based in Houston; the province places no limits on political contributions.Housing prices in Vancouver have soared over the past decade to an average of $1.3 million for a single-family home (or about 1.8 million Canadian dollars at current exchange rates). Residents say offshore buyers are bidding prices up, prompting British Columbia\u2019s Liberal government last year to impose a 15 percent tax on those buyers, even though the party received nearly $13 million in political donations from property developers, its top source of contributions.While prices have come down a bit since then, homes still remain unaffordable for most middle-class residents, a problem worsened by a rental vacancy rate below 1 percent. The Liberals have no plans to build more affordable housing or to impose further taxes on overseas purchasers, while their opponents have promised to raise taxes on offshore and wealthy homeowners.Conflicts of interest are also an issue in BC politics. The province has some of the most lax political finance rules in all of Canada, allowing unlimited donations from corporations, unions and foreigners, a practice banned pretty much everywhere else in the country.\u201cI am not going to be a sucker for Donald Trump and accept the bad deals the Americans have offered us so far,\u201d she told wood pellet factory workers at a campaign stop late last month, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "13 Men, and No Women, Are Writing New G.O.P. Health Bill in Senate", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has a reputation as a shrewd tactician and a wily strategist \u2014 far more than his younger counterpart in the House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan.So the Senate majority leader\u2019s decision to create a 13-man working group on health care, including staunch conservatives and ardent foes of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but no women \u2014 has been widely seen on Capitol Hill as a move to placate the right as Congress decides the fate of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement.But Mr. McConnell, with only two votes to spare, could find that the Senate\u2019s more moderate voices will not be as easily assuaged as the House\u2019s when a repeal bill finally reaches a vote. Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana may prove less amenable to appeals for party unity and legislative success when the lives and health of their constituents are on the line.And certain issues, like efforts to reverse the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, are sure to receive more attention in the Senate than they got in the House. The prospect of higher premiums for older Americans living in rural areas will also loom larger in a chamber where Republicans from sparsely populated states hold outsize power.\u201cThis process will not be quick or simple or easy,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Monday.Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, suggested that the Senate would spend at least two months working on the legislation.The Senate Republican working group on health care includes the party\u2019s top leaders, as well as three committee chairmen and two of the most conservative senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to include himself and his top three lieutenants \u2014 but not Ms. Collins, Ms. Murkowski or more junior women Republicans like Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia \u2014 speaks volumes about his direction and has raised eyebrows.\u201cThe leaders have the right to choose whomever they wish,\u201d Ms. Collins said Monday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to work on health care.\u201cI\u2019ve worked on health care for many years,\u201d she continued. \u201cI spent five years in state government overseeing the Bureau of Insurance many years ago, and I think I can bring some experience to the debate that will be helpful.\u201dBy excluding Ms. Collins and Mr. Cassidy, perhaps viewed as potential troublemakers for the bill, Senate leaders may have inadvertently created a dangerous alliance. The two senators now have no obligation to fall in line behind the working group\u2019s final product and will almost surely continue to work on their own ideas. Together, they and their allies could hold near-veto power.Beyond neglecting Republican women, Senate Republican leaders overlooked Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black member of their conference. Before his congressional career, Mr. Scott sold insurance and owned one of the most successful Allstate insurance branches in South Carolina.Mr. McConnell also left out of the group the only two Republican senators clearly in the Democrats\u2019 cross hairs for 2018 \u2014 Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona. With re-election campaigns looming, they will have their own political calculus to make. Both states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, providing coverage to hundreds of thousands of people.Republicans, holding 52 seats in the Senate, can afford to lose only two members of their party on a vote to undo the health care law they have assailed for seven years. They will not receive any support from Democratic senators or the Senate\u2019s two independents, but they can count on support from Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie, if needed.\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee, said Monday. \u201cThe House bill isn\u2019t going to pass over here.\u2019\u2019Hospital executives, among the most outspoken critics of the House bill, are in town for the annual meeting of the American Hospital Association and will lobby the Senate this week. Thomas P. Nickels, an executive vice president of the association, predicted that the Senate would produce an \u201cutterly different version\u201d of the legislation.Mr. McConnell is likely to find the same tricky dynamic that Speaker Ryan confronted in the House: Any bill that satisfies conservatives like Mr. Cruz and Mr. Lee risks alienating moderates like Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski.Medicaid will also vex Republican leaders in the Senate in ways it did not in the House. Senators in both parties from states that have expanded the health care program for low-income people have expressed deep misgivings about the House bill, which essentially unravels the expansion.Democrats said the Republicans\u2019 failure to include women in the working group showed that they were politically clueless.The House bill would cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood for a year and prohibit the use of federal tax credits to buy insurance that includes coverage of abortion. It would also allow states to seek waivers of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that require insurers to cover maternity care.David Popp, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said on Monday that many Republicans were involved in devising a replacement for Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.\u201cSenators from throughout the conference have been working on solutions,\u201d Mr. Popp said. \u201cThose meetings and efforts continue.\u201dThe Republicans\u2019 working group includes Mr. McConnell and three other members of the Republican leadership: John Cornyn of Texas, the majority whip; John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference; and John Barrasso of Wyoming, the chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, who has been a point man for the party on health care.The group also includes three committee chairmen: Mr. Hatch; Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee; and Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, the head of the Budget Committee.The other senators in the Republican working group are from states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act: Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Rob Portman of Ohio and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania.The House bill would roll back the expansion of Medicaid, which has provided coverage to about 11 million people. The Congressional Budget Office said the bill\u2019s Medicaid changes would save more than $800 billion over 10 years.Savings would shrink if Congress allowed states to keep some or all of the Medicaid expansion.For several weeks, senators have been working on possible changes to the tax credits offered in the House bill to help people buy insurance. Mr. Thune, for example, is drafting a proposal that would make the tax credits more progressive.To people who do not have coverage at work or under a government program, the House bill would offer tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending on age. A family could receive up to $14,000 a year in credits. The credits would be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 a year and families over $150,000.Mr. Thune, not wanting to create a new middle-class entitlement, would like to provide more financial assistance to lower-income people and less to higher-income people.Senators are also focusing on the difficulty of administering the tax credits in the House bill, which could be used either inside or outside the public insurance marketplaces, or exchanges.Under the Affordable Care Act, the exchanges perform a vital role, determining whether consumers are eligible for premium tax credits, which, in most cases, are paid directly by the Treasury to insurance companies on their behalf. Under the House bill, consumers could get the tax credits without going through an exchange.The Internal Revenue Service has expressed concern. The House bill, it said, \u201cappears to greatly expand I.R.S.\u2019s current responsibilities\u201d and \u201ccould impose significant costs and administrative burden\u201d on the agency.Jennifer Steinhauer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Homeownership Became the Engine of American Inequality", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "FeatureAn enormous entitlement in the tax code props up home prices \u2014 and overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy and the upper middle class.Supported byTwo years ago, the couple bought a new home. Set on a half-acre lot that backs up to conservation land in Milton, Mass., the 2,350-square-foot split-level has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open-concept kitchen and dining area, a finished basement, hardwood floors and beautiful touches throughout, like the Tennessee marble fireplace and hearth. It cost $665,000. \u201cThis is the nicest house I\u2019ve ever lived in,\u201d Asare told me.Asare and Jean-Charles have four children and earn roughly $290,000 a year, which puts them in the top 5 percent of household incomes in the country. After renting for the first years of their marriage, they participated in a home buyers\u2019 program administered by the nonprofit Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. The program allowed Asare and Jean-Charles to purchase their first home in 2009 for $360,000 with a 10 percent down payment, half of what is typically required. In 2015, they sold it for $430,000. There is a reason so many Americans choose to develop their net worth through homeownership: It is a proven wealth builder and savings compeller. The average homeowner boasts a net worth ($195,400) that is 36 times that of the average renter ($5,400).Asare serves on the advisory board for HomeStart, a nonprofit focused on ending and preventing homelessness. Like most organizations, HomeStart is made up of people at various rungs on the economic ladder. Asare sits near the top; his salary exceeds that of anyone on staff at the nonprofit he helps advise. When Crisaliz Diaz was a staff member at HomeStart, she was at the other end of the ladder. She earned $38,000 a year, putting her near the bottom third of American household incomes. A 26-year-old Latina with thick-rimmed glasses, Diaz rents a small two-bedroom apartment in Braintree, Mass., an outer suburb of Boston. Her two sons, Xzayvior and Mayson \u2014 Zay and May, she calls them \u2014 share a room plastered with Lego posters and Mickey Mouse stickers. Her apartment is spare and clean, with ceiling tiles you can push up and views of the parking lot and busy street.When Diaz moved in four years ago, the rent was $1,195 a month, heat included, but her landlord has since raised the rent to $1,385 a month, which takes 44 percent of her paycheck. Even with child-support payments and side jobs, she still doesn\u2019t bring in enough to pay her regular bills. She goes without a savings account and regularly relies on credit cards to buy toilet paper and soap. \u201cThere\u2019s no stop to it,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s just a consistent thing.\u201dDiaz receives no housing assistance. She has applied to several programs, but nothing has come through. The last time Boston accepted new applications for rental-assistance Section 8 vouchers was nine years ago, when for a few precious weeks you were allowed to place your name on a very long waiting list. Boston is not atypical in that way. In Los Angeles, the estimated wait time for a Section 8 voucher is 11 years. In Washington, the waiting list for housing vouchers is closed indefinitely, and over 40,000 people have applied for public housing alone. While many Americans assume that most poor families live in subsidized housing, the opposite is true; nationwide, only one in four households that qualifies for rental assistance receives it. Most are like Diaz, struggling without government help in the private rental market, where housing costs claim larger and larger chunks of their income.Almost a decade removed from the foreclosure crisis that began in 2008, the nation is facing one of the worst affordable-housing shortages in generations. The standard of \u201caffordable\u201d housing is that which costs roughly 30 percent or less of a family\u2019s income. Because of rising housing costs and stagnant wages, slightly more than half of all poor renting families in the country spend more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs, and at least one in four spends more than 70 percent. Yet America\u2019s national housing policy gives affluent homeowners large benefits; middle-class homeowners, smaller benefits; and most renters, who are disproportionately poor, nothing. It is difficult to think of another social policy that more successfully multiplies America\u2019s inequality in such a sweeping fashion.Consider Asare and Diaz. As a homeowner, Asare benefits from tax breaks that Diaz does not, the biggest being the mortgage-interest deduction \u2014 or MID, in wonk-speak. All homeowners in America may deduct mortgage interest on their first and second homes. In 2015, Asare and Jean-Charles claimed $21,686 in home interest and other real estate deductions, which saved them $470 a month. That\u2019s roughly 15 percent of Diaz\u2019s monthly income. That same year, the federal government dedicated nearly $134 billion to homeowner subsidies. The MID accounted for the biggest chunk of the total, $71 billion, with real estate tax deductions, capital gains exclusions and other expenditures accounting for the rest. That number, $134 billion, was larger than the entire budgets of the Departments of Education, Justice and Energy combined for that year. It is a figure that exceeds half the entire gross domestic product of countries like Chile, New Zealand and Portugal.Recently, Gary Cohn, the chief economic adviser to President Trump, heralded his boss\u2019s first tax plan as a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big.\u201d And indeed, Trump\u2019s plan represents a radical transformation in how we will fund the government, with its biggest winners being corporations and wealthy families. But no one in his administration, and only a small (albeit growing) group of people in either party, is pushing to reform what may very well be the most regressive piece of social policy in America. Perhaps that\u2019s because the mortgage-interest deduction overwhelmingly benefits the sorts of upper-middle-class voters who make up the donor base of both parties and who generally fail to acknowledge themselves to be beneficiaries of federal largess. \u201cToday, as in the past,\u201d writes the historian Molly Michelmore in her book \u201cTax and Spend,\u201d \u201cmost of the recipients of federal aid are not the suspect \u2018welfare queens\u2019 of the popular imagination but rather middle-class homeowners, salaried professionals and retirees.\u201d A 15-story public housing tower and a mortgaged suburban home are both government-subsidized, but only one looks (and feels) that way. It is only by recognizing this fact that we can begin to understand why there is so much poverty in the United States today.The MID came into being in 1913, not to spur homeownership but simply as part of a general policy allowing businesses to deduct interest payments from loans. At that time, most Americans didn\u2019t own their homes and only the rich paid income tax, so the effects of the mortgage deduction on the nation\u2019s tax proceeds were fairly trivial. That began to change in the second half of the 20th century, though, because of two huge transformations in American life. First, income tax was converted from an elite tax to a mass tax: In 1932, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (precursor to the I.R.S.) processed fewer than two million individual tax returns, but 11 years later, it processed over 40 million. At the same time, the federal government began subsidizing homeownership through large-scale initiatives like the G.I. Bill and mortgage insurance. Homeownership grew rapidly in the postwar period, and so did the MID.By the time policy makers realized how extravagant the MID had become, it was too late to do much about it without facing significant backlash. Millions of voters had begun to count on getting that money back. Even President Ronald Reagan, who oversaw drastic cuts to housing programs benefiting low-income Americans, let the MID be. Subsequent politicians followed suit, often eager to discuss reforms to Social Security and Medicare but reluctant to touch the MID, even as the program continued to grow more costly: By 2019, MID expenditures are expected to exceed $96 billion.\u201cOnce we\u2019re in a world with a MID,\u201d says Todd Sinai, a professor of real estate and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, \u201cit is very hard to get to a world without the MID.\u201d That\u2019s in part because the benefit helps to prop up home values. It\u2019s impossible to say how much, but a widely cited 1996 study estimated that eliminating the MID and property-tax deductions would result in a 13 to 17 percent reduction in housing prices nationwide, though that estimate varies widely by region and more recent analyses have found smaller effects. The MID allows home buyers to collect more after-tax savings if they take on more mortgage debt, which incentivizes them to pay more for properties than they could have otherwise. By inflating home values, the MID benefits Americans who already own homes \u2014 and makes joining their ranks harder.The owner-renter divide is as salient as any other in this nation, and this divide is a historical result of statecraft designed to protect and promote inequality. Ours was not always a nation of homeowners; the New Deal fashioned it so, particularly through the G.I. Bill of Rights. The G.I. Bill was enormous, consuming 15 percent of the federal budget in 1948, and remains unmatched by any other single social policy in the scope and depth of its provisions, which included things like college tuition benefits and small-business loans. The G.I. Bill brought a rollout of veterans\u2019 mortgages, padded with modest interest rates and down payments waived for loans up to 30 years. Returning soldiers lined up and bought new homes by the millions. In the years immediately following World War II, veterans\u2019 mortgages accounted for over 40 percent of all home loans.But both in its design and its application, the G.I. Bill excluded a large number of citizens. To get the New Deal through Congress, Franklin Roosevelt needed to appease the Southern arm of the Democratic Party. So he acquiesced when Congress blocked many nonwhites, particularly African-Americans, from accessing his newly created ladders of opportunity. Farm work, housekeeping and other jobs disproportionately staffed by African-Americans were omitted from programs like Social Security and unemployment insurance. Local Veterans Affairs centers and other entities loyal to Jim Crow did their parts as well, systematically denying nonwhite veterans access to the G.I. Bill. If those veterans got past the V.A., they still had to contend with the banks, which denied loan applications in nonwhite neighborhoods because the Federal Housing Administration refused to insure mortgages there. From 1934 to 1968, the official F.H.A. policy of redlining made homeownership virtually impossible in black communities. \u201cThe consequences proved profound,\u201d writes the historian Ira Katznelson in his perfectly titled book, \u201cWhen Affirmative Action Was White.\u201d \u201cBy 1984, when G.I. Bill mortgages had mainly matured, the median white household had a net worth of $39,135; the comparable figure for black households was only $3,397, or just 9 percent of white holdings. Most of this difference was accounted for by the absence of homeownership.\u201dThis legacy has been passed down to subsequent generations. Today a majority of first-time home buyers get down-payment help from their parents; many of those parents pitch in by refinancing their own homes. As black homeowners, Asare and Jean-Charles are exceptions to the national trend: While most white families own a home, a majority of black and Latino families do not. Differences in homeownership rates remain the prime driver of the nation\u2019s racial wealth gap. In 2011, the median white household had a net worth of $111,146, compared with $7,113 for the median black household and $8,348 for the median Hispanic household. If black and Hispanic families owned homes at rates similar to whites, the racial wealth gap would be reduced by almost a third.Racial exclusion was Roosevelt\u2019s first concession to pass the New Deal; his second, to avoid a tax revolt, was to rely on regressive and largely hidden payroll taxes to fund generous social-welfare programs. A result, the historian Michelmore observes, is that we \u201cnever asked ordinary taxpayers to pay for the economic security many soon came to expect as a matter of right.\u201d In providing millions of middle-class families stealth benefits, the American government rendered itself invisible to those families, who soon came to see their success as wholly self-made. We forgot because we were not meant to remember.Set on a quiet street in Winthrop, a community hemmed in by Logan Airport on one side and the Atlantic on the other, the condo features two bedrooms, a square kitchen with white cupboards, a television room and \u201cthe quiet room,\u201d with hanging plants, guitars mounted on the wall and a large bay window. From the small back patio, the ocean is close enough to smell. The mortgage and property-tax bills are about $915 a month, and the monthly condo fee is $368, which includes expensive flood insurance. Even counting utilities, Wisniewski and Kristof spend about 22 percent of their combined income on housing costs. With what\u2019s left over, they buy items for their son, take vacations and enjoy local restaurants. \u201cWe definitely feel comfortable,\u201d Wisniewski told me.Before moving into his condo, Wisniewski rented an apartment in urban Somerville for $1,500 a month, splitting it with a roommate. If he had continued to rent, Wisniewski would have had steeper monthly payments that would have only accelerated in subsequent years; and none of that money would have contributed to his young family\u2019s nest egg.In 2015, Wisniewski deducted $4,789 of mortgage interest, which means he saved $39 a month. (He didn\u2019t take the deduction for 2016 because once he was married, the standard deduction was larger.) That\u2019s a pittance compared with what Asare and Jean-Charles saved, for an obvious reason: They claim a bigger deduction because they have a bigger mortgage. And they could get a bigger mortgage because they have a bigger income. This is one reason taxpayers on the coasts, where incomes and property costs are higher, typically benefit much more from the MID. The per capita MID claim for residents of Maryland and the District of Columbia, for example, is three times what it is for families living in West Virginia and Mississippi.There is another reason most MID benefits accrue to the top, even among homeowners: You have to itemize your deductions to claim it. Most taxpayers don\u2019t bother because they don\u2019t make enough money to justify the hassle. In 2014, 1.5 million households earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year claimed the MID, receiving an average benefit of $14 a month. That same year, 6.5 million households with earnings above $200,000 claimed the MID and enjoyed an average benefit of $391 a month. What this means in aggregate is that households with at least six-figure incomes receive more than four-fifths of the total value of mortgage interest and property-tax deductions.Wisniewski benefits from the MID, but it didn\u2019t help him buy his condo. The biggest barrier to buying a first home is saving enough for a down payment, a problem the MID does not solve. Wisniewski\u2019s parents pitched in $5,000, and he secured additional financing through ONE Mortgage, a program offered by the Massachusetts Housing Partnership for first-time home buyers. Wisniewski didn\u2019t really consider homeowner tax breaks when shopping for his home. Defenders of the MID began arguing that it encouraged homeownership after the benefit was popularized, but numerous studies have found no support for this claim. For example, a 2002 paper by the economists Edward Glaeser and Jesse Shapiro showed that while the value of the deduction had fluctuated significantly with inflation since 1960, homeownership rates had remained more or less unchanged. \u201cThe home mortgage interest deduction,\u201d the authors write, \u201cis a particularly poor instrument for encouraging homeownership since it is targeted at the wealthy, who are almost always homeowners.\u201d Glaeser later confirmed unequivocally that these patterns hold true today.So why do we keep this \u201cpoor instrument\u201d around, if the overarching goal of American federal housing policy is to create a nation of homeowners? Perhaps because the MID enjoys entrenched, unyielding support from a powerful real estate lobby. We often discuss the influence of the gun and pharmaceutical lobbies, but the real estate lobby has spent much more than either group. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the National Association of Realtors spent $64.8 million in lobbying efforts in 2016, making it second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in terms of dollars spent. And to 1.2 million Realtors, the mortgage-interest deduction is nonnegotiable. The association calls it a \u201cremarkably effective tool that facilitates homeownership.\u201d Jerry Howard, the chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders, refers to the MID as \u201cone of the cornerstones of American housing policy.\u201d Of course, industry groups have a responsibility to their members, who enjoy profiting from a government subsidy that increases the prices of homes they build and sell.William Brown, the president of the Realtor association, said his members \u201caren\u2019t shy about making their voices heard\u201d to preserve the status quo. No, they are not \u2014 and Washington has listened. After the Republican-led Ways and Means Committee proposed modifications to the MID in a draft of the Tax Reform Act of 2014, the association issued a statement saying it was \u201cextremely disappointed.\u201d The act did not propose to eliminate the MID but simply to cap the amount of deductible mortgage debt at $500,000, as opposed to the current cap of $1 million. (Second mortgages are capped at $100,000.) The only reason the MID is capped at all is because of the \u201cimmaculate conception provision\u201d in the 1987 budget reconciliation bill, so named because the initiator of this provision, probably out of a desire stay gainfully employed in government, never took credit for it. It was the only time in its 104-year history that the MID has been altered.Yentel\u2019s coalition supports the idea of lowering the size of deductible mortgage debt to $500,000 and reallocating the savings to housing assistance for low-income families. \u201cThe solution is so obvious,\u201d Yentel says. \u201cThere are a number of programs that have proven success in ending homelessness and ending housing insecurity.\u201d The problem is not in the policies\u2019 prescriptions but in their dosage: We severely underfund programs that work. By one estimate, capping the MID at $500,000 would save $87 billion over 10 years, even though less than 6 percent of mortgages nationwide exceed half a million dollars. That savings would allow 1.2 million additional families to benefit from housing vouchers.Of course, reforming the MID is one thing. Redirecting the savings to low-income families is quite another. \u201cThe much bigger hurdle,\u201d Yentel says, \u201cis making sure that dollars are reaching affordable-housing programs.\u201d On this point, real estate lobbyists and affordable-housing advocates agree. \u201cThey want to cap it and put the savings in rental housing,\u201d says Joe Ventrone, the Realtor association\u2019s vice president for regulatory affairs. \u201cCrazy, because the Congress does not operate that way. It goes in to build a battleship.\u201dCapping the MID at $500,000 would have virtually no effect on homeownership rates. And according to the economist Glaeser, it would have only \u201cmodest effects on home prices\u201d in supply-constrained cities like San Francisco and virtually no effect in cities with plenty of available land, like Houston. \u201cMost homeowners wouldn\u2019t even feel it,\u201d Glaeser says, pointing out further that encouraging homeownership typically means moving people from multifamily buildings to single-family homes, which increases traffic congestion and pollution. But capping the MID at half a million dollars could cause properties in the $625,000 to $1.25 million range to drop in value.Would we be O.K. with that? Would we support reform that provided desperately needed housing relief to millions of low-income Americans if it meant that the net worth of those who owned expensive homes took a hit? The answer is almost certainly no, at least for owners of houses valued north of $500,000. Wealth granted by a bizarre government subsidy is still wealth, and once people have it, they\u2019d prefer to keep it. When it comes to public housing for the rich, it becomes hard to break the cycle of welfare dependency. It\u2019s why some Democratic leaders who represent districts with high housing prices, like Representative Nancy Pelosi (San Francisco) and Senator Chuck Schumer (New York), have been outspoken critics of MID reform, even if they are consistent backers of other equality-promoting initiatives.We tend to speak about the poor as if they didn\u2019t live in the same society, as if our gains and their losses weren\u2019t intertwined. Conservatives explain poverty by pointing to \u201cindividual factors,\u201d like bad decisions or the rise of single-parent families; liberals refer to \u201cstructural causes,\u201d like the decline of manufacturing or the historical legacies of racial discrimination. Usually pitted against each other, each perspective serves a similar function: letting us off the hook by asserting that there is a deep-rooted, troubling problem \u2014 more than one in six Americans does not make enough to afford basic necessities \u2014 that most of us bear no responsibility for.It\u2019s around this point that the conversation gets snagged in the weeds with questions about home prices, political ramifications or the administrative hurdles of reform \u2014 escape routes that allow us to lose sight of people like Cris Diaz, low-income renters who are not entitled to any housing assistance and who are giving most of their income to landlords and utility companies. To drive down poverty and promote economic mobility, the United States will need to make a major investment in affordable housing. You don\u2019t need to reform the MID to pay for that \u2014 there are plenty of other ways to raise revenue \u2014 but you have to pay for it somehow. Whatever our position on homeowner tax benefits, we should have an answer for people like Diaz.Trump\u2019s preliminary 2018 budget includes a 13.2 percent reduction to the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the elimination of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, cuts that will almost certainly result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of housing vouchers and leave more families rent-burdened and homeless. President Barack Obama\u2019s 2017 budget proposal estimated that it would take $1 billion a year over the next 10 years to eliminate family homelessness in America \u2014 not decrease it or slice it in half, but end it. That\u2019s less than 1 percent of what we currently spend on homeowner subsidies. And yet a bill designed to provide every child in America with a home was pronounced dead on arrival in Congress. Up to this point, bills proposing modest reforms to the mortgage-interest deduction have met the same fate.Poverty and homelessness are political creations. Their amelioration is within our grasp and budget. But those of us most likely to vote and contribute to political campaigns are least likely to support MID reform \u2014 either because it wouldn\u2019t affect our lives or because it would, by asking us to take less so that millions of Americans could be given the opportunity to climb out of poverty. It\u2019s just that we usually don\u2019t dial our elected officials when our less-fortunate neighbors are hurting, because we are not.And yet over the course of our history, there have been times when Americans embraced a politics of sacrifice. During World War II, families volunteered to pay more taxes, ration food and give blood to serve a higher purpose. And even today, in what can feel like an age of insecurity and self-preservation, some Americans have shown a willingness to take a personal financial hit to promote social mobility and equality. Take the people of Seattle: For 36 years, they have agreed to be taxed more to raise revenue for affordable-housing programs. Last August, 70 percent of Seattle voters agreed to the largest housing levy yet, one expected to raise $290 million over the next seven years. Contributions to the levy are based on home values; a family living in a $480,000 home (the city\u2019s median value in 2015) pays an additional $122 a year in taxes. With that money, Seattle will fund emergency rental assistance, loans to first-time home buyers and the construction of housing units that must remain affordable for at least 50 years. Previous housing levies have generated over 13,000 affordable apartment units and enabled 900 low-income families to buy homes. The 2016 Housing Levy will do more because the residents of Seattle decided to invest in economic diversity and residential stability, sacrificing a pinch to help those in need.Asare and Jean-Charles would welcome MID reform, even if it meant that they would have less in the bank at the end of the year. \u201cThere are people who sacrificed for me to be here,\u201d Asare told me. One of them was a boy named Chris Jackson, whom Asare met during his tormented years in the West Bridgewater school system. When Asare wouldn\u2019t fight back, Jackson, a fellow black student, would stick up for him. \u201cI watched him fight and fight, get into trouble,\u201d Asare remembers. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be like, \u2018No, stop.\u2019 But he wouldn\u2019t, because what was right was right.\u201d Asare paused to collect himself, a hand fingering the space above his freshly shaved head. \u201cThat kind of compassion, that kind of brotherhood, is what I would ask of people: that we don\u2019t give according to what people are willing to receive; we give according to the standard for what they should have.\u201dOnce a rarity in America, eviction has become commonplace in our cities, disrupting families, schools and entire neighborhoods. Forty people a day are evicted in Milwaukee; each day in New York City brings 60 marshal evictions. An eviction could plunge Diaz and her boys into homelessness and poverty. Studies have found that evicted families lose not only their homes but their jobs, possessions and neighbors too; they relocate to substandard housing in distressed communities; they have higher rates of depression and suicide. Even if poor families avoid eviction, they still suffer, because so much of their money goes to housing costs, forcing them to buy fewer school supplies, clothes, books \u2014 and food.In some markets, there are virtually no affordable units left. The median annual rent for a two-bedroom apartment is currently $39,600 in Boston, $49,200 in New York City and $54,720 in San Francisco. Families priced out of large cities have moved to smaller ones, and now those cities are experiencing some of the steepest rent increases in the nation. The poor used to live on the other side of the tracks. Now they live in different towns and counties entirely.And yet we continue to give the most help to those who least need it \u2014 affluent homeowners \u2014 while providing nothing to most rent-burdened tenants. If this is our design, our social contract, then we should at least own up to it; we should at least stand up and profess, \u201cYes, this is the kind of nation we want.\u201d Before us, there are two honest choices: We can endorse this inequality-maximizing arrangement, or we can reject it. What we cannot do is look a mother like Diaz in the face and say, \u201cWe\u2019d love to help you, but we just can\u2019t afford to.\u201d Because that is, quite simply, a lie.After her name was called, Diaz stepped outside the courtroom to talk with her landlord\u2019s attorney, a white man in wire glasses. She had secured emergency assistance from the state. It wasn\u2019t enough. But the lawyer told Diaz that if she \u201czeroed out\u201d by next month, paying all her back rent and April\u2019s rent in full, he would dismiss the case. Diaz wrote out a check for $583 \u2014 a start, and what amounted to $357 less than what Asare and Jean-Charles receive from the MID in two months \u2014 and raced back to work. In April, she was let go.Thinking about the long, hard road ahead for Diaz, I remembered a conversation I had with her six months earlier. Around her small dining table, Diaz and I had calculated her monthly budget, which left her with -$221 after all the bills were paid. The process seemed to reduce her to a sadder, emptied-out version of herself. \u201cEventually I\u2019m going to have to figure something out,\u201d she said softly, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a second job or a third job. I don\u2019t know.\u201dI looked down at my empty plate, smeared with tomato sauce from the meatball sub Diaz had made me. \u201cDo you know what the mortgage-interest deduction is?\u201d I asked.\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dAfter I explained what it is, she asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they spend it on lower-income housing?\u201d I shrugged. After a moment, I asked, \u201cWhat would you do if you only had to pay 30 percent of your income on rent?\u201dDiaz looked around. Her eyes paused on one of Zay\u2019s homework assignments stuck to the refrigerator. Titled \u201cSomeone Special,\u201d its words wiggled forward in a child\u2019s handwriting: \u201cMy mom is special because she helps me figure out addition and subtraction. We always cook together. We cook some spaghetti.\u201d On the other side of the fridge, held up by a clown-fish magnet, was a bill from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.\u201cThat would be life,\u201d she said.Matthew Desmond is the author of \u201cEvicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,\u201d which won a 2017 Pulitzer Prize.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loophole in Rules on Transgender Troops Denies 2 Their Commissions", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Not long after the Pentagon lifted its ban on transgender troops last year, a West Point cadet named Riley Dosh came out as a transgender woman. She figured she would transition while serving in the Army, as other transgender soldiers have done.\u201cAs cadets we\u2019re told not to hide,\u201d Ms. Dosh said. \u201cSo I felt it would be dishonest to continue hiding.\u201dBut coming out of hiding has carried a price. Ms. Dosh, 22, is one of two transgender cadets \u2014 the other is at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs \u2014 caught in a kind of military limbo. After four years of training to become officers, they are being denied their commissions because of a loophole in Pentagon policy that its chief author says he did not foresee.At issue are rules governing \u201caccessions\u201d \u2014 the military\u2019s term for accepting new recruits or officer candidates.Pentagon officials say the transgender policy, released in October, covers only those on active duty \u2014 not new recruits or new officer candidates. Each service, and each service academy, is expected to issue its own guidelines for accessions later this month, so that transgender people may enlist, or enroll in school, beginning July 1. The two cadets are being treated as new officer candidates.But Brad Carson, a former acting under secretary of defense who is the architect of the transgender policy, said its authors \u201cenvisioned that the same rules that apply to active-duty service members today would also apply to service academy personnel, because they\u2019re already in the military.\u201dMs. Dosh put it this way: \u201cWhy am I different than the numerous transgender officers enlisted who are already currently serving and have been allowed to transition?\u201dMr. Sprigg wrote that the policy \u201cmight actually make the military a magnet for people seeking \u2018gender reassignment\u2019 at taxpayer expense.\u201dA study by the RAND Corporation last year estimated that 2,450 of the 1.2 million active-duty members of the military are transgender, and that every year an estimated 65 would seek to transition to the other gender.Among them is Blake Dremann, 35, an active-duty Navy officer stationed at the Pentagon. He began his transition to male from female in 2013, he said, \u201cwell before the policy was remotely talked about.\u201d Since then, he has gone through a double mastectomy, while assigned to a submarine, and has had chest reconstruction surgery, paid for by the taxpayers under the new policy.\u201cThat\u2019s a big investment for the military to make on somebody, when they\u2019re just going to say, \u2018Go get a civilian job,\u2019\u201d said Matt Thorn, executive director of OutServe, an organization that provides legal services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members of the military. His organization is pressing Pentagon officials to reconsider their position.Ms. Dosh, who will graduate on Saturday, said she \u201ccame out to myself\u201d in April of last year, when she was a junior.She was hoping to begin transitioning while at West Point, but was told she would have to wait until she received her commission. She still wears a male uniform and keeps her hair cut short, as is required for male cadets, and said she had been told she cannot wear makeup.The superintendent of West Point, Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr., sought a \u201cmedical waiver\u201d from the Pentagon to allow Ms. Dosh her commission. But the request was denied, a Pentagon spokeswoman said, because Defense Department officials \u201cdid not think it appropriate\u201d to grant a waiver while the accessions policy was still under review.Both the Air Force cadet and Ms. Dosh are welcome to apply for civilian jobs; an Air Force Academy spokesman said officials there were \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d its cadet. Ms. Dosh, a math major, said her dream was to find work as a math teacher.\u201cThe Army is losing a good officer for bad reasons,\u201d said Sue Fulton, a member of the West Point Board of Visitors who has been an advocate for Ms. Dosh. \u201cIf Riley had lied about who she is, she would be pinning on her bars on Saturday.\u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary misidentified the service academy attended by one of the transgender cadets. As the article correctly notes, one cadet attended the Air Force Academy, and the other attended West Point.Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about transgender graduates at the military academies misstated the medical procedure being done by one of the graduates, Blake Dremann. He is transitioning from female to male, not the other way around.Follow Sheryl Gay Stolberg on Twitter @SherylNYTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Le Pen\u2019s Verbal \u2018Violence\u2019 in French Debate Shocks Observers", "Date": "2017-05-04", "News": "Supported byThe shock in the postdebate commentaries, in print and across the airwaves, was revealing: France had never witnessed such a brutal political confrontation in real time.The consensus was that, far from being the knockout blow Marine Le Pen needed and many anticipated, the result was the opposite. The candidate of the far-right National Front had not improved her already difficult position against the centrist former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.With her sneering mockery of Mr. Macron, her tone and her use of epithets, she had revealed something essential about herself despite years of effort to soften her party\u2019s image, in the view of commentators.\u201cI was myself surprised, as she revealed herself as what is worst about the far right in France,\u201d G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a veteran political scientist at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques, known as Sciences-Po, said in an interview.Even her own father, the National Front patriarch and founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, declared that she \u201cwasn\u2019t up to it\u201d during the two-and-half-hour debate, though he still supports her. A poll taken immediately after for BFMTV found that 63 percent of viewers thought that Mr. Macron had carried the day.His polling lead in the election Sunday is around 20 points, yet it was not clear that the debate would necessarily sway those who had already made up their minds or backed other candidates in the first round of the election. Significantly, however, many observers saw in Ms. Le Pen\u2019s principal debate tactic an unwelcome guest: the big lie.Mr. Macron repeatedly called her a liar during the debate, and newspaper commentaries on Thursday backed him up. \u201cMarine Le Pen: The Strategy of the Lie,\u201d was the banner headline on Le Monde\u2019s front page, which went on to say that the \u201cdeliberate tactic was largely inspired by what Donald Trump practiced in the American campaign.\u201dThe newspaper detailed \u201cThe 19 lies of Marine Le Pen\u201d during the debate about topics including \u201cBrexit,\u201d the euro, the European Union and terrorism. On all these subjects, the newspaper demonstrated that Ms. Le Pen had put forward half-truths and outright falsehoods.She was revealed as \u201cthe heir of a practice of politics that has always been based on denigration and threat,\u201d Le Monde said in its front-page editorial. \u201cThe imitator, besides, of Donald Trump, piling on, just like the American president, lying insinuation.\u201dThe Macron camp was quick to pick up on the negative parallel between President Trump and Ms. Le Pen, posting a video on Twitter in which Americans and Britons express regret about voting for Mr. Trump and for Brexit, and warning that \u201cthis Sunday, France will have to make a choice; the worst is not impossible.\u201dMs. Le Pen has significantly backed away from her early enthusiastic declarations in favor of Mr. Trump since his chaotic beginnings. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama announced on Thursday he was supporting Mr. Macron, in a video posted on Mr. Macron\u2019s Twitter feed.One \u201cinsinuation\u201d from Ms. Le Pen in the Wednesday debate may wind up costing her. At the end, she suggested that Mr. Macron might have \u201can offshore account,\u201d later acknowledging she had no proof.Such an accusation is extremely serious for public figures in France, especially in the court of public opinion. The Paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into whether fake news is being used to influence the election, and Mr. Macron has announced a lawsuit against right-wing websites over the suggestion.Ms. Le Pen\u2019s tactics on Wednesday, eschewing any kind of detailed exposition of policies and instead relying on epithet-slinging \u2014 Mr. Macron was \u201cthe privileged child of the system and the elites,\u201d and the \u201crepresentative of subjugated France\u201d \u2014 would have been familiar to anyone attending her rallies across France this election season. Her supporters roar at these verbal sallies.But such language is not normally part of mainstream political discourse in France. And that fact set up the collision of Wednesday night, and the tone of dismay and shock in the commentaries.The second-round presidential debate has become almost a sacred ritual in French politics. Fifteen years ago, Jacques Chirac, the former president, refused to dignify Ms. Le Pen\u2019s father in a debate when he unexpectedly made the second round. That Ms. Le Pen was not given that treatment in 2017, commentators suggested, meant that she had been accepted as a legitimate partner in the democratic process.But on Thursday, French news media and academic commentators suggested she had violated that trust by her \u201cviolence,\u201d as many put it. \u201cMaybe she wanted to reassure her electorate,\u201d Marc Lazar, a historian, said in an interview, \u201cor maybe she was just showing her true nature.\u201d\u201cShe has wanted to show that she has \u2018undemonized\u2019 the party,\u201d Mr. Lazar continued, referring to the effort Ms. Le Pen has undertaken to distance the National Front from the hate-filled declarations of her father. \u201cBut in the end, she just proved that she is her father\u2019s daughter. I think there were a lot of people who were surprised, because they thought she had really changed.\u201dEven veteran Front-watchers were taken aback by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s actions on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was transformed into a fight, not a debate,\u201d said Val\u00e9rie Igounet, the leading historian of the National Front.On Thursday, one of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s more prominent supporters, the filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin, wrote in an op-ed in Le Monde addressed to Mr. Macron in the wake of the debate: \u201cYou are detested already, before even having set foot in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e,\u201d referring to the presidential residence.More typical of Thursday\u2019s reactions, though, was that of an editorial in the southern La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, in Toulouse: \u201cThe \u2018decisive\u2019 debate was above all a revelatory debate. Through lies and incessant interruptions, striking proof was given last night that it is difficult, if not impossible, to debate with the far right, in conditions of minimal democratic respect.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "L.A. Reincarnation: New Art Spaces in Vintage Settings", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It\u2019s hard to know what to make of the bright gold stripes running down the dark travertine lobby walls of the Scottish Rite Masonic Temple here. From a distance, they look like long strands of jewelry. Up close, they resemble chains of hieroglyphics. But how to crack this code, nobody knows.\u201cWhen you find something this beautiful, you want to preserve and restore it,\u201d said Maurice Marciano, 68, who in retirement has been overseeing the building\u2019s transformation and conservation while his younger brother Paul remains an executive at Guess.\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting for us to turn something very secretive and formidable into something friendly and curiosity-driven,\u201d added Kulapat Yantrasast, the project architect. \u201cIt\u2019s especially interesting for L.A., because we tend to love what\u2019s new and shiny instead of investigating history in this way.\u201dThe Marciano Art Foundation is not alone in going the historical route. Several new arts institutions in development that will expand the city\u2019s museum landscape have opted to reimagine existing buildings rather than build sleek new ones, as the Broad museum did in 2015 with its Diller Scofidio + Renfro design.As contemporary art has grown in its scale and ambitions, the trend of converting industrial spaces to provide cheap and flexible space has also taken off.The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where Mr. Marciano is co-chair of the board, helped lead the way in the early 1980s by turning a warehouse, now known as the Geffen, into a still-raw-seeming exhibition hall. Mass MoCA, in former textile mills of North Adams, Mass., and Dia:Beacon, in a defunct Nabisco box factory in Beacon, N.Y., followed.And European cities where space is scarce have long proven resourceful, transforming train stations (Mus\u00e9e D\u2019Orsay in Paris and Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin) and power plants (the Tate Modern in London and the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology in Lisbon) into visual arts centers. In 2015, after years of trying out different spaces, the Prada Foundation established a permanent home in Milan in a former gin distillery.The obvious incentive is financial. While structural changes to meet earthquake codes can throw an expensive wrench into the works, museums can get a better price per square foot by adapting an existing building if its bones are good.Then there are the branding possibilities. If the convention for world-class museums is to have a custom-built home, preferably by a Pritzker-winning \u201cstarchitect\u201d (\u201cmuseum buildings as logos\u201d as Mr. Yantrasast sees it), some smaller institutions prefer to use existing spaces \u2014 the funkier, the better \u2014 to convey their own sense of adventurousness.As Ms. Agsten of the Main Museum, a noncollecting institution, pointed out: \u201cThis is definitely not the kind of place you would want to hang your Rothkos. A space like ours sets the visitor up for a different kind of experience \u2014 for a sense of experimentation.\u201d She noted that artists had already expressed interest in using the Main\u2019s bank vaults, hinting at another motivation behind the trend: a growing weariness among artists over showing work in predictable, and interchangeable, art fair booths and even pristine gallery rooms.\u201cMost artists would rather see work installed in a rough space than in gleaming new exhibition halls because it\u2019s what their studios look like \u2014 a continuity between place of production and place of presentation,\u201d Mr. Yantrasast said.Having worked in museum conversions before \u2014 he recalled a former slaughterhouse, Les Abbatoirs, in Toulouse, France \u2014 Mr. Shaw said these adapted spaces have a big advantage: \u201cWhen you\u2019re an artist, it\u2019s terrible to have a blank page. It\u2019s better to have something to work off of, riff off of, a starting point.\u201d The disadvantages, he said, are mainly practical: \u201cI could use more electrical outlets now.\u201dThe Marcianos financed the conservation of three murals by Millard Sheets while working with his estate to relocate others; repaired the gold detailing in the lobby walls as needed; and preserved almost all elements on the facade, including sculptures of celebrated Masons like George Washington. They also turned a small Masonic library into an anthropological museum, with literature but also costumes and hats left on the site. \u201cIt\u2019s the museum of the museum,\u201d Mr. Marciano said.The contemporary art gets the most play on the third floor, formerly a Masonic banquet hall large enough to seat 1,500 members (all men). Mr. Yantrasast removed the low ceiling to expose the gable roof and create a soaring space. He also carved out three smaller galleries to the west, each of which currently pairs two heavyweight artists: Mike Kelley and Sterling Ruby, for starters.But there are moments when the new art and historical building have competing agendas. Walk east on the third floor, and you find a panoramic Sheets mosaic mural from 1961 with a nature theme, complete with stylized roosters and glittering trees.Unfortunately, it is impossible to get a full view of the mural: A new wall has been built parallel to it, just six feet in front.Mr. Marciano called the Sheets mural \u201cbeautiful and powerful,\u201d a personal favorite. But he explained that he had the wall erected to keep the building\u2019s history at a remove. He didn\u2019t want the mural to eclipse his contemporary art: \u201cThe mosaic is too commanding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have completely overtaken the view.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Marciano Art Foundation, one of several new Los Angeles institutions making use of existing buildings, described incorrectly the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which gave its name to the foundation\u2019s home on Wilshire Boulevard. The Scottish Rite is a series of degrees awarded by Masonic groups; it is not the Scottish branch of the Masons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Housing Regulator Is Pushed to Crack Down on Sales of Foreclosed Properties", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byLawmakers are pressing the nation\u2019s housing regulator over the sale of thousands of foreclosed houses to investment firms that have pitched the promise of homeownership to people unable to get a traditional mortgage.Some local authorities and regulators are taking legal action against several of these firms, accusing them of engaging in predatory business practices by reselling these often rundown houses \u201cas is\u201d through rent-to-own and other seller-financed transactions, sometimes known as contracts for deed.Since the 2008 housing crisis, seller financing has become a lucrative business model as banks have largely stopped lending to lower-income families and the government has tried to sell a huge inventory of foreclosed homes.On Thursday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, who sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Government, wrote to the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, urging the regulator to stop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big government-controlled mortgage finance companies, from selling foreclosed homes to these firms.Other lawmakers have raised concerns, too. During a Senate hearing on the future of Fannie and Freddie on Thursday, the F.H.F.A. director, Melvin Watt, was questioned about the sale of foreclosed houses to firms using contract for deed.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, told Mr. Watt that the agency should prohibit Fannie and Freddie from selling nonperforming mortgages and houses to firms looking to resell them through contract for deed. Mr. Watt promised that the housing agency would act to limit those sales.\u201cIt would have to be on a going-forward basis, but we are actively looking at that issue now,\u201d Mr. Watt told the Senate Banking Committee.After the housing market collapsed nearly a decade ago, Fannie resold about 400,000 homes to investors, including more than 10,000 to firms that specialize in seller-financed deals. Some of those homes were sold in bulk transactions at rock-bottom prices. Fannie stopped such bulk sales in 2014. But firms continue to buy individual homes from Fannie on the open market.In all, Fannie has resold 1.2 million homes since 2009, the worst year of the crisis.For several months, Mr. Cummings, the ranking member on the oversight committee, has been focused on Vision Property Management, a rent-to-own company based in Columbia, S.C., which owns dozens of houses in Baltimore and more than 6,000 nationwide.The Maryland congressman has been demanding documents from Vision since January, saying that he is concerned that it is duping poor consumers into rent-to-own contracts that become money traps. His office has spoken to Vision at least twice, according to correspondence the office made public, but those conversations have yielded little.On Thursday, Mr. Cummings wrote to Vision and its chief executive, citing \u201cgrave concerns about the physical and financial well-being of tenants\u201d with leases from Vision.Mr. Cummings said Vision\u2019s \u201climited document production to date has heightened concerns about the potential harm Vision may be inflicting on families in Maryland and throughout the United States.\u201dValerie L. Hletko, a lawyer for Vision, said \u201cthe letter\u2019s escalated rhetoric does nothing to assist Americans without access to traditional mortgage loans to achieve homeownership, which Vision works to do every day.\u201dTiffany Bennett, the children\u2019s guardian, discovered that they had lead poisoning one year after moving into a two-story brick house owned by Vision. She and the children moved out soon after learning about the lead paint.Vision\u2019s lawyers, in a letter sent this week to Mr. Cummings, said the company regretted the ordeal that Ms. Bennett had endured. The lawyers said, \u201cin Ms. Bennett\u2019s situation there was an oversight\u201d that Vision did not properly disclose the problems with lead paint in the home, which Vision had bought from Fannie.Ms. Hletko, said in a statement, that Mr. Cummings\u2019s letter \u201cexploits an isolated case to make sweeping and irresponsible allegations against a private company.\u201dLike many of its homes, Vision spent no money to renovate Ms. Bennett\u2019s home or to fix lead paint problems there. The onus was on her to make all repairs and bring the property up to code or lose her contract. Often, when there are serious problems, tenants like Ms. Bennett are forced to sign confidentiality agreements in a settlement after they have been compensated, perpetuating the lead paint problems across the country.But Mr. Cummings has also raised questions about whether the contracts that Vision offers actually provide a path to homeownership or whether the contracts \u2014 which require tenants to pay monthly rent as they build an \u201cequitable interest\u201d \u2014 are just a marketing ploy to hook consumers.In its correspondence with Mr. Cummings and his office, Vision said that 72 of its customers had bought homes through its rent-to-own business.Cincinnati sued Vision last week, accusing it of engaging in a civil conspiracy, causing a public nuisance and contributing to urban blight.The lawsuit seeks to collect $190,000 in unpaid fines, fees and judgments against Vision and several affiliated limited liability companies. The complaint accuses Vision of duping residents by not disclosing known defects and housing code violations and of using \u201cpredatory and unconscionable lease option contracts\u201d that violate Ohio and Cincinnati laws.The litigation contends that Vision has contributed to blight in the city by marketing houses that it knows need repair and with the awareness that its customers will not be able to get the money to make the properties habitable.\u201cVision has been in communication with the City of Cincinnati to address all issues raised, and those communications are ongoing,\u201d Ms. Hletko said.Cincinnati\u2019s lawyers accuse Vision with engaging in a civil conspiracy with other \u201cbottom-feeder investors\u201d to profit \u201coff the foreclosure crisis by intentionally avoiding property maintenance laws.\u201dThe suit was filed just weeks after Cincinnati sued Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas, accusing that company, which sells foreclosed houses through contract for deed deals, of engaging in predatory business practices. The city contends that Harbour owes more than $360,000 in unpaid fees, fines and judgments. Harbour, which bought nearly 7,000 houses from Fannie Mae, is also the subject of an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Sound Legal\u2019: Inside Nike\u2019s Oregon Project", "Date": "2017-05-19", "News": "A report by antidoping officials says the coach, Alberto Salazar, violated drug protocols with Dathan Ritzenhein, Mo Farah and other elite runners.Supported byDathan Ritzenhein, an Olympic distance runner for the United States, was starting to feel sick from his thyroid medication \u2014 a drug that was not medically necessary but one that his coach, a powerful and combative figure in the sport, had strongly recommended to improve his performance.The coach was Alberto Salazar, a running legend himself who after his competitive career had teamed up with Nike, the world\u2019s largest athletic apparel manufacturer, to train elite runners. He was dismissive when Ritzenhein expressed concerns, Ritzenhein later said under oath. Salazar was focused on revving Ritzenhein\u2019s endocrine system for a coming race, he said, \u201cinstead of just whatever was best for my health.\u201dSalazar has emphatically denied violating antidoping rules. He has said that he and his athletes closely followed all protocols established by antidoping authorities.But in the report, antidoping officials depicted Salazar as a medicine chest whose door swung open for the world-class athletes on Nike\u2019s payroll. They said he provided or helped gain access to prescription-dose vitamin D; calcitonin; ferrous sulfate; Advair; testosterone; and various thyroid medications. Many of the drugs have no proven benefits for runners.United States antidoping officials now believe that Salazar and a Texas endocrinologist administered an infusion procedure in violation of antidoping rules, colluded to cover it up and then lied to their athletes about its legality.\u201cSalazar\u2019s conduct here is patently calculating, misleading and dishonest,\u201d the antidoping officials wrote in the report, which was drafted in March 2016 as an appeal to the Texas Medical Board to compel the release of the endocrinologist\u2019s medical files.Salazar, who refused to cooperate with the antidoping agency\u2019s investigation, did not respond to interview requests. Nike declined to respond to questions about the report.Ritzenhein declined to comment on specifics of his time with Salazar, instead deferring to his sworn testimony in the report, in which he and other athletes described an environment in which they felt immense pressure to do as their coach instructed or lose their livelihoods.The Nike athletes, the report said, \u201cwere acutely aware that these opportunities could be withdrawn at Alberto Salazar\u2019s discretion and were dependent both upon Salazar\u2019s favor and their own athletic performance.\u201d\u201cThese facts created huge pressure to conform to Salazar\u2019s wishes and use substances and training methods advocated by him.\u201dFor Ritzenhein, getting a contract with Nike in 2004 was the culmination of years of hard work. \u201cIt\u2019s every kid\u2019s dream to sign a professional contract,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview.He moved to Oregon in 2007 but did not start working directly with Salazar and the Oregon Project until June 2009. He told antidoping officials that as soon as he joined the team, he \u201cstarted taking a lot of supplements that Alberto had in a room in his basement, pretty much everybody on the team took them.\u201dIn June 2010, after an unproductive season of injury, Ritzenhein and Salazar\u2019s conversations moved from supplements to \u201csynthetic thyroid,\u201d Ritzenhein testified, saying it was \u201cto help with low testosterone levels.\u201d Blood work performed at Nike\u2019s lab showed that Ritzenhein\u2019s thyroid-stimulating hormone and his testosterone levels were both within the normal range. Regardless, Salazar sent him to see Dr. Jeffrey Stuart Brown, an endocrinologist who is known for his belief that synthetic thyroid medication enhances athletic performance.The next day, Dr. Brown prescribed Levoxyl, a thyroid drug. (Levoxyl is not a banned substance.)According to the report, Dr. Brown was Salazar\u2019s personal physician and was being paid a monthly retainer to work with the Oregon Project athletes. Ritzenhein said he did not know any of this at the time.Dr. Brown is known in the track world for diagnosing hypothyroidism in distance runners. The condition involves an underactive thyroid that can lead to weight gain and fatigue, but is considered relatively rare among athletes.Some experts say that thyroid hormone can serve as a stimulant, lead to weight loss and improve alertness among athletes.\u201cThroughout my career the health of my patients has, and always will be, my absolute priority,\u201d Dr. Brown said in a statement through his lawyer. \u201cI will not be bullied or coerced regardless of tactics used, and I intend to fully defend myself against any baseless allegations brought against me in any forum.\u201dIn January 2011, Salazar became aware of research from the University of Nottingham in England that appeared to show significant improvement in performance when athletes raised their L-carnitine to extremely high, unnatural levels. (L-carnitine is a substance that occurs naturally in the body and helps convert fat to energy. As a supplement, it is not a banned substance, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency.)After contacting the researchers, Salazar learned that one was about to bring an L-carnitine drink product to market. He spent thousands of Nike dollars on pallets of the preproduction drink and began distributing it to his runners, telling them that access to this special L-carnitine product was something to be kept secret. Salazar knew he would lose his advantage if competitors used it.L-carnitine levels are notoriously hard to increase, however, so it would take up to six months of loading with the drink before the promised enhancement in performance could be realized on the track. Salazar was impatient; Ritzenhein had the 2012 Olympic marathon trials coming up in just two months.The Nottingham researchers had written about a method in which they were able to infuse patients with L-carnitine to bring levels up thousands of times compared with the baseline. This procedure took 4 hours 10 minutes instead of six months of drink consumption. Acting with urgency, Salazar decided to test the process on an employee. Steve Magness, an assistant coach, was the chosen guinea pig.Magness, who was at first unwilling, eventually relented to Salazar\u2019s demands and soon took a preinfusion treadmill test. Medical records obtained by the antidoping agency showed that Dr. Brown then gave Magness a continuous gravity drip infusion of L-carnitine on Nov. 28, 2011, that lasted 4 hours 10 minutes. The records note that Dr. Brown used the same duration, method and solution of L-carnitine and dextrose outlined by the Nottingham researchers.Even though L-carnitine is not a banned substance, the method of infusion used by Dr. Brown was prohibited, antidoping officials believe. Antidoping rules prohibit \u201cinfusions and/or injections of more than 50 mL per 6 hour period except for those legitimately received in the course of hospital admissions, surgical procedures or clinical investigations.\u201dFifty milliliters is about three tablespoons of liquid, an amount that would not take four hours to infuse.Dr. Brown left crucial information out of Magness\u2019s medical records, the report said, including the quantities of L-carnitine that he infused. However, from Magness\u2019s sworn testimony, the antidoping officials concluded \u201cit appears very likely that the infusion volume administered to Steve Magness by Dr. Brown was at least 1000 mL (i.e., one liter).\u201dMagness said in a recent interview that he was not aware at the time that the treatment would be more than 50 milliliters and a violation of doping rules. \u201cBoth Dr. Brown and Alberto told me it was good with Usada and I mistakenly trusted them,\u201d he said.Magness described the results of his post-L-carnitine treadmill test as \u201calmost unbelievable.\u201d Salazar was enamored, and quickly focused on making sure Ritzenhein got the treatment as soon as possible.After learning about the procedure, however, Ritzenhein said to Salazar: \u201cIs this legal? This doesn\u2019t sound legal.\u201dRealizing that the procedure was a breach of antidoping rules, the report said, Salazar and Dr. Brown changed the infusion protocol. From now on, the athletes would be infused for just over an hour, instead of the more conspicuous four.In an email message obtained by antidoping officials, Salazar then appeared to mislead Ritzenhein: \u201cHi Dathan, we are cutting edge but we take no chances on a screw up. Everything is above board and cleared thru Usada. They know me very well because I always get an okay before doing anything!\u201dIn its report, the antidoping agency said, \u201cSalazar\u2019s statement about always getting clearance with Usada \u2018before doing anything\u2019 is both ironic and inaccurate.\u201dNike had begun making fewer payments to Ritzenhein based on his disappointing performance, he said. He believed that his options were to submit to the infusions or leave the Oregon Project. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for me to get around it at that point, in my eyes,\u201d he said in the report.He received the infusion \u2014 which now took just 1 hour 10 minutes \u2014 in Dr. Brown\u2019s Houston offices on Dec. 13, 2011. He also mentioned that Dr. Brown or someone on his staff would come in every few minutes and squeeze the infusion bag.Dr. Brown provided antidoping officials with Ritzenhein\u2019s medical records, but the report says the version he sent was altered. A page was removed and an added annotation read \u201c45mL.\u201d Antidoping officials said they were able to determine the alteration by comparing the records with those provided by Ritzenhein.Antidoping officials suggest that administering an infusion of less than 50 milliliters \u201ccontinuously and uniformly over a one hour period is a practical impossibility and Dr. Brown knew this,\u201d concluding that Ritzenhein \u201creceived 9.67 grams of L-carnitine over 1 hour, which demonstrates that Ritzenhein likely received an infusion far in excess of 50 mL.\u201dRitzenhein did not run fast enough to qualify for the Olympic team at the marathon trials in 2012, and Nike paid him only half his expected $200,000 salary for the year, he said.As previously reported by The Times of London, the report also said that Galen Rupp, an Olympic silver medalist, and Mo Farah of Britain, one of the most successful runners in Olympic history, also received infusions of L-carnitine. Rupp, Farah and Salazar have repeatedly rejected any claims that they violated antidoping rules.Among the others identified in the report as having used L-carnitine was Tara Welling, a standout at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles who moved to Oregon to work with Salazar in 2012. (Her surname was Erdmann when the report was written.)In an email, Welling declined to discuss treatments she received under Salazar, citing medical privacy. \u201cI had nothing but the utmost respect for Alberto and the staff,\u201d she said about her arrival with the team in 2012. \u201cAt this time Usada has not yet been able to share with me the details or evidence that supports these allegations.\u201dHer comments to Usada \u2014 not given under oath \u2014 in the report were starkly different than her initial views in 2012, seeming to indicate that her beliefs about Salazar and the program had changed. Welling recalled Salazar\u2019s abusing medications by giving her the prescription drug Celebrex out of his personal supply. She also spoke to the secrecy of the program, in which she said Salazar demanded that athletes remain closemouthed about all things related to the Oregon Project.An investigator with the antidoping agency first interviewed Welling in the summer of 2015, and she insisted that she had never seen Dr. Brown and knew nothing about infusions. After reviewing Oregon Project emails, the agency found messages from Salazar in which he wrote that Welling \u201cgot the L-carnitine injection yesterday from BrownD.\u201dIn a subsequent interview, Welling admitted that she, too, had received an infusion of L-carnitine. She said that Dr. Brown had drawn blood and performed a physical exam, a bone exam, a lower leg jump-test and an asthma lung-capacity test, and had poked her with a \u201croller thing.\u201d Regarding the L-carnitine infusion, however, she said she could not remember a single detail.Welling\u2019s medical records showed a nearly 11,000 percent increase in her muscle L-carnitine levels after the infusion. For the antidoping officials, this was evidence of illicit performance enhancement.When pressed about the infusion during her interview with the agency, Welling began crying. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Alberto did something to me,\u201d she said.Ritzenhein still runs competitively, but is without a sponsor, having left the Nike-funded program in May 2014. He no longer has a relationship with Salazar and has moved back to his home state, Michigan. Welling left the Oregon Project in December 2015. She is no longer sponsored by Nike, and now runs for Skechers.\u201cWe cannot comment on the specific situation at this time,\u201d a spokesman for the agency said in a statement. \u201cHowever, we know there is a win-at-all-costs culture that exists across all levels of sport, and coaches especially \u2013 given their influence over athletes \u2013 have a responsibility to rise above those pressures and ensure that athlete health and safety is protected.\u201dAntidoping officials have not announced sanctions against anyone implicated in the report.An article on Saturday about Nike\u2019s Oregon Project and the running coach Alberto Salazar referred incorrectly to how the runner Tara Welling handled a request for an interview. Welling answered questions via email; she did not decline an interview request or make a statement through her husband. The article also referred incorrectly to her comments in a United States Anti-Doping Agency report. She was interviewed by the agency; she did not testify under oath.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Track Team From Namibia, a Long Trip to Its First U.S. Finish", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byWhen the first high school track and field team from Namibia to compete at the Penn Relays arrived in Philadelphia from Grootfontein, a town of about 25,000 people, Henk Botha, the school\u2019s principal and shot-put and discus coach, knew the trip would be an eye-opener.The population of Grootfontein, you see, is barely larger than the total number of athletes, about 18,000, who competed in this year\u2019s relays, held April 27-29. But that huge crowd wasn\u2019t the only thing that would be new for the teenagers Botha brought from Grootfontein Agri College, a school of 183 students that he helped found several years ago. Most of his athletes had never been out of southern Africa. A handful had never flown. But Botha felt his team was ready, and he was certain the experience would be worth it.\u201cIn the U.S., you\u2019re used to a high level of competition,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Namibia, you have to seek that out.\u201dThe journey nearly ended before it began, when the main sponsor pulled out a few weeks before the team was scheduled to depart. A parent at the school stepped in with a loan to finance the trip \u2014 on the condition that the money would be repaid by reinvesting in the school \u2014 but that only got Grootfontein on its way.When the team arrived in New York after a 23-hour trip, and only days before the relays were to begin, the students found that the hostel rooms they had reserved in Union City, N.J., were not available. While waiting hours for a solution, the coaches and athletes ordered pizza to fill the time and their stomachs, sharing the food off paper plates in a dim hallway lined with exposed pipes.Because the reservation mix-up meant the hostel could not accommodate the entire team, a parent arranged for two of the athletes, Xu Huber, 14, and Felicia Liswaniso, 15, to move into a hotel room about 10 minutes away, in North Bergen, N.J. The next day, the rest of the team joined them there after a single night in the hostel. \u201cWe always stay together as a team; it feels weird to be separated,\u201d said Liswaniso, who passed time by letting Huber braid her hair.The team had planned to spend an entire day sightseeing in New York City before going to Philadelphia for the relays, but after the hostel episode and a half-day spent moving into the hotel, the athletes settled for a visit to the one place everyone had agreed upon: Times Square.\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be this huge,\u201d Chantel Louw, 16, said. The team members marveled at the giant video screens, took photographs with street performers and bought souvenirs. Then they packed and headed for Philadelphia.In the parking lot of a Howard Johnson in Blackwood, N.J., the team\u2019s home base for the meet, Karlien Botha used a towel to work on her discus form while her teammates practiced baton handoffs. Botha, 15, is considered one of the best discus throwers in Namibia.She turned in a personal best of 39.95 meters the week before arriving in the United States and hoped to throw 40 meters at Franklin Field. Instead, she topped out at 35.88. In Namibia, discus throwers are given six attempts, allowing them time to warm up; at the Penn Relays, they were allotted three. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so big and overwhelming, I was so stressed. Next time I come, I just need to relax and take my time in the circle.\u201dChrislene Klein-Nienaber, 13, stretched before warm-ups for the high jump. Normally, she said, she starts at 1.45 meters when competing. At the Penn Relays, the starting mark was 1.59 \u2014 already higher than the high school record she holds in Namibia. She cleared the bar on her first attempt \u2014 \u201cIt was really high\u201d \u2014 but was unable to get over the next height, 1.63 meters, on three attempts.The Penn Relays divides competitors into two categories: unique and nonunique athletes. Unique athletes specialize in one running or field event, while nonunique athletes compete in multiple events and relays. Unique athletes made up 13,000 of the 18,000 participants this year. \u201cRemember,\u201d Coach Botha had told the team, \u201cyou did not come here to just be participants. You came to be competitors.\u201dIan Grobbelaar, 15, Jaco Grobbelaar, 17, Lincoln Beukes, 16, and Raymond Hummel, 15, waited in the shade until their 4x100-meter relay heat was called. \u201cThere are only three racing tracks in all of Namibia, and none of them are close to our town,\u201d Jaco Grobbelaar said. \u201cThe only time we come to a real track is to run, not to practice. For us, it\u2019s a privilege to race here.\u201d The boys finished in 44.37 seconds, placing second in their heat Friday. They went on to another second-place finish on Saturday, with the 4x400-meter relay finishing in 3 minutes 29.87 seconds.With their events completed, the Namibians watched from the mezzanine as other high schools, colleges and Olympians competed on the relays\u2019 final day.While Botha, their coach, and some of their teammates napped, the others soaked up their final hours in Philadelphia. The next day, the team was to return to Africa, some directly to Zimbabwe to represent their country in a regional championship. \u201cThis whole trip opened my eyes,\u201d Ian Grobbelaar said. \u201cYou may be the best in Namibia, but there\u2019s always someone out there better than you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece Agrees to Tighten Belt Again in Return for Further Bailout Funds", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Greece and its international creditors said on Tuesday that they had reached a preliminary deal allowing the country to receive crucial bailout payments in exchange for promises to raise taxes and to further cut pensions and social spending.Under the terms of the agreement, which is subject to the approval of eurozone finance ministers and the Greek Parliament, Athens will make changes to its labor and energy markets, cut pension payouts, and increase taxes.The deal was a prerequisite for talks on easing Greece\u2019s enormous debt burden, which is about \u20ac300 billion. The issue is a point of contention between the International Monetary Fund, which advocates debt relief for the country, and European Union members, notably Germany, which have taken a harder line against Athens.\u201cThere was white smoke,\u201d Euclid Tsakalotos, the country\u2019s finance minister, told reporters after 12 hours of talks in the Greek capital, alluding to the method the Vatican uses to signal when a new pope has been selected. \u201cThe negotiation has finished.\u201dThe talks focused on economic overhauls including further pensions cuts, tax increases and changes to the labor market. But they stalled at times as a result of disagreements between European officials and the International Monetary Fund over Greece\u2019s economic prospects and its ability to meet budget targets.As part of the deal announced on Tuesday, Athens agreed to raise the equivalent of 2 percent of gross domestic product by cutting pensions further in 2019, and increasing tax receipts by reducing the income threshold at which taxes must be paid.Yielding to creditors\u2019 demands to make the labor market more competitive, the deal also makes it easier for businesses to fire employees.\u201cIt is time to turn the page on this long and difficult austerity chapter for the Greek people,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this agreement, we need now to write a new story of stability, jobs and growth for Greece and for the euro area as a whole.\u201dThe government must now draft legislation bundling together all the measures and push it through Parliament before eurozone finance ministers meet on May 22. As with similar bills in the past, they are expected to become law, but the government of Alexis Tsipras, the leftist prime minister, retains a fragile three-seat majority in the 300-seat chamber, and opinion polls show its popularity falling.If the measures are enacted, eurozone finance ministers \u2014 collectively known as the Eurogroup \u2014 are expected to approve the disbursement of bailout funds for Athens to make a debt payment that is due in July.The ministers are also expected to discuss debt relief and targets for Greece\u2019s primary surplus, or budget surplus not counting debt financing.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

Panel Releases Draft of Treaty to Ban Nuclear Arms", "Date": "2017-05-22", "News": "Supported byA United Nations disarmament panel presented the first draft on Monday of a proposed global treaty to ban nuclear weapons, which advocates called an important step that could hasten completion of a final text by early July.Nuclear powers including the United States have boycotted the negotiations for such a treaty, calling its goals na\u00efve and unattainable \u2014 especially at a time when North Korea has threatened to launch nuclear-armed missiles at its enemies.But those nations\u2019 longstanding argument for deterrence \u2014 that the best way to keep nuclear arms from being used is to hold the ability to retaliate in kind \u2014 has failed to halt the momentum in the negotiations. The first round was held in March, and the effort is supported by more than 120 countries.Treaty supporters have argued that if enough countries ratified an international agreement outlawing nuclear weapons, the political and moral coercive pressure would eventually persuade holdouts to reconsider.Similar strategies were pursued in negotiations that led to global treaties banning other indiscriminate weapons, including chemical arms, cluster bombs and land mines. As more countries have joined those treaties, the shaming effect has grown on those that decline.The nuclear draft text would commit treaty signers to \u201cnever use nuclear weapons\u201d and never \u201cdevelop, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.\u201dSigners would also promise to never \u201ccarry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.\u201dLess clear from the draft text is precisely how nuclear-armed countries that renounce those weapons could join the treaty, and under what conditions.But language in the draft specifies that the treaty is intended to strengthen \u2014 and not replace \u2014 the existing treaties meant to stop the spread and testing of nuclear weapons.The draft is now subject to revision at a three-week round of negotiations at the United Nations scheduled for mid-June.Supporters of the negotiations said the draft\u2019s existence by itself was significant.The disarmament group called the draft \u201can essential milestone in the yearslong effort to ban these indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction and an important step toward their eventual elimination.\u201dElayne G. Whyte G\u00f3mez, Costa Rica\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and chairwoman of the conference that is overseeing the negotiations, said in a telephone interview that she expected revisions to the draft.Ms. G\u00f3mez, who was responsible for writing the draft, said she had sought to \u201csynthesize the many areas where the views of states converged.\u201dAides to Ms. Haley said that she was traveling but that the American position had not changed.\u201cThe vast majority of world states say nuclear weapons are not essential for security, and that we want to reduce their salience by banning them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a contribution to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.\u201dBesides the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014 four countries are known to possess nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel. None support the negotiations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 S\u00f6ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.Instead, he went to China.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Schwertfeger said.Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China\u2019s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.China\u2019s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu \u2014 often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition \u2014 this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.\u201cIt\u2019s a race in the new generation of computing,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe difference is that China seems to think it\u2019s a race and America doesn\u2019t.\u201dFor Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.\u201dQuantifying China\u2019s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn\u2019t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation\u2019s spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cIt\u2019s the habit that yes is more risky than no.\u201dAuthorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China\u2019s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.\u201cThe lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut it has started to change.\u201dAt the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America\u2019s research institutions.Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.It\u2019s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.Baidu is a leader in China\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary \u2014 take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is \u2014 into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.In an apparent effort to harness Baidu\u2019s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a \u201cmilitary-use intelligent ground robot,\u201d was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China\u2019s seven schools of national defense.A company spokeswoman said: \u201cBaidu develops products and services that improve people\u2019s lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.\u201dStill, there are advantages in China\u2019s developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.\u201cAfter AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,\u201d said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, \u201cthe content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.\u201d Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Mr. Shirky said, \u201cunlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that\u2019s never been Beijing\u2019s favorite characteristic.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong, and John Markoff from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Readers Speak Out on South Korea\u2019s New Leader", "Date": "2017-05-10", "News": "Supported byHundreds of readers responded to the election results, telling us that they hoped to see the country mend the political and social divisions that widened during the impeachment of Ms. Park. They also expressed concerns about what they see as entrenched economic corruption and an intractable threat from North Korea. Here is a small sampling of their thoughts.\u201cAfter a year of soul searching, candlelight vigils, real drama (you did not have to watch any soap operas on television), and impeachment of a sitting president, it is about time for the nation to move forward.\u201cTo be sure, the conservatives will continue to raise objections, but Moon Jae-in now has the mandate of the people and he must deliver on his promises. I expect him to engage in peaceful dialogue with the North, clean up the graft among family-owned mega corporations (chaebol), and find ways to strengthen the role of civil society in promoting gender equality, addressing social inequalities, and combating poverty/social exclusion.\u201d\u2014 Theodore Jun Yoo, 45, Seoul\u201cLet\u2019s hope that he will help South Korea move on from his predecessor\u2019s corruption, steer the nation through economic difficulties, and offer solid leadership in the face of North Korea\u2019s threats.\u201d\u2014 NM, New York\u201cEven though I am a rather conservative and voted for one of the conservative candidates, I am not dissatisfied with the result .... The most critical issue facing South Korea is North Korea\u2019s attempt to carry out its nuclear and missile tests. I assume that Mr. Moon will create a peaceful atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula through talks with the North and the close cooperation with the U.S., resulting in a more stability on the peninsular and economic growth.\u201d\u2014 Yoon-jeong Lee, 49, Seoul\u201cThe result from Tuesday\u2019s election is an extension of the impeachment process. It\u2019s something that I dearly wanted to avoid, but also something that I could see happening.\u201cAt the same time, I am still shocked. I thought the debates would prove to be a bigger influence especially since we had such a short time leading up to the elections. Moon didn\u2019t seem reliable in any field, whether it be security or economy. ...\u201cI don\u2019t believe we can solve North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat through dialogue. We tried \u2014 and for 10 years, too. It didn\u2019t work. Did taking a harder stance against North Korea work? I believe so. ... Kim is not going to give up on what he believes to be sustaining his regime, especially when he is very close to reaching his ultimate goal. Dictators are not normal political leaders, and we cannot treat them so.\u201d\u2014 Rebecca Moon, Berkeley, Calif.\u201cAs an overseas South Korean citizen, I voted for Mr. Moon a few days ago during the overseas ballot period. So happy to see him becoming my next president. I want Americans to acknowledge that Mr. Moon is not pro-North Korea. In previous statements, he made clear that the reopening [of the] Kaesong Industrial Complex and further economic cooperation can take place only when there is a significant progress in the nuclear negotiation. To be honest, I don\u2019t really consider Mr. Moon as a liberal. He is more like a center-right candidate. But it\u2019s the unique South Korean political environment that makes him look like a liberal politician.\u201d\u2014 SW, Boston\u201cSouth Korea tried rapprochement. It failed, giving North Korea eight years to develop its nuclear program. South Korea then tried to punitive incrementalism. That, too, failed, giving North Korea eight more years.\u201cThe key is China. As long as China continues to support the North, the North will continue to develop its nuclear program. If the South wants a diplomatic solution, China must participate. But China has thus far refused.\u201cThe only thing that appears to have rattled China is the sudden ratcheting up of U.S. military presence. But the U.S. military presence has alienated South Koreans, and the U.S. can\u2019t lose South Korea as an ally.\u201cHowever, North Korea is more capable than ever before. In addition to South Korea, it now poses a military threat to Japan. Soon it will pose a military threat to the U.S.\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum....I don\u2019t know what the solution is, but I do know that South Koreans are deluding themselves if they think it\u2019s a return to rapprochement.\u201d\u2014 August Ludgate, Chicago\u201cComing from a very conservative household, my family and I were appalled by the outcome of the recent Korean election. One of the many reasons why I voted against Moon was due to his stance on the issue of North Korea. He seems to believe in the Sunshine Policy of his liberal predecessor, which essentially played a major role in financing the current nuclear capability of the North that threatens us today.\u201cSouth Korea has historically been a shrimp caught among whales. In recent years, we seemed to have finally avoided this fate by growing our partnerships with the United States on our joint commitment to pressuring North Korea. Now that Moon is in charge of the country, I fear we will yet again repeat our fate as a fragile nation with our two ears presented to both super powers to be yelled at. Who will pay the price? It is us, the younger generation.\u201d\u2014 Matthew (SJ) Oh, Richmond, Va.\u201cAs a Korean-American, I know the fact, the Sunshine Policy would work the best with NK. There is no perfect approach when you deal with NK. The fact is that the past two right-wing regimes of SK totally destroyed the relationship with NK and led them to focus on the development of nuclear weapon. Yes, the sunshine policy will not solve the issue entirely but it would work as a leverage to bring piece to the Korean Peninsula. I\u2019m so happy to see Mr. Moon was elected! The impeached former president Park Geun-hye brought down the country to the total disaster.\u201d\u2014 Ted Song, Portland, Ore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Faces \u2018Humbling\u2019 Scope of Its Woes in First Court Hearing", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported bySAN JUAN, P.R. \u2014 Puerto Rico\u2019s first day in federal court to reduce its $123 billion in bond debt and unfunded pensions got off to a cordial enough start on Wednesday, but after a few hours, the gloves started to come off.\u201cA conflict is starkly in front of us today,\u201d warned Marcia Goldstein, a lawyer for the National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, which has insured about $3.6 billion of the island\u2019s bonds.Broadly speaking, the case pits one set of bondholders \u2014 those who bought general-obligation bonds \u2014 against a second group that bought what are known as Cofina bonds, which are backed by a fixed portion of Puerto Rico\u2019s sales tax revenue.But the island does not have the resources to repay any of its creditors, or even cover all basic government operations, so there are no good choices or answers. The Federal District Court judge in the case, Laura Taylor Swain, who flew to San Juan from New York, stressed the urgency of the situation and the need for the parties to continue trying to mediate their differences.\u201cFailure, frankly, is not an option,\u201d said Judge Swain, who normally sits in the Southern District of New York. \u201cWe cannot simply turn off the lights and close the door on Puerto Rico.\u201dYet multiple conflicts appeared to be simmering under the surface of the case, the first in which a distressed United States territory has sought court protection from its creditors. Tempers flared when topics like truthful financial disclosures, potential conflicts of interest and the role of Puerto Rico\u2019s federal oversight board arose.The proceedings on Wednesday were supposed to focus primarily on case-management issues, but nearly every time a lawyer spoke, there seemed to be fresh signals indicating intractable battles ahead. The lawyers filling the packed courtroom told Judge Swain about looming deadlines and said that certain fundamental disputes had to be resolved almost immediately or else nothing could happen.\u201cThe scope and scale of the issues are, frankly, humbling,\u201d Judge Swain said at the outset. \u201cI thank you for your trust, and I shall try my best to earn it.\u201dShe spent much of the day reminding the lawyers that time was limited and that they would not be allowed to shift into oral arguments prematurely.This backruptcylike case is not a simple narrative about greedy vultures picking over the carcass of a debtor, although it is often told that way. Puerto Rico\u2019s $74 billion of bond debt involves different types of bonds, and although no one seems to have appreciated it when the bonds were first issued, there is now a glaring lack of consensus about which ones take legal precedence.Puerto Rico is seeking what is essentially bankruptcy relief. This is what\u2019s happening and how the island got here.The biggest bond-versus-bond conflict so far involves $12.7 billion of general-obligation bonds and $17.3 billion of Cofina bonds.The general-obligation bonds are supposedly guaranteed by Puerto Rico\u2019s Constitution, which states that \u201call available resources\u201d are to be put toward their timely repayment. The Cofina bonds are backed by a special, dedicated sales tax that is supposed to go straight from merchants\u2019 cash drawers into a lockbox arrangement that is sealed off from the government.But questions keep emerging: Lawyers for holders of the general-obligation bonds argue that the phrase \u201call available resources\u201d includes the sales taxes. Those are fighting words to holders of the Cofina bonds, who say that they have a property interest in the sales taxes and that \u201cinvading\u201d their lockbox would violate the Constitution\u2019s \u201ctakings\u201d clause.The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, has intensified the rivalry by tightly capping the total amount of money available to repay bonds of any type for the next five years. If the general-obligation bondholders were to claim all of it, as in \u201call available resources,\u201d there would hardly be any left for the other creditors.\u201cThe magnitude of the Cofina debt and the general-obligation debt make this a pivotal issue,\u201d said Martin Bienenstock, who is representing the federal oversight board, known as Promesa, in the case. He said the board had taken no position on which bondholder group was right.As a technical matter, the government of Puerto Rico and the corporation handling the Cofina bonds have filed separate cases, which the oversight board proposes to keep separate but have adjudicated \u201cjointly,\u201d for the sake of efficiency. This approach generated heated objections.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve done this in my career, and I don\u2019t do it lightly,\u201d said Dennis Dunne, a lawyer for Ambac Assurance Corporation who came forward when Judge Swain asked for objections. He said Mr. Bienenstock\u2019s approach might be correct in a corporate bankruptcy but not when the bankrupt debtor was a territory.Thomas Moers Mayer, a lawyer for a group of mutual funds, said that time was already running out. He said that the Cofina bondholders should receive a $120 million payment on July 1 and that they worry the government might \u201csweep\u201d the money out of their lockbox.\u201cWe are going to need an order in the commonwealth\u2019s case that prevents the commonwealth from just taking our money,\u201d he said.But Mr. Bienenstock said it was not clear that the Cofina bondholders even had standing to seek such an order in the commonwealth\u2019s separate case. \u201cIt might be a very strenuous adversarial matter, and this isn\u2019t the place to decide it,\u201d he said.Mr. Bienenstock also said that other government entities not yet involved in the court case, like the Highway and Transportation Authority, which has issued $6 billion of revenue bonds, would probably join it. That would presumably add highway and bridge tolls to the pot of money to ultimately be divided among various creditor groups.Judge Swain eventually overruled the objections to joint adjudication. She said she wanted to hold hearings every six weeks or so for the rest of the year. She called for a report before the next hearing on what progress the island was making on disclosing financial information to creditors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Le Pen and Macron Fight for Presidency in France, Unions Are Split", "Date": "2017-05-01", "News": "Supported byMore than 140,000 people participated in rallies in Paris, Lille, Marseille and other cities \u2014 events organized by French labor unions, some of which have found themselves in a bind ahead of the vote in the second and final round of the presidential election on Sunday.Although they have historically opposed Ms. Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Front and have urged members to vote against her, several major labor unions also fought the job market overhauls that Mr. Macron defended as economy minister and that he wants to expand if elected.That has left unions split between those who have explicitly endorsed Mr. Macron, and those who have only called for votes against Ms. Le Pen.At a rally of his supporters in Paris on Monday, Mr. Macron reiterated his economic agenda and renewed calls for a \u201cstrong Europe.\u201d But he said he would never \u201cjudge\u201d a National Front voter, \u201cbecause behind that vote there is always an anger, an outrage, a disappointment.\u201dMr. Macron said that he was \u201cpro-European,\u201d but that if elected he would \u201creform in-depth the European Union and our European project,\u201d lest he \u201cbetray\u201d the French people.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do so, because the day after, we will have a \u2018Frexit,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to a French exit from the European Union, \u201cor we will have the Front National again.\u201dMany on the French left, including union advocates who oppose the National Front, say the economic policies defended by Mr. Macron \u2014 free trade and a desire to loosen labor regulations \u2014 have fueled the National Front\u2019s success.Some hooded protesters clashed with the police on the sidelines of the demonstrations, throwing rocks and firebombs at the officers, who responded with tear gas. Five riot police officers were wounded in the clashes, the Paris police prefecture said.Demonstrators at a smaller rally organized earlier on Monday in Paris by more moderate labor unions, who have endorsed Mr. Macron, said voters had to choose.\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t support the politics of Macron, we advise our followers to vote for him, because we don\u2019t want Le Pen,\u201d said Olivier Belem, 56, a computer technician and union member. \u201cThe fact that the other unions don\u2019t give voters clear advice will leave open the possibility of a blank vote and will help Le Pen in her chances of victory.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Macron also paid tribute to Brahim Bouarram, a 29-year-old man who was killed during a far-right demonstration in Paris on May 1, 1995, by skinheads who pushed him off a bridge and into the Seine. Mr. Bouarram\u2019s son, who was 9 at the time of his father\u2019s death, joined Mr. Macron as they laid flowers at a memorial plaque.The National Front\u2019s unsavory past is embodied by Ms. Le Pen\u2019s 88-year-old father and founder of the party, who on Monday addressed a couple of hundred supporters in Paris at a rally celebrating Joan of Arc.\u201cHe talks about the future, but he has no children; he talks about workers, but he\u2019s a former banker at Rothschild; he wants to revitalize the economy, but he\u2019s one of those who dynamited it,\u201d Mr. Le Pen said.\u201cI will be a president who protects,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told her cheering supporters.Manon Bouquin, 24, a Le Pen supporter at the rally, said she believed Ms. Le Pen could win on Sunday.\u201cWhatever the outcome, everything will have changed, and it was interesting to see people in the establishment of 40 years finally getting worried,\u201d Ms. Bouquin said.Even some Macron supporters at his rally said that, though they believed in his ability to win, they worried about his ability to unite disenchanted voters beyond their rejection of the far right.\u201cThere are a lot of people who think that it is mostly important to vote against Marine Le Pen,\u201d said Elfayed Sagaf, 18, a student who was holding a banner supporting En Marche!, Mr. Macron\u2019s movement. \u201cI would have preferred more votes of support.\u201dReporting was contributed by Beno\u00eet Morenne, Milan Schreuer and Pam\u00e9la Rougerie from Paris, and Lilia Blaise from Villepinte.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump Has the President\u2019s Ear. Here\u2019s Her Agenda.", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byA month before Donald J. Trump was elected president, he and his aides watched his daughter\u2019s coolly composed surface crack open.Inside Trump Tower, the candidate was preparing for a debate when an aide rushed in with news that The Washington Post was about to publish an article saying that Mr. Trump had bragged about grabbing women\u2019s private parts. As Ivanka Trump joined the others waiting to see a video of the episode, her father insisted that the description of his comments did not sound like him.When the recording finally showed he was wrong, Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction was grudging: He agreed to say he was sorry if anyone was offended. Advisers warned that would not be enough.Ivanka Trump made an emphatic case for a full-throated apology, according to several people who were present for the crisis discussion that unfolded in Mr. Trump\u2019s 26th-floor office. Raised amid a swirl of tabloid headlines, she had spent her adult life branding herself as her father\u2019s poised, family-focused daughter. She marketed her clothing line with slogans about female empowerment and was finishing a book on the topic. As she spoke, Mr. Trump remained unyielding. His daughter\u2019s eyes welled with tears, her face reddened, and she hurried out in frustration.Seven months later, Ms. Trump is her father\u2019s all-around West Wing confidante, an adviser whose portfolio appears to have few parameters, making her among the highest-ranking women in a senior staff stocked almost entirely with men.The two trade thoughts from morning until late at night, according to aides. Even though she has no government or policy experience, she plans to review some executive orders before they are signed, according to White House officials; some earlier orders had set off a firestorm. She calls cabinet officials on issues she is interested in, recently asking the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, about getting humanitarian aid into Syria. She set up a weekly meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.In interviews last week, she said she intended to act as a moderating force in an administration swept into office by nationalist sentiment. Other officials added that she had weighed in on topics including climate, deportation, education and refugee policy.Even as Ms. Trump said she was seeking to exert more influence, she acknowledged she was a novice about Washington. \u201cI\u2019m still at the early stages of learning how everything works,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know enough now to be a much more proactive voice inside the White House.\u201dMs. Trump, 35, a former model, entrepreneur and hotel developer, says she will focus on gender inequality in the United States and abroad, by aiming to create a federal paid leave program, more affordable child care and a global fund for women who are entrepreneurs, among other efforts. Her interest in gender issues grew out of a \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d hashtag and marketing campaign she devised a few years ago to help sell $99 pumps and $150 dresses. On Tuesday, the career advice book she worked on before the election, whose title echoes her hashtag, was released.In the two interviews last week, Ms. Trump talked about unleashing the economic potential of women \u2014 some of her phrases sounding uncannily like those of Hillary Clinton \u2014 and effused about finding a new role model in Eleanor Roosevelt, whose autobiography she is reading. Ms. Trump is reaching out to influential women like Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM, and Mary T. Barra, the C.E.O. of General Motors, and studying up on child care policy. She waved away questions about her motivations for embracing feminist themes.\u201cSuddenly, after my father declared his candidacy, it became that all the things that I was doing that I was praised for, the same people, the critics, viewed them through this different lens,\u201d she said. \u201cSomehow, all the same things they applauded me for as a millennial, as a female entrepreneur, were now viewed very cynically as opportunistic.\u201dSome former employees express surprise at her new policy interest, saying she was once reluctant to grant them maternity leave. But other observers call her the administration\u2019s best hope for progress on gender issues and say they are encouraged to see a presidential daughter, and a top member of a Republican White House, advocate federal paid family leave. (She intends to go beyond her father\u2019s campaign pledge and push to include both fathers and mothers, according to a White House official.)\u201cI hope she will go on to become a great champion in this area,\u201d said Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, which is working with Ms. Trump on funding female entrepreneurs.Ultimately, \u201cthe only test is whether she is able to achieve something other than personal gain,\u201d said Umber Ahmad, a banker turned baker and one of several women quoted in Ms. Trump\u2019s new book who now say they feel uneasy about being included in it.Those close to Ms. Trump say she is generally business-friendly and socially liberal. But she says that on many issues, she does not have strongly held views. (In the White House, she uses corporate terms \u2014 like \u201cbusiness plan\u201d \u2014 as much as partisan or political ones.)She has one skill unmatched by almost anyone else, family members and aides say: She can effectively convey criticism to a man who often refuses it from others, and can appeal to him to change his mind.\u201cI\u2019m his daughter. I\u2019ve known him my entire life. He trusts me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a hidden agenda. I\u2019m not looking to hit him to help myself.\u201dThough their demeanors are different \u2014 she is guarded where he is unfettered \u2014 Ms. Trump is more like her father than most people realize, according to people who know them both.But can she influence his actions as president? In her 35 years, she has left little traceable record of challenging or changing the man who raised her. Mr. Trump did tape an apology for the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording, but by then doing so had become a political necessity.Mr. Trump summons Ms. Trump to the Oval Office to ask her questions and hear her ideas. (She calls him \u201cDad,\u201d not \u201cMr. President.\u201d) If he asks his daughter about an unfamiliar subject more than twice, she will often do research so she can develop a view. Sometimes she seeks out Mr. Trump, telling other staff members, \u201cI need 10 minutes alone with my father.\u201d\u201cA lot of their real interactions happen when it\u2019s just the two of them,\u201d Jared Kushner, Ms. Trump\u2019s husband and fellow aide, said in a telephone interview.Alone with her father, Ms. Trump makes the case on what she sees as priorities, she said. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the mat on certain issues and I may still lose those,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe along the way I\u2019ve modified a position just slightly. And that\u2019s just great.\u201dNo matter how high-decibel Mr. Trump\u2019s divorces, no matter how outsize his statements, his daughter Ivanka rarely if ever rejected him, rebelled or distanced herself from him. When her parents\u2019 marriage ended before she turned 10, photographers snapped her picture on the way to school and helicopters circled over Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. His public and private statements raised eyebrows.\u201cThere were definitely times when I was younger I was going, \u2018Did you have to say that, Dad?\u2019 \u201d she told Oprah Winfrey in an interview.Mr. Trump was always working. \u201cHe was not the father to go and play games with them in Central Park or take them for a walk,\u201d Ivana Trump, Ivanka\u2019s mother, told Michael D\u2019Antonio, a biographer who shared his interviews with The Times. But Ivanka would stop by his office to say hello, or accompany him to construction sites, much as she sees him now in the West Wing or joins him on presidential excursions. She was impressed by her father\u2019s empire; he praised her constantly to others.Her older brother, Don Jr., was at boarding school when their parents divorced, and refused to speak to his father for a year; her younger brother, Eric, was very small. So Ivanka was the child who spent the most time with Mr. Trump, her mother said in an email to The Times. Even then, \u201cDonald knew he could trust her!\u201d she added.Others were sometimes cutting about it: \u201cShe\u2019s only here because of her dad,\u201d Jennifer Lopez remarked within earshot of the teenage Ivanka at a movie premiere, Ms. Roatta recalled. (Representatives for both women said that they did not recall the incident.)When her father started his own modeling agency a few years later, she was upset because he was sweeping into her domain \u2014 but she suppressed her anger, a friend said.Just as Ms. Trump joined the family real estate business in 2005, the Trump name became even more of a source of power and opportunity because of the new glow from the reality television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d in which her father starred. Even as Ms. Trump was in her mid-20s, learning her way around financing negotiations and construction details, she played an authority figure on the show, weighing in on contestants\u2019 merits during the tense boardroom scenes.The brainstorming solidified into a new motto: \u201cWomen Who Work.\u201dMs. Trump and her team set about tailoring her image to fit the concept. An internal document lists one of her challenges as \u201cperceived as rich and unrelatable.\u201d (An additional one: Most of her followers on social media were men.) Ms. Trump was told to post more down-to-earth pictures on her Instagram feed \u2014 less made-up model, more mommy.She hesitated to showcase her young children, but \u201cwe certainly had conversations about whether it was O.K. to put her kids on social media and we felt it was important to show who she was as a whole person,\u201d said Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand.But Ms. Trump\u2019s brand had not always lived up to its progressive image. Initially, former employees say, Ms. Trump had been reluctant to grant maternity leave, and she did not have a benefits package when she began hiring people to work for her.Marissa Kraxberger, a former executive who was pregnant when Ms. Trump offered her a job in the summer of 2013, recalled asking her future boss about paid leave. She described Ms. Trump as saying, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have maternity leave policy here; I went back to work one week after having my child, so that\u2019s just not something I\u2019m used to.\u201dMs. Kraxberger said that she and others pushed Ms. Trump to start offering a paid maternity leave policy. Ms. Klem said that the business was new when the issue arose, and that after consulting employees, the company put in place a policy for two-month paid family leave, as well as flexible working hours, in the summer of 2014.Ms. Trump had not seemed especially focused on gender politics or policy, according to people who have known her at various points throughout her life, beyond awareness of being the rare woman in the male-dominated world of real estate.Ms. Trump\u2019s company proposed a podcast about \u201cWomen Who Work\u201d that featured its leader as a chic business guru, interviewing success stories and business-feminism leaders. It was never made.\u201cDefinitely the brand changed her, and her interests really solidified,\u201d said Ms. Klem, who took over the day-to-day operations of the Ivanka Trump brand after the election. Soon, her office had a play area where children could use crayons and toys while their parents worked.Ms. Trump was shocked by the heat and fury of the campaign. Before, she had gotten letters of admiration, calling her a role model; now many of the letters she received were scathing. \u201cEverything that was ascribed to him suddenly, for my critics, became true of me,\u201d she said.Last week, speaking in her newly repainted West Wing office \u2014 stark white with metallic accents, a contrast with the creamy traditionalism of the rest of the West Wing \u2014 Ms. Trump appeared alternately energized, defensive and daunted. Behind the scenes, advisers say, she has been frustrated, unhappy about giving up her life in New York, and determined to prevail and make the best of a White House tour that she never expected. That morning, for the first time since she had moved into her Washington home, photographers had not gathered outside.It was her first full week in the role of assistant to the president, and she had just hired a chief of staff and was setting up meetings. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know about how government works and how things get done, but I feel I know enough now that I can be much more proactive about the type of change and reform that I\u2019d like to see happen,\u201d she said.As she spoke, the audience murmured with skepticism. (Contrary to some news reports, Ms. Trump was not loudly booed.) One moment, however, appeared more cutting. \u201cThe German audience is not that familiar with the concept of a first daughter,\u201d the moderator asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you, what is your role, and who are you representing: your father as president of the United States, the American people, or your business?\u201d\u201cWell, certainly not the latter,\u201d Ms. Trump said lightly, adding, \u201cI am rather unfamiliar with this role.\u201dQuestions about her father trail Ms. Trump everywhere now. Javier Palomarez, the chief executive of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, has been in touch with her in recent months about immigration and entrepreneurship, but their conversations have also turned more personal.In one of their earliest talks, soon after the inauguration, Ms. Trump hinted at her frustration. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your dad,\u201d she said to Mr. Palomarez. She asked if he would be \u201c100 percent absolutely proud of everything that came out of your father\u2019s mouth,\u201d especially when his father was age 70. She acknowledged that there was a difference between their fathers, Mr. Palomarez said \u2014 hers is the president.Playing the role of centrist advocate in a right-leaning administration would be a challenge for anyone, even those steeped in politics. As is the case with her father, Ms. Trump\u2019s newness to Washington and preference for straight-ahead business negotiations can result in painful collisions.White House officials said Ms. Trump was trying to find a common-sense solution amid the roar of abortion politics. But Planned Parenthood officials said they thought Ms. Trump\u2019s advice was na\u00efve, failing to understand how central reproductive choice was to the group\u2019s mission. Ms. Richards sharply criticized Ms. Trump for not publicly objecting to the Republican health care bill that failed in March, and Ms. Trump felt stung.Speaking generally, Ms. Trump complained in the interview that many advocacy groups were \u201cso wedded to the headline of the issue that sometimes differing perspectives and new information, when brought to the table, are viewed as an inconvenience because it undermines the thesis.\u201dDespite the tension, Ms. Trump helped preserve and increase funding for women\u2019s health in the government spending deal devised over the weekend, a White House official said. (A congressional aide noted that such spending remained the same, and did not increase.) But the victory may be short-lived: The coming bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act is likely to include a measure to strike Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding. And a State Department budget document recently circulated would cut funding for a women\u2019s rights initiative the agency participates in.For now, Ms. Trump acknowledges how much she has to learn and asks the public to be patient with her.\u201cI do believe that in time I\u2019ll get to the right place,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the short run I\u2019ll have missteps, and, in some cases, I\u2019ll take shots that I could have avoided if I had publicly said what I think.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really, really trying to learn,\u201d she added.Michael Barbaro and Alison Smale contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "How the G.O.P. Sabotaged Obamacare", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorObamacare is not \u201ccollapsing under its own weight,\u201d as Republicans are so fond of saying. It was sabotaged from the day it was enacted. And now the Republican Party should be held accountable not only for any potential replacement of the law, but also for having tried to starve it to death.The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released its accounting of the House Republicans\u2019 replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act, and the numbers are not pretty: It is projected to leave 23 million more Americans uninsured over 10 years, through deep cuts to insurance subsidies and Medicaid. The report underscores how the bill would cut taxes for the rich to take health care away from the less well-off.The A.C.A. is not perfect, and improvements to it would be welcome. But it worked in many respects and would have worked much better had Congress been a faithful guardian of the law.It is worth making a record of those Republican saboteurs\u2019 efforts. The A.C.A.\u2019s opponents brought a lawsuit against its requirement that people buy insurance \u2014 a Republican idea \u2014 the very day the statute was signed into law. The Supreme Court rejected that claim. But the court gave opponents a major victory on another front, ruling that Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid was optional for states. Yet another lawsuit seized on some sloppy language in the law to make the implausible argument that Congress did not provide for the insurance subsidies on which the law depends. The Supreme Court also rejected that challenge.But if the Republicans lost those cases, they succeeded in sowing the insurance markets with doubt and forcing states to slow down implementation while awaiting the court\u2019s decisions. That in turn may have reduced sign-ups, further destabilizing the insurance market. The second case challenging the subsidies was not decided until 2015, more than a year after the statute\u2019s critical 2014 deadline for implementation.Even worse, these lawsuits helped make the A.C.A. the salient partisan issue of the Obama administration, turning the law into the ultimate Republican litmus test: Implementing a state insurance exchange or expanding Medicaid, even when it seemed in a state\u2019s interest, became treasonous for the party. Nevertheless, about a dozen principled Republican governors bucked their party and expanded their programs.In 2014, the House brought a lawsuit, arguing that a critical piece of A.C.A. funding \u2014 the cost-sharing subsidies that pay insurers to lower premiums \u2014 had not been properly appropriated. For insurers, not knowing whether that money could be cut off \u2014 President Trump is still threatening not to pay them \u2014 has caused anxiety about whether to remain in the A.C.A. markets. More than 100 other suits have been filed, including challenges to contraception provisions and the requirement that employers provide insurance.On the political front, the Republicans targeted provisions of the law that provided crucial transitional financing to steady the insurance markets early in the program. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, calling the money an insurance \u201cbailout,\u201d sponsored a measure that prevented appropriation of some of those funds. The courts have issued mixed rulings on whether the federal government must pay, adding yet more instability to the insurance markets.The Affordable Care Act, like any major statute, surely could use adjustments. For example, the insurance subsidies were probably set too low initially. The Obama administration\u2019s decision to allow more people to stay on their old plans than originally expected may also have narrowed the new pool of insurance customers in ways that contributed to premium hikes. The Republican-controlled House never provided any additional implementation money after the initial appropriation set forth in the Affordable Care Act itself, forcing the Department of Health and Human Services to scrounge for needed funds.A caretaking Congress would have fixed what wasn\u2019t working. Instead, opponents did everything possible to shut off all the A.C.A.\u2019s financing \u2014 starvation intended to wreak havoc in the insurance markets and to make it falsely appear that the A.C.A.was collapsing because it was just bad policy.The irony is that the A.C.A. was vulnerable to this strategy because the Democrats had tried to compromise with the Republicans in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to build bipartisan support for the law. If the Democrats had instead enacted a single-payer policy \u2014 such as Medicare for all \u2014 the entire health care system would have been in the hands of the federal government, instead of dependent on the states and private insurers.Still, Republicans are using the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called collapse as an argument for a much stingier law, one that would leave states responsible for paying many health care costs. Some conservatives are using the assault on the A.C.A. not to assail its novel insurance provisions \u2014 which many people like \u2014 but rather to grind an old ax against the entire Medicaid program, which was enacted in 1965 to help the poor.As the Senate turns to its own bill, it still has time to preserve the parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working and, more importantly, strengthen those that could succeed with proper support. That would be responsible \u2014 and, indeed, is what should have happened all along.Abbe R.

{"Headline": "Goldman Buys $2.8 Billion Worth of Venezuelan Bonds, and an Uproar Begins", "Date": "2017-05-30", "News": "Supported byVenezuelan bonds would seem to be an unlikely target for global investors.The country is in near revolt and has barely enough ready cash to feed its people, much less pay the billions of dollars in debt that the government owes to its foreign lenders.Yet bonds issued by Venezuela\u2019s national oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, have attracted some of world\u2019s most sophisticated investors. They are betting that the government will use its dwindling supply of dollars to pay bondholders instead of importing food and medicine for its people.Now, Goldman Sachs\u2019 decision to snap up $2.8 billion worth of Pdvsa bonds maturing in 2022, at a 70 percent discount to the market price, has struck a nerve.The investment has caused a political uproar in Venezuela, where opposition forces have taken to the streets to protest the autocratic rule of the nation\u2019s unpopular president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Nearly 60 people have died in clashes, mainly between protesters and the police, in Caracas and other cities in recent months.Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, wrote a letter of protest to Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, accusing the Wall Street firm of looking to make a \u201cquick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people.\u201dGoldman Sachs has defended the deal, saying that many other investors, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, own the bonds and that its asset management division bought the securities on the secondary market, without interacting with the Venezuelan government.Nevertheless, the transaction highlights the extent to which investors are willing to take on increasing levels of political and economic risk as they seek high-yielding investments when interest rates still hover near zero.\u201cThere is a lot of interest in this trade,\u201d said Carlos de Sousa, an economist at Oxford Economics, a research company based in London. \u201cWe are in a low-rate environment, and these are dollar bonds with really high yields.\u201dAmong the large holders of Pdvsa bonds are BlackRock, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase and Ashmore, an emerging market specialist based in London.But none of those firms carry Goldman\u2019s reputation for being politically influential and financially opportunistic \u2014 a combination that has made it an easy global punching bag.At the root of what makes the bonds so attractive to investors, beyond their more than 20 percent returns, is the crucial role played by the Venezuelan oil company in providing foreign exchange to the embattled Maduro government.While Venezuela has been in economic crisis for more than two years, the surge of people to the streets began after its Supreme Court, which is loyal to Mr. Maduro, tried to dissolve the country\u2019s National Assembly in late March. The group of lawmakers, controlled by opposition parties, is considered the only government institution independent of the president.Mr. Maduro\u2019s growing authoritarianism is only the beginning of mounting grievances against Venezuela\u2019s ruling leftists, who have governed since President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took control of the country in 1999.Falling petroleum prices and years of economic mismanagement when oil revenues were high, have led to triple-digit inflation and left a majority of Venezuelans hardly able to buy sufficient food and other necessities. Even those who can afford meals most days have trouble finding basics like bread, eggs and sugar because of rampant shortages.Pdvsa brings in about 95 percent of the economy\u2019s dollars, so foreign investors believe that the government, even in a worst case, will do all it can to keep the company functioning.Mr. de Sousa also points out that unlike pure sovereign bonds issued by the government, Pdvsa securities lack legal mechanisms, like collective action clauses, which can help a government negotiate favorable terms with foreign bond holders if it defaults on its debt.Moreover, investors have noted that in the last year, as Venezuela\u2019s economic situation has deteriorated sharply, the government has paid out billions of dollars to foreign investors holding the oil company bonds.The Pdvsa trade is the latest sign that foreign investors are becoming bolder in investing in the bonds of governments in far-flung locales.In recent months, higher risk countries such as Turkey, Russia and Brazil have been at the forefront of this trend.Driving the bet, analysts say, is a view that emerging market economies, regardless of their political and economic challenges, are no longer willing to face the wrath of bond investors by defaulting on their debts.That is because global investment giants like BlackRock and Goldman have become ready sources of financing, quick to lend billions in dollars or even local currencies, to governments in Africa, Latin America and Asia that in the past relied on banks.Perhaps no country is as reliant on the kindness of risk-happy foreign bond investors as Venezuela. According to the research firm Exotix, Venezuela has a financing requirement of $17 billion in 2017, yet its central bank reserves are a paltry $10 billion.As investors see it, if you can buy a Pdvsa bond at 30 cents on the dollar, which also provides a double-digit yield, even if this government \u2014 or another for than matter \u2014 has to default, the gains made on the investment would be enough to overcome any loss.While Goldman Sachs defended its trade by saying that it bought the bonds on the open market from a broker, bankers and traders say the money ultimately ended up in Venezuela\u2019s treasury because the seller was an institution with ties to the government.Nonetheless, the threat by Mr. Borges, the opposition leader, that a new government would not make good on these bonds seems unlikely.That is because these bonds carry covenants aimed at preventing an issuer from favoring one bond holder over another. So paying BlackRock or JP Morgan and not Goldman would open Venezuela to lawsuits.All of which suggests that, despite the controversy over the Goldman trade, foreign investors will keep lining up to buy Pdvsa bonds.\u201cThis is the only source of foreign currency the government has,\u201d said Mr. de Sousa, the Venezuelan expert at Oxford. \u201cSo I think the government will continue to sell more of these types of bonds to foreign investors.\u201dNicholas Casey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Here are some of the addresses he frequented:This spot was the first Capitol building of the United States, where George Washington took the oath of office as the nation\u2019s first president, observed by a crowd of 10,000. Hamilton watched the ceremony from the balcony of his home at 58 (now 57) Wall Street, several yards away. The original hall was destroyed in 1812; the current structure was built in 1842.The Hamiltons resided for 10 years at 58 Wall Street. But Hamilton also had law offices at 69 Stone Street, 12 Garden Street (today Exchange Place), 63 Pine Street, and 58 Partition Street (now Fulton Street) \u2014 though none of the structures remain. After he and his wife, Eliza, built their family estate in northern Manhattan, Hamilton kept a townhouse at 54 Cedar Street. He spent his last night there.On the site of the Bank of New York, which was founded by Hamilton, this museum is devoted to American finance and financial history. On display are documents signed by Hamilton, copies of his published works, and replicas of the dueling pistols that Aaron Burr fatally fired at him. (Hamilton\u2019s pistols are on private display at the JPMorgan Chase building in Manhattan.)One of the oldest structures in Manhattan, this museum and restaurant was a thriving tavern during the Revolutionary War \u2014 and served as a headquarters for the Continental Army. On July 4, 1804, Hamilton and Burr both attended an event here for the Society of the Cincinnati. It was the last time they met before their fateful duel.Hamilton and Burr chose to meet here on July 11, 1804, as New York\u2019s laws against dueling were severe. Today, it\u2019s surrounded by Hamilton Park, which offers views of the Manhattan skyline. A commemorative plaque indicates the site of the dueling grounds.Hamilton spent his final hours at the home of his friend William Bayard, director of the Bank of New York. He received visits from friends and relatives before dying on July 12. Despite the commemorative plaque, the house may actually have been slightly north.Hamilton\u2019s funeral procession on July 14, 1804, wound through Lower Manhattan, ending at Trinity Church. He is buried in the graveyard south of the church, with Eliza by his side \u2014 a final resting spot in the heart of the city he loved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Older Women and Medical Marijuana: A New Growth Industry", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byRetiringJeanine Moss never expected to get into the cannabis industry. But that was before her hip-replacement surgery.Ms. Moss, 62, of Marina del Rey, Calif., had quit her job as a marketing consultant before she had her hip done in 2014. As she left the hospital, her doctors handed her a \u201cshopping bag filled with opiates,\u201d she said. The drugs made her disoriented and woozy.So she switched to medical marijuana, which is legal in California and was familiar to her, having grown up in the nearby Venice section of Los Angeles. Within a week, she had tossed away her pharmaceuticals.As it turned out, Ms. Moss was in good company: Many of her friends were also using cannabis to manage their ailments. Slightly embarrassed about carrying around a drug associated with naughty high school students, the older women would lament that they had nowhere to stash their drugs.\u201cEveryone was pulling baggies out of their Gucci and Louis Vuitton purses, and I thought, \u2018Why are we sneaking around like guilty teenagers?\u2019\u201d Ms. Moss said.\u201cWhat other industry is growing so fast there\u2019s the opportunity and low cost of entry?\u201d Ms. Moss said. \u201cEntrenched opportunities already have their systems set up. This hasn\u2019t been created yet.\u201dHer story is typical of the women in their 50s, 60s and 70s who have started up businesses in the world of pot. Inspired partly by their own use of the drug for pain relief, or by caring for others who use it for their own aches, these women see viable business opportunities and view their work as therapeutic for their customers.\u201cA lot of women have this family recipe, or they were making a certain kind of tincture for a loved one who was suffering. Now that pot is legal, they\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, that thing you were making for Grandma could be a real product.\u2019\u201d\u201cIn a lot of other industries, there are hundreds of years of history of who is successful and who is not, and there are glass ceilings to be broken,\u201d Ms. Whiteman said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no norm here. Everyone is figuring it out together.\u201dThese are women, Mr. Hudak said, \u201cwho have the type of background and skill sets that lend themselves to be highly useful in an industry like this: lobbying, consulting, finance, operations.\u201dAfter her mother died in 2012, she moved back east and applied for a license to open a dispensary. \u201cI thought, for the last stage of my life, I\u2019d like to do something to give back,\u201d Ms. Heatley said. \u201cHow much of a glow can you get from a real estate transaction?\u201dOther entrepreneurs, like Frances Sue Taylor, 69, are specifically targeting seniors. She has been teaching older people about medical marijuana for the last six years and plans in the next few months to open a dispensary in Berkeley, Calif., just for people 50 and up.Ms. Taylor, a former Catholic school principal, used to think marijuana was a \u201chard-core drug like crack or cocaine,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone would have told me 12 years ago that I\u2019d be an advocate for cannabis, I\u2019d say, \u2018You\u2019ve been smoking too much.\u2019\u201dBut now? \u201cI get so much gratification from this work, and it\u2019s so rewarding to see people get healed,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life is better than ever. I\u2019m healthy, and I\u2019m starting a new business at 69.\u201dLike Ms. Moss, she arrived at her calling through pain. About four years ago, after hip-replacement surgery, Ms. Kusher began massaging coconut oil infused with THC into her side. It helped. So did homemade \u201cprotein balls\u201d \u2014 peanut butter, sunflower seeds, protein powder and 15 milligrams of THC.It occurred to her that her products might have the same effect on other people. Soon, she got certified to sell balms and bake mixes to dispensaries in San Diego.\u201cI\u2019ve always grown plants and flowers and herbs, because I like growing,\u201d said Ms. Kusher, who has a greenhouse filled with 30 pot plants of six different varieties. (Coincidentally, \u201ckush\u201d is a term among pot smokers for a high-grade strain of cannabis.)Ms. Kusher said she was doing better than she had ever imagined, physically and financially. \u201cThis is the first time in my life I can completely support myself and my lifestyle,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of an area in California.

{"Headline": "Trump Looms as Kushner Companies Courts Investors in China", "Date": "2017-05-07", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Like many American firms that come to China looking for money, Kushner Companies tried to woo a Shanghai audience with promises of big returns and a path toward living in the United States.But for Bi Ting, who attended the Kushner event on Sunday, part of the appeal was political: Jared Kushner is the son-in-law of \u2014 and a powerful adviser to \u2014 President Trump. Virtually unknown in China just months ago, he is now recognized here as a deeply influential figure in American politics.\u201cThe Trump relationship is an extra point for me,\u201d Ms. Bi said, adding that she and her husband had not decided whether to invest.At the event in Beijing, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister, Nicole Meyer, cited her brother\u2019s service to the company, which he led as chief executive until January. She said the project in Jersey City \u201cmeans a lot to me and my entire family.\u201dMr. Kushner has said he has stepped back from the day-to-day operations of the family business. But government ethics filings show that he and Ivanka Trump, his wife and the president\u2019s daughter, continue to benefit from their stake in Kushner Companies\u2019 real estate business and other investments, which is worth as much as $600 million.The Shanghai event, at the opulent Four Seasons Hotel, was patrolled by burly security guards who screened those in attendance and kept journalists outside, in an elevator lobby. The organizers had refused on Saturday to allow late registration as word spread of the Beijing event. One guard at the Shanghai event was heard saying that at least some of the participants would be leaving through a private back exit.But some who attended described an investor pitch similar to the one in Beijing, and Mr. Trump\u2019s political power was palpable at the Shanghai event even if his name went unsaid. As on Saturday in Beijing, one slide that was presented to the Shanghai audience, describing who will decide the future of the visa program for foreign investors, included a photograph of Mr. Trump, as shown by a snapshot taken by an audience member.Kushner Companies\u2019 marketing push comes as Mr. Kushner is emerging as a crucial voice on China relations, brokering meetings between his father-in-law and top Chinese government officials.While the Trump connection piqued the interest of many people in attendance, such events soliciting investors for projects in the United States are not unusual in China. The so-called EB-5 visa program awards foreign investors the right to live in the United States for two years and a path to permanent residency, in exchange for investments of at least $500,000 in American development projects. A bright red line near the top of the posters in the Four Seasons lobby prominently mentioned EB-5 visas.Although the program was created as a way to finance projects in economically troubled neighborhoods, it has instead turned into a form of cheap financing for luxury real estate developers. Applicants are primarily seeking the visa, so they typically do not seek a significant return on their investment.The United States Government Accountability Office, the investigative branch of Congress, has criticized the visa program for its lax safeguards against illicit sources of money.Kushner Companies has tapped the program before: The firm raised about $50 million from Chinese investors in EB-5 funding for another project in Jersey City, a Trump-branded luxury apartment tower that opened in late 2016.As part of the marketing effort to finance that building, a firm used by Kushner Companies distributed a Chinese-subtitled video leading viewers behind the wheel of a car in New Jersey accompanied by \u201cWoke Up This Morning,\u201d the theme song from the television show \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201dKushner Companies has declined to identify the investors it found for that building.Mr. Kushner was a manager or president at several entities associated with the Jersey City project that is now seeking Chinese investors. He divested his interests in that project by selling them to a family trust of which he is not a beneficiary, said Blake Roberts, a lawyer at WilmerHale who is advising Mr. Kushner on ethics issues.Mr. Kushner has divested his stakes in dozens of entities used to hold family company investments, although he remains the beneficiary of trusts that hold stakes in hundreds of others.\u201cMs. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,\u201d said Risa Heller, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman. \u201cKushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyer\u2019s intention.\u201dMany in China start looking for overseas residency and passports after they have children. They fear the effects of smog on their children\u2019s lungs \u2014 the smog was heavy in Shanghai on Sunday, and an internationally comparable index of air quality showed that the pollution was seven times the level in New York.Many families also consider overseas schools to be preferable to those in China, where ferocious academic competition keeps children doing homework until late at night even in elementary school, in preparation for a national college entrance exam that can be the difference between riches and ruin.Ms. Bi, who is 34 and is expecting her first child, said, \u201cI want my child to live in a relatively relaxed environment where he or she could be himself or herself and lead a diverse life, instead of having no choice but to take the college entrance exam in China.\u201dStill, she said, investing in the Kushner project would not give her and her husband enough time to get to the United States before her baby was born.Many people in China worry that the window for obtaining an EB-5 visa may be closing. Although Mr. Trump has softened his language considerably in recent weeks, he was a vociferous critic of China during his presidential campaign. He has said he will take a tough line on immigration, although he did not take aim at investors in real estate projects.The Kushner project promoted to Chinese investors, called Kushner 1, includes two towers and nearly 1,500 luxury apartments, with construction to begin early next year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Homes Built for Healing", "Date": "2017-05-12", "News": "Supported by13 PhotosWhen Amber Gallaty, 37, took up residence at a former tuberculosis sanitarium on the Upper East Side, she didn\u2019t realize that her new home would be a restorative place for her, too.\u201cI was going through a divorce when I moved here,\u201d said Ms. Gallaty, the founder and chief executive of the Gallavant Group, a communications agency. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the light or the open courtyards. It just felt like a healing place for me.\u201dThe Cherokee Apartments, between East 77th and 78th Streets, and York Avenue and Cherokee Place, opened in 1912 as the Shively Sanitary Tenements. The development was conceived by Dr. Henry L. Shively, the head of the tuberculosis clinic at Presbyterian Hospital, and designed by the architect Henry Atterbury Smith for low-income tuberculosis patients and their families. Financed by Anne Harriman Vanderbilt, the four buildings in the complex were designed to be filled with light and air. The floor-to-ceiling windows, balconies and open stairwells all had a curative purpose.Ms. Gallaty took up residence in one of the buildings in 2012, first as a subletter, but then quickly decided to stay on. She rents her small but light-filled first-floor studio for $1,675 a month. Her previous place, also on the Upper East Side and also on the first floor, was a \u201cdingy, depressing New York apartment,\u201d she said. But when she entered the Cherokee, her feelings could not have been more different.\u201cI walked into the building and I thought, this is so amazing,\u201d Ms. Gallaty said. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a bit small but the windows are so big, and there\u2019s the open courtyard.\u201dAfter researching the history of the building online, and overhearing some of its lore in the laundry room from longtime residents, she saw the many parallels between the building\u2019s former use and her modern life there.\u201cIt could have been the time I was going through in my life, but there is a feeling when I come home that I\u2019ve never had before,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I walk into the building, I almost breathe a sigh of relief. It just feels very comforting to be here. Even in this tiny little space, it\u2019s so homey.\u201dChristopher Kromer, a licensed associate real estate broker with Halstead Property who has sold multiple apartments in the building over the years, is also enchanted by the Cherokee\u2019s design elements. They are at once functional and beautiful, and were medically cutting-edge at the time they were built, with a focus on creating healthful and sanitary living conditions.\u201cAll of the former residents would have come from real tenements, mostly on the Lower East Side,\u201d Mr. Kromer said, \u201cwhere tiny air shafts served as the only source of light and air, and where multiple families shared one toilet per floor.\u201d\u201cArchitecturally speaking,\u201d he added, \u201cpeople love the triple-sash floor-to-ceiling windows and high ceilings, the building\u2019s courtyards as well as the unique internal exterior staircase, which leads right into your apartment. It all has a very Parisian feel to me.\u201dThe Cherokee is also home to Kate Kolendo, 43, who lives in the building next to Ms. Gallaty\u2019s, in a fifth-floor studio she bought in 2001 for $162,500. A project manager at the Association of American Publishers, she echoed Mr. Kromer\u2019s sentiments, saying she felt \u201ctransported\u201d by her environment.\u201cIt conjures up beautiful, bohemian Mim\u00ec falling in love,\u201d she said, referring to the opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d \u201cand then tragically dying in her former lover\u2019s arms in a garret apartment in Paris.\u201dDuring her apartment search all over the Upper East Side, Ms. Kolendo discounted the \u201cboxy studios in high-rise buildings,\u201d which lacked character and charm. A self-described \u201csucker for history,\u201d she said that the Cherokee\u2019s past solidified her decision to purchase. The fact that the buildings are all walk-ups seemed a small inconvenience when compared with the incredible atmosphere.\u201cAs you walk down 77th from Lexington, each block gets quieter and quieter,\u201d Ms. Kolendo said. \u201cYou come to this street and it\u2019s leafy green, there\u2019s a park at the end, and it\u2019s quiet. The stairs are a challenge, but when I come home I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201dPhilip Sutton, a librarian in the Milstein Division of the New York Public Library, said he often encountered New Yorkers who were curious to research the history of their buildings via databases, maps and old photographs.\u201cPeople are naturally curious about who lived in their New York City homes before themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat were they like? What happened within these four walls? What was a building formerly used for? Was it a store, farm, factory, rowhouse or hospital?\u201dMedical facilities have been abandoned over time for a variety of reasons, Mr. Sutton said. It might have been a need to expand, or to follow clientele to a new neighborhood, or because new medical practices required a more modern structure. Some of these buildings, like the New York Cancer Hospital on Central Park West, have historical significance and architectural flair. \u201cWe see abandoned churches and houses of worship repurposed as apartment buildings \u2014 why not a hospital as a residential building?\u201d he said.In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Adina Halperin, 22, a recent college graduate, said she had learned about the history of the home she shares with her parents, the former Skene Sanitarium, from a cafeteria worker at her former middle school.\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know this used to be a hospital until I had this conversation with this lunch lady,\u201d Ms. Halperin said. \u201cWhen I was in middle school, I was kind of shy. She picked up on it early on. One day I was upset, she wanted to talk and asked me where I lived. And she said, \u2018Oh, my husband was born in there.\u2019 He had passed away a year or two before that conversation.\u201dHer parents, Mark and Marcia Halperin, both retired teachers, purchased their two-bedroom apartment in 1994, when Marcia was pregnant with Adina.\u201cWe looked at this place in early November when the light was coming at the right angle; it was filled with light,\u201d Mrs. Halperin recalled. \u201cWe looked and looked and tramped up and down many staircases of brownstones. And we did that for about 40 apartments. And then we said, \u2018Let\u2019s go back to look at the first place.\u2019 \u201d The light would be ideal for entertaining and the high ceilings would give them plenty of room for their books. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s when we settled on this,\u201d she added.Mrs. Halperin said she was often approached by strangers who told her they knew somebody who was born in the building, which was built in 1884. \u201cA woman who\u2019s lived in the neighborhood a long time said her sister was born here, and her brother had his tonsils out,\u201d she said.Eileen Richter, an associate real estate broker with Brown Harris Stevens, said the building was a unique option among the many brownstones in Park Slope.\u201cThe building is charming; you walk through the old-fashioned Victorian gates and right into the beautifully landscaped courtyard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really advertised the sanitarium past, but the interior common hallways do feel like it was an institution. The large elevator that was clearly made to accommodate gurneys is a big tip-off.\u201dMrs. Halperin, who was born in Caledonian Hospital, on Prospect Park South, which has also been converted to apartments, said her home offered both city and sanctuary. \u201cI actually feel that contrast,\u201d she said. \u201cThe windows in the front of the apartment face the street; the school is on the block. You do feel there that it\u2019s city and busy with cars. And while you still hear city sounds here in the kitchen, you do hear birds. It really is an enclave.\u201dFarther south in Park Slope, Amihai Ulman, 42, and his family have done their best to preserve the details of the six-unit building on 12th Street that they purchased in 2003 for $689,000. Evidence points to the home\u2019s previous life as a sanitarium.Ready for another project, they purchased the second building. They learned its history from an elderly neighbor who had lived in a house across the street since she was 8 years old; her parents had bought the house from the original owners.The couple in the building next door to the Ulmans\u2019 newer home also knew some of its history. \u201cThe story was that both of these buildings were built as a pair, probably in the early 1860s, and that their house was built as a quarters for nurses and doctors,\u201d Mr. Ulman said. His house, he added, was a sanitarium for soldiers returning from the Civil War.Although the Ulmans were interested in homes with character, it was initially the price that drew them to both the former sanitarium and their two-family home, which they believe may have operated as an inn.\u201cWe were just driving around and saw an open house,\u201d Mrs. Ulman said. \u201cPeople in front of us walked up the steps and turned right around and walked down. That was what attracted us, that it was what nobody else wanted.\u201dLuke Alberts, a licensed associate real estate broker at Halstead Property who has rented the apartments in both of Mr. Ulman\u2019s buildings, said, \u201cCustomers have been enchanted upon learning that the building had been a sanitarium.\u201dThe Ulmans have tenants in both buildings and reside in the former sanitarium with their three children and Mr. Ulman\u2019s father. Mr. Ulman took on the renovation of the home himself, and was surprised to find a treasure trove of artifacts underneath the hearthstone of the fireplace.\u201cI put my shovel into it and started seeing stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was like, whoa, this is very cool. We saved it. It\u2019s literally been in a box for years.\u201d Items unearthed from the fireplace include an invitation to a dance, with an envelope dated 1885; a clothespin; spectacles; and a piece of a newspaper.Back at the Cherokee, Ms. Kolendo gave a nod to her building\u2019s past, when, on a warm spring afternoon, she threw open the floor-to-ceiling window to her balcony to \u201ctake the air,\u201d just as the former residents would have done. The place has become a respite for her as well.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be in the city sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are on top of you all of the time. You\u2019re in a gritty dark subway. There\u2019s so much heaviness that comes with city life. So just walking into a place that\u2019s open and light and airy \u2014 it just makes you feel better mentally.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It ranked 13th in worldwide announced deals, according to Thomson Reuters.

{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler, in Settlement Talks With U.S., Is Under More Pressure", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, one of the world\u2019s biggest carmakers, said on Thursday that it was in talks with the Department of Justice to settle an investigation into diesel deception, as growing evidence points to the carmaker\u2019s use of illegal software to evade emissions tests.The settlement talks add to the pressure on Fiat Chrysler at a time of meager profitability.The German carmaker Volkswagen, which faced a similar scandal, has been hit with billions of dollars of settlements and fines, and seen several executives investigated or charged. Though Fiat Chrysler\u2019s financial damage is unlikely to be as costly as Volkswagen\u2019s, the emissions cheating, if proved, could still be expensive.The investigation is following much the same path.Now, a new academic study is lending credence to the claims.Researchers from the University of the Ruhr in Bochum, Germany, and the University of California, San Diego, said they found evidence of a so-called defeat device in a diesel Fiat 500X, a compact S.U.V. sold in Europe. Software in the engine\u2019s computer reduced pollution controls 26 minutes after the car was started, according to the study. A standard emissions test procedure lasts a little less than 26 minutes. Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on allegations of cheating in the 500X.The authors, who are professors and graduate students, provided The New York Times and several other news organizations with advance copies of the study, which is scheduled to be published next week.The company said in a statement that it was in talks with the Justice Department and \u201cis seeking a fair and equitable resolution to this matter.\u201d But Fiat Chrysler also said it would defend itself \u201cagainst any claims that the company deliberately installed defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.\u201dThe term \u201cdefeat device\u201d refers to software installed on vehicles to allow them to deliberately evade pollution standards by detecting when a car is being tested in a laboratory for its emissions levels.Volkswagen\u2019s use of such illegal software in 600,000 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche diesel cars sold in the United States, out of 11 million fitted with the device worldwide, has caused it enormous problems.Six employees have been charged in the United States over the deception and another has pleaded guilty while Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive is being investigated by German prosecutors. The company has already agreed to pay criminal and civil penalties of $4.3 billion under the terms of a plea agreement with American authorities.But other carmakers are also under scrutiny.Daimler, the maker of Mercedes cars, has disclosed that the Justice Department is investigating emissions of its diesel vehicles in the United States and that prosecutors in Stuttgart, Germany, have opened a criminal investigation. The French government is investigating possible emissions fraud by Renault-Nissan.In Europe, diesel pollution has become a major political issue. Volkswagen\u2019s cheating exposed weak enforcement of emissions regulations by governments protecting their domestic automakers. European governments have been pointing fingers at one another, straining relations.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In all the cases, the countries are accused of not enforcing common European rules on emissions.Studies by the French, British and German governments have established that diesel vehicles by virtually all carmakers pollute far more on the road than in the carefully controlled conditions of an emissions testing lab. In a French study, the Fiat 500X was one of the cars with the biggest discrepancies between road and lab emissions.With the exception of Volkswagen, though, European carmakers have been able to escape consequences because of loopholes in European rules that allow carmakers to throttle down pollution controls to protect the engine.Carmakers have made liberal use of that exception. But there is a growing backlash from residents angry about bad air quality caused by diesel cars in big cities like Paris and Stuttgart, the home of Daimler.Diesel sales in Europe have been slumping as buyers become more aware of the cost to human health and the environment. That is a big threat to carmakers. Diesel accounts for about half of all cars sold in Europe, and it is also crucial for automotive manufacturers to meet fuel efficiency standards. Diesel engines burn fuel more efficiently than gasoline ones, but they produce more harmful nitrogen oxides.The researchers sought to detect defeat devices by analyzing engine software, which is less time consuming and less expensive than analyzing tailpipe emissions from moving cars.The study, financed by the European Union and the National Science Foundation in the United States, asserts that documentation for the Fiat 500X\u2019s engine software described two modes.One mode, labeled \u201chomologation,\u201d or approval, kept emissions low. During a second mode, labeled \u201cRDE\u201d \u2014 an acronym for \u201creal driving emissions\u201d \u2014 pollution control equipment was dialed back to improve fuel economy.Fiat Chrysler declined to comment on the findings of the report.The study also raises question about Bosch, the German company that supplied engine computers and software to both Fiat and Volkswagen.\u201cWe find strong evidence that both defeat devices were created by Bosch and then enabled by Volkswagen and Fiat for their respective vehicles,\u201d the study said.Bosch said it could not comment in detail because of continuing investigations and lawsuits.But it said in a statement, \u201cBosch supplies these components to the automaker\u2019s specifications. It is always each automaker\u2019s responsibility to calibrate and integrate components into the overall vehicle system, as well as to obtain approval from the local registration authorities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Considers Moving Student Loans from Education Department to Treasury", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe Trump administration is considering moving responsibility for overseeing more than $1 trillion in student debt from the Education Department to the Treasury Department, a switch that would radically change the system that helps 43 million students finance higher education.The potential change surfaced in a scathing resignation memo sent late Tuesday night by James Runcie, the head of the Education Department\u2019s federal student aid program. Mr. Runcie, an Obama-era holdover, was appointed in 2011 and reappointed in 2015. He cut short his term, which was slated to run until 2020, after clashing with the Trump administration and Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, over this proposal and other issues.Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, declined to comment on his departure or on talks with Treasury.\u201cThe secretary is looking forward to identifying a qualified candidate to lead and restore trust in F.S.A.,\u201d Ms. Hill said, referring to federal student aid.A shift in handling federal student aid is being weighed as the Trump administration and Ms. DeVos consider overhauling the Department of Education. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget for 2018 slashes funding for the department by nearly 50 percent. Moving one of its core functions to Treasury would significantly diminish the agency\u2019s power. It could also alter the mission of the student loan program.\u201cThe reason the federal student aid programs live within the Education Department is because that\u2019s the agency that has as its goal increasing educational opportunities within the United States,\u201d said David Bergeron, who left the Education Department in 2013 after 35 years. \u201cThat is not the Treasury Department\u2019s goal. Its job is to pay for the business of the government.\u201dScrapping or shrinking the Education Department has long been a popular Republican goal, dating from the Reagan administration. President Trump embraced the idea, saying in his book \u201cCrippled America\u201d that the department should either be eliminated or have \u201cits power and reach\u201d cut. In February, a House Republican introduced a bill to terminate the agency.In his resignation memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Runcie said that senior members of his department had met that day with Treasury officials and discussed \u201cholding numerous meetings and retreats\u201d to outline a process for \u201ctransferring all or a portion\u201d of the student aid office\u2019s functions to the Treasury Department.\u201cThis is just another example of a project that may provide some value but will certainly divert critical resources and increase operational risk in an increasingly challenging environment,\u201d Mr. Runcie wrote.Moving the federal student aid unit probably would require congressional action. But even in a fractured Congress, it could win bipartisan support.During the Obama administration, the idea of shifting responsibility for the student loan program to the Treasury Department had some supporters. As the number and dollar amount of student loans grew, the Education Department found itself managing more than a trillion dollars in assets, a portfolio bigger than most banks.\u201cThe Education Department is a policy shop with a trillion-dollar bank on the side,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, a former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who also briefly worked for the Education Department.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d said James Kvaal, a former deputy under secretary of education in the Obama administration. \u201cBecause the Education Department and the I.R.S. are separated, we\u2019ve built these clunky systems that get in the way of achieving the goals of the income-based program. Linking the two would be much easier for students, and have stronger integrity for taxpayers.\u201dBut critics, including a high level official from Mr. Obama\u2019s Treasury Department, warned that the move could hurt students.\u201cMoving the agency that is supposed to provide stewardship for student loan borrowers to an agency that is working on a shoestring with a skeletal crew strikes me as a recipe for a policy disaster,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was the deputy Treasury Secretary under President Obama.Others worry about how students would fare under the Treasury Department.The Treasury Department recently conducted a pilot project in which its employees tried to collect on defaulted loans, a job the Education Department contracts out to private companies.The experiment, which began in mid-2015, did not end well.For now, even without the shift, some at the federal student aid office are rattled, according to one person who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. After Mr. Runcie resigned, at least one employee was in tears, the person said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches\u2019: A Water Crisis on Long Island", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byOAKDALE, N.Y. \u2014 The Great South Bay, flanked by Fire Island and the South Shore of Long Island, once produced half the shellfish consumed in the United States, and supported 6,000 jobs in the early 1970s.Since then, the health of the bay has declined. Housing development meant more septic tanks depositing more nitrogen in the ground. The nitrogen flowed to rivers and the Great South Bay, leading to algae blooms. It depleted salt marshes that serve as fish habitat and suppressed oxygen levels.One result is that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. The annual harvest of hard clams, for example, has fallen more than 90 percent since 1980.After sweeping legislation that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in April, Suffolk County and other local governments in New York are hoping to deal with their aging \u2014 or absent \u2014 sewer lines, drinking water systems and other water infrastructure. The law, the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, allocates $2.5 billion to a variety of projects, as concerns about the safety of drinking water are growing.The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. For years, nitrogen from leaky septic tanks has seeped into groundwater and eventually into rivers and bays.\u201cWhat we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,\u201d said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. \u201cEvery water body is listed as impaired. We have dead rivers, closed beaches, harmful algal blooms.\u201dBefore signing the law on Long Island in late April, Mr. Cuomo noted that a quarter of New York\u2019s 610 sewage treatment plants were operating past their useful life.\u201cWe\u2019re living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents,\u201d he said.In addition to the new water infrastructure financing, the state budget allotted $40 million to build two sewer systems in business districts on the North Shore in Suffolk County. And there was $5 million for Suffolk County and the Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University to develop new methods of removing contaminants from drinking water.While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state\u2019s aging water infrastructure.On Long Island, which is already grappling with hazardous waste at scores of active Superfund sites, the geology poses special challenges. With scant wastewater treatment, Suffolk County sits atop an aquifer that provides virtually all of its drinking water, and the sandy soil allows nitrogen to seep into it.Nassau County, just west of Suffolk, has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. The main reason that a county as populous as Suffolk has remained on septic systems, county officials say, is the legacy of the last attempt at installing a system \u2014 the infamous Southwest Sewer District.The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials.Suffolk County is eager to catch up to Nassau on wastewater treatment, but officials say new sewer systems are prohibitively expensive. One project on the drawing board, for instance, will cover about 8,200 parcels bordering four rivers that feed into the Great South Bay. The price tag is $383 million.Instead, the county\u2019s strategy is to coax homeowners to replace antiquated septic tanks with high-tech \u201cdenitrification systems\u201d \u2014 small units that cost more than older septic systems but remove most of the nitrogen from wastewater. Mr. Bellone said Suffolk hoped to tap the new state fund to help property owners acquire the systems.Suffolk officials have laid the groundwork for the new type of individual systems, which cost $15,000 to $20,000. Using a lottery, the county offered 19 homeowners free units and studied their performance. Officials have also written new regulations to allow the technology and provided training to contractors.When the water infrastructure law was enacted, Suffolk was set to start a denitrification pilot program. The idea was to make grants and low-interest loans available to 400 homeowners whose properties are in sensitive areas. Mr. Bellone now sees the potential to \u201cbump up the pilot even further,\u201d to perhaps 5,000 homes.The challenge, however, is persuading homeowners to replace their septic tanks.\u201cThe problem with an old system is that unless it\u2019s manifesting itself in some physical fashion, with waste bubbling to the surface, most people don\u2019t know their system is failing,\u201d Mr. Bellone said.Nitrogen is more harmful to coastal ecosystems than to sources of drinking water. According to Christopher Gobler, a professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University, the federal standard for drinking water is 10 milligrams per liter, but anything above one milligram per liter will have an impact on coastal waters. In Suffolk County, the average concentration of nitrogen in groundwater is four milligrams per liter, he said.\u201cWhen it\u2019s working perfectly, it\u2019s perfectly transferring the nitrogen to the groundwater, and that nitrogen triggers a series of events in the bay,\u201d explained Dr. Gobler, whose center is developing new passive systems to remove nitrogen.Richard Remmer is the third generation of his family to own the Snapper Inn, a restaurant in the hamlet of Oakdale on a bank of the Connetquot River in Islip. \u201cThirty years ago, all of our clams came from the bay,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s zero.\u201dLike other residents near the bay in Islip, Mr. Remmer is desperate for a sewer system. The water table is so high here, he said, that some septic systems sit in water, and residents must choose between showering or doing laundry because drainage is so poor.Suffolk has hired an engineering firm to design a sewer line that would run beneath Montauk Highway, serving a few of Islip\u2019s hamlets, from Oakdale to Sayville.Peter Scully, a deputy county executive and Suffolk\u2019s water czar, said that the sewer trunk alone would run to $45 million, and that connections to several thousand houses could reach $450 million. But given the high water table, sewers make more sense than individual systems, he said.The project, as yet unfunded, could benefit from the new state financing. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to get every dollar we can out of the $2.5 billion,\u201d Mr. Scully said.Ultimately, officials say, Suffolk County needs recurring revenue to subsidize new sewers and individual denitrification units, whether a surcharge on water bills or some other tax. The new state money is significant, Mr. Bellone said, but not sufficient, given the needs across the state\u2019s 62 counties.\u201cOver the next 20 years, I\u2019d like to see that we\u2019ve resolved this crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken decades to get here, but I think from where I sit today, we can solve this in one generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Everyone is there to learn about what to do with his or her money. All of a sudden, the door to the room opens, and in walks the much-anticipated speaker. Who do you think it is?If you said Warren Buffett or the retired Fidelity ace Peter Lynch, you\u2019re wrong. The famous speaker is Numbers.That\u2019s right, Numbers.You know Numbers, right? Numbers is that really smart person who is always right and always rational and whose suggestions fit nicely into a calculator or spreadsheet. Numbers is the gatekeeper for truth. And when Numbers speaks, all of your other friends \u2014 Feelings, Emotions and Intuition \u2014 must shut up and listen. Those are just the rules.My question is: Why not?When I think about personal finance, I feel like we\u2019ve created a world for something we aren\u2019t. This world we\u2019ve made is one for Mr. or Ms. Rational Human, a world where numbers are king, where everything else is secondary and unimportant.There\u2019s not a lot of patience in this world for things that don\u2019t fit into a calculator. Even just mentioning \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201cintuition\u201d makes me feel that I should be sitting in a drum circle with people reeking of patchouli. That is how strong a stereotype we\u2019ve created around these things we all experience. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a stereotype with negative connotations. How did we get to this spot?Early work in the field of economics made some assumptions, out of a desire to make things fit in a spreadsheet, about how people act (or react). The assumption was that the typical person is a rational being who makes informed, measurable decisions based on things we can quantify and calculate. It was also assumed that people would always act in their own best interests (which, by the way, is to make more money).Raise your hand if those findings surprise you. This is not rocket science, people. We all know that we do irrational things. That\u2019s because we aren\u2019t numbers \u2014 we\u2019re humans. It makes no sense for you to have cash on hand when you could be investing it instead. At least, if Numbers were in charge, that would be true.But Numbers isn\u2019t in charge. My experience, plus the study above and many other examples of how people interact with money, bears that out. Want to know why it makes sense to have cash on hand? Because we feel better when we have cash on hand! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s rational. It\u2019s true. And the study suggests it\u2019s probably also true for many of us.I\u2019m not saying we should ban Numbers from the room altogether. Numbers has a time and a place, but we should be careful not to let Numbers always be the keynote speaker.In the end, the point of money is not to make you more money. The point of money is to help make and keep you happy and fulfill the hopes and dreams that align with your own (often irrational and emotional) values.So as long as Numbers helps you with that, let Numbers talk endlessly. But when it starts to get in the way, it\u2019s time to pass the microphone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K.\u2019s Labour Party Pledges Broad Tax Increases to Pay for New Benefits", "Date": "2017-05-16", "News": "Supported byTuesday\u2019s official release of Labour\u2019s manifesto was dominated by the cost implications of the party\u2019s most left-wing program in three decades, which includes plans to scrap university tuition fees, build more homes and increase spending on health and social care.Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Conservative Party is well ahead in opinion polls, has called a snap election for June 8 to try to increase her parliamentary majority before difficult negotiations over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union.On domestic issues, voters face a stark choice. While many of Labour\u2019s policies are popular \u2014 among them, renationalizing some rail, energy and utility companies \u2014 the party faces difficult questions about how it plans to fulfill its pledges without large increases in taxes and government borrowing.Its response was to say that 95 percent of earners would pay no more tax, but that the burden would start to rise on earnings of more than 80,000 pounds, about $103,000 at current exchange rates, and in corporate taxes. There would also be a \u201cfat cat\u201d tax that companies would pay on salaries above \u00a3330,000, or about $425,000.Earnings of more than \u00a380,000 would be taxed at 45 percent, while those of over \u00a3123,000, or $159,000, would face a 50 percent rate. Companies would pay a 2.5 percent tax on salaries paid above \u00a3330,000 and 5 percent on those above \u00a3500,000, about $645,000. And the corporate tax rate would rise to 26 percent by 2020 from 19 percent.Those increases aimed to cover $62.7 billion in spending pledges and underlined the ideological shift Labour has made since the Blair years, when one of the prime minister\u2019s closest aides, Peter Mandelson, said that Labour was \u201cintensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes.\u201dOn Tuesday, Labour\u2019s current, leftist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, brought back a Blair-era campaign slogan \u2014 \u201cFor the many, not the few\u201d \u2014 but struck a markedly different tone.Britain, Mr. Corbyn said at his manifesto announcement at the University of Bradford, had been \u201crun for the rich, the elite and the vested interests,\u201d adding: \u201cThey have benefited from tax cuts and bumper salaries while millions have struggled.\u201d\u201cWe are asking the better-off and the big corporations to pay a little bit more, and, of course, to stop dodging their tax obligations in the first place,\u201d he added.His stance is a gamble because the tax threshold of \u00a380,000 catches many members of Britain\u2019s professional classes who, whatever the statistics say, do not consider themselves rich, and even more voters who aspire to earn that sum. In London, where housing costs are very high, such salaries do not finance lavish lifestyles.\u201cBecause the extent of those kinds of responses is very uncertain, the amount of extra revenue these higher tax rates would raise is also very uncertain,\u201d wrote Robert Joyce, an associate director at the institute.But the institute estimated that those earning between \u00a380,000 and \u00a3100,000 a year would pay from nothing to \u00a31,000 a year extra.David Gauke of the Conservative Party, who is chief secretary to the Treasury, attacked the broader plan. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that proposal after proposal in this manifesto will mean more borrowing and debt: from promises on benefits, to promises on prison guards, to promises on nationalizing the water network,\u201d he said in a statement.Advertisement"}

During a point in the debate when candidates could question each other directly, each candidate asked Mr. Murphy about his time at Goldman.Mr. Wisniewski cited his investment portfolio as supporting companies that promoted pipelines, hydrofracking and other practices that would be anathema to progressive environmental values. Mr. Murphy countered that \u201cthere\u2019s probably no good answer in terms of those investments,\u201d but promised that if he were to become governor, his portfolio would go into a blind trust and he would champion environmental causes.Mr. Johnson pointed to Goldman Sachs\u2019s role in the recession as an example of a values system he viewed as antithetical to progressive mores. Mr. Murphy noted that he left Goldman Sachs in 2003, before the recession began.Drawing attention to Goldman Sachs carries outsize weight in New Jersey; former Gov. Jon S. Corzine was also a former executive at the investment bank and spent $43 million of his own money in 2005 to help him win the governorship. But he lost his re-election bid and left office deeply unpopular.\u201cWe elected Chris Christie because of Jon Corzine,\u201d Mr. Wisniewski said, referring to the current Republican governor. \u201cWe can\u2019t repeat that movie.\u201dThough political broadsides and personal attacks dominated the night, the candidates did find common ground. They all agreed on the need to improve New Jersey Transit\u2019s finances, limit the growth of charter schools and legalize and tax marijuana, and on the failures of Mr. Christie\u2019s tenure.While Mr. Murphy\u2019s opponents tried their best to land punches during their debate, Mr. Murphy chose instead to play it safe. In a brief interview afterward, Mr. Murphy said that he could have pointed out Mr. Wisniewski\u2019s and Mr. Lesniak\u2019s extensive ties in Trenton \u201cif I was really taking shots tonight.\u201dMr. Murphy instead focused his criticism on Mr. Christie and President Trump, whom he lumped together.Mr. Murphy defended his campaign spending, and stressed that he was not looking to go on the attack during the debate.\u201cI am participating in the system that exists, I did not create the system. In fact two of those guys were state chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I probably should have said if was really taking shots.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when the debate took place.

{"Headline": "Alitalia Files for Bankruptcy, but Italy Balks at a Third Bailout", "Date": "2017-05-02", "News": "Supported byWhen the Italian airline Alitalia went bankrupt in 2008, the government swooped in with taxpayer money and Pope Benedict \u2014 a regular rider \u2014 offered the carrier a blessing. Six years later, as Alitalia stumbled into debt yet again, the government engineered another rescue.But on Tuesday, even a papal decree would not have been enough to save Alitalia from what threatened to be its final stand, as Europe\u2019s most troubled airline filed for bankruptcy once more, this time amid signs that the government, and the Italian people, were fed up from providing life support.Like the Italian state, Alitalia has always been too big to fail. The carrier has already cost Italian taxpayers an estimated \u20ac7 billion over the decade.This time, officials say there will be no new bailout of the airline, which has been a fixture of the economy and one of Italy\u2019s largest employers since it was founded in 1947. No other carriers have come forward to express interest in taking it over, including Lufthansa, which had been cited as a possible white knight.After the Italian government approved the bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, Alitalia will be put into the hands of special administrators charged with devising a last-ditch plan to turn around the carrier within 180 days, sell it, or put it into liquidation.Company officials had said that in order to keep the carrier alive, adjustments were needed in the 12,400-strong work force, which operates about 120 planes and had 22.6 million passengers last year. By contrast, its low-cost rival Ryanair has around 11,000 employees for 300 planes and more than 100 million passengers.But when unions and management negotiated a rescue plan involving 1,600 layoffs, an 8 percent pay cut and more working days a year in exchange for \u20ac2 billion in new financing, employees rejected it.They seemed to be gambling that the state would come to the rescue, given the political and economic consequences of letting Alitalia collapse.In the meantime, the situation has outraged some Italians, who took to Facebook and Twitter to protest spending any more taxpayer money on top of the billions already doled out by the government.\u201cAlitalia bankruptcy is due to bad management and #ConsumerChoice. Italian state shouldn\u2019t give any money to save it,\u201d Luca Bertoletti, the European affairs manager at Consumer Choice Center, an Italian consumer rights organization, said in a message on Twitter.The Middle Eastern airline made new investments and financed a revision of Alitalia\u2019s business plan to compete better with low-cost carriers. But losses started to mount again in 2015, to nearly \u20ac200 million, as Alitalia failed to ward off fierce competition from low-cost airlines, and terrorist attacks in Europe hurt travel.Alitalia sought to recover this year with a plan to slash \u20ac1 billion in costs, cut 2,000 workers and reduce salaries by up to 30 percent. Unions negotiated all those demands down in a deal struck last month that would have released new financing.Instead, pilots and cabin crew rebuffed the accord, throwing Alitalia yet again into an uncertain future.\u201cIt seems that Alitalia workers have all gone nuts,\u201d Simone Filippetti, a finance and economy reporter at the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore, wrote in a column. \u201cWhy did they reject a plan that involved a hard sacrifice but a chance of recovering to instead face the risk of a total company disruption and liquidation, and ultimately all lose their jobs anyway?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Should the Big Banks Get Free Money?", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byStreet SceneIf you stop and think for a minute about how banking actually works, you can\u2019t help but conclude what an extraordinary business it really is and how lucky big banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorganChase are to be at the top of it.In 2016, these three financial institutions together raked in $65 billion in net income, which is after paying out a total of $75 billion or so in compensation and benefits to their employees. This does not appear to be an industry suffering in the least.As regulatory relief appears to draw near, what should we ask of big banks in return for the extraordinary franchise we, the American people, have granted to them?The raw material of banking, by and large, is the money you and I deposit in banks. The banks, in turn, take our deposits and lend that money to people and businesses all over the world that want it, or need it, and are willing to pay a fair price to get it.The alchemy of capitalism is that they use these loans, which of course must be paid back, to start and expand companies, to build plants and equipment, and to hire employees and, it is hoped, pay them higher wages. The difference between what banks pay depositors for use of their money and what banks charge borrowers to get this money is known as \u201cthe spread,\u201d and forms much of what becomes the extraordinary profits described above. (There is more to it than this, of course, but you get the basic idea.)For some reason, which does not make a whole lot of sense, we collectively are willing to give the banks this raw material essentially for free. If you look at what the banks are paying us for the use of our money, it is about as close to nothing as you can get, and has been for years.These are very small percentages. What other industry on the face of the earth gets its raw material for free, or nearly for free? I can\u2019t think of any. General Motors has to pay for rubber, glass, plastic, aluminum and the electronics it uses to make cars.By valuing our deposits so trivially, without coming out and admitting it, these three big banks are essentially saying to us that they don\u2019t want our money, that they can\u2019t use any more of it and that we should give it to a bank willing to pay us more for it. And there are such banks, as The Journal noted: Both Goldman Sachs Bank \u2014 the locus of Goldman\u2019s new effort to develop a consumer lending business \u2014 and Ally Financial (previously the financing arm of General Motors) want our deposits, and are willing to pay for them. Indeed, they are willing to pay a lot more for them. For instance, Goldman\u2019s consumer bank is willing to pay depositors 1.05 percent for their money, some 13 times what Bank of America is willing to pay its depositors.In effect, Goldman is saying: We want deposits and are willing to pay for them. Bank of America is saying pretty much the opposite. According to The Journal, if Bank of America\u2019s depositors moved all their money to JPMorganChase, they would have been paid $700 million more in 2016. Had they moved their money to Goldman Sachs, they would have been paid a staggering $5.1 billion more. But they have not moved.Why do we continue to enable these banks to make huge profits by giving them our money for free? Wouldn\u2019t the more rational thing be to give our money to the highest bidder for it?The answer is not terribly complex and goes to the heart of human nature. First, inertia is a very powerful force: It\u2019s a pain in the neck to switch banks, for what seems like a minimal amount of compensation to do so. (Switching a $3,000 savings account to Goldman Sachs Bank from Bank of America gets you an additional $30 or so annually.) Second, Goldman does not make it easy to get your money back if you need it: Although that could soon change, it has no branches and no A.T.M.s. If you are a Bank of America customer, you go to an A.T.M. machine and, bingo, there\u2019s your money.The potential problem, of course, is that your money is not actually at the bank; only a portion of it is. The bank is busy using your money to make its profits, not leaving it around in case you want it back. That\u2019s fine until depositors or consumers get to thinking that their money will not be at the bank when they want it. Then they start panicking and start demanding their money back all at the same time. That leads to the kind of financial crises we saw in 1929 and 2008, revealing to everyone what a fragile system we have constructed.Banking in this country is at an important crossroads. Proposals are flying fast and furious about how to roll back the regulations imposed on Wall Street and community banks after the 2008 crisis. It\u2019s unclear what changes, if any, will be made.What\u2019s needed now is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. The current rules about how much capital a bank must have and the amount of leverage the big banks can employ are essential to retain. As is the rule that complex derivatives must continue to be traded on an exchange to facilitate knowing their value. Then there are the reforms that no one is talking about \u2014 for instance, paying depositors more for their money or changing the way bankers, traders and executives are compensated to reward prudent, ethical and moral behavior instead of risky behavior.The big American banks have had a very nice run since the financial crisis. They are essentially an oligopoly, and they have the profits to show for it. It\u2019s time they agreed to give something back to us, the people who saved their bacon nearly 10 years ago.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunnels Aren\u2019t the Only Vision for New Jersey Transit in the Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byPhilip D. Murphy, a Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, stood in front of the Trenton train station, with a New Jersey Transit train that had been delayed 30 minutes behind him, and offered a starkly candid assessment: The state has a transportation crisis, and a new tax might be the only way to tackle it.\u201cPotentially, potentially,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in response to a question from a reporter, though he stressed that a tax would be one of many options on the table.But the moment underscored how the misery that so many travelers have endured in recent weeks \u2014 with the likelihood that things will get worse this summer when Amtrak closes tracks at Pennsylvania Station for repairs \u2014 has thrust public transportation to the forefront among those vying to become New Jersey\u2019s next leader.During Mr. Christie\u2019s nearly eight-year tenure, a state subsidy to New Jersey Transit, the nation\u2019s third-busiest railroad, was cut by over 90 percent. The governor famously stopped an earlier plan to build a new Hudson River tunnel, even as constant problems plagued the aging rail infrastructure between New York and New Jersey.The candidates have taken note, laying out extensive plans to claim the mantle of \u201ctransportation governor.\u201d And the issue is likely to take center stage at the first debate of the primary campaign, which will be held on Tuesday night at Stockton University near Atlantic City.In a race that features two clear party favorites and a vast field of hopefuls jockeying to distinguish themselves amid voter apathy, Democratic and Republican candidates share some common ground when it comes to infrastructure: They think the Gateway project to build new rail tunnels under the Hudson is vital and say Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal both need significant overhauls.They also agree that an audit of New Jersey Transit should be undertaken to identify waste and mismanagement and that there should be no more political appointees to transit agencies or panels in the state. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, a Republican candidate, called the appointment process \u201cthe worst public policy to come out of Trenton in a generation.\u201dFrom there, however, their plans diverge.Ms. Guadagno was a vocal opponent of an increase in the gas tax, which helps pay for transportation projects, and instead links transit financing to her call for a sweeping examination of spending in Trenton.She also wants to bring all agencies responsible for infrastructure under one roof, a plan she claims would save more than $100 million. And, like some of the Democratic candidates, she is in favor of expanding transit options to include more ferries and express trains.Her Republican rival, Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, also called for an agency reorganization, though he offers more detail: bringing together the Department of Transportation, New Jersey Transit and the Motor Vehicle Commission and using the $1.4 billion generated from fees for drivers\u2019 licenses, vehicle registrations and other regulations for infrastructure spending, rather than putting it into what he calls the state\u2019s \u201cblack hole,\u201d the general fund.He also wants to negotiate a new tax agreement with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York that would tax wages based on where people live, not where they work, similar to the agreement New Jersey has with Pennsylvania, and then using tax proceeds to improve infrastructure.John S. Wisniewski, who has focused on transportation issues during his roughly two decades in the Assembly, points to an amendment he introduced twice over the past three years to the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, which finances public transit and highway projects, as a way to pay for improvements.He calls for renovating train stations near affordable housing, including adding accessibility; expanding rail capacity to include a line that would connect Monmouth, Ocean and Middlesex Counties; and allowing New Jersey Transit to operate as a developer as well as a landlord to help produce new revenue.The airports, which the Port Authority also oversees, would be better served by a separate agency or a private company, Mr. Wisniewski said.For some candidates, the problems on the rails are both personal and part of their campaign. Ms. Guadagno took the train every day from Little Silver to Newark when she worked as a federal prosecutor. Mr. Johnson still relies on the PATH train to travel to New York.Mr. Murphy, through a spokesman, declined to say when he had last used public transportation, saying only, \u201cThis is about making the system work for the hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans who depend on N.J. Transit.\u201dMr. Wisniewski, who used to take train from South Amboy to Newark every day and still counts rail as his favorite means of getting to New York, has recently had to change course because of the countless delays and cancellations.\u201cI had a meeting recently, and candidly, because of the difficulties, I couldn\u2019t afford to be late,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cI had to drive in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Best\u2019 Places to Move in Retirement? They\u2019re All Over the Map", "Date": "2017-05-05", "News": "Supported byRetiringWhat\u2019s the best place to live in retirement?New Hampshire boasts low taxes and a vital cultural climate. Mexico has warm weather and a low cost of living. The Provo-Orem metropolitan area of Utah, with about 115,000 residents, promises an outdoorsy lifestyle, proximity to Salt Lake City and plenty of opportunities to take classes at local colleges.The quality varies, Mr. Sperling said: \u201cSome are very analytical, and others are casual in their approach, with little justification provided for their choices.\u201dWith so many surveys and rankings, you\u2019d think that America\u2019s retirees are a horde of itinerants. But relatively few people really do move in retirement.Only six-tenths of 1 percent of Americans over age 55 moved across a state line in 2015, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. (The population he looked at includes people who are still working.) And those who do move generally are not following the more creative, and sometimes chilly, recommendations found in many surveys. The top five destinations between 2010 and 2015 were all in the Sunbelt: Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, followed by Texas, North Carolina and Georgia.The Sunbelt has also been a magnet for people who aren\u2019t quite ready for retirement. \u201cThese are regions that attracted plenty of baby boomers during their prime working years, and they are just staying there as they grow older,\u201d Mr. Frey said.But eyebrow-raising studies keep coming. Common criteria cited include the cost of living, the tax burden, the quality of health care, weather, crime, cultural vitality and the prevalence of other older citizens.Bankrate derives its results from a survey that asks people to name the factors that matter most in a retirement location; the results indicated that respondents were concerned primarily with a low cost of living, access to good health care, a low crime rate and rich cultural offerings.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to take a forward look at where people should be retiring now, instead of what they\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d said Claes Bell, a data analyst for Bankrate.Milken\u2019s exhaustive report evaluates 381 United States metropolitan areas using public data on 83 indicators, including general livability, health care, wellness, financial security, living arrangements, employment and educational opportunities. The report also breaks out separate results for younger seniors (ages 65 to 79) and older ones, recognizing that needs differ. Additionally, it separates the rankings into large and smaller metro areas.Along with Provo-Orem, Milken\u2019s rankings among large metro areas include Madison, Wis., and Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C. The small metro list was topped by Iowa City; Manhattan, Kan.; and Ames, Iowa.Paul Irving, chairman of Milken\u2019s Center for the Future of Aging, acknowledges that the selections may strike some as a little odd. \u201cWe\u2019re not suggesting anyone move to a different place,\u201d he said. \u201cAging Americans increasingly are inclined to continue to work, stay engaged and active, and live lives driven by purpose. We\u2019re evaluating a series of characteristics that are likely to help enable that kind of life.\u201dMexico has topped the list for five years running. This year, the other top countries include Panama, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia; Thailand and Cambodia are also rising stars.The list is highly subjective. \u201cWe really rely on the correspondents,\u201d Jennifer Stevens, the site\u2019s executive editor, said. \u201cAnd we only have people working for us in the countries that we recommend.\u201dThe factors that readers ask about most often, Ms. Stevens said, include cost of living and the ease of integrating into a foreign culture and language.\u201cLanguage can be especially off-putting,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are worried they are too old to pick up a new language. But they should also be asking about the access to visas, climate and health care.\u201dInterest in retirement abroad is rising. The number of retired workers receiving Social Security benefits abroad jumped 22 percent from the end of 2009 to 2015, to just over 390,000. That figure understates the total, Ms. Stevens said, since many expats use American bank accounts for their benefits. The Social Security data points to Canada, Japan and Mexico as the most popular locations for United States citizens interested in retiring in a foreign country.He cautions retirement-location shoppers against getting too obsessive about any one characteristic. For example, some studies emphasize keeping taxes low in retirement, which is odd to him. \u201cIf you have enough money to worry about taxes, then you probably don\u2019t need to worry about it so much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more important to think about the overall quality of life than how much you are paying in taxes.\u201dHe also worries that too many studies view retirement as a single phase of life.\u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that you can just go somewhere permanently,\u201d Mr. Sperling said. \u201cThere really are three stages: a \u2018go-go\u2019 period where you\u2019re very active and seeing the world, then a time where you\u2019re slowing down and need more health care resources, and then a third where you really need to be cared for.\u201dMr. Sperling emphasized that all the rankings and studies on retirement locations were simply a starting point for making a decision. \u201cThey\u2019re just suggestions,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they can get you to think about someplace you hadn\u2019t thought of before, but your mileage will vary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amanda Anisimova, 15, Is Ready for Her Grand Slam Debut", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byAVENTURA, Fla. \u2014 On the eve of Amanda Anisimova\u2019s latest trip to the French Open, she was ripping forehands and two-handed backhands in the sunshine on a public clay court in South Florida.Tall and deeply tan with a long braided ponytail, Anisimova is just 15, the child of Russian parents who have nurtured her precocious talent.It sounds like the start of a familiar tennis tale. See Maria Sharapova and Anna Kournikova, two blond Russian prodigies who arrived very young in the academy-rich ecosystem of South Florida and, against the odds, went on to fame and fortune.But this familiar story has a twist. Anisimova is an American, born in Freehold Township, N.J., on Aug. 31, 2001. She represents the United States and reached the French Open junior final last year. Though she speaks Russian with her parents, Konstantin and Olga, she has never been to Russia.\u201cI never considered representing Russia,\u201d Anisimova said in an interview Sunday at the apartment complex where she and her parents live. \u201cI do plan on going, though. I really want to visit and see what it\u2019s like and see the culture more.\u201dFirst, though, she has a major tennis commitment: her first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament. She is the youngest player in the top 300 at No. 262, and she will be the youngest to play singles in the French Open since 2005, when Aliz\u00e9 Cornet of France received a wild card at 15.\u201cAmanda is a very special player,\u201d said Martin Blackman, the general manager for player development at the United States Tennis Association.Like Cornet, Anisimova also has a wild card, a reciprocal one offered to the United States Tennis Association by the French Tennis Federation.But she was not simply handed her spot in the draw. She had to compete against her American elders in a series of clay-court events this spring. She secured the wild card by reaching the finals of back-to-back tournaments last month in Indian Harbour Beach, Fla., and Dothan, Ala.She headed to Paris on Monday with quite an entourage for a 15-year-old: her mother, Olga; her fitness trainer, Andy Hanley; her new coach, Henner Nehles; a hitting partner, Maxsim Fomine; and her agent, Gary Swain, the IMG veteran who has long worked with John McEnroe.\u201cThe good thing about it is she really earned the wild card, and it wasn\u2019t a gift,\u201d said Nick Saviano, the veteran American coach who has been Anisimova\u2019s main tennis mentor outside her family. \u201cI\u2019m excited for her, excited for her mom and dad, who have sacrificed a lot.\u201dKonstantin Anisimov, a burly, dark-haired, ebullient man, is Anisimova\u2019s primary coach. He said he and Olga, who are from Moscow, moved to the United States in 1998 hoping to provide more opportunities for their first child, Maria, who was 10 at the time.\u201cMy wife had relatives who had lived a long time in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThey sent us an invitation to come visit this country. We visited it, and we liked it more and more, and we start thinking and taking it seriously.\u201dHe said they also considered moving to Spain.\u201cWe really like Spain, but then we recognized when we visited America that everybody who comes here is going to feel like home,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Europe, you always feel like a foreigner because it\u2019s a completely different culture. America is a united country where people come from all over the world, and after a couple of years, they feel this is home, you know?\u201dIn Moscow, Konstantin said, Olga was an \u201caccountant in the banking system\u201d and that he was involved in \u201cfinance and banking.\u201d Maria inherited some of her parents\u2019 aptitudes. She graduated from the undergraduate business program at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where she excelled on the tennis team. She is currently a director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Maria, who was Amanda\u2019s initial tennis inspiration, started playing at age 10 in Moscow and eventually set her sights on college tennis after the family moved to Florida to help her train. Amanda started playing at age 2 with her mother.\u201cUntil she was 7, no one touched her,\u201d Olga said of Amanda\u2019s technique. \u201cThat was the development.\u201dAmanda, now 5-foot-10 and still growing, turned professional in September, soon after her 15th birthday and shortly after winning a round in the qualifying tournament at the United States Open.\u201cI definitely want to become No. 1 in the world and win every Grand Slam,\u201d she said in her contralto, measured voice. \u201cOne of each would be like super awesome. I hope to do that one day.\u201dShe and her parents insist that she has been encouraged and supported but not pushed.\u201cI definitely have to sacrifice a lot, because I have to travel so much,\u201d said Anisimova, who has always been home-schooled. \u201cBut I really enjoy traveling and playing all these tournaments, so I really don\u2019t care that I don\u2019t go to school or be like a normal person. Because this is what I enjoy doing. Other people might have a different perspective on this, but I really like this and really like my career and how it\u2019s going.\u201dAnisimova plans to play in the junior event, too, once she finishes with the main event. She opens against Kurumi Nara of Japan, ranked 90th.Konstantin confessed to some sleepless nights about Amanda\u2019s career path. He knows the odds are against her and everyone.\u201cDefinitely pressure is big and especially pressure is growing when she is doing unexpectedly good,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause then it\u2019s very difficult to stay on course and be realistic and don\u2019t be delusional. I saw a lot of parents who got immediately delusional, and those stories end up in a very bad way. You can\u2019t overtrain. You can\u2019t over-push.\u201dThough Konstantin coaches in Aventura for a living, neither he nor Olga played competitively in their youth, learning the game through watching, studying and working with their daughters. But Amanda has had plenty of outside counsel in the last eight years. She has worked with several U.S.T.A. coaches, including Fed Cup captain Kathy Rinaldi, and practiced with Lindsay Davenport, the former No. 1 whose game, in Konstantin\u2019s eyes, has many similarities with Amanda\u2019s.The primary outside influence has been Saviano, who has worked with her since she was 11 and runs his own academy in Plantation, Fla., about a 30-minute drive from Aventura.\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the luxury to bring Nick to Paris, because, like, too many people on the payroll,\u201d said Konstantin, who nonetheless praises Saviano\u2019s technical knowledge and influence on Amanda.Saviano, no longer eager to travel in general, has played a leading role in developing some of the best young talent in the women\u2019s game, including Eugenie Bouchard and Sloane Stephens.\u201cIt\u2019s always exciting working with committed people,\u201d Saviano said. \u201cShe\u2019s very committed to becoming a great player. Her parents have been totally devoted to that. They are good people, and I love being a contributor. She has excellent ball-striking skills. She has tremendous groundstrokes. She can volley. She\u2019s got good touch.\u201cShe\u2019s a good athlete and a very strong, powerful player. The ball kind of explodes off her racket, so she tends to hit a lot of winners naturally when just hitting normal groundstrokes. But she also has the will and determination to be someone who wants to be absolutely as good as they can possibly be.\u201dIt is, in short, quite a tennis package highlighted by her fluid and versatile backhand, although her second serve has been an occasional liability under pressure and her movement needs improvement.\u201cShe is still growing into her body, so her movement is not great,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cIn my opinion, the three keys for her success are: keep making time for training blocks to get stronger and faster; keep improving the forehand and keep developing her transition game to the net.\u201dLike every savvy coach who knows the long history of tennis prodigies who failed to hit the highest notes, Saviano is cautious.\u201cGoodness knows people want to hype them while they\u2019re going up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the key for her is focusing on all the things she can control: her work ethic, competing as hard as she can, developing her skills. She has a good team around her, and she\u2019s very levelheaded, so I think it will work out well for her.\u201dIf it goes awry, Anisimova, a big fan of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d who recently met some of the cast on a trip to Los Angeles, has a backup plan.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t play tennis, I\u2019d want to be a surgeon,\u201d she said. \u201cActually what I want to do is go to online college while I\u2019m in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish.\u201dFor now, she is just getting started.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Winning Yankees Aren\u2019t Faring Nearly as Well at the Ticket Office", "Date": "2017-05-25", "News": "Supported byThe Yankees are, at the moment, a marketer\u2019s dream. With a spirited start to the season, they can boast of having one of baseball\u2019s best records, bask in the captivating presence of the Bunyanesque outfielder Aaron Judge and nod in approval at some popular changes to their ballpark \u2014 with all of these developments wrapped in the team\u2019s rich history.But even those selling points have yet to turn around attendance at Yankee Stadium, where ticket and suite revenues through last season had fallen by a staggering $166 million since the end of 2009, the year the Yankees christened the new ballpark with their last World Series title.The financial figures, from the public filings the Yankees are required to make on their stadium bonds, represent a 42 percent loss in ticket and suite revenues over the last seven seasons. And despite the team\u2019s compelling play this season, attendance through the first quarter of their home schedule is down from the same point last year.The ticket and suite revenues are only a portion of the Yankees\u2019 overall income, which also includes television and radio broadcast fees, advertising and licensing, and a portfolio of ancillary businesses. And indeed, the decline in ticket and suite income has offered some relief from baseball\u2019s revenue-sharing system, allowing the Yankees to pay less into the pot that is distributed among all 30 teams.But the losses do provide a window into how even the blue-blooded Yankees, who have been largely impervious to the market forces that have affected the rest of baseball, have had difficulty maintaining their audience.The challenge confronting the team comes at a time when the entire sports industry is feeling the ground move beneath its feet as consumer behavior shifts drastically, with the changes even rattling the broadcasting titan ESPN.For the Yankees, one of the most prestigious sports franchises in the world, gaining a foothold with younger fans has proved particularly difficult, especially in a period in which the team has lost its championship gloss, failing to secure a postseason berth in three of the last four years.\u201cBaseball, I think, has somewhat struggled with the millennial problem,\u201d Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees\u2019 managing general partner, said in an interview before the start of the season. \u201cWe recognized in looking at our fan base, we recognized in looking at our viewers on YES, that that age group is not what it could be and not what it should be.\u201dThe drop-off in ticket and suite revenues also comes at a time when the team\u2019s expenses are still among the highest in baseball: The payroll is $212 million (third behind the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Detroit Tigers, according to Cot\u2019s Baseball Contracts, which tracks salaries), the stadium bond payment climbed to $83.8 million this year, and the luxury tax at the end of last season was $27.4 million.So perhaps it is no surprise that Steinbrenner wants the Yankees\u2019 payroll to dip below next season\u2019s $197 million luxury-tax threshold.It would be the first time since the tax was instituted in 2003 that the Yankees would be below the threshold and it would come just in time to avoid the onerous penalties for repeat offenders that will kick in next season. Still, Steinbrenner maintained that the decline in ticket and suite revenues had nothing to do with his payroll objective.\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to spend money,\u201d he said.Indeed, as much as Steinbrenner is preaching more responsible spending, he would not rule out again blowing past the luxury-tax threshold if the situation calls for it \u2014 as he said it did after the 2013 season, when the Yankees committed more than $450 million in a free-agent spending binge.\u201cEvery year is different,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cI wish I could kind of sum up my overall philosophy, but I tend to roll with the times and really take a look at the team every year and what we need.\u2019\u2019It does help Steinbrenner\u2019s payroll quest that the Yankees have two substantial salaries coming off the books at the end of this season \u2014 with pitcher C. C. Sabathia ($25 million) and the released, and now retired, slugger Alex Rodriguez ($21 million) in the last year of their lengthy deals. Both players are relics of the Yankees\u2019 last championship.It also helps over all that the Yankees have been at the fore in building a broad reservoir of income streams that can be used to help underwrite club expenses, a business strategy that the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs, other teams with strong national brands, have begun to emulate.For the Yankees, business interests include Legends, the sports concessions and marketing company founded with the Dallas Cowboys that recently won the naming rights and ticket sales contract for the new N.F.L. stadium in Los Angeles; a handful of New York Yankees Steakhouses; a stake in New York City F.C., the Major League Soccer club that is affiliated with Manchester City and is a tenant at Yankee Stadium; and the YES Network, in which the Yankees team up with Fox Sports.The Yankees also joined forces last year with a longtime adversary, the ticket reseller StubHub, in a deal that could earn the Yankees as much as $100 million over six and a half years.Still, all these deals and the income they generate have to be set against the very expensive stadium the Yankees are financing, and the problems they have filling enough seats and suites. And some of that problem may have its roots in pricing.\u201cWhen the Yankees went into the new building and set pricing, it was clear to me that they priced a perennial contending team into their tickets and suites,\u201d said Vince Gennaro, the director of the Columbia University graduate program in sports management. \u201cThey\u2019ve come off that some, but I was always a firm believer that if the Yankees faltered on the field with this economic formula, there\u2019s no question attendance would drop more than another team because of the aggressive pricing.\u201dLast year, ticket and suite revenues declined $46 million. It was a sharper-than-expected drop that was cited by Moody\u2019s, the bond rating service, as a factor in its decision this month to downgrade the outlook of the $1.2 billion in stadium bonds to negative from stable.The negative outlook indicates a higher likelihood that the bond ratings \u2014 currently Baa1 \u2014 could be downgraded in the next 12 to 18 months, which could then make future borrowing by the Yankees a costlier proposition.The main reason for the Moody\u2019s downgrade was the Yankees\u2019 decision not to refinance the bonds. The Yankees had received approval by the city to refinance last September, but shelved the plans when interest rates climbed. Under the refinancing, the Yankees had forecast $16 million in savings on their debt service in 2018, $11 million annually from 2019 to 2030 and $6 million a year beyond that until the bonds mature in 2046, according to Moody\u2019s.The refinancing \u201cwould have saved us significant money,\u201d said Randy Levine, the Yankees president. \u201cThen Trump got elected and interest rates went up, so you don\u2019t save any money. There\u2019s no reason to do it.\u201dBut what the Yankees have done is try to alter the atmosphere of a still relatively new stadium. The famous building it replaced was often raucous in the championship era that began in 1996. The new stadium, in contrast, has too often had a desultory vibe.For instance, it was striking last September when several thousand Los Angeles Dodgers fans congregated in the left-field corner of Yankee Stadium and all but made the ballpark their home \u2014 boisterously mimicking the right-field Bleacher Creatures\u2019 ritual roll call and unrolling a tifo, the enormous banner prevalent at soccer matches.And this month, a game in the Bronx against the Toronto Blue Jays drew an announced crowd of 25,556 \u2014 the smallest for a Yankees home game in 13 years.Even with a young, vibrant team that is playing beyond expectations, attendance has continued to fall this season. The Yankees\u2019 per-game decline of 3,793 over the same number of games last season, through Tuesday, is the third-sharpest in baseball, according to Baseball Reference, trailing just Kansas City and the Mets. And the average attendance of 34,642 represents a decline of nearly 12,000 from the new stadium\u2019s peak.To be fair, the Yankees\u2019 average attendance this season is diminished in part by a rainout that caused them to play a single-admission Sunday doubleheader \u2014 two games for the price of one \u2014 when the team retired Derek Jeter\u2019s jersey. Additionally, the Yankees had hosted the rival Boston Red Sox by this point last season, but have yet to do so in 2017.But even factoring in those two elements, an attendance dip would probably still exist.In addition, the Yankees reported last week in their first-quarter filings that ticket and suite revenues had declined nearly $14 million from the first-quarter filing of a year ago. The team noted in the filing that a three-month delay in invoicing and a home schedule that began one week later had affected cash collections.But if these numbers are frustrating for the Yankees, they are not necessarily that surprising. The Yankees, internally, were acknowledging a problem well before now.By the end of the 2015 season, when the Yankees made their lone playoff appearance of the last four seasons \u2014 a wild-card loss to Houston \u2014 Steinbrenner and his top executives had come to understand that an older team whose most renowned player was the polarizing Rodriguez was not resonating with young adults.Levine, who is now 62, spent months after that season exploring how to better reach fans 35 and under, canvassing people in various industries, including entertainment, retailing and health care, to better understand how that demographic made its decisions. For example, Levine said, how a recent college graduate decided whether to sign up for the Affordable Care Act might tell the Yankees how he or she decided to buy tickets.Marty Greenspun, senior vice president for strategic ventures, visited every other major league ballpark, conducted surveys of 5,000 Yankee fans and, with several outside consultants, examined ways the club could make the stadium more convivial for young adult fans.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a trend going south, you look at it,\u201d Levine said. \u201cLike a doctor, if somebody\u2019s hurt, you look at it and try and diagnose it and fix it.\u201dWhat the Yankees found out was that younger fans were more likely to buy tickets at the last moment \u2014 as they would for a play or a concert \u2014 and attend with a group of friends. They also preferred not to spend the entire game tethered to their seats. And they wanted a good deal.So after more than a year of planning, the Yankees rolled out a series of changes.They removed 2,100 obstructed-view seats in center field over the winter, and created plazas \u2014 the kind of gathering spots in the outfield that have become popular at other ballparks. They have also made more than 200,000 tickets available for $15 or less, including the Pinstripe Pass, which comes with a drink (soda, water or beer) and park entry, but without a seat. They hired a new social media director to help better connect with young fans.They have been more aggressive with advertising and also took to the streets during the winter, parading young players around the city \u2014 picture Gary Sanchez slapping together hero sandwiches at a Bronx deli \u2014 on publicity stops that the Yankees might have once felt beneath them.After all, when the new stadium opened in 2009, in the midst of the financial downturn, the Yankees had the hubris to put a $2,500-per-game price on some of the seats behind and near home plate. When many of them stayed empty and became an embarrassing eyesore on TV, the Yankees slashed those prices in half.Even so, a certain sense of haughtiness could still be detected before last season, when Lonn Trost, the Yankees\u2019 chief operating officer, said in a radio interview that fans buying luxury seats on the secondary market \u201cmay be someone who has never sat in a premium location, so that\u2019s a frustration to our existing fan base.\u201dBut that was then.Now the Yankees are willing to try a lot of things \u2014 particularly if it will attract younger people. Their latest foray came Monday, when they cordoned off 18 seats in right field, some of which have an obstructed view, and declared them The Judge\u2019s Chambers, an attempt to whip up more excitement about their rookie right fielder.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that looking at things \u2014 baseball has been talking to us about it as well \u2014 that\u2019s the age group that is less interested than other age groups in the game,\u201d Steinbrenner said. \u201cWhy? What can you do about it?\u201dOf course, one other thing the Yankees could do is to develop more players. For years, the Yankees had a poor record of player development \u2014 Brett Gardner and Robinson Cano were the rare everyday players to come up through the system over the last decade \u2014 but that began to change last summer.It was then that General Manager Brian Cashman jettisoned veteran players in trades both to refurbish the farm system and to make room on the major league roster, and in the lineup, for young prospects like Judge and Sanchez. Suddenly, the team taking shape on the field, younger and exciting, was better aligned with the club\u2019s efforts to market to millennials.\u201cThe two started completely separate,\u201d Levine said. \u201cThen we realized this could be a perfect storm and started connecting them up.\u201dSanchez helped a lot, immediately, when he smashed 20 home runs over the final two months of the 2016 season. Judge has started this season in similar fashion, leading the American League in home runs \u2014 many of which have left his teammates (and opponents) as awe-struck as fans.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no LeBron in baseball, there\u2019s no Tom Brady,\u201d Levine said. \u201cDerek Jeter was, maybe David Ortiz. But I think these young guys on our team and some of the other ones have the breakout ability, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting and what our fans are looking at.\u201dSo far, Judge, with the physique of an N.F.L. pass-rushing end and a charismatic personality, has landed on the cover of Sports Illustrated and in a comedy skit on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d If he continues to hit tape-measure home runs and the Yankees continue their early success, Judge might accomplish a truly gargantuan feat: filling up Yankee Stadium on a regular basis.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the contract Legends won for the new N.F.L. stadium in Los Angeles. It was the naming rights and ticket sales contract, not the concessions contract.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roger Ailes, Who Built Fox News Into an Empire, Dies at 77", "Date": "2017-05-18", "News": "Supported byBREAKINGRoger E. Ailes, who shaped the images that helped elect three Republican presidents and then became a dominant, often-intimidating force in American conservative politics at the helm of Fox News until he was forced out last year in a sexual harassment scandal, died on Thursday morning. He was 77.The cause was complications of a subdural hematoma that Mr. Ailes sustained when he fell and struck his head on May 10 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., the local authorities said.\u201cFair and balanced\u201d was Mr. Ailes\u2019s defining phrase for Fox News, along with another slogan: \u201cWe report. You decide.\u201d Though routinely mocked by liberal critics, who regarded the network as decidedly unfair and imbalanced, those words amounted to an article of faith for Mr. Ailes, who created Fox News with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s money and guided it for two decades.\u201cIf we look conservative,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s because the other guys are so far to the left.\u201d In his mordant humor, CNN stood for Clinton News Network and CBS for Communist Broadcasting System. What Fox News did, he said, was apply a necessary corrective.From its debut on Oct. 7, 1996, the network, under his tutelage, did its share of straightforward reporting but also unmistakably filtered major news stories through a conservative lens. Evening programming, which embodied the Fox News brand, was dominated by right-wing commentators like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, who hurled opinions and vented resentments with a pugnacity that reflected their boss\u2019s own combativeness.As the network\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Mr. Ailes was widely feared, particularly by conservative politicians who sought his favor. He cultivated a swaggering persona, accentuated by bursts of obscenity-laced anger. Once, he became so enraged that he punched a hole in the wall of a control room.Years earlier, Lee Atwater, whose remorseless approach to politics matched that of Mr. Ailes when they worked together on George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 presidential campaign, described his colleague as having \u201ctwo speeds: attack and destroy.\u201dBoth speeds were evident at the Ailes-run Fox News. For loyal viewers, it was the network of choice to hear repeatedly about the moral failings of Bill and Hillary Clinton, questions about Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, doubts about the patriotism of American Muslims, grumblings about the war ostensibly being waged on Christmas, and warnings about \u201cdeath panels\u201d that would supposedly flourish under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Fox News embraced the American flag as if it were its own, then became an uninhibited booster of the Iraq War and an unabashed critic of those who opposed it.The network also made itself a haven for Republicans who had fallen from political grace and hoped to restart their careers, among them Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum. Mr. Hannity\u2019s show was effectively a public-relations vehicle for one presidential candidate who made it to the top: Donald J. Trump.Even more than he embraced political combat, Mr. Ailes keenly understood television and its reliance on attention-grabbing flourishes. He learned the medium\u2019s emotional impact in the 1960s as the young producer of \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show,\u201d a syndicated daytime variety program. To hold people\u2019s interest, \u201cyou have to be punchy and graphic in your conversation,\u201d he wrote in a 1988 book, \u201cYou Are the Message.\u201dHe put that instinct to effective use, and to personal profit, after he left the Douglas show in 1968 to devote himself to political stagecraft. Across more than two decades, he devised media strategies for several dozen political campaigns, including the winning presidential candidacies of Richard M. Nixon in 1968, Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Mr. Bush in 1988. In 2016, he informally advised the triumphant Trump campaign.At Mr. Ailes\u2019s Fox, the news was delivered with eye-catching graphics and whooshing sound effects. Female broadcasters tended to be attractive blondes encouraged to show more than a little leg. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a certain element of the melding with show business or entertainment,\u201d he told Broadcasting & Cable magazine in 2003. \u201cEntertainment and news should always be separate, but you should walk right up to the line and get your toe on it.\u201dHis methods served the network well. In January 2002, barely five years after its birth, Fox passed the well-established CNN as the most-watched cable news network. It stayed No. 1, reinforcing Mr. Ailes\u2019s political influence. Power made him anxious about his personal safety. Convinced that enemies like Al Qaeda had him in their cross hairs, he installed elaborate security measures at work and at home.At the end of his tenure, the network had an average daily viewership of 2 million, more than CNN and the left-leaning MSNBC combined. Its audience skewed white, male and old, the median age approaching 70. But they were passionate viewers. Their fidelity produced billion-dollar profits and made Fox News an indispensable component of the Murdoch empire, 21st Century Fox.In a statement on Thursday morning, Mr. Murdoch said Mr. Ailes \u201cwill be remembered by the many people on both sides of the camera that he discovered, nurtured and promoted.\u201d\u201cRoger and I shared a big idea, which he executed in a way no one else could have,\u201d he added. \u201cIn addition, Roger was a great patriot who never ceased fighting for his beliefs.\u201dMr. O\u2019Reilly denied the charges of sexual impropriety, as did Mr. Ailes. But Mr. Ailes was finished at Fox, and walked away with a payout reportedly worth $40 million.Those were not the first accusations of their kind. They went back at least to the early 1990s, when Mr. Ailes returned to television full time, producing a show for the conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh and a separate late-night talk show on NBC.As recounted in \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d Gabriel Sherman\u2019s 2014 biography of Mr. Ailes, a female producer looking to work for him at NBC said he had offered her an extra $100 a week \u201cif you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.\u201dIn 1993, Mr. Ailes took charge of the CNBC business news network and a second NBC cable channel, America\u2019s Talking (which gave way in 1996 to MSNBC). As he would later do at Fox, he turned the struggling CNBC into a financial success and won the loyalty of employees, who had at first viewed him warily.But after a falling out with NBC chieftains over programming control, he quit in 1995. Almost immediately he called on Mr. Murdoch, who longed for a news network of his own and shared Mr. Ailes\u2019s belief that existing news organizations were far too liberal. They created Fox News in fairly short order. Eventually, dozens of seasoned NBC employees joined them. With characteristic bite, Mr. Ailes described their defection as \u201ca jailbreak.\u201dRoger Eugene Ailes was born on May 15, 1940, in Warren, Ohio, a blue-collar town near Youngstown. His father, Robert, was a foreman at the Packard Electric Company, and his mother, Donna, a housewife who brought in extra money by embroidering handkerchiefs for sale. Theirs was a rocky marriage. His father was known for abusiveness.Found to have hemophilia as a child, Roger more than once nearly bled to death, as when he fell and bit his tongue at age 2. (Mr. Ailes had also been bleeding heavily when paramedics found him on a bathroom floor at his home on May 10, the police said. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner\u2019s office said his hemophilia had contributed to his death.)Assorted maladies plagued Mr. Ailes through life. He dealt with blood-pooling around the joints and, in time, developed arthritis and severe weight problems.Despite the ailments, or perhaps because of them, he did not shy from physical contact, whether digging ditches as a teenager or getting into occasional fistfights. Even after politics and television had made him a rich man, he reveled in portraying himself as a working-class tough guy. That sensibility, and a disdain for most journalists, infused his network\u2019s news coverage.\u201cI\u2019ve had a broad life experience that doesn\u2019t translate into going to the Columbia Journalism School,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes me a lot better journalist than some guys who had to listen to some pathetic professor who has been on the public dole all his life and really doesn\u2019t like this country much.\u201dMr. Ailes\u2019s interest in broadcasting was ignited at Ohio University, in Athens, where he worked on the college radio station before graduating in 1962.There, he met Marjorie White, the first of his three wives. Their 17-year marriage ended in 1977. His second wife was Norma Ferrer, a television producer, but that union ended, too, in 1995, after 14 years. His third wife, Elizabeth Tilson, was a program director at CNBC. They were married in 1998 at New York\u2019s City Hall in a ceremony presided over by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former Ailes political client.In 2000, with the birth of a son, Zachary, Mr. Ailes became a first-time father at nearly 60. His survivors include his wife and son as well as an older brother, Dr. Robert J. Ailes.After college, Mr. Ailes started out as a production assistant on \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show,\u201d which was then based in Cleveland. He rose swiftly, becoming executive producer at 28. A turning point for him came in early 1968, when Nixon went on the show as his presidential campaign took form. Wary of television \u2014 convinced that he had lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy on the basis of appearances \u2014 Nixon dismissed it in a conversation with Mr. Ailes as a \u201cgimmick.\u201d\u201cTelevision is not a gimmick,\u201d Mr. Ailes said boldly, \u201cand if you think it is, you\u2019ll lose again.\u201dNixon took those words to heart, and took the young man onto his campaign as a media adviser. Mr. Ailes strove to make Nixon more likable \u2014 no simple task \u2014 giving him a makeover that included town hall-style sessions with carefully screened audiences that asked easy questions and allowed the candidate to seem assured.In the 1970s, Mr. Ailes set up shop in New York, where he solidified his growing reputation as a master of bare-knuckled politics.Even then, he had visions of a right-of-center network, and played an important role in developing Television News Inc., or TVN, a news service financed by the ardently conservative Joseph Coors, of the beer-making family. Its slogan was one that would ring loudly years later: \u201cfair and balanced.\u201d TVN distributed news clips with a conservative slant to television networks and local stations. But it did not truly get off the ground, and collapsed in 1975 after two years.In that era Mr. Ailes also flirted with the theater world, producing a few Off Broadway shows. An initial effort, an ecologically themed musical called \u201cMother Earth,\u201d flopped. But he enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with \u201cThe Hot l Baltimore,\u201d a Lanford Wilson play about down-and-outers.As a campaign strategist, Mr. Ailes helped elect powerful Republican senators like Mitch McConnell, Phil Gramm and Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato. But his most notable work was at the presidential level.When Mr. Reagan floundered for a while in his 1984 re-election campaign, Mr. Ailes coached him in ways to appear sharper in a televised debate and to display his innate affability. Four years later, the aggressive Ailes approach kicked into high gear in the presidential campaign of the elder George Bush. He coaxed Mr. Bush into sounding tough, to dispel a so-called wimp factor that hung over the candidate like a dark cloud.That was the campaign of the notorious Willie Horton commercial. It focused on a black man who had raped a woman and assaulted her husband while free on a prison-furlough program in Massachusetts that was supported by the Democratic candidate, Michael S. Dukakis. The ad was widely attacked as blatantly racist, but it appeared to work as a vote magnet for Mr. Bush.Mr. Ailes claimed he had nothing to do with the commercial. Nonetheless, he told Time magazine in 1988 that \u201cthe only question is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it.\u201d He later said he was joking.Reflecting on his career as a political operative, he insisted that he had not been motivated by a right-wing agenda.\u201cPeople think I stayed in politics because I wanted conservatives to run the world,\u201d he told The New York Times Magazine in 1995. \u201cActually, it was the money.\u201dYet he clung to conservative politics even in the quiet setting of Garrison, N.Y., where he and his wife bought property in 2001, across the Hudson River from the United States Military Academy. In 2008 the couple purchased a sleepy community newspaper, The Putnam County News and Recorder, and, with Ms. Ailes as publisher, turned it into a blunt instrument of conservative thought. They sold the paper toward the end of 2016. They bought their Palm Beach home last fall for a reported $36 million.Mr. Ailes relished his reputation as a battler. Take the time he punched that hole in the wall. \u201cIt was just a drywall, and luckily I didn\u2019t hit any beams,\u201d he told Zev Chafets, author of the biography \u201cRoger Ailes: Off Camera.\u201d\u201cBut somebody,\u201d he said, \u201cput a frame around the hole and wrote, \u2018Don\u2019t mess with Roger Ailes.\u2019 \u201dAn earlier version of a capsule summary for this obituary misstated the given name of Mr. Ailes. As the obituary correctly notes, he was Roger, not Robert.Jose Lambiet contributed reporting from Palm Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Can\u2019t Sustain Its Debt-Fueled Binge, Moody\u2019s Says", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China has gone on a spending spree, borrowing money to build cities, create manufacturing giants and nurture financial markets \u2014 money that has helped drive the economic powerhouse in recent years. But the debt-fueled binge now threatens to sap the energy of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.With its economy maturing, China has to pile on ever more debt to keep its growth going, at a pace that could prove unsustainable. And the money is increasingly flowing through opaque channels that operate outside the regulated banking system, leaving China vulnerable to blowups.A major credit agency sounded the alarm on Wednesday, saying the steady buildup of debt would erode China\u2019s financial strength in the years ahead. The agency, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, cut the country\u2019s debt rating, its first downgrade for the country since 1989.China\u2019s debt problems stem from the global financial crisis in 2008. As world growth faltered, China unleashed a wave of spending to build highways, airports and real estate developments \u2014 all of which kept its economic engine chugging.To finance the construction, local officials and state-run companies borrowed heavily. Even after the worst of the crisis passed, China continued to rely on debt to fund growth.But debt no longer packs the same economic punch for China. An aging work force, smaller productivity gains and the sheer math of diminishing returns mean it must borrow more money to achieve less growth.China\u2019s debt has been increasing lately by an amount equal to about 15 percent of the country\u2019s output each year, to keep the economy growing from 6.5 percent to 7 percent. Overall debt in China, by the same measure, barely changed from 2001 to 2008, when the country achieved some of its fastest double-digit growth rates.As a percentage of economic output, China\u2019s total debt \u2014 including the government, households and businesses \u2014 is now high for a developing country. It has similar levels to those of many developed Western countries, though its debt load is still considerably smaller than Japan\u2019s, according to the Institute of International Finance, a trade group of global banks. Some economists now compare China to Japan, where a lack of willingness to deal with its deeply indebted companies has led to what is commonly called the Lost Decade, a period of sluggish economic activity there.Against that backdrop, Moody\u2019s on Wednesday lowered its rating on China\u2019s sovereign debt by one notch, to A1 from Aa3. The move brings it in line with another major ratings company, Fitch Ratings. A third, Standard & Poor\u2019s, rates China a notch higher but with a negative outlook, which means its next move is also likely to be downward. Moody\u2019s changed its outlook for further rating changes to stable from negative.\u201cThe downgrade reflects Moody\u2019s expectation that China\u2019s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economywide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows,\u201d the credit rating company said.China criticized the move within hours, saying that Moody\u2019s failed to understand China\u2019s legal or financial systems and underestimated the country\u2019s efforts to restructure its economy to achieve more sustainable growth. More broadly, experts inside and outside China believe Beijing probably has the power to stop a meltdown of the kind that slammed the United States and much of the rest of the world a decade ago, thanks to the Chinese government\u2019s considerable financial firepower and ironclad grip on the country\u2019s banking system.Economists at the International Monetary Fund and at Goldman Sachs have issued a series of increasingly strong warnings about the pace at which the debt is rising. China\u2019s financial system has traditionally been firmly under the control of the central government, giving many economists confidence that Chinese officials could contain a crisis of the sort that gripped the world in 2008. Still, fast growth and signs of fragility in the financial system have given pause to economists and Chinese regulators alike.Chinese corporate debt has been mounting, and China\u2019s banks show little inclination to force companies to do something about it. China\u2019s banks have kept lending to the country\u2019s state-owned companies, even to those in trouble, to help them make payments on previous loans. That helps those companies stay in business and helps the economy keep growing despite mounting debt.Regulators and economists are also questioning where China\u2019s lending comes from.Traditionally, China\u2019s lending has come from four big, state-controlled banks with a solid deposit base. But in recent years, local and provincial banks that lack the deposit base and nationwide branch network of their bigger brethren have grown rapidly, and they now account for half of the assets in the banking system.The worry is that if the public loses confidence and stops buying these wealth management products from smaller banks and nonbank firms, a wave of defaults could spread across the economy.In a series of interviews over the last two weeks, current and former Chinese officials contended that the structure of their country\u2019s debt made it inherently much more stable than the debts of other nations.For starters, China owes little to other countries. Brad Setser, a former Treasury official specializing in China\u2019s finances who is now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China\u2019s $3 trillion in foreign reserves far exceeded the country\u2019s overseas debts and gave it a large financial cushion.Within China, most households also appear to have manageable debts, in contrast with the United States before its mortgage crisis. Only in the past year and a half has China allowed rapid growth in mortgages to help the construction industry as well as its suppliers, like steel mills and cement factories. Overall mortgage debt is still fairly low.The central government in China also owes little over all, with total debts equal to less than 40 percent of the economy. That means the government has a lot of capacity to borrow money and bail out troubled borrowers.By far, the biggest category of debt in China is corporate debt, which equals almost 170 percent of annual economic output. This debt consists overwhelmingly of loans by state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.On Wednesday, the Finance Ministry said the downgrade was a mistake because it applied to China\u2019s central government bonds, even though the central government was not on the hook for the debts of local governments and state-owned companies.Still, China could end up paying the tab. The central government could decide to tell the state-owned banks to write off a lot of their bad loans, and then recapitalize the banks by providing money to them.

{"Headline": "Discounted Cars Benefit Buyers, but May Spell Trouble for Industry", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byWheelsBig cash discounts are making a comeback in the car business.Now that sales of new cars and trucks are slowing down, automakers and their dealers are starting to lop thousands of dollars off sticker prices \u2014 sometimes slashing the final cost by a third \u2014 a sales tactic that helps consumers but has led to industry troubles in the past.Take the Nissan Altima, one of the country\u2019s top-selling cars. Some dealers around the country are now offering the midsize sedan for $6,000 to $8,000 below list prices. In Stafford, Va., Leckner Nissan has marked down 59 Altimas in stock, including a black 2017 Altima SV it is selling to sell for as little as $21,593 \u2014 $7,195 below its sticker price.Sizable price cuts are being offered on the Hyundai Sonata, the Chevrolet Malibu, the Ford Fusion and many other models.\u201cThe market is slowing down and now inventories are building up, so the manufacturers are putting money out to move these cars,\u201d said Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich.The hefty price cuts are the latest signs of difficulty in the auto industry. In April, sales declined 4.7 percent, to 1.4 million cars and light trucks. Forecasters expect sales of about 17.2 million vehicles in 2017, down from last year\u2019s record of 17.5 million.While that is still a healthy level, cash discounts are one of the first tactics automakers typically turn to when they feel the need to lure more shoppers into new-car lots.The trouble is, big price cuts, if maintained for extended periods, can hurt automakers by eating into their profit margins and lowering the value of used cars. A decade ago, offers of \u201ccash on the hood\u201d reached a frenzy when General Motors offered employee pricing to all customers, and other automakers rushed to match the deal. Such discounting helped push the industry into crisis, and G.M. into bankruptcy.Mr. Lutz\u2019s franchise is offering a gray 2017 Dodge Challenger coupe for $27,900 \u2014 $6,680 under its list price \u2014 thanks to an incentive program that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ran last month allowing dealers to discount the price on certain models by up to 20 percent.\u201cThis is a great deal. Consumers win. Dealers win. I can sell a lot of cars if I have $7,000 discounts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so great for the manufacturers, though.\u201dThere appear to be few types of vehicles without discounts. The trucks, S.U.V.s and other roomy vehicles that Americans favor these days are also being offered at bargain prices. Bomnin Chevrolet in Miami is selling a white 2017 Colorado pickup truck for $19,281 \u2014 $4,854 below its sticker price, a saleswoman at the dealership confirmed. It will lower the price by $1,000 more for customers who finance the truck through the dealership. Yet another discount of $1,250 is available if a customer can show he has a family member who leases a vehicle from a competing manufacturer.In Snohomish, Wash., near Seattle, Bickford Ford has slashed the prices of Escape S.U.V.s. This week one front-wheel-drive model, in a brownish color known as \u201cCanyon Ridge Metallic,\u201d was on sale at $24,645 \u2014 $9,000 below the list price.Many heavily discounted vehicles are not stripped-down, basic models, but fully loaded versions with all the bells and whistles. Leckner Nissan has discounts of up to $10,000 off the price of several Murano S.U.V.s equipped with navigation systems, heated seats, all-wheel drive and other features.Luxury brands are also cutting prices but tend to offer smaller cash discounts and limit them to certain slow-selling models. Consumers who hunt around can find deals on sedans like the BMW 320, the Cadillac ATS and the Infiniti Q50, though.\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to buy a car. The consumer is in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d said Mark Scarpelli, owner of Chevrolet, Kia and Chrysler Jeep franchises in the Chicago area.Tom Maltic is the kind of potential buyer they\u2019re looking for. A retiree living near Jackson, Mich., about 60 miles west of Detroit, he has just started shopping for a used pickup truck to tow a recreational vehicle and haul his hockey gear.\u201cBut now I\u2019m thinking maybe I should buy new,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are some really nice discounts, maybe I pay a little bit more but I don\u2019t have to worry if something is going to break down.\u201dTo manage the flow of unsold cars, automakers can also change production levels. General Motors and Ford Motor have recently cut shifts at a handful of plants in the United States, for example. Fiat Chrysler has stopped making compact and midsize cars altogether.But these days, new cars rolling out of the factory also face increasing competition from used cars, an inventory that is largely out of automakers\u2019 control. Some 3.5 million vehicles that were leased for the last two or three years will be returned and sold as gently used cars this year, and even more are coming in 2018, according to Edmunds.com. Sometimes consumers can choose between a new car and a two-year-old model that has been driven just 20,000 miles and is selling for half the price.As the industry rebounded over the last seven years, automakers had been careful to limit pure cash discounts and try more subtle ways of offering deals. Sometimes they give dealers discounts to allow them more leeway to negotiate prices with customers. Or they give dealers discounts tied to aggressive sales targets, a practice that sometimes results in very little profit for dealers while preserving the manufacturer\u2019s margins.Automakers have also turned more heavily to leasing, and longer loans of 72 or 84 months, which keep the customer\u2019s monthly payment affordable.Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the current wave of discounts was not yet a repeat of the mistakes the industry had made in the past. Most of the price cuts offered so far are limited to certain models, or certain regions of the country, as opposed to the big, across-the-board campaigns of the last decade that applied to all vehicles in stock, Ms. Krebs said.\u201cThey\u2019re much more targeted. They\u2019re not plastering them all over like they used to,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t see this as the sins of the past.\u201dG.M. and Ford continue to rack up big profits, underpinning that view. But troublesome signs are cropping up. On Wednesday, Toyota Motor said it lost money in North America in the quarter that ended March 31, its first loss in the region in five years.One of the reasons it cited: rising sales incentives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Hopes for Rewriting Tax Code in 2017 Are Fading", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Only two months ago, Republicans in Congress and President Trump\u2019s top economic advisers were confidently predicting that a sweeping rewrite of the tax code would be in hand by summer\u2019s end.But with the White House consumed with constant upheaval, Congress facing the prospect of myriad investigations on top of its delayed duty to fund the government, and health care legislation still grinding through the Senate, those hopes have faded. Even with the less ambitious plan of just tax cuts \u2014 not a tax overhaul \u2014 the new mantra in Washington is \u201cMaybe next year.\u201d\u201cI think people are beginning to settle in and come to the realization that this is going to be a long ride,\u201d said Ken Spain, a former National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman who lobbies for businesses on tax issues. \u201cThe hope was to get something done by the end of 2017, but this could slip to 2018.\u201dMembers of Congress have quietly started to modulate their ambitions. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said on Tuesday that passing tax cuts \u201cthis Congress\u201d was more likely than revamping the tax code this year. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who still hopes to get something passed in 2017, has stopped publicly setting monthly goals.The realization is a gloomy one for Republicans who have spent years waiting for the planets to finally align and make a tax overhaul possible. Differences between the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives over what shape a tax plan should take have stalled the crafting of legislation.Despite the disappointing fits and starts, they are trying to get things on track this week.On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, head to the Capitol for a briefing with Republicans and Democrats of the Senate Finance Committee on where the tax overhaul stands. It will be a rare moment of bipartisan outreach for an administration that has said it expects any tax legislation to be a Republican-only affair.The House, which released its own blueprint almost a year ago, will take an important step forward on Thursday when the Ways and Means Committee holds its first public hearing on taxes. Republicans will call business executives to testify about why the existing system needs to be changed to spur economic growth, while Democrats will invite Steven Rattner, the investor and former Obama administration official, to discuss the importance of focusing tax cuts on the middle class.The hearing will be an appetizer for a session on Tuesday that will focus on the contentious border adjustment tax that Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Mr. Brady have been pitching across the country. Opponents of the proposal, which would impose a 20 percent tax on imports, have been swarming the capital this week to stop it in its tracks.Mr. Brady and Mr. Ryan both insisted this week that some form of border adjustment tax remained crucial to a tax overhaul, while Mr. McConnell said it would not have sufficient support to pass in the Senate. The White House has not backed it.As he left the meeting with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the White House was still struggling to add substance to the one-page outline it released last month.\u201cTo date, they have not given us very much \u2014 one page \u2014 I\u2019ve had drugstore receipts that were longer,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cThe clock is really ticking down, and they need to get us some specifics soon.\u201dDespite the flurry of activity, the prospects of quick action on taxes are dim because Congress has so many other things to deal with. Mr. Trump is expected to release a budget next week. That will set off a new debate about cuts to domestic programs and increases in military and border security spending for 2018. Congress faces an October deadline to pass a funding bill for next year. Otherwise, parts of the government will shut down.Republicans in Congress must separately approve a budget resolution this summer if they want to use the reconciliation process to pass a tax overhaul with a simple majority in the Senate. That will determine the scope of the tax legislation that Republicans can pursue if they choose to exclude Democrats from the process. Health care legislation that is being put together in the Senate could lead to additional delays.And to top things off, Republicans and Democrats must reach a deal this fall over raising the debt ceiling.\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that we can have actual legislation on the president\u2019s desk in calendar year 2017,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former director of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cThere are a lot of other things on their plate, and they don\u2019t have that many days left.\u201dAnalysts on Wall Street are also tempering their optimism. Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients last week that the prospect of tax cuts was looking less rosy than a few weeks ago and that passage of any legislation in 2017 was \u201cunlikely.\u201dRohit Kumar, a tax expert at PwC who used to advise Mr. McConnell, said he hoped the behind-the-scenes negotiations that have so far slowed progress on tax legislation would help speed its eventual enactment once everyone gets on the same page.However, he acknowledged that the continuing swirl of questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Russia and the furor over his firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, could have implications that are hard to foresee.\u201cI don\u2019t have a good sense for how much more drama the system can tolerate before it detracts form the ability to advance the legislative agenda,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cThere is some theoretical limit for the system.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "500 Students in a One-Room School: Fallout of New Jersey\u2019s Funding Woes", "Date": "2017-05-14", "News": "Supported byFREEHOLD BOROUGH, N.J. \u2014 At an elementary school in Freehold, over 500 students share a vast, open space where bookshelves, whiteboards, storage cubbies and other pieces of furniture are the only boundaries between classrooms.There are no walls because the building was originally designed in the 1970s to be a smaller Montessori school, Rocco Tomazic, the superintendent of the Freehold Borough School District, explained during a recent tour. But now it is noisy and crowded, and the district does not have the money to move students into traditional closed classrooms \u2014 the kind with walls and fewer distractions.The issue for Freehold Borough \u2014 and about two-thirds of New Jersey\u2019s 586 school districts \u2014 is the state\u2019s nine-year-old formula for paying for public schools. Adopted by the State Legislature in 2008, it calculates how much each district needs to ensure that students receive a \u201cthorough and efficient\u201d education, regardless of income, as New Jersey law requires.The formula directs extra dollars to districts with children who are learning English, students with disabilities and those living in poverty. But hundreds of towns, including Freehold Borough, where 75 percent of the schoolchildren are Latino, have not gotten their full share of funding under the formula since 2010. This year, for instance, the district was due $23 million, Mr. Tomazic said. It got $9 million.\u201cState aid has been flat-funded since at least 2010, with no adjustments for enrollment, for our at-risk students, for our special-needs students, for our English-language-learner students,\u201d said Joe Howe, the district\u2019s business administrator.When the state falls short, the burden falls on local governments. In Freehold, that has meant overcrowded classes, a library converted into classrooms for English learners, a small gymnasium that doubles as a school cafeteria and an elementary school class with 28 students \u2014 well over the recommended 21.The Freehold Borough School District is the 33rd-poorest district in New Jersey; 78 percent of its students are eligible for subsidized meals. Low-income communities cannot turn to property tax payers to cover what the state has not provided because the tax base will not generate enough financing.David Sciarra, the director of the New Jersey Education Law Center, says the problem is not the funding formula but Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s decision not to abide by it.\u201cThe problem is seven, going on eight, years of Governor Christie\u2019s stubborn refusal to put any new state aid to invest any new money over an extended period of time,\u201d Mr. Sciarra said.Some districts in the state, however, are actually overfunded. Places like Jersey City, Hoboken and Asbury Park \u2014 cities that have gentrified \u2014 are receiving more money than they are owed from the state. A loophole in the formula allows those cities to continue getting the same aid even after the student population has shrunk or property tax revenue increases.In his February budget address, Mr. Christie criticized the funding formula, calling it unfair. \u201cCertain municipalities are ripping off the state; certain school districts are being ripped off,\u201d he said. Mr. Christie had promoted a new formula that would set aside the same amount for each public school student, regardless of income. But critics called the proposal unfair to low-income districts. Now, Mr. Christie has asked the Legislature to come up with a new funding plan.Any solution would most likely pit district against district and the needs of property owners against the needs of public school students. And emotions are rising. In Clifton, students staged a walkout. In Paterson, one of the state\u2019s poorest cities, hundreds of teachers have been laid off.When state legislators recently held a budget hearing, parents and district administrators packed the room to plead for more funding. Valerie Freeman, a parent who lives in Paterson, said nurses and substance abuse counselors had been cut throughout the district.\u201cMost of our children, they walk through harsh areas in our school. Most of them are coming to school high. But, what can the teacher do?\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe teachers can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201dWith Mr. Christie entering the final months of his term, the issue of how to get enough money to school districts will probably fall to the next governor, who will be elected in November. It is a monumental task because the state faces many financial challenges, including a public transit system that has had several major breakdowns and an underfunded state pension system.The four leading Democratic candidates for governor all say the state has an obligation to abide by the existing school funding formula.One of the candidates, John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, said he would find the money by limiting the amount of tax breaks given to corporations. He criticized the Christie administration for granting millions in tax breaks to companies while schools struggle.Another candidate, State Senator Ray Lesniak, said he would put a moratorium on charter schools; traditional public schools lose money when students leave to attend public charter schools because the state money is shifted to the charter.A third candidate, Jim Johnson, a former federal prosecutor, said he would expand state aid to include prekindergarten and after-school services. He said he would go after federal dollars to support the programs.The leading Democratic candidate, Philip D. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, said the state had an obligation to fund the school formula, though he said that it might need to be tweaked and that an increase in taxes would be necessary.On the Republican side, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is seeking to replace her boss, says the formula needs to be overhauled, but she also says the extra money that has gone to overfunded districts should be directed to property taxpayers in the form of a credit on their property tax bill.Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, a state assemblyman, has a detailed plan that includes requiring all communities to contribute at least 25 percent of their public education costs, and reducing the excess aid some districts are getting.But there has been resistance from districts that have gotten extra money. Officials of those districts argue that their property owners do not want their taxes to go up, either.On Thursday, the Freehold Borough School District sued the State Education Department on behalf of a parent who claims his children have been denied their right to the kind of education promised by state law. A spokesman for the agency said it did not comment on pending litigation.Mr. Tomazic, the superintendent, said the district would get some relief because the state\u2019s Schools Development Authority had agreed to finance renovations that would restore libraries and provide new classroom space. When local voters rejected two referendum proposals to raise property taxes, Mr. Tomazic appealed to the authority, saying he could not provide students the education they were entitled to.\u201cWe cited regulations and law of what we were supposed to do and showed where we were short because of the space,\u201d citing the closing of libraries and cutting of gym time, Mr. Tomazic said. And he tracked how district students performed after they went to a regional high school.\u201cOur students were not faring very well in getting into the honors when compared to the seven sending districts, all of which were wealthy,\u201d he said.But when the renovations are finished in late 2018, the district will still have 200 more students than its schools were designed to hold, and the elementary school where children learn in a large open space will still have classrooms without walls, he said.Building new classrooms does not solve all Freehold\u2019s problems. Unless the state fulfills what the funding formula calls for, Mr. Tomazic said, he may not have teachers to fill them.Karen Rouse is a reporter for WNYC and New Jersey Public Radio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysian Money. Opulent Ideas. But Now, for Park Lane, a Forced Sale.", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byThe celebratory dinner was held at one of the city\u2019s chicest restaurants, whose building offers a picture-perfect view down Central Park South to the Park Lane Hotel, a 47-story tower that looms over its more famous neighbor, the Plaza.Steven Witkoff, a New York developer, had just won the bidding for the Park Lane. It was, he thought, the best location in Manhattan, if not the world, to build a supertower with ultraluxury apartments.\u201cThis was the best site in New York City and maybe the world,\u201d Mr. Witkoff said in an interview. \u201cWe designed what the entire partnership thought was a beautiful building. Little did we know we\u2019d face circumstances like this.\u201dMr. Witkoff was reluctant to go into detail about his dealings with Mr. Low, given the investigations and associated litigation.The story of the Park Lane offers a window into high-stakes development in Manhattan, where over the past decade a gusher of foreign capital, much of it difficult to trace to its original sources, has chased some of the most desirable real estate on earth.The once-ubiquitous Mr. Low has disappeared, possibly holed up in a hotel in Shanghai. He sits at the center of what the authorities are calling one of the biggest international money-laundering schemes ever.Mr. Low has denied any wrongdoing, as has Mr. Najib and the development fund. The federal complaint contends that $731 million from the fund, which was known as 1MDB, was deposited into accounts belonging to an official identified as \u201cMalaysian Official 1,\u201d who is widely believed to be Mr. Najib.The case has all the intrigue of a Robert Ludlum novel, with billions of dollars rocketing between bank accounts and shell companies in multiple countries. Authorities have shut down two Swiss banks and jailed several bankers. Investigations are underway in the United States, Switzerland, Malaysia and at least three other countries.The Park Lane, built in 1971 by Harry Helmsley, was architecturally uninspiring, but offered wide-angle views of Central Park. Mr. Helmsley and his wife, Leona, made their home at the top, in a three-story triplex that featured a 22-foot-long swimming pool.In 2013, as the Park Lane, one of the last remaining properties in the Helmsley estate, was put up for sale, Mr. Low was looking for a large real estate deal.Developers at the time were turning 57th Street into a billionaires\u2019 row, with a half-dozen skyscrapers, each boasting $100 million penthouses, under construction.The Park Lane looked like an unparalleled opportunity.Both Mr. Witkoff and Harry Macklowe, a longtime developer who was already building a billionaires\u2019 tower at 432 Park Avenue, lobbed unsolicited offers before the bidding even started.Finding financing for what promised to be a heated auction was no problem \u2014 there was so much pension and foreign money available for deals in New York. Mr. Macklowe had money from Abu Dhabi behind his bid.A lawyer introduced Mr. Witkoff to Mr. Low.The Malaysian financier had attended the Harrow School in London and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was close to Riza Aziz, a film producer and the stepson of Mr. Najib.In 2009, Mr. Najib established 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, to spur economic development. Mr. Low emerged as an adviser and a key figure in the fund\u2019s global deal making. The fraud and money laundering at 1MDB started almost immediately, according to the federal complaint.Mr. Low befriended celebrities, spent millions at Las Vegas casinos, gave charitable gifts worth tens of millions of dollars and went on a real estate shopping spree with money the Justice Department says was illegally diverted from 1MDB.He also bought a substantial stake in EMI Music in 2012, along with partners from Blackstone, the investment group, and the Mubadala Development Company, a sovereign investment fund based in Abu Dhabi.Mr. Low also had a tight relationship with Goldman Sachs, which earned hundreds of millions in fees from bond offerings it handled for 1MDB. According to the Justice Department forfeiture complaint, \u201c$1.4 billion was misappropriated and fraudulently diverted to bank accounts in Switzerland and Singapore\u201d controlled by Mr. Low from the bond offerings.With land prices soaring in New York, some developers take only a fractional equity interest in their projects and raise the additional money from lenders, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.That is what Mr. Witkoff did, and in July 2013, he won the auction of the Park Lane and signed a contract for $654 million. Mr. Witkoff and his partners \u2014 New Valley L.L.C., Highgate Holdings and eventually, Mr. Macklowe \u2014 had 15 percent of the deal. At the last minute, Mr. Low took a 55 percent stake and brought in Mubadala for the remaining 30 percent.Just before the closing in November, an executive in Mr. Witkoff\u2019s office sent an email to Mr. Low asking \u201cwhere the money on your side of the deal is coming from.\u201dAccording to the complaint, Mr. Low responded: \u201cLow family capital,\u201d and \u201cJust all the family.\u201d The Justice Department says the money came from 1MDB.At the closing, $202.2 million of Mr. Low\u2019s contribution came from client escrow accounts from one of his law firms, DLA Piper.The group hired the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron to design an undulating glass tower that would rise 855 feet, using air rights acquired from adjoining properties. The tower was set atop 140-foot-tall legs so the first floor would be above the tree line and every apartment would have an unimpeded view of the park. The developers figured the condominiums would command more than $8,000 a square foot.Mr. Low\u2019s contribution to the design was simple: Put outdoor swimming pools on the exterior galleries of each of the five penthouses, according to executives involved in the deal who requested anonymity because of the litigation.\u201cHe didn\u2019t \u2018like it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Witkoff said of Mr. Low. \u201cHe loved it.\u201dIn late 2015, the Park Lane owners were preparing to refinance the debt used to buy the property. Once again, according to the complaint, Mr. Low told his partners and the lender that his money came from family trusts established by his father.But JP Morgan Chase, the new lender in the deal, could not find out much about the Low family before 2009, according to the executives who were briefed on the deal, and raised questions. While law firms are not required to do due diligence on clients, banks are.In addition, critical stories started to appear in Malaysia about Prime Minister Najib, his relationship with Mr. Low and 1MDB. Then subpoenas arrived from the Justice Department.Mr. Low told his partners that the claims of alleged wrongdoing were baseless, the work of rival political parties in Malaysia.In July 2016, Mr. Low failed to make a loan payment on the Park Lane mortgage. At the same time, the Justice Department filed its civil complaint seeking to recover more than $1 billion in assets.\u201cThere is so much money moving around the world every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a need to focus on funds going into banks and high-value real estate and how that may be facilitating corruption and poverty around the world.\u201dUnder a cooperation agreement between Mr. Witkoff and the Justice Department, the hotel is to be sold and the proceeds divided between Mubadala and Mr. Witkoff\u2019s group. The government will take Mr. Low\u2019s share. The sale is being handled by Eastdil Secured, a real estate services company.The marketing books are expected to arrive this week. The pitch: The Park Lane is \u201cthe world\u2019s best development site.\u201dThe sellers hope the bids will exceed $1 billion.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the Mubadala Development Company headquarters.

{"Headline": "Tips for Financing That Home Remodeling", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserSummer is coming, and homeowners may be contemplating remodeling projects and household repairs during the warmer months. But with interest rates starting to rise, consumers should carefully consider their financing options.The recovery in housing prices means that more people have equity in their homes that they can tap for projects like adding a bathroom or updating a kitchen. As interest rates tick upward, though, homeowners may want to consider whether to draw on that equity for a remodel.\u201cI do think the rate landscape is a factor at this point in time,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.Mike Kinane, general manager for home equity products with TD Bank, said he did expect that \u201cconsumers will be borrowing against their homes\u201d for remodeling projectsHow will you pay for it?If you have the cash, it\u2019s wise to consider using it, because interest rates paid on savings are still quite low, said Robert Schmansky, founder of Clear Financial Advisors, outside Detroit. If you must finance the work, then a home-equity loan or line of credit \u201cisn\u2019t the end of the world,\u201d he said, although he suggested paying it down as quickly as possible.With interest rates trending up, refinancing an existing mortgage to take out cash for a remodeling is becoming less attractive. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.03 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3.66 percent a year ago.Home-equity lines of credit, which function like a credit card rather than a traditional term loan, have been one of the most popular ways to finance remodeling. Lines of credit, or Helocs, however, are more complex to manage than a traditional second mortgage and come with variable interest rates, typically tied to the prime rate. That means monthly payments will rise \u2014 perhaps more than some homeowners are comfortable with \u2014 if the interest rate on the loans increases.The average rate on a home-equity line of credit is 5.45 percent, Mr. McBride said, although some lenders offer initial \u201cteaser\u201d rates as low as 2.99 percent for an introductory period, typically six months.Before the financial crisis, as home values skyrocketed, borrowers used the lines to finance all sorts of things, from vacations to new cars. But since the recession, borrowers have been using the lines more responsibly, to fund specific upgrades on their homes or to pay for college costs, Mr. Kinane said.\u201cThe majority of it is remodeling,\u201d he said.The average draw \u2014 the amount of the credit line that is in use \u2014 is about $50,000 nationally, Mr. Kinane said.Home-equity loans \u2014 a traditional second mortgage, typically made at a fixed-interest rate \u2014 may be more palatable than lines of credit as rates rise.Mr. Kinane said he had seen a \u201cvery slight uptick\u201d in applications for home equity loans, rather than lines of credit, as borrowers react to news of rising interest rates.But home-equity loans may be harder to find, Mr. McBride said. Many larger banks stopped making them, preferring to offer lines of credit, which reduce risk to the lender from rising rates. Borrowers who do locate home-equity loans, however, are likely to find rates that are comparable to the average rate on a line of credit. \u201cYou have to shop around,\u201d he said.The choice is ultimately dependent on the consumer\u2019s risk tolerance. \u201cIf they don\u2019t like the possibility that the rate can change,\u201d Mr. Kinane said, \u201cthen the loan product is probably a safer bet.\u201dThere is one more way to manage the risk of rising rates: Many lenders offer the option of converting the amount of money that you have already drawn from a line of credit into a fixed-rate loan to lock in a rate.Here are some questions and answers about home-equity financing:Do I have to use a home-equity line of credit right away?Some lenders require a \u201cminimum draw\u201d when you close on the line of credit, Mr. McBride said. So make sure you know about such requirements and consider whether it meets the timing of your project. If you must borrow $10,000 right off the bat, but your contractor can\u2019t schedule you for another several months, you\u2019ll end up paying interest unnecessarily.Is there any disadvantage to using a fixed-rate home-equity loan for a remodel?Loans are made in a lump sum. You can\u2019t borrow more if your project goes over budget. Revolving lines of credit are more flexible. You borrow as you need the money. So they may make more sense for projects that are being done in stages over a longer period of time, Mr. McBride said.Can I deduct the interest I pay on a home-equity loan or line of credit?Generally, yes. But check with your tax adviser.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medicaid Expansion, Reversed by House, Is Back on Table in Senate", "Date": "2017-05-15", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate negotiators, meeting stiff resistance to the House\u2019s plans to sharply reduce the scope and reach of Medicaid, are discussing a compromise that would maintain the program\u2019s expansion under the Affordable Care Act but subject that larger version of Medicaid to new spending limits.Those changes would, for the first time, put Medicaid on a budget, limiting federal payments to states for care provided to tens of millions of low-income people \u2014 not just those who gained Medicaid coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act, but also children, people with disabilities and nursing home residents who have been eligible for decades under the law that created Medicaid in 1965. The House bill would cut expected Medicaid spending by more than $800 billion over 10 years, according to the most recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.A bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act has been \u201cleveraged, by a sleight of hand, into reform of the entire Medicaid program,\u201d said Greg Moody, director of the Office of Health Transformation in Ohio, run by the state\u2019s Republican governor, John R. Kasich.States could face tough choices because Medicaid spending per beneficiary is expected to increase faster than the limits in the House bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office and an independent commission that advises Congress on Medicaid policy. State governments could cut services, limit beneficiaries or take on more of the funding responsibility.\u201cWe have a hard time seeing this as anything more than a budget fix for the federal government,\u201d said Leslie M. Clement, director of health policy and analytics at the Oregon Health Authority, which runs the state Medicaid program. \u201cIt\u2019s a cost shift to Oregon and other states.\u201dSenators may wish to provide more assistance to low-income people and older Americans. But talks cannot gain real momentum until the Congressional Budget Office delivers its final analysis of the House bill next week. And Senate leaders will face the same difficult dynamic that House leaders confronted: Any move to ease the concerns of moderate Republicans or senators from Medicaid-expansion states runs the risk of alienating conservative hard-liners, especially Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.On Medicaid, senators have discussed possible trade-offs. One idea is to preserve the expansion of Medicaid eligibility but impose new limits on Medicaid spending. Senators could modify the House bill to change how the caps are computed, but they are far from any final decisions.Speaker Paul D. Ryan has described the proposed changes in Medicaid as \u201cthe most historic entitlement reform we have ever had.\u201dBut Bruce Lesley, the president of First Focus, a child advocacy group, said the per capita limits would prompt states to curtail eligibility, cut lifesaving health benefits or reduce payments to providers.The American Medical Association weighed in on Monday, urging the Senate to prevent any loss of insurance. \u201cChanges to the financing of Medicaid must also guarantee that the safety net remains strong and is able to respond quickly,\u201d Dr. James L. Madara, chief executive of the association, said in a letter to Senate leaders.Under current law, the federal government and states share the costs of Medicaid, with the federal government reimbursing states for a percentage of their spending. The federal commitment is open-ended: If more people enroll in Medicaid because of a recession, or if costs per person go up because of a disease outbreak or the development of an expensive new medicine, the federal government automatically provides additional money.By contrast, under the bill passed this month by the House, the federal government would set an annual limit on payments to each state, starting in 2020. In the bill, the limit is called a \u201cper capita cap on payments for medical assistance,\u201d but that is somewhat misleading. The bill does not limit how much Medicaid can spend on any particular individual. Rather, it limits how much the federal government will pay a state in the aggregate for all its Medicaid beneficiaries.The limit would be set by calculating the average per-person cost of care for five specified groups of Medicaid beneficiaries (people 65 and older, people with disabilities, children under 19, newly eligible adults and other nondisabled adults under 65). These numbers would be increased each year to reflect growth in medical costs and would be multiplied by the number of Medicaid beneficiaries in each category to determine the overall limit on federal payments to each state.The formula would automatically increase payments when enrollment increased. But state Medicaid officials say it would not provide an adequate allowance for increases in medical costs or for changes in the needs of beneficiaries in each enrollment group. If a state spent more than its target, as defined by Congress, the federal government would not provide additional funds to match that spending.Medicaid spending varies greatly among the five groups, averaging $3,500 a year for children, $14,500 for beneficiaries over 65, and $20,000 for people with disabilities.Under the bill, the limits for most Medicaid beneficiaries would rise with one measure of the cost of care: the medical component within the \u201cbasket of goods and services\u201d that the government uses to calculate the Consumer Price Index, a government measure of inflation. The caps for older and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries would be allowed to rise by an additional percentage point.Vernon K. Smith, a former Medicaid director in Michigan who is now a consultant to many states, said increases in Medicaid costs were not always captured in that national measure of inflation. Hepatitis C, for example, is more common among Medicaid beneficiaries than in the general population, so when effective but expensive new hepatitis drugs became available several years ago, Medicaid costs were affected much more than national health spending.Mr. Moody of the Ohio Office of Health Transformation said that Mr. Kasich and some other Republican governors could live with per capita limits on Medicaid spending if they had more freedom to manage the program and keep costs under the cap. For example, he said, Medicaid spending on prescription drugs is growing much faster than spending on other items, and state officials could better control pharmacy costs if they had more freedom to decide which drugs to cover.Although Democrats now oppose per capita allotments in Medicaid, they once supported the idea. \u201cA per capita cap would limit the amount of federal spending per eligible person while retaining current eligibility and benefit guidelines,\u201d President Bill Clinton said in a 1996 message to Congress proposing ways to balance the budget.Bruce C. Vladeck, then the head of the agency that runs Medicaid and Medicare, defended the proposal at a congressional hearing. Per capita limits, he said, would put Medicaid spending on a sustainable course while protecting coverage for beneficiaries.Republicans say it is hypocritical of Democrats to resist the caps now.But in an interview, Mr. Vladeck said the situation was different today. In 1995 and 1996, he said, the Clinton administration embraced per capita caps as a \u201cnegotiating position\u201d to counter Republican efforts to convert Medicaid into a block grant, a fixed amount of money that would not respond to population growth or an economic downturn.In the current fight over the future of the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Vladeck said, Democrats should not even discuss per capita limits while Republicans are \u201ctrying to end coverage for 12 million people\u201d by phasing out the expansion of Medicaid.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Look of the French Election", "Date": "2017-05-03", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookFor the country glued to the TV, it made for a strategic statement, even before she said a word.And it underscored the point made by Samir Hammal, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po (the Paris Institute of Political Studies), who said that while \u201cour male presidents have traditionally cast themselves as the fathers of the nation, she has cast herself as the mother.\u201d To this end, she has been a master at dressing the part.After all, one of the things the 48-year-old lawyer and mother understood from the very beginning of her political career was just how large a role her own style could play in reshaping perception, not just of herself and her family, but of their party itself. Whatever you think of her politics, and the broader implications of her rise and that of the far right in Europe, that she has gotten so far means it is important to consider the way she has gone about normalizing what was once dismissed as fringe. In this, clothes have played a central role.Just because they did so in a country where dress is not deemed an unseemly consideration for serious people, and self-expression through fashion is practically a sacrament, does not make her tactical use of her wardrobe any less resonant for us all.Since 2011, when Ms. Le Pen took over the party her father built and moved it away from its anti-Semitic, racist and xenophobic roots to make it a palpable, if uncomfortable, force in French politics, she has been deft about using her own image as a tool in separating herself from the French elites, and about making her formerly toxic party look \u2026 well, like everybody else. Literally.She has transformed herself, as Mr. Hammal said, from the extremist next door to the \u201cwoman next door.\u201d\u201cAll past leaders, from Louis XIV to Napoleon, have used costume to create legitimacy for their power,\u201d Mr. Hammal said. \u201cBut Marine Le Pen is one of the best.\u201d She realized early on, he said, that dress could be a tool to help legitimize her party. And that as a woman, with all the greater wardrobe choice and freedom that suggests, she was the ideal person to wield it.It began with a haircut. In 2007, when Ms. Le Pen became the director of strategy for her father\u2019s presidential campaign, she lopped off her Farrah Fawcett locks and adopted her shoulder-grazing flip, going from seductive to Doris Day with a touch of the curling iron. Like Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel, she adopted a uniform of basic pantsuits, though she alternates them with straight, above-the-knee skirts to emphasize her femininity (see her much-discussed campaign poster with its flash of thigh) and the occasional jeans and trench coat. The message was generic female executive with a patriotic color palette: red, blue and white, the tones of the tricolor, set off against black and white.She has made something of a signature out of being unbranded, abandoning her Dior sunglasses along with the couture trappings of the patrimony that have long been embraced by the French female political establishment.Indeed, she has been adept at adopting her clothes to her constituencies: wearing a bright red jacket, navy shirt and pumps at a party rally; wrinkled black trousers and a zip-up jacket on the streets of Amiens while talking to striking factory workers.Mr. Hammal calls this \u201cmirroring,\u201d and for a politician running on a populist ticket, claiming to feel the pain of marginalized working men and women, it has been indubitably effective.\u201cIf you listened to the same speech coming out of the mouth of a man, it would not have the same effect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because of how she looks when she says it, how maternal she seems, it\u2019s much easier to hear.\u201dAfter all, in the encyclopedia of political tactics, makeover comes just after Machiavelli. Or, perhaps it should from now on.He is the teacher\u2019s pet, or chouchou, who once dressed like the big kid who literally married his high school instructor. He is an economics geek with a degree in philosophy who headed a government finance ministry while clad in the strictly-tailored power suits favored by members of the Grandes \u00c9coles elite.He is athletic and mediagenic, a Kennedy-style maverick, a candidate for the digital age and also one whose pretty-boy looks helped propel him onto GQ France\u2019s best-dressed list just as his pragmatic and business-friendly rhetoric carried him to the head of a field of seasoned politicians in the French elections.He is Emmanuel Macron, the centrist candidate who faces off this week in the second and final round of voting for the presidency against his rival, the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. As a 39-year-old political novice, Mr. Macron has repeatedly demonstrated that a lack of experience running for public office is no deterrent to an ability to manipulate image and shift shape on a dime. His clothes have been one of the many platforms he has used to convey his message to the divided population.\u201cHis style and self-presentation reek of health, vigor and physical prowess,\u201d Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, a senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion and an expert on fashion semiotics, said in an email.\u201cThe sharp suits make him look disciplined, but also energetic,\u201d Ms. Cronberg added, and they offer a defining visual contrast with the rumpled and often fumbling appearance of the departing president, the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.Superficially, Mr. Macron\u2019s sober two-button suits are all but indistinguishable from those favored by most high-level French businessmen and politicians. Yet they have been modified and altered repeatedly as his poll numbers shifted and he sought to look more \u2014 although never too baldly \u2014 presidential.In other words, when the dapper tailored suits the candidate wore in both his ministry days and at the start of his campaign \u2014 invariably with a sky-blue shirt and Windsor-knotted, solid-color four-in-hand tie \u2014 first drew attention for their obvious price tags, he promptly ditched them. \u201cNo ordinary person wears suits that cost 1,000 euros,\u201d Mr. Macron\u2019s right-hand aide, Isma\u00ebl Emelien, said. \u201cThat\u2019s too expensive.\u201dWhen his natty midnight-blue suits began attracting the perhaps unwanted attention of the French fashion news media, the candidate immediately lowered his sartorial profile and his expenses. Soon he was spotted dressed as a midprice version of his former self, clad in clothes made for him by Jean-Claude and Laurent Toubol, whose small tailoring shop in the Paris garment district has become a default outfitter of French tyro politicians, from Guillaume Larriv\u00e9, 40, a member of the French National Assembly, to Patrice Bessac, 39, the Communist mayor of Montreuil.Other youthful politicians have faced the challenge Mr. Macron now does: to balance an image representative of the entrepreneurial France he imagines driving into a digital future and a hidebound traditional one. The open-neck shirts of Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, were an image fail. So, too, would a vision of Mr. Macron be in the hoodies and jeans favored by the tech wizards he sees as vital to a French economic future stoked by start-ups like the ride-sharing app BlaBlaCar or the niche internet retailer Vente-privee.Still, that he elects to wear suits in almost every setting, outside the ski slopes, is both strategic and a necessity, Ms. Cronberg said. \u201cThose perennial dark suits,\u201d she explained, continue to serve an important function, despite the widespread abandonment of the suit by the wider fashion world. \u201cThey speak of respectability and tradition and of how powerful men control others by controlling themselves.\u201dAn article last Thursday about the style of Emmanuel Macron misstated the name of the school where Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, an expert on fashion semiotics, is a senior research fellow. It is London College of Fashion, not London School of Fashion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Invest in Your Child\u2019s Theater Dreams, First Invest in the Theater", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersDean Roth, the owner and president of a New Jersey company that makes parts for the tool-and-die industry, admits he has utterly failed to talk his teenage daughter out of pursuing a career in musical theater.Since then, he has invested in 22 other shows, with six returning profits so far. And he and his daughter, Kim, now a musical theater student at Syracuse University, have come to an understanding about where to draw the line between meddling parent and struggling artist.Like so many parents juggling feelings of pride and concern as their children step into adulthood, Mr. Roth said he wanted his daughter to understand the risks \u2014 as well as the rewards \u2014 associated with a career in the arts, and the only way he could see doing that was for both of them to get closer to the business.\u201cI wanted her to go into this with open eyes and know what she was getting into,\u201d Mr. Roth said.As with practically everything in New York, especially the insular world of Broadway, connections mean everything. Being a child of an investor in a show doesn\u2019t secure a part or even an audition, but it can create opportunities that open doors.\u201cThe parents don\u2019t have the friends or relationships, so they do it the old-fashioned way by writing a check,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that check does is get you in the door. It\u2019s up to the kids to prove themselves.\u201dOf course there\u2019s no substitute for talent, Mr. Parker and others said.\u201cInvesting is a wonderful and glorious activity, but unless you know what you are doing as an investor, the best you can hope for is a glass of Champagne with Bette Midler,\u201d said Peter Cooke, the head of the drama school at Carnegie Mellon University, which sends many graduates on to Broadway careers.The only career path he can see, he said, \u201cis being well trained.\u201dThere are different ways productions raise money, but for many shows, affluent individuals play a key role. Typically, these are people with at least $1 million of investable assets \u2014 what the finance industry calls an accredited investor, who is presumably able to swallow the considerable risks associated with this type of investing.Producers raise the money by putting together pools of investors, who tend to give an average of $25,000 to finance a production in a Broadway theater. Sometimes there are different investing tiers, and those who give more can get perks like having their names printed above the show\u2019s title on posters and Playbills, or getting an invitation to a dress rehearsal.The investor pools are usually organized as a limited partnership, like a private equity investment fund. Very often these investors are people who know the show\u2019s insiders, including the actors, writers, directors and others bringing it to the stage.Tim Speiss, a former board chairman of the Abingdon Theatre Company, a Broadway production group, said he once auctioned an item for a production in which the winning bidder could get his or her child a small speaking part in one performance. \u201cThere are some very clever ways to raise money,\u201d said Mr. Speiss, who is a wealth adviser at EisnerAmper, an accounting and advisory firm based in New York.Once a show gets up and running, the investors might get their money back, proportionate to what they put in, plus any profit after the show\u2019s expenses are covered.Many shows are money losers: Just one in five will end up being profitable, and even fewer are runaway successes. But Mr. Davenport points out that those odds aren\u2019t much different than those of any other alternative investment in which a high-net-worth investor might dabble. As far as privately held start-ups \u2014 a favorite of private equity investors \u2014 some 50 percent of new companies fail after the first four years, according to labor statistics.Linda Huber, an executive at a financial services company in New York, began investing in Broadway a few years ago when her daughter, now a high school senior, showed an interest. Her daughter, Claudia Lopez-Balboa, gives her advice on which shows to bankroll. So far she has invested in four, including \u201cOn Your Feet,\u201d a musical about the lives of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, a story that resonated with her daughter\u2019s part-Cuban heritage.\u201cFor art that\u2019s worth making, it\u2019s the responsible thing to support these endeavors \u2014 it\u2019s a thing to do together,\u201d Ms. Huber said.Her daughter is about to graduate from St. Paul\u2019s School, a New Hampshire boarding school, and plans to go to the University of Michigan in the fall to major in finance and minor in arts management.Ms. Lopez-Balboa said that Broadway had captured her imagination since she saw the show, \u201cBring It On,\u201d as a middle-school student \u2014 she recalled skipping all the way home afterward.\u201cI wanted to produce a show that would make you leap in the air,\u201d she said.She reached out to Daryl Roth, a 10-time Tony-winning producer (and no relation to Mr. Roth, the tool-and-die executive) to seek out an informational meeting about the business.Ms. Roth recalled that initial meeting and said she was impressed by Ms. Lopez-Balboa\u2019s energy and interest \u2014 enough to hire her as an intern for two summers.Ms. Roth, the lead producer of the show \u201cKinky Boots,\u201d said she understood where Ms. Lopez-Balboa was coming from because her son Jordan had also dived into the theater world. \u201cI wanted to help Claudia learn and be excited about working in theater,\u201d Ms. Roth said.For Dean Roth, the industrial company executive from New Jersey, the first $1,000 investment got him and his daughter invited to a cocktail party at Sardi\u2019s, where they mingled with other investors and met the show\u2019s director, Danny Goldstein.Some of those contacts advised Kim Roth on whether she should pick college or an acting conservatory (she chose college), gave her tips for getting started in the business, and helped answer other novice-level questions.Ms. Roth, who interned for Ken Davenport one summer, has one year of study left at Syracuse before setting out for what she hopes will be a career as an actress, singer and dancer on Broadway.\u201cLiving so close to the city just getting to make those networking connections is definitely helpful,\u201d Ms. Roth said. \u201cKnowing someone doesn\u2019t necessarily help, but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Successful Are Charter Schools?", "Date": "2017-05-06", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Second, although charters often use a lottery system, many do not accept special-needs students on the grounds that they cannot meet those needs. In addition, charter schools such as the Success Academy network in New York City expel students whose behavior does not meet school standards \u2014 standards that have been shown to be punitive, harsh and controlling.Charters do take money from the public education system; dollars follow each student who attends a charter. Many have additional funds from private sources, such as hedge funds, that public schools do not have.Since success is largely measured by test results, charters often spend inordinate amounts of time on test preparation and drill, to the detriment of other subjects and the well-being of young children.The original concept for charter schools imagined that they would serve as an experiment, and if successful, be an example that public schools could incorporate. As long as charters have more funding and are in direct competition with public schools, public schools will suffer. And have.ANNETTE MARCUS, NEW YORKThe writer is a retired science teacher.To the Editor:Successful charter schools and traditional schools have the same characteristics: high expectations for what students need to know and be able to do; a powerful curriculum that matches those expectations; instruction aligned to the curriculum that is substantive and creative; and a way to measure student performance and intervene if students fall behind expectations. Educators and policy makers\u2019 time is better spent implementing known successful elements of good schools rather than debating what form they should take.The writer is an education consultant and former New York State deputy commissioner of education.To the Editor:The word \u201cpublic\u201d can be used to describe many different institutions, but until very recently a public school was broadly understood to mean a school controlled by a locally elected school board. Calling independently managed schools that exist off taxpayer money \u201cpublic\u201d is a relatively recent rhetorical innovation, and one that seems purposefully deceitful. Why not call these schools public-private, or privately managed, publicly funded schools? The answer is simple. Charter operators benefit from a populace that has a weak and confused understanding of public institutions and the public good.Calling a charter school a public school is like calling a defense contractor a public institution because it consumes public funds.The writer is a public-school teacher. To the Editor:David Leonhardt ignores the fact that very few charters enroll and retain equal numbers of at-risk students as traditional public schools in the communities in which they are situated \u2014 children with serious disabilities, those who receive free lunch, and/or recent immigrants and English-language learners.The result is that our traditional public schools are increasingly concentrated with the highest need students with fewer resources to educate them. In New York City alone, charter schools are diverting more than $1.7 billion from the public schools, as well as taking up more space in a system where more than 550,000 students attend overcrowded schools and more than 300,000 students are crammed into classes of 30 or more.For the sake of equity, we need to implement solutions that will work for all public students, especially those with the highest needs. By focusing our efforts on expanding charter schools, society is leaving out those students who need our help the most.LEONIE HAIMSON, NEW YORKThe writer is executive director of Class Size Matters.To the Editor:As a retired public school educator, I must say this column does a good job of differentiating charters and vouchers. Here in Florida, both have been a part of our educational landscape for many years, with mixed results.At the state level, charter schools, many of which are for-profit ventures, have been greatly expanded. One result of this expansion is a legislature that takes money away from traditional schools and shifts it to charters. Fewer necessary repairs are made to traditional public schools, and it is harder to build new schools.At the same time, while charter schools are given much freedom in regard to curriculum design and innovation, traditional schools are run in a top-down manner, with teachers being given less and less opportunity to design curriculum or innovate. By the time I retired, I no longer felt like a professional expert in my field. I was simply handed a boatload of curriculum and told to stick to the calendar.Although there are good charter schools that have shown success, David Leonhardt is correct in his assessment of vouchers. Many of us have fought for years to oppose giving state money to unproven or church-run schools. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sees no problem with this blurring of lines between church and state, and that is one issue that should concern us all.To the Editor:I count myself as a progressive who prefers to spend more on public schools and trusts them. After working 29 years as a public school superintendent in five different states in the Northeast, here\u2019s what I have found: Public schools, governed by elected school boards in communities that can afford to provide generous funding for small class sizes, a wide array of programs and teacher training, do a superb job of educating their students.Choice advocates often sidestep questions of inequitable funding and the housing patterns that underlie these disparities in spending. I believe we need to face these issues.WAYNE GERSEN, ETNA, N.H.To the Editor:Until charters are held to the same standards and requirements as traditional public schools (such as free or reduced lunch, transportation, special services for the disabled, standardized testing, teacher pay, state and federal mandates), you are comparing apples to oranges. The \u201cflexibility\u201d David Leonhardt praises is not allowed in many traditional public schools, where our doors are open to all students and where all needs must be met, regardless of cost. The money that allows charters their vaunted flexibility is squeezed out of already strapped traditional public schools.My state, North Carolina, is one where the underlying philosophy of the G.O.P. is to starve traditional public schools for funds, call them failures for not rising to a bar set only for them, and then take even more funding away to offer \u201cchoice.\u201dThe writer is a teacher and president of the Dare County Association of Educators.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Nuclear Deal Will Remain for Now, White House Signals", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byFacing a deadline of Thursday, the administration said it was waiving sanctions against Iran, as required under the deal. To have done otherwise would have violated the accord, freeing the Iranians to resume the production of nuclear fuel without any of the limits negotiated by the Obama administration two years ago.But while acknowledging that the deal would remain in place, the administration imposed modest new sanctions against several Iranian individuals and four organizations, including a China-based network that supplied missile-related items to a key Iranian defense entity.That appeared to be an effort to mollify Republican critics of the deal, which President Trump has called a \u201cdisaster\u201d and said he would have negotiated far more skillfully.\u201cThe U.S. and its partners will continue to apply pressure on Iran to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone in Iran,\u201d said Stuart E. Jones, the acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, who will be traveling with Mr. Trump to the Middle East at the end of the week.The Trump administration has said that it is continuing to study the Iran nuclear deal, leaving a door open to leaving it at some point.\u201cFrom the very beginning, it\u2019s been clear they couldn\u2019t renege on the deal without cause,\u201d said Gary Samore, President Barack Obama\u2019s top nuclear adviser in the first term, who helped organize the pressure campaign on Iran that ultimately led it to the negotiating table.If Mr. Trump had made good on pledges to scrap the arrangement, \u201cthe U.S. would have been entirely isolated, and no one else would have resumed sanctions,\u201d said Mr. Samore, who is now the executive director at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard.The announcement came two days before Iranian elections, and just before Mr. Trump\u2019s first overseas trip as president.His first stops are in Saudi Arabia and Israel, both of which opposed the deal but now concede it is working, at least so far.A unit inside the National Security Council has been working on ways to counter Iran, but it is unclear whether it had proposed a far harsher approach.At a moment when Mr. Trump is consumed by troubles at home and viewed with suspicion by allies, however, there was no appetite in the White House for a breach with Iran.The Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department announced that among those targeted for sanctions were two senior Iranian military officials, Morteza Farasatpour and Rahim Ahmadi.Mr. Farasatpour coordinated the sale and delivery of explosives and other material for the Scientific Studies and Research Center of Syria, while Mr. Ahmadi directs the organization responsible for Iran\u2019s solid-fuel ballistic missile program, according to the Treasury Department.Those sanctions appeared similar to missile-related sanctions that Mr. Obama put in place in January 2016, as the Iran deal went into effect.The Treasury Department also announced sanctions against a network of companies associated with a Chinese citizen, Ruan Runling, which supports Syria and supplies technology and financing to aid Iran\u2019s missile program.\u201cThis administration is committed to countering Iran\u2019s destabilizing behavior, such as Iran\u2019s development of ballistic missiles and support to the Assad regime,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, speaking of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. \u201cIt is alarming that individuals involved with Iran\u2019s missile program are assisting the brutal Assad regime, and we are taking action to curtail this behavior.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of Gary Samore. He is the executive director at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, not the director of studies.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investigation Turns to Kushner\u2019s Motives in Meeting With a Putin Ally", "Date": "2017-05-29", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, was looking for a direct line to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia \u2014 a search that in mid-December found him in a room with a Russian banker whose financial institution was deeply intertwined with Russian intelligence, and remains under sanction by the United States.Federal and congressional investigators are now examining what exactly Mr. Kushner and the Russian banker, Sergey N. Gorkov, wanted from each other. The banker is a close associate of Mr. Putin, but he has not been known to play a diplomatic role for the Russian leader. That has raised questions about why he was meeting with Mr. Kushner at a crucial moment in the presidential transition, according to current and former officials familiar with the investigations.But the half-hour meeting with Mr. Gorkov since has come under increasing scrutiny. The current and former American officials now say it may have been part of an effort by Mr. Kushner to establish a direct line to Mr. Putin outside established diplomatic channels.The meeting came as Mr. Trump was openly feuding with American intelligence agencies and their conclusion that Russia had tried to disrupt the presidential election and turn it in his favor.The Senate Intelligence Committee notified the White House in March that it planned to question Mr. Kushner about the meeting.It is not clear whether Mr. Kushner saw the Russian banker as someone who could be repeatedly used as a go-between or whether the meeting with Mr. Gorkov was designed to establish a direct, secure communications line to Mr. Putin.The reasons the parties wanted a communications channel, and for how long they sought it, are also unclear. Several people with knowledge of the meeting with Mr. Kislyak, and who defended it, have said it was primarily to discuss how the United States and Russia could cooperate to end the civil war in Syria and on other policy issues. They also said the secure channel, in part, sought to connect Michael T. Flynn, a campaign adviser who became Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, and military officials in Moscow.Mr. Flynn attended the meeting at Trump Tower with Mr. Kislyak.Yet one current and one former American official with knowledge of the continuing congressional and F.B.I. investigations said they were examining whether the channel was meant to remain open, and if there were other items on the meeting\u2019s agenda, including lifting sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia in response to Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its aggression in Ukraine.In a statement on Monday, Ms. Hicks said that \u201cMr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official\u201d in meeting with the Russians. Mr. Kushner has agreed to be interviewed by congressional investigators about the meetings, she said.In March, Mr. Gorkov said in a statement that his December meeting with Mr. Kushner was part of the bank\u2019s strategy to discuss promising trends and sectors with influential financial institutions in Europe, Asia and the United States. That statement said he met with representatives of \u201cbusiness circles of the U.S., including with the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner.\u201d At the time, Mr. Kushner was still running the company, which is his family\u2019s real estate business.Vnesheconombank has not responded to questions about which other financial institutions and business leaders Mr. Gorkov met with while in the United States.Trying to set up secret communications with Mr. Putin in the weeks after the election would not be illegal. Still, it is highly unusual to try to establish channels with a foreign leader that did not rely on the government\u2019s own communications, which are secure and allow for a record of contacts to be created.But the Trump transition was unique in its unwillingness to use the government\u2019s communications lines and briefing material for its dealings with many foreign governments, partly because of concern that Obama administration officials might be monitoring the calls.In addition, Mr. Kushner disclosed none of his contacts with Russians or any other foreign officials when he applied for his security clearance in January. He later amended the form to include several meetings, including those with Mr. Kislyak and Mr. Gorkov, but it is unclear whether he told the investigators who conducted his background check about the attempts to set up a back channel. His aides have said his omissions from the clearance form were accidental.The meeting with Mr. Gorkov is now being scrutinized by the F.B.I. as part of its investigation into alleged Russian attempts to disrupt last year\u2019s presidential campaign, and whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers assisted in such efforts.His bank is controlled by members of Mr. Putin\u2019s government, including Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev. It also has long been intertwined with Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle: It has been used by the Russian government to bail out oligarchs close to Mr. Putin, and has helped fund the Russian president\u2019s pet projects, such as the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014.The spy, said Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, was under \u201cthe guise of being a legitimate banker, gathered intelligence as an agent of the Russian Federation in New York.\u201dMr. Gorkov is a graduate of the academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia, a training ground for Russian spies. Though current and former Americans said it was unlikely that Mr. Gorkov is an active member of Russian intelligence, they said his past ties to the security services in Moscow were a reason he was put in charge of the bank.But days earlier, responding to questions from The Times about the meetings with Mr. Kislyak and Mr. Gorkov, Ms. Hicks said the meetings were part of an effort by Mr. Kushner to improve relations between the United States and Russia, and to identify areas of possible cooperation.After the first meeting with Mr. Kislyak, she said at the time, the Russian ambassador asked for a follow-up discussion to \u201cdeliver a message.\u201d Mr. Kushner sent Avrahm Berkowitz, a longtime associate and now a White House aide. At that session, Mr. Kislyak told Mr. Berkowitz that he wanted Mr. Kushner to meet Mr. Gorkov, Ms. Hicks said.Ms. Hicks did not say at the time why Mr. Kislyak had wanted to arrange a meeting between Mr. Kushner and Mr. Gorkov. But she said then that during Mr. Kushner\u2019s meeting with Mr. Gorkov, there was no discussion about the Kushner company\u2019s business or about American sanctions against Russian entities like Vnesheconombank.Matthew Rosenberg and Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "Jim Bunning, Hall of Fame Pitcher and Blunt-Spoken Senator, Dies at 85", "Date": "2017-05-27", "News": "Supported byJim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher who threw a perfect game and later forged a second career as a fervently conservative and often cantankerous Republican representative and senator from Kentucky, died on Friday in the Fort Thomas, Ky., area. He was 85.His death was confirmed by his son David, a Federal District Court judge in Kentucky. Mr. Bunning had a stroke in October.He was the second pitcher, after Cy Young, to win at least 100 games, record at least 1,000 strikeouts and throw no-hitters in both the American and National Leagues. When he retired after the 1971 season, his 2,855 strikeouts were second only to Walter Johnson\u2019s 3,509.Mr. Bunning threw fastballs, curveballs and sliders out of a 6-foot-3-inch frame, seeking to intimidate batters with a gruffness that would be a hallmark of his time in Congress.Larry Bowa, the Phillies\u2019 longtime shortstop, once recalled a game that Mr. Bunning pitched at Montreal in the early 1970s when \u201cthe Expos had Ron Hunt, a guy who loved to get hit.\u201d\u201cWell, Bunning threw him a sidearm curveball, Hunt never moved, and it hit him,\u201d Bowa told The Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cThe ball rolled toward the mound, and Bunning picked it up. He looked right at Hunt and said: \u2018Ron, you want to get hit? I\u2019ll hit you next time.\u2019 And next time up, bam. Fastball. Drilled him right in the ribs. And he said to Hunt, \u2018O.K., now you can go to first base.\u2019\u201dMr. Bunning pitched a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park on July 20, 1958, retiring Ted Williams for the final out.His perfect game was the first in the National League in 84 years and the first in the major leagues since the Yankees\u2019 Don Larsen threw one against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1956 World Series. Mr. Bunning set down all 27 Mets batters at Shea Stadium on June 21, 1964, in the first game of a Father\u2019s Day doubleheader, striking out John Stephenson, a pinch-hitter, for the final out.The only Baseball Hall of Fame player to have served in Congress, Mr. Bunning was elected to Cooperstown by the Veterans Committee in 1996.After serving as minority leader in the Kentucky State Senate, Mr. Bunning was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1986. He served six terms in the House and then was elected to the Senate in 1998 and re-elected in 2004. He spoke out against spending and taxes and showed a contrarian streak in the Senate while receiving national attention for some strange remarks.While running for a second Senate term, Mr. Bunning said that his Democratic opponent, Daniel Mongiardo, resembled one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s sons. Mr. Bunning also said he and his wife had been roughed up by supporters of Dr. Mongiardo at a political event, telling of \u201clittle green doctors pounding on my back.\u201dAlthough President George W. Bush easily carried Kentucky in the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Bunning barely survived the Democratic challenge to his seat.While discussing the need for conservative judges at a dinner in Kentucky in February 2009, Mr. Bunning noted that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a member of the Supreme Court\u2019s liberal wing, had undergone surgery for pancreatic cancer a few weeks earlier. \u201cEven though she was operated on, usually, nine months is the longest that anybody would live\u201d with the disease, he said.He apologized for his remarks about Dr. Mongiardo and Justice Ginsburg.A critic of Federal Reserve Board policies, Mr. Bunning was the only member of the Senate to vote against the confirmation of Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Fed in 2006.He was a staunch opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care legislation, but he was the only senator to miss the final roll call on the bill, which passed by 60-39 on a party-line vote. A spokesman said the senator had family commitments.Mr. Bunning registered procedural objections to a bill extending unemployment benefits in early 2010 while demanding that it be financed from the economic stimulus program, and he single-handedly delayed its passage. During the debate, he complained about missing a Kentucky-South Carolina basketball game.His fellow Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, then the Senate minority leader, declined to endorse him for a third term, amid concern by some fellow Republicans over his fund-raising ability and his evidently declining popularity back home.Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, said in a statement Saturday that Mr. Bunning \u201crarely shied away from a new adventure\u201d and had \u201ca larger-than-life personality.\u201dMr. Bunning had planned to run again in 2010, but he retired instead.James Paul David Bunning Jr. was born on Oct. 23, 1931, in Southgate, Ky., the son of a businessman, and grew up in Fort Thomas, Ky., a suburb of Cincinnati.He pitched for Xavier University in Cincinnati and then signed with the Tigers\u2019 organization in 1950. While in the minors, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Xavier in business administration.Mr. Bunning pitched for the Tigers from 1955 to 1963, when he was traded to the Phillies. He threw his perfect game in \u201964, the season best known for the Phillies\u2019 collapse in the final week, when the St. Louis Cardinals overtook them to win the National League pennant. It was the closest Mr. Bunning ever got to a World Series.He was active in the rise of the baseball players\u2019 union in the 1960s, joining with Robin Roberts and Harvey Kuenn in recruiting Marvin Miller, then an economist for the steelworkers, as the union\u2019s executive director.Mr. Bunning was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1967, later pitched for the Los Angeles Dodgers and then returned to the Phillies in 1969. He had only one 20-win season, going 20-8 for the Tigers in 1957, but he had four 19-win seasons and was a seven-time All-Star. He had a career record of 224-184 with an earned run average of 3.27.He managed in the Phillies\u2019 minor league system and worked as a stockbroker before arriving on the national political scene.In addition to his son David, Mr. Bunning\u2019s survivors include his wife, Mary; his sons Jim, Bill and Mark; his daughters Barb, Joan, Cat, Bridget and Amy; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.In his farewell address to the Senate in December 2010, Mr. Bunning defended his outspoken ways. Standing at the desk once occupied by Kentucky\u2019s Henry Clay, one of the great names in the Senate\u2019s history, Mr. Bunning cited another forum to make his point.\u201cI have been booed by 60,000 fans at Yankee Stadium standing alone at the pitcher\u2019s mound, so I have never really cared if I stood alone here in Congress as long as I stood by my beliefs and my values,\u201d he said. \u201cI have also thought that being able to throw a curveball never was a bad skill for a politician to have.\u201dAn obituary on May 29 and in some editions on May 28 about Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher who became a United States senator, misidentified the legislative job he once held in the Kentucky State Senate. He was the minority leader of the Republicans, not the majority leader..Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Wanted to Close the Export-Import Bank. Now He May Run It.", "Date": "2017-05-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two years ago, Scott Garrett, then a Republican congressman from New Jersey, took to the floor of the House of Representatives and laced into his colleagues for resurrecting an institution that \u201cembodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.\u201dThe institution he derided was the Export-Import Bank. He could soon be running it.In April, President Trump tapped Mr. Garrett, who lost his seat to a Democrat last November, to lead the bank, a federal agency that provides loan guarantees to American companies selling to foreign customers. For years it has been a political punching bag for conservatives who have called it a tool of corporate cronyism and a meddler in free markets. Mr. Trump frequently assailed the bank while on the campaign trail.Mr. Trump reversed himself last month, though, and decided to keep the bank alive, coming to the conclusion that it helps small businesses and allows American exporters to compete more effectively around the world.But the choice of Mr. Garrett was widely viewed as curious. As one of the bank\u2019s most ardent conservative Republican critics, he had argued forcefully that it should be shuttered. As a critic of the organization that he has been asked to lead, Mr. Garrett fits the mold of the deconstructionists who Mr. Trump found appealing in forming his cabinet, like Rick Perry at the Department of Energy and Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cI think he may have been ill served by the people that advocated for Scott Garrett for chairman,\u201d said Fred Hochberg, the last chairman of the of the Export-Import Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd choice.\u201dCompanies that rely on the bank and lawmakers who fought to save it are once again fretting about its future. \u201cI think there is a legitimate concern about whether this nominee will fulfill the commitment we have to American workers to get the bank up and running,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who helped make the case to Mr. Trump that keeping the bank alive was aligned with his goals of promoting American manufacturing. \u201cYou have to make sure you are not putting someone there who is a saboteur.\u201dMr. Garrett did not respond to requests for comment, but a White House spokeswoman, Natalie Strom, said Mr. Trump was confident that he would be a \u201ckey voice for reform\u201d at the bank. The Trump administration will direct Mr. Garrett to stop the bank from being a target of \u201cspecial interests\u201d and instead focus on supporting small businesses, she said.Known in Washington as \u201cEx-Im,\u201d the 83-year-old bank has been languishing for nearly two years. Since Congress renewed its lapsed authorization to operate in late 2015, the bank has done little business. Ex-Im authorized $5 billion in financing last year, the smallest amount in 40 years and a quarter of what it authorized in 2014, the last year it was fully operational.Mr. Hochberg, who was fiercely grilled by Mr. Garrett in congressional hearings, said that $30 billion in deals and 40 major projects were languishing in the pipeline as recently as January. The inaction has created a backlog of big deals that has left American companies and their foreign customers in a lurch.Because other industrialized countries use similar tactics to promote their goods, proponents argue, Ex-Im keeps American companies competitive. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with countries that have tremendous export machines,\u201d said Deborah Wince-Smith, chief executive of the Council on Competitiveness business group. \u201cThe U.S. needs to have these instruments.\u201dDecades ago Democrats were the most vocal opponents of the Export-Import Bank, branding it as corporate welfare. But in recent years Republicans and conservative activist groups took on that role in the name of limited government. During the presidential campaign, Republican candidates often called for closing the bank, listing it among top goals like repealing the Affordable Care Act and securing the border.They regularly cast the bank as a corrupt organization that helps foreign companies at the expense of American firms. \u201cThis is basically a subsidy to foreign competitors of U.S. companies,\u201d said Dan Holler, vice president of the conservative advocacy organization Heritage Action for America. \u201cIt\u2019s not a policy that actually creates American jobs.\u201dWhile many conservatives share Mr. Garrett\u2019s views of the bank, his Senate confirmation is far from a lock. A vote is expected this spring or summer, though no date has been set. Bipartisan support for the bank has led to worries about Mr. Garrett\u2019s intentions. He also left his job as a lawmaker on a sour note.For longtime opponents of the bank who had hoped for its demise, Mr. Garrett\u2019s confirmation would be a consolation prize.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said if the bank must live on, he wants Mr. Garrett to ensure that foreign companies pay their share when they get financing. And he wants the bank to avoid financing foreign projects that end up harming American workers.\u201cFor someone who would rather see it all closed down,\u201d Mr. Toomey said, \u201cScott Garrett is the best guy we could have.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kenya, Phones Replace Bank Tellers", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byFixesPauline Kimari is a pharmacist in Ndaragwa, Kenya, a small town several hours\u2019 drive north of Nairobi. She moved there from rural Muranga, several hours away, to open a small shop, Ndaragwa Joy Chemist. It is white with blue and green doors and a blue bench inside. She sells medicine and cosmetics.She is 43, devoted to God and her family. Her parents in Muranga still farm coffee, tea, corn, beans and other vegetables. Kimari\u2019s success allows her to send them money regularly. \u201cI\u2019ve been a great help to them,\u201d she said.She used to have two ways to send money, neither satisfactory. She could buy a money transfer at a bank. Her parents would travel to the nearest town to retrieve it. And transfers were not instant. \u201cThere was so much delay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took three days to get the money there.\u201dThe other way was to find someone going to Muranga, perhaps a bus driver, and give him an envelope of cash. \u201cThis was not efficient for me, and it was not safe at all,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that person was not trustworthy. Maybe the money didn\u2019t reach the person you wanted it to, or it was less than the amount you gave.\u201dIn 2007, Kenya\u2019s mobile network giant Safaricom started M-Pesa, a money transfer service. That ended up changing how Kimari helps her parents \u2014 changing many aspects of her life, and much about Kenya.In Africa the mobile phone is ubiquitous \u2014 the continent has skipped over landlines and gone straight to mobile. Smartphones are becoming more popular, but a vast majority of phones are basic $25 models. All apps with wide reach in Africa work via SMS.Nearly all Kenyan households have a mobile phone, and in nearly all those households, at least one person has an M-Pesa account.M-Pesa is available to any Safaricom customer. But it\u2019s only useful if there\u2019s a nearby agent who can accept or disburse cash.They followed both groups through 2014. Places that went from zero to six M-Pesa agents ended up with 22 percent fewer female-headed households living in extreme poverty than areas of the same size where no new agents came in.Since researchers couldn\u2019t randomize the spread of M-Pesa\u2019s agents, the study can\u2019t prove that it was access to M-Pesa that caused incomes to rise. It\u2019s possible that both things were caused by something else. But it\u2019s unlikely.How could mobile money raise incomes?\u201cWhen bad stuff happens, people reach out to friends and family,\u201d said Suri, a Kenyan who is an associate professor of applied economics at M.I.T.\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThat\u2019s what M-Pesa helps them do.\u201d Before, if a child needed medicine or a bike broke down, people could ask nearby relatives or friends for help. But often, it wasn\u2019t enough. Household consumption dropped by 7 percent to 10 percent after such emergencies.Their new research shows that M-Pesa has a long-term effect on poverty. It helped women graduate from subsistence agriculture to small business, perhaps because having an M-Pesa account gives a woman her own money, rather than her husband\u2019s or parents\u2019, and a greater sense of agency.The researchers also note other ways M-Pesa could have made a difference. It provides a secure way to save money, which can then be invested in goods to sell. It facilitates commerce by making payments easier and safer. And when people feel less vulnerable, they take more risks, for example, switching professions.M-Pesa is a commercial service, of course. But it couldn\u2019t have happened without foreign aid. The British aid agency financed small early pilot projects that tested a mobile money service; they also gave Nick Hughes, the head of global payments at Vodafone, a $1.3 million grant to develop the system, which Vodafone then matched.It was one of the most successful foreign aid investments ever.M-Pesa is a beginning. Mobile money is spreading \u2014 100 countries have it, although nowhere else is it as widespread and successful as in Kenya. It\u2019s also a platform for other innovations that lead to other ways to help people live better.One of those is pay-as-you-go. Most rural Africans light their homes at night with kerosene lamps. Kerosene is dangerous, expensive and unhealthy. It doesn\u2019t even provide much light. Solar power is clean, healthy and bright, and once you have the equipment, it\u2019s free. But even where solar lighting is available, many people stay with kerosene because they can buy a day\u2019s worth. They can\u2019t pay the upfront cost of a solar lighting system.Another huge advance: M-Pesa has brought millions of people into the formal banking system. If you don\u2019t have a bank account, it\u2019s hard to save money and impossible to get reasonable credit.Before M-Pesa, very few Kenyans had bank accounts, for many reasons. Formal financial transactions involve paperwork and bureaucracy. Rural people don\u2019t live near banks. The poor lack credit histories and traditional collateral.M-Pesa has given rise to an alternative. Customers who go to M-Pesa on their phones now find an option called M-Shwari. It\u2019s a bank that offers two types of savings accounts; deposits are held by the Commercial Bank of Africa, pay high rates of interest and are insured.Savers can also get small 30-day loans in seconds, starting at $10. Kimari has taken more than a dozen loans so far. Her repayment record helps increase her loan limit \u2014 now at $380 \u2014 as do her savings with M-Shwari.What about credit scores? Know-your-customer due diligence? Normal banks find this to be too much work for small accounts or loans. But M-Shwari can use M-Pesa\u2019s data, which reveals, for example, whether a customer paid utility bills on time. M-Shwari evaluates new customers\u2019 credit by examining their M-Pesa purchases of small advances of airtime.M-Shwari began its service in November 2012 and acquired 12 million customers in its first three years \u2014 in a country with 10 million households.Safaricom says that most M-Shwari users have no other bank account. All over the world, poverty experts wrestle with how to bring the poor into the formal banking system. Kenya has done it practically overnight.An earlier version of this article misspelled, on first reference, the name of a global telecommunications company.

{"Headline": "A Chinese Giant Is on a Global Buying Spree. Who\u2019s Behind It?", "Date": "2017-05-09", "News": "Supported byThe political spotlight was a global coup for Chen Feng, chairman of the carrier\u2019s parent, the HNA Group, who was on hand to greet Mr. Xi and David Cameron, then British prime minister.Mr. Chen has propelled the privately held HNA onto the world stage through a dizzying array of acquisitions, a spending spree supported by Chinese state banks and hidden behind a holding company with a complex ownership structure. According to corporate filings, state-backed banks have given HNA a $60 billion line of credit, a level of lending usually reserved for state-owned enterprises charged with carrying out the government\u2019s policies.In a statement, the company insisted that it was \u201csupported by strong operational cash flow and a wide range of domestic and international sources of financing.\u201d\u201cHNA Group is focused on continuing to build a leading global platform in tourism, logistics and financial services supported by strong operational cash flow and a wide range of domestic and international sources of financing,\u201d the company said in a statement.The White House declined to comment.HNA\u2019s deals are increasingly putting the company in the political cross hairs, at home and abroad.Mr. Scaramucci, in a telephone interview, disputed any suggestion that HNA was trying to curry favor with the Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019m very glad to have sold my business to them. They\u2019re world-class,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I were to serve in government, I\u2019d sign a full recusal, so I wouldn\u2019t be dealing with them.\u201dAs speculation swirled that HNA could be drawn into a political firestorm, shares of one of the company\u2019s Hong Kong affiliates tumbled late last month. Soon after, critical news articles on the group began disappearing from Chinese websites, prompting concerns that government censors had handed down orders to delete unfavorable news about HNA.HNA declined to comment on the allegations by Mr. Guo.The birth of HNA traces back to the creation of China\u2019s brand of capitalism.When the company was founded in 1993, China had just begun experimenting with private ownership, opening new economic zones and allowing companies to sell shares to the public. The Hainan provincial government asked Mr. Chen, a former pilot with the People\u2019s Liberation Army, to help develop a regional carrier, one that would be partly owned by the state and partly owned by private investors.As the company gained momentum, Mr. Chen brought in overseas investors, including the billionaire George Soros, who in 1995 invested $25 million, for a 25 percent stake. (Mr. Soros has since sold his stake.) With deeper pockets, it began diversifying into other, more stable businesses like hotels, finance, advertising and property development, creating a holding company called the the HNA Group.The strategy and structure allowed Mr. Chen and his top executives to parlay their small stake in a state-backed airline into a controlling stake in its parent company. In doing so, a group of six longtime HNA executives \u2014 led by Mr. Chen \u2014 effectively took the group private.Along the way, he nurtured government ties. Mr. Chen has been a delegate to the national congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which meets every five years to help determine party leadership. In 2008, HNA formed a venture with a firm connected to a son of He Guoqiang, the Communist Party\u2019s powerful discipline chief at the time.It all played to Mr. Chen\u2019s goals. A Buddhist and an expert calligrapher, Mr. Chen has tried to use his force of personality to create a corporate culture based in part on Confucian values of ethical living. But he is also an executive who talks not so much about creating a profitable enterprise as a really big one.In 1993, the company had just $17 million in revenue. Today, it has about $90 billion in annual revenue, most coming from companies acquired outside China.\u201cHis fundamental goal is to be in the top 10 of the Fortune 500 by 2025,\u201d says William Kirby, who teaches at Harvard and has known Mr. Chen for nearly a decade. \u201cThis is an incredibly ambitious company.\u201dHNA, of late, has embraced the government\u2019s push to \u201cgo global\u201d and invest overseas, focusing on shipping, hotels, logistics and retail, amassing a $145 billion portfolio. Over the past three years, it has spent more than $30 billion, according to Dealogic.In a span of three months in 2016, HNA bought a construction and property development company; a flight catering and airport servicing group in Switzerland with 40,000 employees; a St. Regis hotel in Bora Bora, in French Polynesia; a global network of 1,400 hotels, among them the Radisson and Park Plaza brands; and a 28-story office tower in San Francisco.Last year, the company spent $6 billion to buy Ingram Micro, a technology wholesaler, and $10.4 billion for the aircraft leasing business of CIT Group. It has snapped up American hotel chains, golf courses and signature buildings, including paying $2.2 billion for 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan.And two of the company\u2019s top executives \u2014 Mr. Chen and his brother, Chen Guoqing \u2014 seem determined to make a home in New York. Each has purchased an entire floor at One57, the ultra-luxurious, 75-story residential tower, with commanding views of Central Park.The company also outbid the Ukrainian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik for the Upper East Side limestone mansion owned by the art dealer Wildenstein & Company, buying it for $79.5 million. For its American headquarters, HNA paid $450 million for 850 Third Avenue, which includes tenants like the City of New York.\u201cIf there\u2019s any strategy, it\u2019s to go out and buy up as much as possible,\u201d says Edward Tse, a longtime consultant who has advised HNA and now runs Gao Feng Advisory.While other big Chinese deals have been delayed or canceled in recent months, after the country imposed tighter controls on money flowing out of the country, HNA so far has managed to keep borrowing and making more purchases. It has racked up a debt pile of a size that some analysts wonder is sustainable.Its biggest lenders are state-owned banks like the China Development Bank and the Export and Import Bank of China, institutions that generally support state enterprises and the country\u2019s industrial policies. In 2016, another state giant, China Construction Bank, announced it was giving HNA a $4.5 billion credit line, and said that it would partner with the company to set up a $2.9 billion \u201cindustry fund.\u201dIn tapping Wall Street and the global bond market for even more money, HNA has relied on a network of affiliates and subsidiaries to increase its borrowing power. Eighteen companies now listed on the Chinese stock market fall under the HNA Group, and several more trade on a smaller stock exchange in Beijing.Understanding how these companies work together, and who controls the HNA Group, is a challenge. Its shareholders are masked behind multiple layers of shell companies, subsidiaries and offshore affiliates.One of the group\u2019s biggest shareholders is the Hainan Traffic Administration Holding Company, which is in turn owned by four other entities. Those entities are owned by yet other entities.Corporate filings show that 45 percent of the HNA Groups\u2019s shares are owned by Mr. Chen and five longtime company executives. Another 22 percent is owned by the Cihang Foundation, run by Zeng Haorong, a former government official who once served as mayor of Haikou, where HNA is based.There are also a few mystery investors, like Guan Jun, who does not appear in filings as a top executive. Mr. Guan\u2019s residence, in the records, is a rundown apartment building in Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defending Cuts, Mulvaney Misleads on Food Stamps and Big Bird", "Date": "2017-05-26", "News": "Supported byFact CheckPresident Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, defended austere budget cuts with misleading claims about economic development in coal country, how Social Security disability works and Big Bird.In congressional hearings over the budget, Mr. Mulvaney justified the president\u2019s proposals to eliminate or tighten public programs that disproportionately affect the very people who voted for Mr. Trump.Here\u2019s an assessment.The budget calls for changes to the Medicaid program that would \u201csave\u201d $610 billion over 10 years. Mr. Mulvaney argued that this didn\u2019t count as a cut since it still allocated \u201cmore money year on year\u201d for Medicaid.Government spending would be cut substantially. See how every budget item would be changed.While \u201cthere\u2019s a lot to like in the president\u2019s budget,\u201d Representative Bill Johnson, Republican of Ohio, said he did not support the proposal to gut the commission, which he called \u201ccritically important to the people of eastern and southeastern Ohio.\u201dJustifying a $191 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which provides food stamps for households with low incomes, Mr. Mulvaney suggested a work requirement for \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults to receive benefits.Of recipients who can work, many do \u2014 or at least want to. About 30 percent of adults were employed, and 27 percent were looking for work. Of the remaining 43 percent, it\u2019s unclear how many have disabilities.Over all, 32 percent of food stamp households had earnings, and 44 percent of participants lived in households with one person working. SNAP participation remains high, in part, because while unemployment has declined since the recession, wages have not risen.Asked by Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, about the $72 billion cut to the safety net for disabled workers, Mr. Mulvaney replied, \u201cThis is how I explained Social Security Disability Insurance, Mrs. Schakowsky, which is that we also propose a paid parental leave program.\u201dThe Trump administration on Tuesday released its 2018 budget, called \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness.\u201dThis claim distorts how the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit that funds PBS and NPR stations, operates and its relationship to \u201cSesame Street.\u201d Singling out the Jim Henson Company, which created the \u201cSesame Street\u201d characters, Mr. Mulvaney said, \u201cWhen I do go to that family in Grand Rapids and say, \u2018Look, is this what you want your money to go to?\u2019 I think they might tell me no, that maybe they can afford to do it without us.\u201dFurthermore, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting actually spends much less on programming (about 24 percent) than it does on directly funding public television and radio stations (66 percent). While \u201cSesame Street\u201d will survive with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, many local stations may not.Advertisement"}

Now he has eight. His father-in-law, Alfredo Torres, owns Puerto Rico\u2019s oldest bookstore, but it has been going downhill for two years.\u201cThe government is bankrupt,\u201d said Bernardo Rivera, 75, a private bus driver who sometimes earns only $40 all day. \u201cEveryone is bankrupt. There is nothing left. People who do not have jobs do not take the bus to work.\u201dJust days after a May Day strike sent tens of thousands of people to the streets in a protest that turned violent, people gathered at work, in parks and their homes in never-ending debates over the uncertainties. At the R\u00edo Piedras terminal where Mr. Rivera works, the drivers and cleaning crews huddled to gripe about waning business and pensions, as well as ever-rising fees and water and electricity bills.Although the move on Wednesday was hardly a surprise, it left a sense of gloom and anxiety here, as civil servants question whether their pensions will ever be paid and private companies suffer the consequences of the brutal domino effect that results when taxes rise, salaries drop and the middle class takes off on a mass exodus for Florida.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here, even if I make only $1,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.The government plans sweeping austerity measures in the coming months that will hit teachers especially hard. On Friday, Puerto Rico\u2019s education secretary announced a proposal to close 184 schools. Teachers may see their hours trimmed by two days a month.So while the government seeks protection from lawsuits from the hedge funds and other financial firms that invested in Puerto Rico\u2019s risky debt, residents of this United States territory are taking the squeeze. Fines for parking and other traffic violations have doubled. Dozens of government agencies are on the chopping block, while perks like the annual Christmas bonus and pay for unused sick time make for wistful memories.\u201cAt some point I will have to decide whether I live in a house, or with medical insurance,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, 55, a retired electronics teacher. \u201cAnd the food?\u201d he said, letting the thought trail off.His pension is about $1,900 a month, of which $556 goes to pay his family\u2019s medical plan.Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, who took office in January, acknowledged that low-income people without access to health care and parents with children in public schools would be the most vulnerable in the months ahead.\u201cThere has to be sacrifice everywhere,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe have been very clear about what that sacrifice is.\u201dThe last two administrations cut tens of thousands of positions from public payrolls, and now Mr. Rossell\u00f3 has vowed to make \u201cstrategic cuts\u201d that do not cause layoffs but put the government in a position to better negotiate with its creditors. Among the ideas is to cut government pensions by 10 percent, which will hurt retired police officers and teachers most, because they do not receive Social Security benefits.Creditors were unimpressed, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said.\u201cThey don\u2019t think that fiscal plan is appropriate; they think they should get more money and that the people of Puerto Rico should get less,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, my position is I am completely against that, and I will protect the people of Puerto Rico over anything.\u201dWhen he took office, Mr. Rossell\u00f3 said his first task was to determine \u201chow deep the rabbit hole went.\u201d He expected a $3 billion deficit, and instead found a deficit of $7.5 billion.\u201cWhat was happening in Puerto Rico is the definition of a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said.Roberto Pag\u00e1n, vice president of the Puerto Rico chapter of the Service Employees International Union, said he expected that up to 400,000 people would lose health plans because they will not be able to afford it. Public services like filing a child abuse complaint will probably go unattended.\u201cIn this fiscal plan, we see proposals that are very optimistic and hardly realistic,\u201d Mr. Pag\u00e1n said.Mr. Domenech, 50, the general contractor, who lives in Aguadilla in western Puerto Rico, said he had no idea where people like him stood in the new Puerto Rican reality. With the government owing huge sums to credit unions and companies like Microsoft, hedge funds and gasoline suppliers, where do his unpaid bills fit in?Not only are his savings tied up in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds, but his contracting business also went under, he said, largely because the government did not pay the invoices on an airport renovation project that dragged on and went over budget.\u201cThey left me with no money,\u201d Mr. Domenech said. \u201cI feel frustrated and helpless.\u201dHe has thought about moving to Canada.His father-in-law, Mr. Torres, 63, owns Librer\u00eda La Tertulia, the island\u2019s oldest book store, which depends on the disposable income of students and professors at the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s campus in R\u00edo Piedras. But students protesting severe budget cuts have been on strike for over a month, and the store\u2019s profits dipped up to 70 percent this semester, Mr. Torres said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the pharmacy, it\u2019s the grocery store.\u201dHe said that it would be easy for him to blame the slow foot traffic on the student strike but that he looks at the deteriorating urban core around him and blames decades of neglect that pushed more people to suburban shopping malls and still others off the island altogether. The boarded storefronts at Paseo de Diego, a nearby pedestrian mall, underscore his point.\u201cA lot of this is perception, but it\u2019s real,\u201d he said. \u201cGo walk around the plaza.\u201dData from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Puerto Rico\u2019s work force dropped by about 300,000 in the past decade, said Carlos J. Saavedra-Guti\u00e9rrez, the labor secretary here.\u201cThis is a new chapter,\u201d he said, as he rattled off labor changes he hopes will stimulate the economy and create \u201ca stopgap to the exodus.\u201dMany of those left behind do not have the money to leave. Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez, 53, has spent 30 years sweeping the streets of San Juan, but with the cuts coming to pensions, he estimates that he will have to stay on the job until he is at least 70.\u201cThe fiscal board making all the decisions is going to take it all from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to.\u201dBoth of Iris D. Matos\u2019s grown children moved to the mainland in search of work. She and her husband, both retired electric company employees, are bracing for a $500 monthly cut in their pensions, even as their grandchildren depend on them for basic necessities.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single sector that hasn\u2019t been hit: The older people are worried about their retirements, the parents have had their hours cut, and the young people are on strike at the university, and the kids are about to see their schools closed,\u201d Ms. Matos, 64, said. \u201cThey are spreading the pain, but to only one class of people: us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Don\u2019t Feel Your Pain", "Date": "2017-05-11", "News": "Supported byMr. President, 172,000 West Virginians got insurance for the first time. These are working people, but they\u2019ve got something they never had before. They don\u2019t know how they got it, they don\u2019t know who gave it to them, they don\u2019t know the Democrats, nothing about, \u201cIt\u2019s Obamacare.\" They don\u2019t know any of that. All they know is they\u2019ve got it. And you know what? They voted for you, Mr. President. The Democrats gave it to them but they voted for you. They\u2019re going to know who took it away from them.During the campaign, Trump appeared to fully grasp Manchin\u2019s point.Even after he won the presidency, Trump maintained his pro forma commitment to social insurance.What in fact would the Trump-backed measure passed by the House last week actually do?The distributional impact of the tax provisions is most apparent in the highest income brackets: those in the top one percent, whose household income is more than $770,000, would get an average tax cut of $37,220. Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $4 million or more, would get an average reduction of $207,240.the proposed changes to Medicaid under AHCA would disproportionately affect low-income individuals and people of color for whom the program is a central source of coverage. Medicaid covers over half of all poor families, one in five adults of color, and over half of children of color.Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, described some of the AHCA changes in Medicaid in an email.Beginning in 2020, Solomon wrote,states can freeze enrollment and only cover the \u201cgrandfathered\u201d enrollees who were enrolled on 12/31/19. The block grant option allows states to cut eligibility. The only requirement would be to cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with incomes under 138% of the poverty line, and children 6 to 18 below the poverty line.Along similar lines, Matthew Fiedler, a Brookings fellow, wrote me:The two most important Medicaid provisions under the AHCA are: (1) cutting federal funding for covering the ACA Medicaid expansion population; and (2) implementing a \u201cper capita cap\u201d that would limit the total amount of federal funding states could receive per person they enroll. Both provisions would give states very strong incentives to curtail eligibility, but neither would directly require states to do so.Just as the tax changes in the Republican bill flow to the rich, so do the health care benefits.Those making less than $10,000-a-year would lose an average of about $1,400, or nearly one-third of their income \u2014 under the AHCA relative to the ACA. Middle-income households, those making $50,000 to $75,000, would see little change \u2014 an average increase in net government transfers of about $60. However, those making $200,000 or more would receive an average net increase in government support of $5,640, or 1.1 percent of their income.Gleckman explained that thedecline in well-being for low-income people would result from the AHCA\u2019s proposals to cut the federal contribution to Medicaid and its move to eliminate cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income households that buy non-group insurance, thus raising their deductibles and co-pays.allow for people with pre-existing conditions to be charged more per year for their insurance coverage \u2014 possibly to the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per year.result in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage and could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.From another vantage point, one with political significance, maps created by the Kaiser Family Foundation show how individuals of different ages and incomes would fare if the AHCA replaces Obamacare.The affluent come out ahead. Older voters with modest incomes \u2014 a core element of Trump\u2019s support \u2014 would be penalized, paying more for health coverage in almost every section of the country.The accompanying Kaiser map shows the sections of the country where a 60-year-old making $30,000-a-year would pay more (in orange) or less (in blue) in 2020. The only places where such an individual would pay less are in New York and Massachusetts.The consequences of the House bill, if it is enacted into law, are plain to see.Mark A. Peterson, a professor of public policy, political science, and law at U.C.L.A., put the case in straightforward terms in an email:The Medicaid cuts and caps would withdraw coverage from large swaths of the poor, the working poor, and lower-paid working class individuals who do not have access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance. The shift to the tax credits for insurance purchase would mean that many working- and lower-middle-class individuals and families would be unable to afford insurance. The weakening of the pre-existing condition protections, and the reliance on usually problematic high-risk pools, would be most detrimental to people with those conditions who are not in the higher ranks of income.Benjamin Sommers, a professor of health policy and economics at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health, was similarly direct:The AHCA repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on high-income households and insurance companies, while reducing the Obamacare tax credits that helped lower and middle income families purchase health insurance. The changes to Medicaid are even more dramatic, with more than $800 billion dollars in federal money for the program cut over the next decade \u2014 this will have a huge impact on the 70 million lower-income children, adults, disabled individuals, and elderly who currently rely on Medicaid for their health care.Add in the termination of the taxes of investment income and the higher tax obligations in general of more affluent individuals and the AHCA would lead to a dramatic shift of resources away from the poor, working class, and lower middle class, especially for people with jobs outside of the realm of large employers.As is always the case in legislation as complex as health care, the devil is in the details, the significance of which is often hidden from the general public. It is these details that ultimately determine the winners and the losers of any legislative program.For many years, some conservatives have berated the political left for \u201cwaging class war\u201d whenever the left suggested that conservative policies helped to further enrich the wealthy at the expense of the poor.In a harsh critique, Aaron added:The AHCA is stunning in its shamelessness and baldness. Even allowing for the fact that Republicans will be ashamed and embarrassed if, after seven years, of promising to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d they were to do nothing, it is difficult to understand why the shame of voting for so egregious and contemptible a piece of legislation did not cause more of them to find it impossible to vote for it.The most surprising aspect of the politics of the AHCA is that by and large the winners cast majorities for Clinton and the losers backed Trump.voters hit the hardest \u2014 eligible for at least $5,000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan \u2014 supported Mr. Trump by a margin of 59 percent to 36 percent.Affluent constituencies that cast pluralities or majorities for Hillary Clinton actually gained from the measure.Conservative tax reform \u2014 perhaps better described as radical tax cuts for the rich \u2014 is the very highest priority issue on the Republican legislative agenda. It is also dear to Trump\u2019s heart.In order to get any tax overhaul through the Senate with a simple majority, the tax bill under Senate rules can\u2019t increase the federal deficit. Since the health care bill would cut the federal deficit it makes it easier to come back later and pass more tax cuts.is an old one: divide and rule. The rich guy convinced much of the white working class that he would \u201ctake back\u201d the country from the rest of the working class and other undeserving non-white and non-Christian people, as well as the coastal elites giving those folks jobs and handouts at the expense of \u201creal\u201d Americans. It\u2019s a strategy as old as this country.Dunlap is on target. But it\u2019s one thing to gut regulations and change tax rates to benefit the affluent and another thing altogether to take away someone\u2019s health care coverage. Voters who are denied medical care or find themselves unable to pay bills from doctors or hospitals are unlikely to be receptive to a campaign that seeks to \u201cdivide and rule,\u201d no matter how receptive they may have been in 2016.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hundreds of Thousands Strike in Greece as Cuts Near Approval", "Date": "2017-05-17", "News": "Supported byATHENS \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of Greeks walked off the job on Wednesday, heeding the call of labor unions to join a 24-hour general strike to protest a new round of austerity measures nearing approval in Parliament.Greece has been struggling for years to dig its way out of an economic crisis, and even though there has been progress, unemployment is at 23 percent and the country is largely dependent on outside help.Demonstrations were held in Athens and in other major cities, including Thessaloniki, Patras and Iraklio, against the new round of belt-tightening, which calls for pension cuts starting in 2019 and tax increases beginning in 2020 that together would save about 5 billion euros, or $5.5 billion.In a statement, the Greek civil servants\u2019 union, Adedy, called the austerity measures \u201cbarbaric.\u201d It decried what it called the \u201clooting of wages and pensions\u201d and a \u201csellout\u201d of state assets, referring to plans to privatize the power board and other public bodies.\u201cThe memorandums have consciously crushed small- and medium-size businesses,\u201d Thanos Vasilopoulos of Greece\u2019s private sector union, GSEE, told the radio station Sto Kokkino on Wednesday, referring to three foreign bailouts that successive governments have agreed to since 2010. \u201cBasically, they have created an army of 1.5 million unemployed.\u201dThe protests were mostly peaceful, although a group of around 20 hooded youths in Athens broke away from a crowd and hurled stones and flares at riot police officers.As is usually the case, only a small fraction of those on strike joined protests in the street. About 12,000 people gathered in the Greek capital, according to police estimates, a small turnout compared with previous rallies, reflecting public fatigue after years of strikes and demonstrations.Although some members of Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government have expressed opposition to the measures, coalition lawmakers are expected to approve them in a parliamentary vote on Thursday.In an effort to win over wavering lawmakers and to placate a public weary of seven years of austerity, the government has also prepared legislation that would introduce some so-called countermeasures, including social benefits for the poor.With Greeks taking to the streets, the government is hoping to secure parliamentary approval before the country\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, meets his eurozone counterparts at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.Officials at the meeting are expected to sign off on the release of around \u20ac7 billion that Greece needs to meet debt obligations due in July. They are also scheduled to discuss relief for Greece\u2019s huge debt burden, which is equivalent to nearly 180 percent of gross domestic product.The fiscal discipline has improved the country\u2019s finances, but it has left one in four Greeks unemployed and cut household incomes by a third, and the ratio of the country\u2019s debt to its gross domestic product is the highest in the eurozone.Advertisement"}

A short drive from downtown, it sits on more than a quarter of an acre, at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac near the scenic Elbow River.The house is nearly 4,000 square feet, with three bedrooms and three full and two partial bathrooms, as well as a finished basement and a three-car attached garage. A separate carriage house, converted from a horse barn built in the early 1900s, could be used as guest or staff quarters.The house was built in 2005 in a traditional style, with a long slate walkway snaking up to a large wooden front door and stone porch. Inside, the style is more contemporary, with recessed lighting and hardwood floors throughout.On one side of the central tiled foyer is a formal living-and-dining area with a fireplace and oversize front-facing window. On the other is a great room with another fireplace, a coffered ceiling and three sets of French doors that open to a landscaped yard with a stone patio, a built-in barbecue and an outdoor fireplace.

The luxury market was hit especially hard, as companies downsized and unemployment levels rose. \u201cThis would have been a five-million-dollar house at one point just a few years ago,\u201d Mr. Plintz said of his listing.There have been signs of late that Calgary\u2019s housing market, and luxury in particular, is slowly coming back. Sales volume has risen as sellers have lowered their expectations on prices, agents said, and buyers on the sidelines have re-entered the market. WHO BUYS IN CALGARYMost buyers in Elbow Park are locals, real estate agents said. But Calgary, in general, draws a number of foreign buyers, including Americans.Since the recession, the city has seen a slowdown in foreign purchases, agents said. Lately, though, there has been increased interest from Asian buyers, particularly those from Hong Kong and China, who find the area appealing because it is less expensive than neighboring British Columbia Province, Mr. Lowe said: \u201cOver the last 12 months, the Chinese have been looking hard at Calgary.\u201dBUYING BASICSIn Alberta, he said, buyers are required to pay land title and mortgage registration fees, which are on a sliding scale based on the purchase price of a property and the loan amount.

{"Headline": "Border Tax\u2019s Apparent Demise Jeopardizes G.O.P. Overhaul Plan", "Date": "2017-05-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After months on life support, the border adjustment tax looks as if it\u2019s finally dead.The rifts raise the likelihood that Republicans will struggle to meet their goal of enacting a sweeping rewrite of the tax code in 2017. It\u2019s just as likely that Mr. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, will need to find alternatives to their proposed border adjustment tax on imports. The idea is the linchpin of a plan produced by House Republicans last year, but it has drawn fierce resistance from retailers, energy companies and small businesses.At a standing-room-only House Ways and Means Committee hearing Tuesday about the tax proposal, it was not only Democrats who were uneasy about the path that Republicans have been charting on taxes. \u201cI know we have to pay for these tax cuts, but I don\u2019t want it to be on the backs of everyday hardworking American taxpayers,\u201d said Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania.Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican, was more explicit in his opposition. \u201cI cannot support the border adjustability provisions as introduced last year in the blueprint,\u201d he said.Other Republicans echoed Mr. Kelly\u2019s fears, expressing concern that importers would face higher tax bills and that consumers, in turn, would be harmed by higher prices. Without their support, a bill that includes the tax could die in the committee.As proposed, the border adjustment tax would impose a 20 percent tax on imports and exempt taxation of exports. It would raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade, helping Republicans cut tax rates permanently without adding to the deficit. In theory, it would level the playing field between American manufacturers and their competitors around the world.The proposal has ignited a frenzy of lobbying activity, with retail executives scrambling around Washington to \u201ceducate\u201d lawmakers on the evils of an import tax. At the same time, companies that are heavy exporters are working to push the concept forward in hopes that their income tax bills will shrink. The retail lobby and advocacy groups financed by the billionaire Koch brothers are spending millions in an effort to kill the tax.On Tuesday, lawmakers heard these arguments in the public glare. \u201cThe people who shop at Target are middle-class working families whose budgets are already stretched,\u201d Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, told lawmakers. \u201cFor them, this new tax would be a budget breaker.\u201d\u201cThis whole thing needs to be thought out,\u201d said Tee Miller, owner of Black Mingo Outfitters in South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make a model on a spreadsheet, but this whole thing is pretty complex.\u201dWitnesses at the hearing debated the effects that a border adjustment tax would have on currency markets and the economy. While some cautioned that it could create upheaval, others, such as the chief executive of the food processing company Archer Daniels Midland, said that the change to the tax system would make companies like his more competitive globally.Others discussed the possibility of phasing in a border tax to give sectors that are worried about sudden disruptions time to adapt. Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former director of President George W. Bush\u2019s National Economic Council, proposed starting with a smaller import tax to essentially let companies get their feet wet.\u201cLet\u2019s try something minor,\u201d Mr. Lindsey said.But the appetite for making such a drastic change to America\u2019s tax system does not appear to be there.Democrats are primarily interested in middle-class tax cuts and are opposed to any changes to the tax code that could raise prices for working-class families.Senate Republicans are currently crafting their own plan, and none in that chamber have publicly embraced the one pitched by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Brady.The Trump administration has also been cool to the border tax idea. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threw more cold water on it during a conference hosted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation on Tuesday.\u201cOne of the problems with the border adjustment tax is that it doesn\u2019t create a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt has the potential to pass on significant costs to the consumer.\u201d\u201cThe tax plan, as you know, is in its very early stages,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said during a budget briefing on Monday afternoon.Despite all of the resistance, Mr. Brady does not appear to be giving up on the border adjustment tax. Speaking at the Peterson forum after the hearing, he insisted that it was the best way to give the economy a boost and help American businesses.\u201cIf someone has a better solution,\u201d he said, \u201cbring it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
